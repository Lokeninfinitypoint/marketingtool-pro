It rarely happens that way. But with a solid lead nurturing strategy, you can greatly increase the chances that a lead turns into sale.<\/p>\n<p>After over 20 years split between sales and marketing, I\u2019m acutely aware of the anxiety that fills the space between a lead showing interest and when they finally place an order. So let me break down what a successful lead nurturing campaign looks like and give you a few examples of them in action.

Using lead nurturing strategies, you guide people through your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/07\/marketing-funnel\">marketing funnel<\/a> from initial interest to conversion.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/lead-nurturing-stat-funnel.png\" alt=\"lead nurturing - marketing funnel represented as an ice cream cone\" width=\"688\" height=\"830\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-77084 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/lead-nurturing-stat-funnel.png 688w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/lead-nurturing-stat-funnel-480x579.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 688px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Lead nurturing guides people through your sales funnel.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>A lead nurturing campaign can take on many forms and use multiple channels to reach a prospective customer. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ehanced-cpc-going-away\">Email<\/a> is the most often used, but social media, snail mail, and even the occasional phone call are useful.

The common answer is that you need seven touchpoints with a potential customer before they remember your brand, logo, or products (it\u2019s unoriginally called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.indeed.com\/career-advice\/career-development\/rule-of-seven\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the rule of seven<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>A developed lead nurture strategy lets you have those meaningful interactions with someone after they\u2019ve requested information or saved a product to their cart. When it comes time to buy, yours is the brand at the top of their mind.<\/p>\n<h3>Educates your best customers<\/h3>\n<p>Buyers are taking advantage of the vast amount of information available at their fingertips. A Google study revealed that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/consumer-insights\/consumer-trends\/shopping-research-before-purchase-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">53%<\/a> of shoppers always research before buying. At the same time, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesbusinesscouncil\/2021\/05\/04\/transparency-is-no-longer-an-option-its-a-must\/?sh=7f36c5f575fe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">transparency<\/a> is becoming as important as price and quality for many buyers.<\/p>\n<p>The business that offers the most information will win. And that\u2019s exactly what happens during the lead nurturing process. You give more information about where your products are sourced or the steps you take to leave a service area spotless. The more informed your lead feels, the more likely they\u2019ll choose your solution.<\/p>\n<h3>Leads to an increased conversion rate<\/h3>\n<p>All of these benefits lead to the ultimate goal of enticing more people who\u2019ve become leads to buy from your business. Since nurtured leads make <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smallbizgenius.net\/by-the-numbers\/lead-nurturing-statistics\/#gref\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">47%<\/a> more purchases than leads that weren\u2019t nurtured, it has a good track record of hitting that goal.<\/p>\n<div id=\"successful-lead-nurturing-strategies\"><\/div>\n<h2>7 strategies for successful lead nurturing campaigns<\/h2>\n<p>Lead nurturing isn\u2019t one size fits all; a clothing retailer will use different tactics than an enterprise software consultant. So consider this a menu of super effective lead nurture ideas you can mix and match to build your own strategy.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Send targeted emails<\/h3>\n<p>I love email as a lead nurture channel. It\u2019s easy to automate, less expensive than ads, and endlessly flexible. Plus, it\u2019s useful for just about any type of company or product.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-email-stats.jpg\" alt=\"lead nurturing - graphic showing the benefits of email marketing\" width=\"929\" height=\"569\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-77087 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-email-stats.jpg 929w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-email-stats-480x294.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 929px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Of course, you can\u2019t just send a bunch of random emails to a lead. That\u2019ll get annoying. Here are some ways to get the most out of your nurture emails:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Segment your list:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/13\/targeted-email-marketing-strategies\">Segment<\/a> your leads by behavior (clicked on a product page, watched a video), engagement (those that opened the last email vs. those that didn\u2019t), or journey stage (new lead vs. returning customer).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Personalize for relevance:<\/strong> Send <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/06\/personalized-marketing\">personalized emails<\/a> with offers and information relevant to each customer based on what you know about them (their birthday, their interests, their shopping habits).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Write captivating headlines:<\/strong> Keep open rates high by writing concise, actionable <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/40-great-email-subject-lines\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">subject lines<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Include a strong CTA: <\/strong>Add a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/09\/call-to-action\">call to<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/09\/call-to-action\"> action<\/a> that clearly states what your lead should do next (buy now, watch a video, claim your discount).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Make sure they\u2019re mobile friendly:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.campaignmonitor.com\/resources\/guides\/email-marketing-trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">70%<\/a> of emails are opened on a mobile device, so make sure yours are fast-loading and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/18\/mobile-ad-strategies\">easy to read on mobile<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>A\/B test:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/26\/ab-testing-best-practices\">A\/B test<\/a> variations of your CTA, subject line, and offers to see which gets the most clicks and conversions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>2. Retarget with ads<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/15\/retargeting-ads\">Retargeting ads<\/a> help you nurture leads by presenting your offers to them multiple times as they click around the web. If you\u2019ve ever clicked on a product page and then seen an ad for that product on other websites, you\u2019ve probably experienced retargeting ads.<\/p>\n<p>These ads work by tagging someone who visits your website or enters your marketing funnel in some other way. The lead is then presented with ads automatically on websites within an advertising network (like the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/10\/google-display-network-targeting\">Google Display Network<\/a>, for example).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-retargeting.jpg\" alt=\"lead nurturing - graphic showing the retargeting flow.\" width=\"936\" height=\"497\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-77088 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-retargeting.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-retargeting-480x255.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Make sure to follow lead nurturing best practices when <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/12\/04\/adwords-remarketing-best-practices-guide\">setting up your remarketing campaigns<\/a> so your ads don\u2019t go from effective to overbearing.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Leverage SMS marketing<\/h3>\n<p>In the right situation, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/11\/09\/sms-marketing\">SMS marketing<\/a>\u2014using texts to reach your audience\u2014is the ideal lead-nurturing strategy. That\u2019s because SMS requires an opt-in, so the people you text have qualified themselves as interested leads.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s why SMS marketing works:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It costs less than other forms of advertising<\/li>\n<li>A text doesn\u2019t fight for attention like an email in a crowded inbox has to<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/marketscale.com\/industries\/retail\/business-texting-sales\/#:~:text=Businesses%20are%20tentative%20to%20text%2C%20but%20study%20after,and%20it%E2%80%99s%20a%20hassle%20to%20play%20phone%20tag.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">89%<\/a> of customers say they prefer texts to calls with businesses<\/li>\n<li>Text open rates are as high as <a href=\"https:\/\/ponyexpresshq.medium.com\/3-reasons-why-sms-marketing-is-more-effective-than-email-addb689801b8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">98%<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Just like emails, you can use texts to offer time-sensitive discounts, confirm appointments, or announce new products or services.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Create nurture content<\/h3>\n<p>Content marketing solves the need to educate your leads while they consider their options. It includes several formats such as blog posts, FAQs, ebooks, or webinars.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-example-content-email.jpg\" alt=\"lead nurturing - screenshot of a content email\" width=\"901\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-77089 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-example-content-email.jpg 901w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-example-content-email-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 901px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Following up with helpful content is a solid nurture strategy.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Content is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/10\/15\/multi-channel-marketing\">multi-channel marketing<\/a> tactic that fuels the other nurture channels. You can send a piece of educational content through email, SMS, or distribute it on social media.<\/p>\n<p>Ideally, you\u2019ll create content for each stage of your marketing funnel:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Awareness stage<\/strong>: Focus on exposing and solving a problem through how-to content.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Consideration state:<\/strong> Show how your product or service solves the problem with use cases.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Action stage:<\/strong> Explain specific product features coupled with discounts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>5. Connect on social media<\/h3>\n<p>I think some marketers forget about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/social-media-marketing\">social media<\/a> as a viable lead nurture channel because it feels less one-to-one than email or texts. That\u2019s a shame because it\u2019s a natural fit for building trust if you\u2019re already posting helpful content.<\/p>\n<p>An important step for lead nurturing on social media is to make sure you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/get-more-instagram-followers\">invite leads to follow<\/a> your accounts. Then they\u2019ll see your brand, products, and amazing content in their feeds.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-example-content-collins.jpg\" alt=\"lead nurturing - Instagram post from a service company\" width=\"897\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-77090 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-example-content-collins.jpg 897w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-example-content-collins-480x321.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 897px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Social media is the perfect place to nurture leads with helpful content.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Once leads start following you, it\u2019s important to increase their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/27\/how-to-increase-instagram-engagement\">engagement<\/a> by asking questions, posting polls, or going live on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/30\/instagram-live\">Instagram<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/31\/facebook-live-guide\">Facebook<\/a>. That helps you in three ways:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>You connect directly with a lead, especially in comments and replies.<\/li>\n<li>You learn more about your leads through polls, questions, and their engagement.<\/li>\n<li>You get more people viewing your posts because social media platforms reward engagement.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>And don\u2019t forget, you can always ask a lead to contact you via direct message if they pose a question or response on one of your social media posts.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Pick up the phone<\/h3>\n<p>I got a voicemail a while back from a yoga studio I visited once. I\u2019d done a free trial class and the instructor that led it called to see if I was interested in coming back. She\u2019d asked me some questions in the class, so her voicemail had specific recommendations for which sessions best fit my needs.<\/p>\n<p>Using the phone like this to nurture leads can be tricky business. Many people, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bankmycell.com\/blog\/why-millennials-ignore-calls\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">especially younger generations<\/a>, don\u2019t like phone calls. Make sure you have permission to call and make sure you add value.<\/p>\n<p>The call I received was valuable because it was personalized for me. And yes, I went back for more sessions because of it.<\/p>\n<h3>7.\u00a0 Score leads<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/10\/22\/demand-generation\">Lead scoring<\/a> is the process of assigning a value to a lead based on a set of predetermined characteristics. Leads become more or less valuable based on things like the value of the product they\u2019re interested in and the likelihood of them making a purchase.<\/p>\n<p>A lead score then determines what nurture strategies you\u2019ll apply. Leads with higher scores might get higher touch follow ups. Lower scores can be handled with automated lead nurturing tactics.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-lead-scoring.jpg\" alt=\"lead nurturing - graphic of the lead scoring process.\" width=\"936\" height=\"339\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-77091 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-lead-scoring.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-lead-scoring-480x174.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Example time. Person A gave their email address in exchange for a guide to home lawn maintenance. Person B called and spoke to a rep about hiring crews to maintain three golf courses. Both the product value and the action give lead B a higher score and suggest the need for more direct follow up.<\/p>\n<p>There are other characteristics to consider. The person\u2019s decision-making ability (e.g. head of purchasing) or the source of the lead (referral vs. cold website visit) might also affect the lead score.<\/p>\n<p>Lead scoring helps you direct the highest effort towards the best potential return.<\/p>\n<div id=\"lead-nurturing-examples\"><\/div>\n<h2>5 lead nurturing examples<\/h2>\n<p>Theory is great, but let\u2019s dig into some lead nurturing examples from companies that do it well.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Abandoned cart recovery<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/17\/shopping-cart-abandonment\">Abandoned carts<\/a> are a scourge for most online retailers. Missing the sale after coming so close is like getting stopped at mile 25 of a marathon.<\/p>\n<p>Menswear band True Classic doesn\u2019t take missed opportunities lightly. They immediately send a valuable offer to people who look at a product or place it in their cart.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-example-true-classic-1.jpg\" alt=\"lead nurturing - a recovery email from True Classic\" width=\"477\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-77092 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-example-true-classic-1.jpg 477w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-example-true-classic-1-239x300.jpg 239w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Notice the urgency they\u2019ve added by making the offer for \u201ca limited time.\u201d The offer and urgency will convert lots of leads to customers.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Milestone celebrations<\/h3>\n<p>Of course, not every lead is so close to making a purchase. For lower-intent leads, it makes sense to just keep a friendly dialogue open.<\/p>\n<p>This chiropractor does a nice job of it by sending a happy birthday SMS text with a link to a fun birthday message.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-chiropractor.jpg\" alt=\"lead nurturing - a birthday text from a chiropractor.\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-77093 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-chiropractor.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-chiropractor-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t need to gather personal information to use this lead nurturing strategy. You could send a thank-you note on the anniversary of your first connection. Or if you work in a particular industry, like education, you could send a \u201chappy Teacher\u2019s Day\u201d email.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Dynamic remarketing<\/h3>\n<p>Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/04\/01\/dynamic-remarketing\">Dynamic Remarketing Ads<\/a> make lead nurturing more personalized by automatically pulling the products you look at and filling them in the ads.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example from a retail shoe store.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-example-shoe.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"936\" height=\"173\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-77095 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-example-shoe.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-example-shoe-480x89.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And perhaps no one is better at it than companies in the travel industry.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-example-travel-1.jpg\" alt=\"lead nurturing - retargeting ad from a travel company\" width=\"936\" height=\"165\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-77096 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-example-travel-1.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-example-travel-1-480x85.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The idea is to make it super easy for the lead you\u2019re nurturing to see the ad and complete their purchase.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Maintenance reminder<\/h3>\n<p>There are so many things in life that need regular maintenance. Our cars, our HVACs, and our bodies all need the occasional review and tune-up. If you\u2019re in the business of providing those services, an automated lead nurturing campaign is perfect for booking more business.<\/p>\n<p>This home services company sends timely texts each year to catch leads as they\u2019re facing seasonal maintenance jobs.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-retargeting-2.jpg\" alt=\"lead nurturing - reminder text from a home services company.\" width=\"329\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-77097 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-retargeting-2.jpg 329w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-retargeting-2-165x300.jpg 165w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This lead nurturing tactic works well for consumable products, too. If a tube of toothpaste or bag of dog food is expected to last 30 days, then a reminder to purchase every 30 days should give conversions a boost.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Social listening<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/20\/social-listening\">Social listening<\/a> is such a cool and underrated lead nurture strategy. The gist is that you set up alerts when someone mentions your brand or a keyword on social media platforms. You then join the conversation in an organic way.<\/p>\n<p>I consider this a lead nurturing tactic when someone directly asks about a product you produce, which is exactly what happened here.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-example-sword.jpg\" alt=\"lead nurturing - instagram post showing a woman cutting wood with a sword.\" width=\"862\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-77098 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-example-sword.jpg 862w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Lead-nurturing-example-sword-480x334.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 862px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The original poster tagged the company, Viking Wood Splitter, which makes wood cutting swords (of course). People showed interest in the swords throughout the comment section. The brand was right there, nurturing their new leads with answers and advice.<\/p>\n<h2>Start lead nurturing to convert more sales<\/h2>\n<p>Most people won\u2019t buy right away. Lead nurturing helps you convert more of your hard-won leads into customers by building a relationship through trust, transparency, and education.<\/p>\n<p>Here are seven of the most effective lead nurturing strategies:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Send targeted emails<\/li>\n<li>Retarget with ads<\/li>\n<li>Leverage SMS marketing<\/li>\n<li>Create nurture content<\/li>\n<li>Connect on social media<\/li>\n<li>Pick up the phone<\/li>\n<li>Score leads<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Boost your conversion rates with these lead nurturing strategies and
