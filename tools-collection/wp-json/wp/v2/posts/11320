Let\u2019s start with some basic initial steps to take before you even start writing your email.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Decide what you\u2019re promoting<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Before you even start the outline of your email (which you should do every time), you have to decide what the subject is. What are you offering to the reader? Whether it\u2019s a limited time discount, webinar, free eBook, or a rewards program, whatever you\u2019re promoting is going to determine how you craft the entire email.<\/span><br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-40488\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/promotional-email-examples-tax-pro.png\" alt=\"promotional email examples: tax pro\" width=\"500\" height=\"491\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/promotional-email-examples-tax-pro.png 500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/promotional-email-examples-tax-pro-480x471.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Identify why you\u2019re promoting It<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Now that you know what you\u2019re promoting, it\u2019s time to ask yourself why. For instance, you might be offering some free content to move leads further down your sales\/marketing funnel, or you might be hosting a webinar to launch your new product and generate some sales. Identifying your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/15\/marketing-objectives\">objective<\/a> will help determine your email wording, position, and audience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Examples of objectives include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Bring back dormant customers.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Increase sales for a specific product or service.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Improve audience engagement.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Generate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/14\/increase-traffic-to-my-website.\">more traffic to your website<\/a>.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Increase brand awareness in a particular vertical or niche within your audience.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Decrease customer churn.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"55cdbadc-3324-4a1f-874a-b3113f872acb\" data-langcode=\"en\"><\/div>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p>\ud83d\udceb <strong>Free email templates!<\/strong>\u00a0 <strong>&gt;&gt; <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteEmailExampleTemplate.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Email_EmailTemplates_Download\">30 Free Small Business Email Examples &amp; Templates<\/a><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Target your audience<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Once you figure out what you\u2019re promoting and why, it\u2019s time to determine your audience. Sending the same promotional email out to your entire audience is not recommended, because your messaging will get diluted as you try to appeal to all readers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Instead, send it to a select few, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/13\/targeted-email-marketing-strategies\">segment out your list<\/a> so you can deliver targeted messaging for each segment. The way you describe the offer to new customers that you\u2019re trying to move through your sales funnel will be different from the way you describe it to existing customers you\u2019re trying to get repeat business from. Knowing your audience beforehand will allow you to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/31\/email-marketing-with-buyer-personas\">write a more effective email.<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"promotional-email-tips\"><\/div>\n<h2>Tips for writing your promotional email<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Once you have the framework set up for your promotional email, you can start to craft your copy and set up your send. The tips below will help you to maximize your open rate and engagement rate.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Focus on the benefit\/value<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Be careful not to focus too much on the promotion and its features at the expense of its benefits. Ideally, the link for your offer will take readers to a landing page describing the promotion\u2019s features and terms in more detail. The body of the promotional email itself should clearly identify why this promotion is of value to the reader and make clear the ultimate benefits. <\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20write20promotion20emails20promotional20email20example20focus20on20the20benefit.png\" alt=\"how to write promotion emails promotional email example focus on the benefit\" width=\"800\" height=\"815\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Send from a person<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In addition to the subject line, the &#8220;from&#8221; field can have a significant impact on whether your promotional emails get opened, disregarded, or sent to the trash bin. Instead of using your company name, use your (or a teammate&#8217;s) name to add a more personal touch. People like to read emails from other humans,\u00a0but\u00a0sure to test this out as preferences vary from audience to audience.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20write20promotion20emails20promotional20email20send20from20person.png\" alt=\"how to write promotion emails promotional email example send from person\" width=\"800\" height=\"288\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If you do send the promotional email from a person, be sure to include an attractive and professional\u00a0email signature. This\u00a0should include the name and role in the company, and if applicable, company contact information, social media handles, and a photo. This adds a nice personal touch to your promotional emails and helps your readers to feel more connected to your brand.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20write20promotion20emails20promotional20email20example20include20signature.png\" alt=\"how to write promotion emails promotional email example include signature\" width=\"800\" height=\"597\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Introduce your promotion in the subject line<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Did you know that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invespcro.com\/blog\/email-subject-lines-statistics-and-trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">47% <\/a>of emails are opened solely based on the subject line? That said, when including your promotion in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/31\/email-subject-lines\">subject line,<\/a> strive to be catchy, conversational, and compelling Just be aware that some words and phrases can trigger spam detectors and send your email to your readers&#8217; spam folder (for example, using &#8220;free,&#8221; &#8220;FREE,&#8221; or &#8220;100% free&#8221;). Here&#8217;s an example of a compelling promotional email subject line from Shutterfly:<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20write20promotion20emails20promotional20email20example20subject20line20and20preheader20text_0.png\" alt=\"how to write promotion emails promotional email example subject line and preheader text\" width=\"800\" height=\"123\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Use preheader text<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Email users see three layers of information before opening an email: sender name, subject line, and preheader text. Though just a few words (anywhere from\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.activecampaign.com\/blog\/email-preheader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">40-130 characters<\/a>), preheader text can be the final influence over whether a reader opens your email. Use this limited space to provide an essential detail about the promotion that\u00a0will clarify the email&#8217;s purpose and attract readers. Preheader text\u00a0appears in different forms depending on which email client and device you&#8217;re using.\u00a0Sometimes\u00a0it appears below the subject line, and other times right after it, such as with the Shutterfly example we just used:<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20write20promotion20emails20promotional20email20example20subject20line20and20preheader20text202.png\" alt=\"how to write promotion emails promotional email example subject line and preheader text 2\" width=\"800\" height=\"123\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In some cases, preheader text may also appear in the promotional email itself, as with the example below, but not always.<\/span><br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-40489\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/promotional-email-example-fitbit.png\" alt=\"promotional email examples: fitbit\" width=\"500\" height=\"679\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/promotional-email-example-fitbit.png 500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/promotional-email-example-fitbit-480x652.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\n<span lang=\"EN\">If you don\u2019t have the ability to fill in the preheader text field, your email client will typically pull in the first 40-50 characters of the email,\u00a0so make sure the first characters of your email are engaging and give the reader a reason to continue investing their time. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Brand your header<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The header is the first thing a consumer sees upon opening your promotional email, so make sure it\u2019s clean, professional, and appealing. You could use a standard simple header with your logo, company name, and brand colors; or leave space for text so you can include the name of the promotion.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20write20promotion20emails20promotional20email20example20sale20in20header.png\" alt=\"how to write promotion emails promotional email example sale in header\" width=\"800\" height=\"277\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">You may even wish to include the CTA right in the header of the email, as we sometimes do:<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20write20promotion20emails20promotional20email20example20copywriting20toolkit.png\" alt=\"how to write promotion emails promotional email example copywriting toolkit\" width=\"800\" height=\"761\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Break up the body of the email<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Depending on the offer of your promotional email, the body is going to vary in length. Regardless, a wall of text is a surefire way to get the reader to click the \u201cX\u201d and trash the email. Keep the body of your promotional email concise and break up lengthier blocks of text with images, links, or bullet points so it\u2019s easier for your readers to digest.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/promotional20emails20break20up20text20.png\" alt=\"how to write promotion emails promotional email example break up text\" width=\"1412\" height=\"1040\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Include a call to action<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Above all else, you must include a loud (but not obnoxious) and clear call to action in your promotional email. Most effective promotional emails have a nice flow that leads your readers to the desired action.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20write20promotion20emails20promotional20email20example20CTA.png\" alt=\"how to write promotion emails promotional email example call to action\" width=\"675\" height=\"1203\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Having the CTA at the end of your promotional email isn\u2019t necessary, as long as it\u2019s clear and easy to spot:<\/span><br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-40490\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/promotional-email-examples-sportsdigita.png\" alt=\"promotional email examples: sportsdigita\" width=\"500\" height=\"867\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/promotional-email-examples-sportsdigita.png 500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/promotional-email-examples-sportsdigita-480x832.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nYou may also wish to include the CTA twice if the email is long enough. That way the option is always in view even if the reader has scrolled.<\/p>\n<p>(You can get some ideas of helpful CTAs from ChatGPT using these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/08\/chatgpt-prompts\">ChatGPT prompts<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Add visuals<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">No email is complete without captivating and appealing imagery. Rather than using the same stock photos that every company in your industry uses, try using your own photos. Or create graphics with free and easy-to-use platforms like Canva. It doesn\u2019t take much time, it\u2019s an easy way to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/31\/brand-voice\">authenticate your brand<\/a>, and also helps to break up the text. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Just don\u2019t go too overboard with them. Your promotional email should be exciting but not overwhelming, and the images should complement, rather than distract away from, the CTA. <\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20write20promotion20emails20promotional20email20example20include20images.png\" alt=\"how to write promotion emails promotional email example include images\" width=\"680\" height=\"1661\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div id=\"promotional-email-examples\"><\/div>\n<h2>More promotional email examples<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">We\u2019ve included plenty of promotional email examples above with our tips and best practices, but it can never hurt to see more examples. Here are a few more that you can use as inspiration or adapt for your own business promotions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">New offer promotional email<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This great promotional email example by BookBub has a branded header with attractive\u00a0imagery, and the value of the promotion (rather than the promotion itself) is prioritized\u2014meaning they provide the name of the platform they are promoting\u00a0(&#8220;chirp&#8221;) but not before first highlighting the ultimate benefit\u00a0(&#8220;audiobook deals&#8221;). <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The copy is also clear and concise. In under 50 words, the email answers all of its readers questions:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><em>Why should I\u00a0read this email?\u00a0<\/em>To get audiobook deals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><em>What are you asking me to do?<\/em> Sign\u00a0up, for free.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><em>What is it?<\/em> A new platform called chirp.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><em>Why will I like it? No subscription required, new deals daily, and unbeatable prices.<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">And then they have a second CTA that reinforces the ultimate<span lang=\"EN\">\u00a0benefit (&#8220;Start Getting Deals!&#8221;).<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20write20promotion20emails20promotional20email20examples20book20bub.png\" alt=\"how to write promotion emails promotional email examples book bub\" width=\"800\" height=\"693\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Flash sale promotional email<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">I&#8217;m actually going to start off with an example of a promotional email that does not follow the best practices covered in this post. First of all, there is no attractive imagery. Even the logo in the branded header is small. Second, the features, rather than the benefits, are highlighted. Third, while the promotion is clear (20% off all plans)\u2014the call to action is not. Yes, you are clearly asked to claim your discount, but for what? Only with a closer do you find that it&#8217;s to &#8220;upgrade today.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/promotional20email20example20flash20sale20wordpress.png\" alt=\"promotional email example flash sale wordpress\" width=\"800\" height=\"1068\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">On the flip side, WordPress could be targeting this email for WordPress power users or engineers who already know the benefits of the platform and are more inclined to look for specific features.\u00a0In this case, providing feature details without any distractions or unnecessary elements makes sense, which brings us back to the third tip in this post: target your audience. Also, two best practices are followed: the bolded blue text makes the call to action easy to spot among the gray text, and the bullets break up the text for an easier read.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In general, however, effective flash sale promotional emails can be limited in text. After all, you&#8217;re urging recipients to stop reading and start shopping, and the discount itself automatically implies the benefit of saving money. Here&#8217;s an example of a flash sale promotional email that better follows the best practices in this post. It\u00a0uses simple design elements, including a legibly-sized\u00a0logo, an emoji, and branded charts; the benefit is prominent\u00a0(&#8220;get paid twice as fast&#8221;), and the CTA button both stands out and clarifies the offer.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/promotional20email20examples20freshbooks.png\" alt=\"promotional email examples flash sale freshbooks\" width=\"800\" height=\"1074\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Free resource promotional email<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This email example from Zoom doesn\u2019t offer a discount or sale, but rather a variety of free resources. Promotional offers like this keep customers engaged with your brand as well as your products, which helps to foster <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/10\/customer-loyalty\">customer loyalty<\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As far as the best practices it demonstrates,\u00a0we see a branded header and a benefit statement (host meetings like a pro) right off the bat.\u00a0There&#8217;s also concise copy about each resource and a large orange CTA that makes clear the next step to take.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/promotional20email20example20zoom20educational.png\" alt=\"promotional email example zoom educational\" width=\"800\" height=\"1331\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Time-limited promotional email<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The example\u00a0below from Doordash may be text-heavy, but because it adheres to best practices, it is an effective promotional email for a time-limited offer. You&#8217;ve got your attractive imagery and prominent CTA button. You can also see the use of bold versus regular font to help break up the text.<\/span><br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-40486\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/promotional-email-examples-doordash.png\" alt=\"promotional email examples: doordash\" width=\"450\" height=\"912\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/promotional-email-examples-doordash.png 450w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/promotional-email-examples-doordash-148x300.png 148w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/promotional-email-examples-doordash-49x100.png 49w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/promotional-email-examples-doordash-99x200.png 99w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><br \/>\n<span lang=\"EN\"><span lang=\"EN\">Another thing to note is that the footer of this email contains details about the promotion. This is a good way to include terms and conditions without cluttering up the body of the email.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/promotional20email20examples20terms20and20conditions.png\" alt=\"promotional email examples terms and conditions\" width=\"686\" height=\"710\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">New offering announcement email<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">New products and expanded offerings make for great promotional emails. In the way of imagery, benefit focus, brevity, and CTA best practices, this example email covers it all. The image complements the colored text, the ultimate benefit is highlighted in large font at the top, the messaging is quick and to the point, and the two options are crystal clear. <\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/promotional20email20example20202020onsite.png\" alt=\"promotional email example 2020 onsite\" width=\"800\" height=\"706\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Content promotion email<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">You don\u2019t need to have fancy promo codes or create unique landing pages for every promotional email you send. Our weekly Performance Tip email is a good example of a simple content promotion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">We may be tooting our own horn here, but then again, you&#8217;d\u00a0better hope we&#8217;re following best practices if we&#8217;re writing about them. We use a branded header with appealing imagery that orients the reader to what type of email this is. The title of the content is in large font at the top so that readers can know right away what they are investing their time in. There is a lot of text, but it is broken up by bullet points to make it easily skimmable. Finally, there is a clear CTA at the end to send readers to the full post.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/promotional20email20example20wordstream.png\" alt=\"promotional email example wordstream\" width=\"800\" height=\"999\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>Ensure success with your business\u2019s promotion emails<\/h2>\n<p>Using email to communicate your special offers, deals, and promotions is definitely worth your while.
