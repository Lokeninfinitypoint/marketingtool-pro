You&#8217;re already closer to selling a <em>heck of a lot more<\/em> SaaS, widgets, or artisanal coffee mugs, than your competitors.<\/p>\n<p>Not everyone has the opportunity to market a truly great product. If you\u2019ve been blessed to do so, you\u2019ve already won half the battle.<\/p>\n<p>But guess what? Resting the hopes of your business on the strengths of your product is one of the fastest ways to tank revenue. That\u2019s right: just because <em>you know<\/em> you have the winning horse, doesn\u2019t mean your <em>target audience<\/em> does.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s where product positioning comes in. Product positioning is the process of creating a unique identity and value proposition for your product <strong>in the minds of your target customers.<\/strong> Read that bolded section again, and don\u2019t forget it.

We&#8217;ll cover market analysis, how to develop a unique value proposition, key messaging strategy, measuring success, and much more.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s dive in.<\/p>\n<h2>What is product positioning?<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Product positioning is the process of creating a distinctive identity or value proposition for your product or service, and then communicating it in a way that resonates with your target audience.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The goal of product positioning is to create the perception that your product is meaningfully different and better than your competitors\u2019 products.<\/p>\n<p>Does your product need some work? Not to worry. Product positioning can help you capitalize on what your product does well and minimize the features that still need some work. Is your product a straight-up killer? Even better. For you, product positioning is going to be less about creating the perception of uniqueness and quality than simply illuminating facts.<\/p>\n<h2>Why product positioning is important<\/h2>\n<p>Truly great product positioning requires an in-depth understanding of the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/types-of-customer-needs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">needs<\/a>, wants, and preferences of your customers. It also requires an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of your competitors. We\u2019ve heard time and time again about the importance of being customer-centric, or customer-<em>obsessed<\/em>, in today\u2019s competitive landscape.<\/p>\n<p>And it\u2019s true: the businesses that are able to take the focus off themselves, and what they may or may not be doing well, and think about how they can start <strong>better serving their customers<\/strong>, are the ones that succeed.<\/p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t some attempt to appear chivalrous or take the moral high ground. Companies that are customer-obsessed legitimately outperform those that focus on themselves. In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pwc.com\/us\/en\/advisory-services\/publications\/consumer-intelligence-series\/pwc-consumer-intelligence-series-customer-experience.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">86%<\/a> of customers are willing to pay more for a better experience with a company.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/stat-pay-more-for-better-customer-experience.jpg\" alt=\"customers are willing to pay more for better customer experience stat\" width=\"936\" height=\"358\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72901\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/stat-pay-more-for-better-customer-experience.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/stat-pay-more-for-better-customer-experience-480x184.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Not only does product positioning help you prioritize the customer experience, but it also helps you create a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/16\/marketing-competitive-analysis\">competitive advantage<\/a>\u00a0so your products stand out, and ultimately, are the products your prospects choose to purchase.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\ud83d\udcd7 Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite30BestWaysToPromote.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Marketing_The30BestWaysToPromoteYourBusiness_Download\" class=\"waffle-rich-text-link\">The 30 Best Ways to Promote Your Business (With or Without Money!) <\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<h2>5 steps for stellar product positioning<\/h2>\n<p>Ready to get started?

Or maybe you still have some work to do. Whatever the case, here are some foolproof strategies you can use to get to the root of who you\u2019re competing against, and how to outmaneuver them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enter some commercial search queries around your products and services into Google. The businesses you\u2019re jostling with in the search results, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/learn\/ppc101\">search ads<\/a>, and organic results are the ones you need to beat out.<\/li>\n<li>You can also use an SEO tool like Ahrefs, Moz, and the like to conduct a keyword overlap analysis, which is essentially the strategy mentioned above, but on a more comprehensive scale.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/product-positioning-keyword-overlap-analysis.jpg\" alt=\"example of keyword overlap analysis from ahrefs\" width=\"936\" height=\"485\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72895\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/product-positioning-keyword-overlap-analysis.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/product-positioning-keyword-overlap-analysis-480x249.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check out what the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/21\/emotional-ad-copy-examples\">ad copy<\/a> looks like in your competitors\u2019 search ads. What are they touting as their core value prop? What are they mentioning in their callouts?

But what exactly is a USP?<\/p>\n<p>A USP is a statement that communicates the unique benefit that your product provides to customers, and how it differs fundamentally from other products on the market.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/unique-selling-proposition.jpg\" alt=\"definition of unique selling proposition\" width=\"936\" height=\"339\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72893\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/unique-selling-proposition.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/unique-selling-proposition-480x174.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A well-defined USP can help a brand stand out in a crowded market, attract and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/09\/customer-retention-strategies\">retain customers<\/a>, and ultimately, <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-increase-sales-for-your-business-on-a-budget\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">drive sales<\/a>. For reference, here are some dynamite USP examples from across the world of business:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Saddleback Leather<\/strong>. <em>Rugged Leather Goods with a 100-Year Warranty.<\/em> Everybody claims to back up their products, but a 100-year warranty? That\u2019s unique and memorable.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Robinhood. <\/strong><em>Investing for everyone.<\/em> Maybe this USP didn\u2019t age incredibly well, but it\u2019s certainly how Robinhood cornered the market: cutting through the red tape in an industry that has traditionally been reserved for the uber-wealthy.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Warby Parker<\/strong>. <em>Designer eyewear at a revolutionary price.<\/em> Sick of spending $300 and half your day at Lenscrafters for a decent pair of glasses? Warby Parker has the solution.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Dollar Shave Club<\/strong>. <em>A great shave for a few bucks a month.<\/em> This is a great example of really understanding your target market. Men love to save a buck. As one of them, I can tell you that this USP is music to my ears.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Craft a strong and resolute USP, and you\u2019ll have endless messaging fodder to use when targeting your ideal customer.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 3: Create a positioning statement<\/h3>\n<p>Sometimes, simplifying things is the best way to get results. A positioning statement does just that. It\u2019s a concise statement that communicates exactly how your product or service fills a market need.<\/p>\n<p>Check out this positioning statement example from Apple:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/product-positioning-statement-example-apple.jpg\" alt=\"product positioning example from apple\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72892\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/product-positioning-statement-example-apple.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/product-positioning-statement-example-apple-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This four-step formula is a timeless way to craft a positioning statement, and it works best when adapted to specific products and specific target markets.<\/p>\n<p>In this case, Apple\u2019s positioning statement describes how <em>all <\/em>of its products outperform the competition. But if you were Head of Product over at Apple, and you had a new set of Air pods coming out, you\u2019d do well to craft a product-specific statement based on what you know about who buys Air pods and who your main competitors are.<\/p>\n<p>Remember: clear and concise is the name of the game. Once you have your positioning statement nailed, you can move on to key messaging, which is going to be broader in scope.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 4: Define your key messaging<\/h3>\n<p>Think about your USP and positioning statement as kernels from which the real meat and potatoes of product positioning stem.<\/p>\n<p>Here are three steps for defining your key messaging:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Step one:<\/strong> Determine how your product stands out from the crowd, and who it\u2019s for.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Step two:<\/strong> Come up with a product-specific statement that clearly and concisely outlines your USP.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Step three:<\/strong> Develop actual ad copy, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/02\/landing-page-copywriting\">landing page copy<\/a>, product descriptions, and more from the hard work you did in steps one and two.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Messaging frameworks can be pretty fluid, but here\u2019s a decent one from Forrester:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/product-positioning-messaging-architecture.jpg\" alt=\"product positioning - messaging framework from forrester\" width=\"535\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72891\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/product-positioning-messaging-architecture.jpg 535w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/product-positioning-messaging-architecture-480x538.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 535px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In this model, the top three layers of the cake (or floors of the house, whichever metaphor you prefer), comprise your market research and USP. Level 4 is your positioning statement. Level 5 is your key messaging. So for each positioning statement, you\u2019re going to have several key messaging points that answer the question: <em>how does my product uniquely enable the objective my customers want to accomplish?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>You need look no further than at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/03\/ad-copy-examples\">best search ads<\/a> to find examples of key messaging in action.
