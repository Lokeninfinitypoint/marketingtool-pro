A product feed is essentially a spreadsheet that contains all the relevant information about your products, including their prices, images, and descriptions. This data is essential for Google Ads to understand which products customers are viewing and to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/29\/how-to-promote-a-product\">promote relevant ads for other products<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Thankfully, creating a product feed is a simple and straightforward process. You can use any standard spreadsheet or CSV file to create your product feed, then upload it directly to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/18\/google-merchant-center\">Google Merchant Center<\/a> (create a Merchant Center account <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/retail\/solutions\/merchant-center\/\">here<\/a>). This process ensures that your product data is accurately and consistently presented to Google Ads, allowing you to create effective dynamic remarketing campaigns that reach the right customers at the right time.<\/p>\n<p>While creating a product feed can seem like a daunting task (especially if you have a lot of products), there are ways to make it easier, particularly for ecommerce websites running on certain platforms. For instance, CMS platforms like Shopify and WordPress (running WooCommerce) have features that can automatically add products to the Google Merchant Center.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-2.jpg\" alt=\"example of one place where dynamic remarketing ads can show in google\" width=\"701\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72108\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-2.jpg 701w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-2-480x411.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 701px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>An example of where the Shopping Feed can show in Google Ads.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In the case of Shopify, you can use the API method to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/intl\/en_us\/retail\/connect-your-ecommerce-store\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">integrate your Shopify store with the Merchant Center<\/a>. This method allows you to automatically synchronize your product data between the two platforms, eliminating the need for a traditional feed. This feature can make it easier and more efficient for e-commerce businesses to set up dynamic marketing with Google Ads, as it eliminates the need for manual data entry and ensures that product information is always up-to-date.<\/p>\n<p>With WooCommerce, you can utilize rich results for products with <a href=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Schema.org<\/a> structured data (check out <a href=\"https:\/\/yoast.com\/rich-snippets-product-listings\/\">Yoast<\/a> for an easy way to do this). This allows the Merchant Center to automatically crawl your website and retrieve all of your products without the need for a traditional feed. This feature can also make it easier and more efficient for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/03\/23\/best-ecommerce-marketing-channels\">ecommerce businesses<\/a> to set up dynamic marketing with Google Ads.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Important note:<\/strong> To ensure that Google Ads can use your product feed in dynamic remarketing campaigns, it&#8217;s crucial to link your <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/merchants\/answer\/9455541?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Merchant Center account to your Ads account<\/a>. This link ensures that Google Ads knows that you have a product feed available to select when creating your dynamic remarketing campaign.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 3: Add the Data Layer<\/h3>\n<p>To set up dynamic remarketing, one essential step is adding the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/tagmanager\/answer\/6106009?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Data Layer<\/a> to your website. In the Data Layer, you include information about a specific product that a user viewed on your website, including its ID (which must align with the ID in your Merchant Center feed), its value (the shopping cart and final order value can also be passed), and which page category the user is viewing. This information is then passed on to your remarketing tag, and subsequently to Google Ads.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So how does a Data Layer send this information to Google Ads?<\/strong> Essentially, when a user interacts with your website, an event is triggered. While the complete event snippet code won&#8217;t automatically appear in your tracking tools, you can install the Data Layer that pushes relevant data from the products on your website to your Data Layer.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, let&#8217;s say a user viewed two products on your website. The event snippet code will contain the value (price) and IDs of the products viewed. The Data Layer can then send this data to Google Ads, allowing you to create effective dynamic remarketing campaigns that target the right customers with the right products.<em><br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-3.jpg\" alt=\"an example of how Data Layer sends information to Google Ads as part of your dynamic remarketing campaigns\" width=\"843\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72109\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-3.jpg 843w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-3-480x342.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 843px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Event names are an important part of your Data Layer code, as they describe the specific event being measured. In the example provided below, the code is using the &#8220;add_to_cart&#8221; event to track when a user adds a product to their cart. It&#8217;s important to choose the right event name as Google Ads uses it to assign users to automatically generated user lists.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-3b.jpg\" alt=\"example of event names using Data Layer\" width=\"936\" height=\"301\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72110\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-3b.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-3b-480x154.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Assuming you have already installed Google Tag Manager (if you do not, please refer to this <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/tagmanager\/answer\/6103696\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Help Center article<\/a>), the next step is to implement the Data Layer code customized for your website <strong>above <\/strong>the GTM code snippet.<\/p>\n<p><span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;&lt;div class=&#039;et-box et-shadow&#039;&gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;div class=&#039;et-box-content&#039;&gt;\\n\u2734\ufe0f How are your Google Ads really performing? \\nFind out with the Free Google Ads Performance Grader.\\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:1053313,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;10&quot;:2,&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;23&quot;:1}\" data-sheets-textstyleruns=\"{&quot;1&quot;:0}\uee10{&quot;1&quot;:33,&quot;2&quot;:{&quot;6&quot;:1}}\uee10{&quot;1&quot;:39}\uee10{&quot;1&quot;:71,&quot;2&quot;:{&quot;2&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:1136076},&quot;9&quot;:1}}\uee10{&quot;1&quot;:105}\" data-sheets-hyperlinkruns=\"{&quot;1&quot;:71,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader&quot;}\uee10{&quot;1&quot;:105}\"><div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\u2734\ufe0f How are your Google Ads really performing?\nFind out with the <a class=\"in-cell-link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\" rel=\"noopener\">Free Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a>.<\/div><\/div><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Step 4: Create a Google Ads Remarketing Tag in GTM<\/h3>\n<p>To set up a Google Ads Remarketing Tag in your Google Tag Manager account, follow these simple steps:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log in to your Google Tag Manager account.<\/li>\n<li>Click on &#8220;Tags&#8221; in the left-hand menu, then click on the red &#8220;New&#8221; button.<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-4a.jpg\" alt=\"setting up dynamic remarketing in google ads\" width=\"936\" height=\"283\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72111\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-4a.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-4a-480x145.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/li>\n<li>Name your new tag, then click on the tag configuration section and choose &#8220;Google Ads Remarketing&#8221; from the list of tag types.<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-4b.jpg\" alt=\"setting up dynamic remarketing for retail - choosing tag name\" width=\"936\" height=\"390\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72112\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-4b.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-4b-480x200.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/li>\n<li>Enter your Google Ads conversion ID, which you can find in your Google Ads account.

Name it &#8220;dlv-items&#8221; and click on &#8220;Choose a variable type to begin setup&#8230;&#8221; Then, select &#8220;Data Layer Variable&#8221; from the available options.<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-5f.jpg\" alt=\"how to set up dynamic remarketing for retail\" width=\"731\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72120\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-5f.jpg 731w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-5f-480x393.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 731px, 100vw\" \/><\/li>\n<li>Now, assign the appropriate name from your site&#8217;s code to the Data Layer Variable.

To achieve this, we need to create a custom event trigger that will only activate when these predefined events take place.<\/p>\n<p>To start, check the &#8220;Use regex matching&#8221; option. This is a powerful tool that enables us to use an &#8220;or&#8221; function with a pipe symbol. You can then copy all of your predefined event names from the Google documentation and separate them with the pipe symbol, like so: view_search_results|view_item_list|view_item|add_to_cart|purchase<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-6a.jpg\" alt=\"how to set up dynamic remarketing for retail\" width=\"936\" height=\"425\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72123\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-6a.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-6a-480x218.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Your Tag will only be triggered when a visitor traverses through these various remarketing events (think of them as steps down the lower half of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/07\/marketing-funnel\">marketing funnel<\/a>).

Begin by creating a new Remarketing Tag in GTM, using the same conversion ID as the dynamic Remarketing Tag. However, do not add any custom Data Layer events to this tag.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Also, make sure to set the trigger to fire on all pages, except for the pages where the new dynamic Remarketing Tag is being triggered. To achieve this, add &#8220;custom &#8211; remarketing events&#8221; as an exception to the trigger.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-6d.jpg\" alt=\"how to set up dynamic remarketing for retail\" width=\"936\" height=\"585\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72126\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-6d.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-6d-480x300.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Get started with dynamic remarketing for retail<\/h2>\n<p>To sum up, dynamic remarketing ads are a game-changer for your business when it comes to reaching out to your target audience effectively.
