Reach in-market shoppers with Google Shopping ads \u2026<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/04\/google-shopping-campaigns-tips-tricks\">Google Shopping campaigns<\/a> are a no-brainer for any ecommerce company. With a Shopping campaign, you can prominently advertise your products at the top of the Google search results at the exact moment people are looking to buy the kinds of products you sell. Your Shopping ads can include product images, price points, ratings, offers, and other key info that makes it easy for customers to &#8220;add to cart.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve uploaded a product data feed\u2014a master spreadsheet that describes key attributes of your products\u2014to Google Merchant Center and connected your Merchant Center account to your Google Ads account, Google will automatically generate ads for your products whenever a user searches a relevant query.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"806cffd3-6054-47a0-afc0-c6467f3aa50e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-marketing-shopping-ads.png\" alt=\"ecommerce-marketing-shopping-ad-examples\" width=\"672\" height=\"449\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>To learn more, you can check out our guide to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/12\/google-shopping-campaign-structure\">Google Shopping campaign structures<\/a> as well as our guide to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/18\/google-shopping-feed\">product data feeds<\/a>.

In other words, about 2% of all clicks on Google Shopping ads convert into purchases. Does that mean Shopping campaigns are a waste of time? Nope. Even if it doesn\u2019t immediately lead to a sale, a click represents a valuable interaction between your business and your prospect.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what the 2% conversion rate <em>does<\/em> mean: You might have to do some additional work if you want to bring those shoppers back to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/08\/how-to-build-an-ecommerce-website\">ecommerce site<\/a>. That&#8217;s where remarketing comes in.<\/p>\n<p>Remarketing increases your ecommerce conversion rate because it reels on-the-fence shoppers back in.

Turn likes into sales with Shopping on Instagram<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For years, the conventional wisdom has been that <strong>search<\/strong> marketing is for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/11\/increase-online-store-sales\">driving sales<\/a> and <strong>social<\/strong> marketing is for building brand awareness. Though search (including Google Shopping) is certainly a good way to convert low-funnel prospects, and though social is most definitely a good way to reach new audiences, this absolute distinction between the two channels is becoming less and less valid every year.<\/p>\n<p>Why? Three words: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/26\/instagram-stories-shopping\">Shopping on Instagram<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-create-a-new-instagram-account\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">set up a business profile on Instagram<\/a> and uploaded a product catalog to Facebook (Instagram\u2019s parent company), you\u2019re eligible to tag your products in your organic feed and Stories posts. All of a sudden, the users who see your organic content no longer need to navigate to your website if they want to make a purchase; instead, they can simply click on the product they\u2019re interested in and follow the link to the corresponding page on your website.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7aedff2f-775b-4452-8661-dad8606a78d4\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-marketing-shopping-on-instagram.jpg\" alt=\"ecommerce-marketing-shopping-on-instagram-example\" width=\"454\" height=\"898\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Basically, what makes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/25\/social-shopping\">social shopping<\/a> such a strong ecommerce marketing tactic is the <strong>elimination of friction<\/strong>. By enabling your followers to effortlessly make purchases, Instagram has effectively brought the power of search to social media.<\/p>\n<p>For more ecommerce help in the social media realm, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/13\/facebook-ecommerce-tips\">4 Facebook Ecommerce Tips to Boost Sales<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">4. Instill trust with customer reviews<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So\u2014you\u2019ve started using Shopping on Instagram. Things are going <em>well<\/em> in the sense that it\u2019s driving a substantial amount of traffic to your product pages, but things are also going <em>poorly<\/em> in the sense that those pageviews aren\u2019t converting into sales at a terribly high rate. Is there an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/31\/2020-ecommerce-marketing-trends\">ecommerce marketing<\/a> tactic you can use to boost your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/17\/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate\">conversion rate<\/a>?<\/p>\n<p>Yup: <strong>customer reviews<\/strong>. Limited discretionary income makes consumers cautious about spending their money, and few things are more reassuring (read: persuasive) than a glowing review from someone who\u2019s already bought one or more of your products. Throwing ratings and reviews on your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/07\/ecommerce-sales-product-pages\">product pages<\/a> is a time-tested, straightforward way to turn more site visitors into customers.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3afe362a-17f4-44f3-b1f7-2eb72245bae9\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-digital-marketing-tips-customer-reviews.png\" alt=\"ecommerce product page with reviews\" width=\"750\" height=\"563\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">5. Up your cross-selling game with pop-ups<\/h2>\n<p>Another way to boost your ecommerce digital marketing strategy is with <strong>pop-ups<\/strong>: the windows that temporarily take over site visitors\u2019 screens to present them with additional offers. You can use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/learn\/landing-page-creator\">pop-ups<\/a> to entice a prospective shopper with a discount offer or to add another product to his or her shopping cart.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"e3f63b3b-0939-466b-9e16-324d64f63241\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-marketing-pop-ups.jpg\" alt=\"ecommerce-marketing-pop-up-example\" width=\"778\" height=\"431\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>I know, I know. Pop-ups have a bad reputation\u2014but there&#8217;s a reason they&#8217;re so pervasive. They work! Especially when used to present people with legitimately relevant offers\u2014a limited-time discount, a BOGO sale. Use them correctly and they can drive a <em>ton<\/em> of additional revenue for your business.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">6. Win new customers with referral marketing<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One last ecommerce marketing tip: Use the power of <strong>referral marketing<\/strong> to turn the enthusiasm of your most loyal customers into a steady stream of new business.<\/p>\n<p>For those who may not know, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/06\/referral-marketing\">referral marketing<\/a> is the practice of incentivizing your customers to tell others about how much they love your business. The idea, of course, is that your prospects are far more likely to trust their friends and family than they are to trust your advertisements. Tactically, it\u2019s pretty similar to curating customer testimonials; the key difference is that it\u2019s <strong>more direct<\/strong>. Generally, your prospects trust their loved ones more than they trust random people on the internet.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a real-world example to get the wheels turning. Before their official launch, women\u2019s athleisure wear company Girlfriend Collective decided to give away free pairs of their high-end, eco-friendly leggings. Because this offer was so irresistible\u2014and because it only lasted for a short period of time\u2014Girlfriend Collective generated a ton of buzz within their target market. All of a sudden, everyone and their mother wanted a pair of their leggings\u2014and they hadn\u2019t even officially launched the company yet! You better believe that plenty of these initial customers came back for more once Girlfriend Collective started charging for their products.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f139a884-9225-4020-904d-31b5772542ff\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-marketing-referrals.jpg\" alt=\"ecommerce-marketing-girlfriend-collective-referral-strategy\" width=\"741\" height=\"361\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Critical Pass\u2014an exam preparation company that sells flashcards to help law school students get ready for the bar\u2014provides another great example of the power of referral marketing. To incentivize their happy customers to spread the word to their friends, Critical Pass offered $10 to anyone who passed along a referral link that ended up generating a sale. Because the price of their flashcard set is well above $10, this tactic proved extremely profitable for the company!<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Get your ecommerce marketing strategy off the ground!<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">No <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/09\/ecommerce-brands\">ecommerce business<\/a> can succeed in an increasingly crowded landscape without choosing the right <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/03\/23\/best-ecommerce-marketing-channels\">ecommerce marketing channels<\/a> and implementing a thoughtful, full-funnel strategy.
