We\u2019re going to get into the step-by-step instructions for this shortly, but before we do, let\u2019s unpack what each of those terms means so you can get a full picture of what this all means for your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/10\/google-ads-account-structure\">Google Ads account.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Conversions <\/strong>are any meaningful actions your audience members take after seeing your ad.

If a user interacts with (but doesn\u2019t convert on) more than one of your ads before completing a conversion action, an attribution model decides which ad(s) should get credit for the conversion.For example, first click attribution gives all the credit to the first ad the user interacted with, while linear attribution gives each ad a fraction of the credit.

We\u2019ll fully explain the Google tag installation process and purpose later.

A website action could be a purchase, form-fill, button click, and more.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Phone calls: <\/strong>This conversion type is also very popular as it&#8217;s simply a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/22\/call-tracking-industries\">call to your business<\/a> that originates from your Google Ads.<\/li>\n<li><strong>App installs and in-app conversions: <\/strong>These only apply to businesses that are advertising an app. Their purpose is to count app downloads or other interactions within an app.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Imported or offline conversions: <\/strong>These are actions that happen offline, but may have originated from an ad. You would import those tracked offline actions, such as an over-the-phone sale or in-person action, via a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/09\/crm-for-small-business\">customer relationship management (CRM) <\/a>platform.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Local conversions:<\/strong> Whenever someone completes an action specific to an advertiser\u2019s physical location during or after interacting with an ad, it\u2019s considered a local conversion action. These are automatically defined for you by Google Ads since they occur only across Google\u2019s products or services, like Google Maps. Some examples of local actions are clicks to call, viewing a menu, or getting directions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/google-ads-conversion-actions.png\" alt=\"google ads conversion actions\" width=\"720\" height=\"161\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-58376 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/google-ads-conversion-actions.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/google-ads-conversion-actions-480x107.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Note that Local conversion actions would never be an available option here since they are automatically applied to your account by Google Ads. <\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Conversion categories<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll also have to choose a conversion category for your conversion actions.

If after 24 hours conversions still aren\u2019t showing up, it\u2019s possible that no customers have converted yet. One way to test this is by going through the motions of a conversion yourself by clicking on your ad when it appears, and doing whatever action is required to trigger the conversion on your site. If after another 24 hours your conversion isn\u2019t registering, double-check that the code was installed correctly.

To understand why this may be happening, ask yourself:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are you using a dedicated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/great-landing-pages\">landing page<\/a>? Sending users to your homepage can result in low conversion rates.<\/li>\n<li>Is the landing page optimized for conversion? Is there a prominent CTA, a simple form, and is the key information available above the fold?<\/li>\n<li>Is the landing page relevant to the ad? Does it contain the same keywords and copy so that the person is reassured upon clicking on the ad that they\u2019ll get what you\u2019ve promised them?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/google-ads-conversion-tracking-small-business-landing-page-example.jpg\" alt=\"google ads conversion tracking - conversion optimized landing page example \" width=\"720\" height=\"351\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-64064 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/google-ads-conversion-tracking-small-business-landing-page-example.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/google-ads-conversion-tracking-small-business-landing-page-example-480x234.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A landing page from a<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/local-marketing-lab\/small-business-websites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> small business website <\/a>that\u2019s optimized for conversions.
