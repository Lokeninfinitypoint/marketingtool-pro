There are many ways to help your brand begin to effectively embrace the diversity that has gone unnoticed and underappreciated. In this post, we\u2019ll cover three of them:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Diversify your team<\/li>\n<li>Perform market research<\/li>\n<li>Let your customers\u2019 voices be heard<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>3 ways to incorporate diversity into your marketing strategies<\/h2>\n<p>It has become increasingly important that a company is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/20\/ethical-marketing\">socially aware<\/a> and willing to include minorities and other groups of people that have, in the past, not typically been included in advertising. This is especially true as online <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/19\/social-media-for-small-business\">marketing through social media<\/a> continues to become more streamlined in targeting specific (and potentially sensitive) demographics such as weight and marital status.<\/p>\n<p>Creating visibility and representation not only\u00a0has a major impact on how potential clients see a company when choosing where to invest their money, but it also is the key to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/19\/conversion-rate-benchmarks\">higher conversion rates<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here are three ways to create visibility and representation within your brand.<\/p>\n<h3>1.
