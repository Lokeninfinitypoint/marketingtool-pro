Advertisers can easily reach billions of people across the greater web through Google search, Shopping, Maps, Gmail, YouTube, Discover, and more than 2 million different partner websites and apps. Google makes it easy for advertisers to reach all of these constantly updating placements across the web, too. Some of Google\u2019s campaign types\u2013such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/05\/performance-max-tips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Performance Max<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/18\/universal-app-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">App<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/08\/11\/google-adwords-express-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Smart<\/a> campaigns\u2013even automatically target all of these available placements to further simplify reaching this massive audience for advertisers.<\/p>\n<p>However, seasoned advertisers know that not all placements are equally valuable. In fact, your brand\u2019s ad next to the wrong content can upset your customers, damage your brand, and work against your goals. It\u2019s crucial to monitor where your ads appear online to prevent these missteps, but for years, advertisers couldn\u2019t view or control some of their ad placements on Google, specifically in their search partner network.<\/p>\n<p>However, after some recent vocal concerns from brands, Google has responded and released a new tool for some advertisers to review their ad placements across the search partner network and exclude placements that may be inappropriate.<\/p>\n<h3>Contents<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#google-ads-search-partner-nework\">What is the Google Ads Search Partner network?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#google-ads-performance-max-placement-report\">Google&#8217;s new Performance Max campaign placement report<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#opt-out-of-google-ads-search-partners\">How to opt out of Google Search Partner placements<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"google-ads-search-partner-network\"><\/div>\n<h2>What is the Google Ads Search Partner network?<\/h2>\n<p>Believe it or not, Google isn\u2019t the only search engine across the web! There are hundreds of smaller search engines and millions of websites with search bars\u2013and many of them serve similar PPC ads within their search results. However, most of these smaller sites don\u2019t build their own advertising platforms, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ad-strength\">Google Ads<\/a> or Microsoft Advertising. Instead, they partner with Google (or Microsoft) to help advertisers connect with searches on their sites. These secondary search engines across the web make up the Search Partner network and collectively make up a decent share of search traffic for many industries.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udea8<span>\u00a0<\/span>Ready to learn how to maximize your campaign success across networks?

Google\u2019s Performance Max (and other fully automated campaign types) dynamically places your ads across the entire Google network (Google search, search partners, display, YouTube, video, discover, and Gmail) to dynamically <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-in-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">use AI to maximize your campaign\u2019s results<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>The problems with Google\u2019s Search Partner Network<\/h3>\n<p>Google\u2019s Search Partner network&#8217;s additional reach is generally positive for advertisers\u2013but that reach comes at additional costs and concerns. Even if most search partners on the network are from reputable, high-quality sites, the vast internet unfortunately hosts many low-quality sites and bad agents.<\/p>\n<p>Google has never previously shared a list or directory of its ever-changing search partners. And unlike <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/30\/mastering-display-placements\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">placements across the Google Display Network,<\/a> advertisers haven\u2019t been able to review where their ads appeared on the Search Network. Search advertisers had the choice to buy ads on the entire Search Partner network\u2013or opt out entirely. Advertisers using Performance Max campaigns were automatically included across the entire Google network, including Search Partners.<\/p>\n<p>Over the years, advertisers have become <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/12\/05\/breitbart-ad-boycott\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">increasingly worried and vocal<\/a> about the kinds of content their ads appeared alongside, and many advertisers have serious concerns about their brand image across the web.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, <a href=\"https:\/\/adalytics.io\/blog\/search-partners-transparency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Adalytics published a study<\/a> revealing some concerning placements across the search partner network and discovered that several large companies, agencies, and government agencies were allegedly paying to show ads across some very questionable sites. Some of the examples from their study include pornographic content, pirated content, and sites that may be subject to international sanctions.<\/p>\n<p>Google largely refuted the claims from Adalytics and assured advertisers <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/edantaylor\/status\/1729591667294921038\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">that ad revenue wasn\u2019t being shared with sanctioned entities<\/a>. They further asserted that Adalytics claims were exaggerated and that such sites \u201crepresent a minuscule amount of [Google\u2019s] Search Partner network.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Shortly afterward, Google announced it would <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/google-advertisers-opt-out-search-partner-network-adalytics-435513\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">temporarily allow advertisers<\/a> to opt out of the Search Partner network in Performance Max and App campaigns until March 1. Advertisers would have to contact Google directly to opt out of Search Partners in these campaigns.<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-performance-max-placement-report\"><\/div>\n<h2>Google\u2019s new Performance Max campaign placement report<\/h2>\n<p>Addressing advertiser\u2019s growing concerns, Google announced that it would begin to share more insights into where advertisers\u2019 ads appeared across the web, including on the Search Partner network. Starting on March 4, advertisers can review how frequently their ads appeared across individual placements within their Performance Max and App campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>The report is now available to all advertisers with active Performance Max and App campaigns. However, the reporting is slightly hidden from how advertisers generally review their search queries or other ad placements.
