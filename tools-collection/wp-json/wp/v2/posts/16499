After all, it\u2019s the name of the industry!<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ads-for-nonprofits-scooper-bowl.jpg\" alt=\"guide to facebook advertising for nonprofits\" width=\"597\" height=\"596\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>WordStream employees volunteering for a good cause!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>As a graduate student, I know a thing or two about working with a small budget, and luckily Facebook is a great place to do just that! While not all Facebook advertising campaigns are cheap, there are many strategies you can implement so as not to overspend on the platform. There are also great opportunities for exposure if you advertise strategically on Facebook.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Advertise on Facebook?<\/h2>\n<p>You might be questioning the advice to spend <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/06\/small-marketing-budget\">your precious budget<\/a> towards advertising on Facebook. Is it really worth it? Can\u2019t you just post on your Facebook non-profit page and create buzz through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/12\/06\/social-media-for-nonprofits\">organic social media efforts<\/a>? What about Facebook grants for nonprofits? Is there such a\u00a0<em>free\u00a0<\/em>Facebook advertising for nonprofits?<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Facebook does not offer an equivalent to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/27\/google-ad-grants\"> Google&#8217;s Grants program<\/a>&#8211;so you&#8217;re not going to be able to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/10\/nonprofit-marketing-tactics\">market your nonprofit organization<\/a> for &#8220;free&#8221; on the platform. That said: as the saying goes, you have to spend money to make money. And when you spend money on Facebook, you give yourself the potential to experience really great ROAS. So while it&#8217;s not free, per se, there is a good chance to end up in the black if you advertise effectively.<\/p>\n<p>And if you have a smaller budget? Facebook is an extremely cluttered space, so while your budget may be miniscule it is still necessary to allocate a portion of it if you want any chance of getting seen and heard on Facebook. And I\u2019m not the only one who thinks this\u2026<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUnless you have a really large following, thousands of advocates sharing your content and maybe a couple of other organizations pitching in to spread the word, you probably won\u2019t make a dent in the social space,\u201d says\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/tulani-elisa\/nonprofits-and-social-med_1_b_8909244.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Huffington Post<\/a>\u00a0writer Tulani Elisa.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/07\/facebook-marketing-tips\">Facebook ads<\/a> don\u2019t have to be a budget-eater. Whether you\u2019re generating buzz about an event, gathering donations, or just raising awareness about an important cause, these eight money-saving tips will help you accomplish your goals without drying up the bank.<\/p>\n<h2>#1: Craft Super-Compelling Ad Headlines<\/h2>\n<p>Aside from the image, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/02\/ppc-ad-headlines\">headline<\/a> of your Facebook ad is a pivotal part of non profit advertising on Facebook. You only have a few seconds to catch someone\u2019s attention and convince them to engage with your nonprofit. Therefore, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/28\/facebook-ad-headlines\">your headline needs to be insanely actionable<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/collect_donations_facebook_ad_for_nonprofits.png\" alt=\"facebook ad examples for nonprofits\" width=\"450\" height=\"895\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via <a href=\"https:\/\/donations.fb.com\/en-gb\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Stick to simple and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/13\/power-words-ad-writing\">powerful language<\/a> that includes a specific call-to-action based on the goal of your ad. For example, if you are simply trying to generate awareness for your non-profit, try a CTA related to learning more. If you\u2019re trying to raise money, try words like \u201cgive\u201d and \u201cdonate.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Whatever you do, make sure to show some personality in your headline. Use your nonprofit\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/31\/brand-voice\">brand voice<\/a>, whether that\u2019s primarily about compassion or commitment. Here are some more <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/17\/how-to-write-great-headlines\">tips to writing click-worthy headlines<\/a><\/u>.<\/p>\n<h2>#2: Ensure Your Audiences Are Extremely Targeted<\/h2>\n<p>One of the many benefits of advertising on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/24\/facebook-engagement\">Facebook<\/a> is that you don\u2019t have to show your ads to every joe schmo who happens to stumble across them.<\/p>\n<p>You likely have an understanding of who your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/18\/beginners-guide-to-target-markets\">target audience<\/a> is, and since these are the individuals most likely to donate to your cause, why wouldn\u2019t you focus your small budget on them? With <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/01\/facebook-stories-ads\">Facebook ads<\/a> you can do just that \u2013 hooray!<\/p>\n<p>Whether it be a customer audience, specific age range, locations, gender, languages, demographics, interests, behaviors, etc., these categories just scratch the surface of how granular you can get in your targeting capabilities. For instance, let\u2019s say you want to target \u201cgreen moms\u201d who are interested in cancer causes, running, and make between $75,000 and $99,000\/year, you can do it!<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ad-targeting-for-non-profits.png\" alt=\"how to target nonprofit facebook ads\" width=\"593\" height=\"376\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Using these granular targeting options will ensure your budget is well spent on the most relevant individuals. Just make sure not to get <em>overly<\/em> layered to the point where no one ends up seeing your ads.<\/p>\n<h2>#3: Use Custom and Lookalike Audiences<\/h2>\n<p>Did you know that you can upload a list of emails right into Facebook and then show your ads to that audience? Through\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/27\/facebook-custom-audiences\">Facebook\u2019s Custom Audiences<\/a><\/u>\u00a0feature, you can target the leads you\u2019ve captured from your newsletter signup or other marketing efforts, or perhaps a group of your past supporters that you want to re-engage.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-audiences-for-nonprofit-ads.gif\" alt=\"nonprofit facebook ad audiences\" width=\"1185\" height=\"646\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In addition to focusing on insanely targeted audiences (see tip #2) you should also be showing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/04\/30\/facebook-canvas-ads\">Facebook ads<\/a> to the contacts you already have, but in an even more personalized way. For instance, let\u2019s say you have a list of people who registered to attend a fundraising event. You can upload that list of people and target them with a highly specific ad that refers to that event and tells them what the next steps are.<\/p>\n<p>We have discussed a few strategies for creating relevant audiences; once you\u2019ve acquired enough data, you can clone your top-performing Facebook audience.\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/28\/facebook-ad-targeting\">Facebook\u2019s Lookalike Audience feature<\/a><\/u>\u00a0allows you to take an audience you already have and expand your reach by finding new supporters that have similar attributes. You can pretty much clone your best audience. It\u2019s that simple!<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/lookalike-audiences-facebook-ads-nonprofit.jpg\" alt=\"lookalike audiences facebook ads nonprofit\" width=\"600\" height=\"365\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>#4: Add a \u201cDonate Now\u201d Button to Your Facebook Ads<\/h2>\n<p>The majority of non-profits need donations to keep running and making strides towards their cause. Money makes the world go around, after all. However, this is likely the trickiest part about being a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/09\/marketing-for-nonprofits\">non-profit marketer<\/a>. There are so many great causes out there, so why should someone donate to yours over some other cause? Well, convincing your pool of potential donors to help out is another thing the non-profit marketer always has at the top of their to-do list.<\/p>\n<p>One foolproof way to increase the likelihood of driving donations through non profit advertising on Facebook\u00a0is by making it as easy as humanly possible for someone to make a donation. What could be easier then clicking a \u201cDonate Now\u201d button right from the Facebook platform? And yes, this magical button is something that you can indeed add to your Facebook page and ads!<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-button-donate-now-for-non-profits.png\" alt=\"facebook donate now button\" width=\"397\" height=\"419\" \/><\/div>\n<p>One thing to note is that the Donate Now call-to-action button is only available for the following objectives: Brand Awareness, Reach, Traffic, App Installs, Lead Generation, Conversions, Product Catalog Sales, Video Ads, and Store Visits. Clearly, your options are not limited! <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/694386777360892\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Check out this page<\/a> to learn about adding this donation-driving button to your ads.<\/p>\n<h2>#5: Utilize Ad Scheduling<\/h2>\n<p>As we\u2019ve discussed time and time again, money is tight in the non-profit sector, so when it comes to running ads it likely does not make sense to blindly run ads 24\/7. Why? Well, there are likely days and times where your potential donors or the key audience you\u2019re trying to reach is spending more conscious time on Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps you\u2019ve found donations spike towards the end of the week during lunch and after dinner. Or maybe trends fluctuate by season. You might see more activity on weekends when people are spending time indoors on their phones or computers during the colder months. In the summer this pattern may change completely.<\/p>\n<p>Look at your Facebook data to make these determinations and take advantage of ad scheduling to show your ads to your target audience only at these peak, ready-to-convert times.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ad-scheduling-for-nonprofit-sector.png\" alt=\"facebook ads for nonprofits ad scheduling\" width=\"511\" height=\"440\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Ad scheduling is a great way to maintain control over your budget, and get a better return through the money you invest in advertising. Take advantage of this feature, and don\u2019t let your small budget go to waste!<\/p>\n<h2>#6: Appeal to Emotions<\/h2>\n<p>While this is actually a tip that applies to all marketing campaigns, it is especially true when it comes to the non-profit industry. After all, these organizations are often built and run off of emotion. Investing in a cause is often an emotional decision.<\/p>\n<p>Non-profit marketers have the opportunity to tell a meaningful story in every piece of content they share to promote their cause. This is by far the best way to reach people and make them invested in your business.<\/p>\n<p>The key to appealing to user emotions is telling a story in an impactful way. Using descriptive adjectives in ad copy, showing pictures and videos of the real people or animals behind these stories, and letting your own emotional ties shine through will help others relate and become invested as well. Take the example below from St. Baldrick\u2019s Foundation. In this Facebook ad they share a picture of a little boy who has beat cancer through the help of their supporters. What could be more impactful then a message like this?<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/st-baldricks-nonprofit-emotional-facebook-ad.png\" alt=\"example of a facebook ad for non-profit\" width=\"400\" height=\"490\" \/><\/div>\n<p>For testing ad copy, check out this guide on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/11\/facebook-ab-testing\">saving money through\u00a0A\/B testing on Facebook<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>#7: Experiment with Interactive Ad Formats<\/h2>\n<p>Storytelling and appealing to emotions should not be done just through copy. There needs to be supporting images and videos to tell your story in a compelling and convincing manner. You may have these resources already on hand or consider investing in some powerful videos to tell your story. Whatever you decide, Facebook offers a variety of visually compelling ad formats to choose from.<\/p>\n<p>Take the carousel ad for instance; this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/26\/how-to-create-facebook-ads\">ad format<\/a>\u00a0is perfect for any industry that has visual appeal. Non-profits fit right into this bucket. The Facebook <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/21\/facebook-carousel-ads\">carousel ad<\/a> format essentially allows the advertisers to display a series of images in a catalog type format so viewers can scroll through and view multiple images or listings. You could create an ad featuring images of people participating in your fundraising race, or use images of the people and communities you\u2019re trying to help.<\/p>\n<h2>#8: Continually Measure and Evaluate Your Campaign Performance<\/h2>\n<p>Last, but certainly not least, it is especially critical for non-profits to measure and track the success of their Facebook ad campaigns. Having insight into whether or not the money you\u2019re spending is yielding a return is critical when resources are limited.<\/p>\n<p>Taking action by understanding which metrics to track, how frequently to track them, and what constitutes a budget well spent will ensure no money is going wasted.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-conversion-tracking-custom-conversions-dashboard.png\" alt=\"Facebook conversion tracking custom conversion dashboard\" width=\"940\" height=\"533\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This might seem easier said than done.
