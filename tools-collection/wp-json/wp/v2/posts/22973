It\u2019s great to see people I\u2019ve worked with grow and try new things, but it\u2019s also sad to see them go. Second, and worse, hiring takes up a ton of time. It can be so hard to find the right person!<\/p>\n<p>In my time at WordStream, I\u2019ve reviewed HUNDREDS of marketing resumes, some better than others. Some a LOT better than others.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to get hired for a marketing job, you need to make sure your resume <strong>immediately<\/strong> stands out, because the hiring manager is busy and frustrated and doesn\u2019t have time to grant everyone a phone screen.<\/p>\n<p>Here are nine simple ways to improve your marketing resume and increase your chances of getting an interview.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Add stats &amp; figures<\/h2>\n<p>When reviewing marketing resumes, hiring managers want to see <strong>hard evidence of strong performance<\/strong>. So take a look back at the work you did in your last or current role and make sure you quantify your successes.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d3a66059-cf56-4dd7-b92e-00545e14cc15\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-resume-math.jpg\" alt=\"how to improve a marketing resume\" width=\"346\" height=\"255\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><em>Math: Anyone can do it!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Examples of stats you might include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Growth in site traffic thanks to your work on SEO or social media campaigns<\/li>\n<li>Growth in email subscribers or increases in email open rates<\/li>\n<li>Conversion rate improvements through landing page optimization or other tests<\/li>\n<li>Reduction in cost per action or cost per acquisition<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The same way that numbers <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/02\/ppc-ad-headlines\">improve CTR in ad headlines<\/a>, they stand out from all the verbiage on a resume and show that you\u2019re results-driven.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Use a striking resume template<\/h2>\n<p>Chances are, at any given moment, your hiring manager\u2019s eyes are glazing over with the boredom of reviewing dozens of resumes in a row that all look the same. Especially if your experience isn\u2019t absolutely stellar or perfectly aligned with the role, you can get your resume noticed by using a striking resume format.<\/p>\n<p>Some design elements that can help you stand out from the other marketing resumes include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use of color<\/strong> \u2013 Don\u2019t go crazy; the main text of the resume should be black. But in the marketing world, a little color (keep it refined!) is better than strict black and white throughout. (I wouldn\u2019t say this is true if you\u2019re applying for a technical job or something in law or medicine.) Below is an example of a resume that makes good subtle use of color.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"32ef1520-eb8a-4540-bfa4-09181d110f66\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-resume-template-colour.jpg\" alt=\"marketing resume template\" width=\"570\" height=\"706\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use of fonts<\/strong> \u2013 Different fonts for headings and body text improve readability and the overall look of your resume. But again, don\u2019t choose anything too \u201ccreative.\u201d Check out Canva\u2019s guide to the <a href=\"https:\/\/designschool.canva.com\/blog\/resume-fonts\/\">best and worst fonts for resumes<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"16fc02ac-b553-42ed-bbcc-e429d077e3a9\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-resume-comic-sans.jpg\" alt=\"marketing resume fonts\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A two-column design<\/strong> \u2013 This can help you put a little more information on the page without things looking too cluttered, and it\u2019s often easier to read (this is why print magazines use columns).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Depending on the role, attractive resume formatting could just be a nice-to-have or it could be critical. If you\u2019re applying for a job in design, your resume is effectively part of your portfolio, so don\u2019t take shortcuts. Make it count.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t know where to start, you can find free marketing resume templates on the web; try these ones from <a href=\"http:\/\/offers.hubspot.com\/marketing-resume-templates\">HubSpot<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.livecareer.com\/resume-examples\/marketing-advertising\">LiveCareer<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Sharpen up your skills section<\/h2>\n<p>Most resumes include a section that lists your skillsets, but I\u2019ve seen plenty of marketing resumes where it was a total waste of space. Mastery of Microsoft Office is pretty much a bare-minimum skill for any marketing job, so think bigger.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d6d01f49-6ba2-4e8c-b777-bc8533c53ab5\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-resume-sweet-skills.jpg\" alt=\"marketing resume skills\" width=\"500\" height=\"350\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Most importantly, <strong>make sure the skills you list are relevant to the marketing job you\u2019re applying for<\/strong>. A good third of the resumes I get don\u2019t even use the words in the job title anywhere on the resume! This is a terrible idea, because it makes it look like you\u2019re just carpet-bombing people with your resume and didn\u2019t bother to read the job description. Plus, some companies use screening software, meaning if your resume doesn\u2019t include certain keywords, a real person won\u2019t ever even look at it.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, hiring managers are going to be looking for three things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Proficiency in specific channels\/techniques<\/strong> \u2013 List any broad or channel-specific <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/17\/digital-marketing-skills\">marketing skills <\/a>you have, such as PPC, content marketing, lead nurturing, public speaking, video editing, web design, mobile marketing, data visualization, etc. Again, <em>make sure you include the skills required in the job description<\/em> (if the job title is \u201cSEO Manager,\u201d your resume should include skills relevant to SEO, like link building and keyword research). But include your other <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/07\/marketing-skills\">marketing skills<\/a> too; you never know what additional skills the company might consider to be a bonus.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Proficiency in specific tools\/software platforms<\/strong> \u2013 List all the tools\/software that you use to accomplish the above techniques (SEO tools, PPC platforms and third-party software, email marketing platforms, video or design tools, etc.). Make sure you check the job description to see if they\u2019re looking for a candidate who has experience with any specific platforms or tools, such as AdWords or Photoshop.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Proficiency in coding languages and operating systems<\/strong> \u2013 List any programming languages you know (even good old-fashioned HTML) plus operating systems and content management systems. (For example, the WordStream site runs on Drupal, which isn\u2019t super-common, so I always notice when it pops up on a resume and consider it a plus.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It\u2019s also worth mentioning <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/growth-academy\">marketing certifications<\/a> and <strong>relevant<\/strong> awards (i.e. marketing industry awards).<\/p>\n<p>Try not to be too vague or general in this section. Pretty much everyone believes they have \u201cthe ability to multitask\u201d; putting that on your resume is like saying you\u2019re a good driver.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Add links to your work<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c087f3c2-1317-452b-9821-88dc08c8b306\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-resume-look-upon-my-works.jpg\" alt=\"marketing resume links\" width=\"500\" height=\"596\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>This is key! You can claim anything you want on a resume, but your claims are going to go way farther if you\u2019re able to back them up.<\/p>\n<p>Consider adding links to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your LinkedIn profile (just <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/09\/improve-linkedin-profile\">polish it up first<\/a> and get a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/18\/linkedin-connection-requests\">decent amount of connections<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>An online portfolio (if you\u2019re applying for a design, development, or writing job, say)<\/li>\n<li>Your personal blog or your company\u2019s blog if you\u2019re involved in it<\/li>\n<li>Your social media profiles, such as Twitter, Google+, or Instagram, but ONLY if they\u2019re professional and relevant to the position<\/li>\n<li>Contributed articles you\u2019ve written or other evidence of thought leadership<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When I\u2019m looking to hire a writer or content marketer, I really appreciate when candidates make it easy for me to see recent samples of their work.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Keep the education section simple<\/h2>\n<p>List any degrees you have, where you got them and when. <strong>Don\u2019t bother including any of the below<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your grade point average<\/li>\n<li>Any clubs or societies or fraternities\/sororities you belonged to<\/li>\n<li>Minor academic awards (e.g. Dean\u2019s list)<\/li>\n<li>The fact that you studied abroad<\/li>\n<li>Your coursework<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Seriously, just leave all this out. It looks amateurish \u2013 unless there is literally nothing else to put on your resume because you\u2019ve never had a job. (The rules are a little different if you\u2019re trying to land an internship.)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"733f3459-c219-4a6f-9b62-320658be15dc\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-resume-skill-tips.png\" alt=\"marketing resume guide\" width=\"525\" height=\"164\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The fact is, 95% of hiring managers don\u2019t care about the details of your academic background, because getting A\u2019s in college doesn\u2019t necessarily tell you anything about how the person will perform in a real work environment, and classwork doesn\u2019t really translate into experience. So don\u2019t waste space; include more details and data from your previous jobs instead.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Add a summary sentence at the top<\/h2>\n<p>My colleague Meg Lister told me, \u201cI LOVE when people add a sentence to the top of their resume to describe who they are or why they want the job. It\u2019s a nice way to personalize an application without a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/13\/how-to-write-a-cover-letter\">cover letter<\/a>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>You should have a cover letter (see #9, below) but if the application doesn\u2019t allow for it, definitely make use of this tip. Add a sentence at the top, right under your contact information, that summarizes who you are and what you\u2019re looking for in your next career move.<\/p>\n<p>An example of a <strong>good<\/strong> summary sentence is \u201cSelf-motivated SEO with six years\u2019 experience, strong analytical skills, and a belief in the power of holistic marketing campaigns.\u201d (This is good because it differentiates you from other candidates, like a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\">value prop<\/a> for your resume.)<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example of a <strong>bad<\/strong> summary sentence: \u201cI am seeking a full-time position as a content marketing specialist.\u201d (This is bad because it all it does is state the obvious \u2013 duh, that\u2019s the job you\u2019re applying for \u2013 and shows no personality.)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"44340961-6d16-4512-b69c-446482a50e14\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-resume-duh.gif\" alt=\"marketing resume advice\" width=\"388\" height=\"200\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>7. Keep it to a single page<\/h2>\n<p>Unless you\u2019re applying for a very senior position, like a VP role where they\u2019re looking for 10+ years of experience, pare down the information on your resume so it fits on one page. Otherwise you\u2019re sucking up too much of the hiring manager\u2019s time.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re struggling to cut down your marketing resume, here are some ideas:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try a two-column design as mentioned above, like this:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"9748363e-28ab-4372-abb6-da77793e5d8c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/2-column-marketing-resume.jpg\" alt=\"marketing resume format\" width=\"236\" height=\"305\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<ul>\n<li>Only include your last three to four jobs, not your entire job history, especially if earlier roles didn\u2019t give you relevant experience (I don\u2019t need to know about the summer you were a waitress).<\/li>\n<li>Condense the summary of each role to three bullet points max.<\/li>\n<li>Reduce the font size (but no smaller than 10 pt).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>8. List a few hobbies<\/h2>\n<p>If you have room and it doesn\u2019t push you over the first page, show the hiring manager a bit of your personality by including a brief list of two to three hobbies. It reminds the hiring manager that you\u2019re an actual human.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve hired at people at WordStream whose hobbies include birdwatching, figure skating, kendo, bartending, reviewing food trucks, mountain climbing, marathons \u2026 (I mean different people, not one person all at the same time).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"71330a0e-723d-42a1-9415-4cc48e56474e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-resume-include-hobbies.png\" alt=\"marketing resume hobbies\" width=\"339\" height=\"348\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><em>Our beloved Erin at her OTHER job<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If the hiring manager thinks they will like you as a person, that might give you the edge.<\/p>\n<h2>9. Write a cover letter<\/h2>\n<p>Your resume isn\u2019t ever going to tell the whole story, so always supplement the resume with a cover letter, and <strong>always tailor it to the job you\u2019re applying for<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h3>Cover Letter Do\u2019s:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Do mention why you\u2019re interested in THIS ROLE in particular.<\/li>\n<li>Do highlight the two or three elements of your work or life experience that are most relevant to this role and speak best to your ability to do the job well.<\/li>\n<li>Do show your personality. That means you need to write the cover letter yourself; don\u2019t copy and paste from a template you find on the internet.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Cover Letter Don\u2019ts:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Don\u2019t use fancy-sounding words you would never say, like \u201csynchronicity\u201d and \u201cmyriad\u201d (ugh).<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t go on and on and on (we\u2019re busy, remember?). Two to three short paragraphs tops.<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t be phony. Don\u2019t pretend to be \u201cpassionate\u201d about things you\u2019re not passionate about.<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t say you\u2019re just trying to get your foot in the door, trying to build experience for your future career, etc. The hiring manager wants to find someone who is excited about this role, not someone who just needs a job.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Is Your Marketing Resume Already Slammin\u2019?<\/h2>\n<p>Check out our <a href=\"\/jobs\">open jobs<\/a>!
