These 17\u00a0strategies below will help you to do just that.<\/p>\n<h3>1. First, know the process<\/h3>\n<p>It takes about a minute for a customer to write\u00a0a Google review. Easy enough, right? Well, there&#8217;s a process to get there. The customer has to:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open up\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/02\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps\">Google Maps<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Search for your business<\/li>\n<li>Click on it to pull up your\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/08\/what-is-google-my-business\">Google Business Profile<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Scroll down to the reviews section in your profile<\/li>\n<li>Click write a review<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><em>Customer: You have been amazing. How can I leave you a review?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Would you rather have to say:<\/p>\n<p><em>A Google review would be great! Just search for us on\u00a0Google Maps and when you pull up our listing, scroll down to the review section and there will be a button there to write a review.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Or<\/p>\n<p><em>A Google review would be great! Just go to our website and there&#8217;s a link right there to do it.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>2. Create a Google review link shortcut<\/h3>\n<p>Your customer has to go online to write the review, regardless, so create a review shortcut link and put it on your website.<\/p>\n<p>Go to your Google My Business account, click the Home tab, and find the &#8220;Get your first review&#8221; (or &#8220;Get more reviews&#8221;) card. Click &#8220;Share review form&#8221; and copy the link to your clipboard.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-36703\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/get-more-google-reviews-link-shortcut.png\" alt=\"how to get more google reviews: create google review shortcut link\" width=\"720\" height=\"324\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/get-more-google-reviews-link-shortcut.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/get-more-google-reviews-link-shortcut-480x216.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll see this:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-36704\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/get-more-googe-reviews-review-shortcut-link.png\" alt=\"google review link shortcut\" width=\"720\" height=\"439\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/get-more-googe-reviews-review-shortcut-link.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/get-more-googe-reviews-review-shortcut-link-480x293.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>3. Shorten your review shortcut<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy enough to drop this link into a button on your website or hyperlink it through shorter anchor text. But there are plenty of offline methods of getting Google reviews for which this eye sore of a string will not work. Thankfully, there are free link shorteners out there like <a href=\"https:\/\/bitly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bitly.com<\/a>\u00a0through which you can shorten and even customize your review link.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20get20more20google20reviews20shorten20review20link_1.png\" alt=\"how to get more google reviews shorten review link\" width=\"800\" height=\"366\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Okay, now that you&#8217;ve got a nice and clean review shortcut link, it&#8217;s time to look at various ways to present this link to customers to get more Google reviews for your local business.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Link out to your Google reviews page from your website<\/h3>\n<p>If a customer wants to leave a review for your business,\u00a0the first place they&#8217;re probably going to look is <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/12\/31\/basic-website\">your website<\/a>. Provide a clear and clutter-free call to action that is intuitively easy to find, as with the example below:<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-36705\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/get-more-google-reviews-website-reviews-page.png\" alt=\"example of reviews page on website with google review CTA\" width=\"800\" height=\"501\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/get-more-google-reviews-website-reviews-page.png 800w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/get-more-google-reviews-website-reviews-page-480x301.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nIn this example, clicking on &#8220;here&#8221; takes the user directly to the review section of the home inspector&#8217;s Google Business Profile which lives in the\u00a0SERP.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Create a Google reviews page on your website<\/h3>\n<p>While the above\u00a0method works, an even better one is to dedicate a full website page to Google reviews (or reviews in general), accessible from your main navigation menu. The page should contain both a CTA to write a review but also include existing reviews. These not only encourage\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/04\/nurture-marketing\">prospects to become a customer<\/a>, but also give that added inspiration\u00a0for an existing customer to leave a review.<\/p>\n<p>You can populate your reviews page via screenshots, but ideally, you want them\u00a0to be in text form. The reason for this is that reviews are often keyword-rich, so including them on your website in a way that Google&#8217;s crawlers can &#8220;read&#8221; makes for a\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/13\/smb-seo-strategies-covid-19\">great small business SEO strategy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, you may want to come up with a template where you can copy and paste the text in. There are also platforms and plug-ins that allow you to aggregate your Google reviews onto your website automatically.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-36706\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/how-to-get-more-google-reviews-embed-reviews.png\" alt=\"get more google reviews: tool to embed google reviews on website\" width=\"800\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/how-to-get-more-google-reviews-embed-reviews.png 800w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/how-to-get-more-google-reviews-embed-reviews-480x278.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>6. Include a Google review CTA in your footer<\/h3>\n<p>In addition to or instead of having a designated page for Google reviews (or reviews in general) on your website, you may also want to include it in your website footer. This way, you don&#8217;t have to worry about deciding where or where not to include the CTA. The below example uses images, but anchor text will do just fine.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-36707\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/get-more-google-reviews-CTA-footer.png\" alt=\"get more google reviews with CTA in website footer\" width=\"800\" height=\"432\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/get-more-google-reviews-CTA-footer.png 800w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/get-more-google-reviews-CTA-footer-480x259.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>7.\u00a0Create \u201cleave us a review\u201d cards<\/h3>\n<p>This is an offline method of getting more Google reviews, for which your shortcut link from #3 comes in handy. Have physical cards made up that says something to the effect of:<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Review Us on Google!<\/em> <em>Your Google review helps others who need our services to find our business. <\/em><em>Plus, your feedback equips us to continue serving you best.<\/em> <em>Take a minute to rate and review us at bit.ly\/WordStreamreview.<\/em> <em>Thank you!&#8221;<\/em><br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-36708\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/get-more-google-reviews-review-request-card.png\" alt=\"get more google reviews with a review request card\" width=\"800\" height=\"458\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/get-more-google-reviews-review-request-card.png 800w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/get-more-google-reviews-review-request-card-480x275.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>8. Ask for Google reviews in person<\/h3>\n<p>Having a good conversation with a customer in your store? Just finished a solid support call in which the customer felt eternally grateful? In your interactions with clients, there are many opportunities to ask for Google reviews. Here are some scenarios and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">examples of asking for reviews<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>&#8220;I\u2019m so glad to hear how happy you are with our business. Hey, if you wanted to leave that in a Google review, you\u2019d help a lot more people like yourself to find us.<\/em><em>\u201d <\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>\u201cThis feedback is super helpful. You know what would be awesome is if you shared that feedback online for other customers to see.\u201d<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>\u201cI\u2019m so happy we could help you. If you wouldn\u2019t mind sharing a sentence or two in a Google review, that would help us a ton.\u201d<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And then you have that compact little card that has the link on it, or a link to your review page on your website that makes it easy peasy for them.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Emphasize to customers how quick and easy it is<\/h3>\n<p>So by now, <em>you<\/em> know how easy it is to leave a Google review, but your customers may not. Plus, review writer&#8217;s block is a thing. An exuberant or <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/10\/customer-loyalty\">long-time customer<\/a> may have a hard time distilling everything they love about your business into one review. And then there are those who have a hard time articulating what&#8217;s on their mind. So when you&#8217;re encouraging a review, it might be helpful to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tell them they can\u00a0leave a star rating without writing anything (if applicable).<\/li>\n<li>Remind them that if they do write, the review need only be one or two sentences.<\/li>\n<li>Use terminology like \u201cleave a review\u201d or \u201cdrop a quick review\u201d instead of \u201cwrite a review,\u201d as it might feel less cumbersome.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20get20more20google20reviews20leave20us20a20review.png\" alt=\"how to get more google reviews leave us a review\" width=\"500\" height=\"164\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>10. Run a Google review email campaign<\/h3>\n<p>Whether via <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/06\/personalized-marketing\">personalized<\/a> messages or a larger blanket campaign, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/03\/email-marketing-best-practices\">email marketing<\/a> is another effective way to get more Google business reviews. Just be clear in your ask\u2014don\u2019t try to sugar coat it, beat around the bush, or coerce customers\u00a0into leaving a review. There\u2019s nothing wrong with asking them\u00a0to do something that will help other future customers make informed decisions. Plus, when you <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/19\/customer-marketing-strategies\">have happy customers<\/a>, you\u2019d be surprised at how willing they are to write a review. As long as the process is clear and you make it fast and easy to do, you&#8217;re likely to get warm responses to your request.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Fact:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/research\/local-consumer-review-survey\/\">86%<\/a> of consumers are willing to write a review.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>11. Include Google review opportunities in surveys<\/h3>\n<p>Asking your customers for their <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/24\/customer-feedback\">feedback<\/a> lets them know that you value what they have to say and have their best interests in mind. If you&#8217;ve gotten someone to fill out a poll or survey, they&#8217;re already in the proper mindset. See if you can take advantage of their momentum by asking them to review your business on Google while they&#8217;re at it.<\/p>\n<h3>12. Ask for reviews on social media<\/h3>\n<p>Social media platforms are great for conversational marketing and transparency. Post a screenshot of your best review and ask your customers to leave their own feedback (including your clean and simple Google review\u00a0shortcut link). Remind your followers that this is an opportunity for them to introduce someone else just like them to the benefits they experience from working with your business.<\/p>\n<p>Platforms like Facebook have their own review system, so keep this in mind when reaching out in this regard.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-36709\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/get-more-google-reviews-facebook-post.png\" alt=\"get more google reviews with a facebook post\" width=\"800\" height=\"698\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/get-more-google-reviews-facebook-post.png 800w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/get-more-google-reviews-facebook-post-480x419.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>13. Get Google reviews from vendors and partners<\/h3>\n<p>Vendors and partners may not be customers, but they can attest to what it&#8217;s like to work with you on a regular basis. They also might be more willing to leave a Google business review if you write one for their business first.<\/p>\n<h3>14. Respond to your existing Google reviews<\/h3>\n<p>When you r<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-respond-to-google-reviews-with-examples\/\">espond to your customers\u2019 Google reviews<\/a>, you are letting new potential reviewers know that you listen to customer feedback and that it\u2019s worth their time to write their own review. There are two ways in which responding to reviews can get you more reviews.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Positive reviews:\u00a0<\/strong>Being specific, timely, and grateful in your responses to positive reviews will beget more positive reviews.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Negative reviews:\u00a0<\/strong>Responding promptly and politely to negative reviews and actually resolving the issue can oftentimes result in the conversion of a negative review into a positive one.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Among consumers that read reviews, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/research\/local-consumer-review-survey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">97%<\/a> read businesses\u2019 responses to reviews.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>15. Create a Google review instruction video<\/h3>\n<p>Even with a shortcut link, some customers might still be more likely to write a review if they see what the process looks like.

Include your Google review link in your email signature<\/h3>\n<p>Adding a link to review your business on Google in your email signature is a great way to ask for more Google reviews without actually asking! Something like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Have we helped you? Help others to find us by leaving a Google Review! <\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>Happy with [Business Name]? Leave a review here.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>Let others know about\u00a0[Business Name].<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This can be particularly effective if you <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/21\/client-communication-during-covid-19\">communicate on a daily basis with clients <\/a>via email.<\/p>\n<h2>Examples of asking for Google customer\u00a0reviews<\/h2>\n<p>Coming up with the words to actually ask for a Google review can sometimes be hard, so here are some basic phrases you can use for starting points or inspiration:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reviews on Google help us to help more people like you. When you have a minute, please share your feedback about our business!<\/li>\n<li>Got a minute to review us on Google? We\u2019d love to get your feedback.<\/li>\n<li>Thank you for choosing our business! Let us know how we&#8217;re doing by dropping us a quick Google review!<\/li>\n<li>We appreciate your input! Help us continue providing the best service by\u00a0posting a review on Google.<\/li>\n<li>Leave us a quick review on Google! This helps people who need our help to find us.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>How to leave Google reviews (without the shortcut link)<\/h2>\n<p>While your shortcut link turns writing Google reviews into a one-step process, it&#8217;s still good to know the steps just to have all of your bases covered. Plus, you may want to leave reviews for other local businesses in your community who may not have the shortcut link. So here&#8217;s how to do it:<\/p>\n<h3>How to leave a Google review on mobile<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the Google Maps app<\/li>\n<li>Search for the business name<\/li>\n<li>Tap on the listing<\/li>\n<li>Tap the \u201cReviews\u201d tab in the listing.<\/li>\n<li>You\u2019ll see a \u201cRate and review\u201d section where you can give the business a star rating. Once you select the star rating, you\u2019ll have the option to write a review about the experience.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20get20more20google20reviews20leave20review20on20mobile_1.png\" alt=\"how to get more google reviews leave review mobile\" width=\"300\" height=\"533\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>How to leave a Google review on desktop<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google.com\/maps<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Search for the business name<\/li>\n<li>Click the listing<\/li>\n<li>Scroll down to \u201cReview summary\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Click on \u201cWrite a review\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Alternatively, you can click on the star rating directly below the business\u2019s listing title. This will take you directly to the review pane, which has an option to write a review.<\/p>\n<p>For either of these methods, you will be asked to\u00a0rate the business from one to five stars. You can add comments or even images of the location and offerings (provided they abide by <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/local-guides\/answer\/7400114?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google&#8217;s review posting guidelines<\/a>). Then, to publish, you&#8217;ll simply need to click \u201cPost.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Make Google business reviews a habit<\/h2>\n<p>The fact is, consumers trust what other consumers have to say. In fact, many people feel that reviews posted by strangers are just as reliable as personal recommendations. Use that to your advantage. Make a habit of asking\u00a0your customers to review your business on Google. As long as you make it as easy as possible to do, you are likely to get more Google business reviews showing up on <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/listings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">your listing<\/a>\u00a0and therefore reaping all of the ranking, reputation, and revenue benefits it has to offer.<\/p>\n<p>To sum it all up, here are the 16 best ways to get more Google reviews:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure you have a verified Google Business Profile<\/li>\n<li>Tell customers how to do it<\/li>\n<li>Link out to your profile from your website<\/li>\n<li>Create a short and clean Google review link shortcut<\/li>\n<li>Have a reviews page on your website<\/li>\n<li>Include a Google review CTA in your footer<\/li>\n<li>Create &#8220;leave us a review&#8221; cards<\/li>\n<li>Ask in person<\/li>\n<li>Emphasize how easy it is<\/li>\n<li>Run a Google review email campaign<\/li>\n<li>Include review opportunities in surveys<\/li>\n<li>Ask your social media followers to review your business<\/li>\n<li>Request reviews via social media posts<\/li>\n<li>Include your review link in your email signature<\/li>\n<li>Respond to existing reviews<\/li>\n<li>Create an explainer video.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google reviews should be a top priority for your local business.
