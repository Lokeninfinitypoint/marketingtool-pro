Look over some of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/12\/07\/amplify-email-marketing-with-ppc\">the emails you sent<\/a> to prospective customers, or the social media updates you made promoting your brand-new product or service. Read over some of the blog posts you published.<\/p>\n<p>How much of this promotional content focused on what your product <em>does<\/em>?<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/features-vs-benefits-header1.png\" alt=\"Features versus benefits\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" \/><\/div>\n<p>When it comes to marketing, there are two primary approaches you can take. The first focuses on what your product or service is or does \u2013 including all the shiny bells and whistles you\u2019ve worked so hard to develop. The other focuses on how your product or service will improve users\u2019 lives.<\/p>\n<p>Which of these approaches do you think is more effective?<\/p>\n<p>In today\u2019s post, we\u2019ll be taking a look at features versus benefits. Although closely linked, these two concepts are completely different animals, and if you don\u2019t consider <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/26\/intent-marketing\">user intent<\/a> from the outset, even the most innovative, revolutionary products will fail to hit the mark.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ll be looking at real-world examples to highlight the often-subtle yet crucial differences between features and benefits, as well as several important considerations you should bear in mind before launching your next campaign. For the sake of ease, we\u2019ll be focusing primarily on product-based marketing, rather than marketing a service-based business, although many of the concepts covered will apply equally to both.<\/p>\n<p>So what\u2019s the difference between features and benefits? To get started, let\u2019s take a look at the definitions of what features and benefits actually are.<\/p>\n<h4><em>&lt;&lt;Need more help with your copywriting? <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLWebBlogInContentTextLinkTrickstoClicks.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_TrickstoClicks_Download\">Get our free guide: Tricks to Get the Click&gt;&gt;<\/a><\/em><\/h4>\n<h2>Features vs. Benefits: What&#8217;s the Difference?<\/h2>\n<h3>What is a Feature?<\/h3>\n<p>Simply, a feature is something that your product has or is. For <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/15\/adwords-for-saas-startups\">SaaS companies<\/a>, this is typically functionality offered by a software program that enables users to do something. Other examples of product features might include razors with five-blade heads, power drills with interchangeable bits, fridges that can make crushed ice etc. You get the idea.<\/p>\n<p>Going back to software, a feature of <a href=\"\/wordstream-for-ppc\">WordStream Advisor<\/a>, for example, is the 20-Minute PPC Work Week, an intelligent system of unique, personalized recommendations based on users\u2019 account data that identifies areas of AdWords and Bing Ads accounts in which immediate improvements can be made.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/new-improved-20-min-ww-2.png\" alt=\"wordstream 20 minute workweek for agencies\" width=\"1000\" height=\"653\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>WordStream Advisor\u2019s 20-Minute PPC Work Week<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Features often directly address common problems experienced by users in <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/18\/beginners-guide-to-target-markets\">a company\u2019s target market<\/a>, in WordStream\u2019s case, streamlining the paid search workflow for busy small-business owners.<\/p>\n<p>Product features have to be planned, built, and executed. The 20-Minute PPC Work Week didn\u2019t build itself, nor did WordStream\u2019s engineering team create it accidentally \u2013 WordStream identified a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/28\/pain-points\">common pain-point<\/a> among its target market, and intentionally set out to implement a feature that addressed this problem.<\/p>\n<p>So what about benefits?<\/p>\n<h3>What is a Benefit?<\/h3>\n<p>Benefits are the outcomes or results that users will (hopefully) experience by using your product or service \u2013 the very reason why a prospective customer becomes an actual customer.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/features-vs-benefits-umbrella-example-1.png\" alt=\"features vs benefits\" width=\"1920\" height=\"801\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via WebEngage Monk<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Although it might seem counterintuitive, consumers rarely want to buy things for the sake of buying them \u2013 <strong>they want to solve their problems<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>To borrow from the example above, a feature of this particular umbrella might be its unbreakable spokes or wind-resistant construction \u2013 the benefit of which is staying dry even in strong winds that might break lesser umbrellas.<\/p>\n<p>Admittedly, the waters can get a little muddy when it comes to aspirational or lifestyle-based products or services, as the \u201cproblems\u201d that drive motivation to purchase such products are often less tangible (think \u201cbeing perceived more favorably\u201d by purchasing clothing or accessories by a certain designer, for example), but generally this concept holds water.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/features-vs-benefits-ipod-example.png\" alt=\"Features vs benefits iPod example\" width=\"575\" height=\"350\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via Help Scout<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Essentially, benefits can be thought of as the primary reason a customer would choose to buy whatever you\u2019re selling.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR \u2013 a feature is what something <em>is<\/em>, and a benefit is what users can\u00a0<em>do or accomplish\u00a0<\/em>with it.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>Why Are Features and Benefits Often Confused?<\/h2>\n<p>As with so much of marketing, the main reason why so many businesses confuse features and benefits comes back to intent.<\/p>\n<p>Marketers often spend a great deal of time in the weeds examining common problems experienced by their target markets. As such, it\u2019s easy for marketers to forget that, to the layperson, the benefits of using their product may not be immediately obvious.<\/p>\n<p>Put another way, <strong>just because <em>you<\/em> know why your product will make your ideal customer\u2019s life better doesn\u2019t mean <em>they<\/em> do.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Another common misstep marketers make is equating the time and effort that went into developing a new feature with its importance to consumers. As harsh as it may sound, most people don\u2019t care about you, your company, or how many late nights your engineering team pulled to ship a product \u2013 all they care about is themselves.<\/p>\n<p>This is why entry-level salespeople are often told to remember the \u201cfive magic words\u201d when cold-calling prospects: What\u2019s in it for me? This question is never far from a customer\u2019s mind, and it should inform almost every single aspect of your marketing strategies.<\/p>\n<h2>Using a Feature-Benefit Matrix<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re a marketer, the chances are pretty decent that you\u2019ve come across the term \u201cfeature-benefit matrix.\u201d Despite sounding suspiciously like one of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/23\/marketing-buzzwords\">those godawful buzzwords<\/a> that so many marketers are seemingly obsessed with, feature-benefit matrices are actually really useful documents.<\/p>\n<p>Feature-benefit matrices help marketers ensure their messaging is consistent, relevant, and accessible to end-users. These documents are often formatted as grids, with one column for features, several more for benefits, and additional columns for specific messaging data points or calls-to-action.<\/p>\n<p>This can all sound horribly confusing and abstract if you\u2019ve never seen one, so let\u2019s take a look:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/features-vs-benefits-matrix.png\" alt=\"Features vs benefits matrix example\" width=\"890\" height=\"489\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As you can see, there is space in the left-hand column for the various features of your product, in this example listed 1-5. Next, we see three columns (\u201cBenefit A\u201d, \u201cBenefit B\u201d and \u201cBenefit C\u201d), where you can then add three benefits of each feature. Finally, in the right-hand column, there\u2019s room for your various calls-to-action.<\/p>\n<p>Using this format of feature-benefit matrix can help you quickly and easily identify each of the unique benefits offered by your product\u2019s features. This, in turn, can make overall message mapping a lot easier, and ensures that not only marketing but other teams such as product are on the same page in terms of what is being communicated to end-users.<\/p>\n<p>There are plenty of other feature-benefit matrix formats, but the example above is a great place to start if you\u2019ve never used one before.<\/p>\n<h2>Examples of Feature-Driven Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>So, with all that tiresome theory out of the way, let\u2019s take a look at some examples of marketing messaging from both a feature and benefit perspective. First up, feature-driven marketing.<\/p>\n<h3>Automotive Marketing<\/h3>\n<p>Ads for new cars are about as aspirational as it gets. With big-ticket items like new cars, it\u2019s little wonder \u2013 after all, the benefits of owning a vehicle, such as reliable transportation, aren\u2019t terribly sexy or persuasive, regardless of how important they are. This is why so many car ads and marketing campaigns are inherently feature-driven (pun most definitely intended).<\/p>\n<p>This strategy can work well, if your product\u2019s features are genuinely innovative or exciting. This also works if the benefits of these features are obvious, as they often are in commercials for new cars.<\/p>\n<p>Take a look at the screenshot below, taken from the Infiniti website, which outlines the new motion-detection features of Infiniti\u2019s newer models:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/features-vs-benefits-car-ads.png\" alt=\"Features vs benefits car ad example\" width=\"1004\" height=\"610\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In the above image, you can see how Infiniti describes and illustrates its new camera technology and its applications when driving \u2013 but there\u2019s no mention of how this benefits the driver. This is because the benefits of the feature are implied; being able to see the environment surrounding the car from multiple angles makes it significantly easier to parallel park and avoid obstacles, improving overall safety. The reader doesn\u2019t need to be explicitly told how these features will benefit them.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of aspirational marketing\u2026<\/p>\n<h3>Consumer Electronics Marketing<\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to \u201clifestyle\u201d marketing, few industries do it better than the consumer electronics vertical. Mobile devices live and die by their features, and the enormous popularity of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/shortcuts\/2014\/jul\/21\/unboxing-youtube-phenomenon-videos-unpackaging-toys\">\u201cunboxing\u201d videos on YouTube<\/a> (a surprisingly large online subculture that began with toys before moving on to consumer electronics) tells us that feature-driven marketing can work wonders \u2013 if done well.<\/p>\n<p>Few companies in the world understand this concept better than Apple, which has taken the art and science of feature-driven marketing to a whole new level during the past 10 years.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/features-vs-benefits-iphone.png\" alt=\"Features vs benefits iPhone features\" width=\"1119\" height=\"559\" \/><\/div>\n<p>They may be slimmer, lighter, and generally \u201csexier\u201d (if you\u2019re comfortable applying this kind of label to a phone), but today\u2019s iPhone 7 is largely identical to its much older predecessors. After all, a smartphone is a smartphone \u2013 there\u2019s only so much they can do, and genuine differences between iterations are few. However, this is where the genius of Apple\u2019s primarily feature-driven approach to marketing comes into play.<\/p>\n<p>With each iteration of its flagship device, Apple has continually improved the core specifications of the iPhone to make them increasingly powerful without compromising on Apple\u2019s unique design sensibilities. This makes the difference between a dual-core 1.4 GHz ARM v8 Typhoon processor (iPhone 6) and a 64-bit A10 Fusion chip with an embedded M10 motion coprocessor (iPhone 7) a <em>very<\/em> big deal to Apple aficionados.<\/p>\n<p>Apple may state how much faster its device is in some of its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/04\/marketing-collateral\">marketing collateral<\/a>, but generally speaking, it\u2019s the features, and not the benefits, that matter in this business.<\/p>\n<h2>Benefit-Driven Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>So, now that we\u2019ve seen how product features can take center-stage in a marketing campaign, let\u2019s look at some examples of benefit-driven marketing.<\/p>\n<h3>Software-as-a-Service Marketing<\/h3>\n<p>The Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, industry has become enormous in recent years. As software companies have migrated away from one-time license purchasing models toward subscription-based agreements, many developers have also shifted toward benefit-driven marketing messaging.<\/p>\n<p>Slack is an excellent example of this principle in action. The remarkably popular communications platform may offer a range of handy tools and features that streamline team-based communication, but the real selling point is the time-savings it offers.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/features-vs-benefits-slack-productivity.png\" alt=\"Features vs benefits Slack productivity statistics\" width=\"921\" height=\"478\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Some pretty compelling data for people who hate emails and meetings\u2026<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Much of Slack\u2019s messaging focuses on how the product can help increase productivity and transparency, a clearly defined benefit-driven approach. Yes, its features page outlines all the cool things Slack can do, but if you\u2019re considering adopting a new communications platform, information like that in the graphs above are what you\u2019re really looking for.<\/p>\n<p>WordStream also uses this principle in its messaging. Yes, we\u2019re proud of the functionality and features offered by our products, but we also know that prospective customers want to know how our software can help them, which is why this messaging features prominently throughout our site.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/features-vs-benefits-wordstream-advisor.png\" alt=\"Features vs benefits WordStream marketing messaging\" width=\"486\" height=\"500\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Many SaaS companies use benefits-driven messaging in their campaigns because, as with all service-based businesses, they know that people don\u2019t patronize these kinds of businesses for its own sake, but <strong>because they want to solve specific problems<\/strong>. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll often see SaaS companies combining feature-driven information with benefits-driven messaging. This allows SaaS companies to simultaneously highlight the features of their products and explain how these features will make users\u2019 lives better.<\/p>\n<h3>Financial Services Marketing<\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to benefits-driven marketing, few industries are more keenly aware of its importance than the financial services sector. Nobody opens an account with a bank because of its branding \u2013 they do so because of the benefits they will receive, whether it be cash-back rewards programs or lower APRs on their credit card balances.<\/p>\n<p>Mobile payments company Square (a subsidiary of American Express, an important point we\u2019ll come back to momentarily) exemplifies this principle excellently. Essentially, Square allows small businesses to accept credit card payments \u2013 it\u2019s that simple. Of course, this service is positioned in such a way that focuses almost entirely on user-focused benefits, as we see throughout Square\u2019s site:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/features-vs-benefits-square-mobile-payments.png\" alt=\"Features vs benefits Square mobile payments\" width=\"965\" height=\"514\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This is another great example of combining product feature information with benefits-driven messaging. The copy featured throughout Square\u2019s site uses a lot of strong, active verbs, combined with punchy, urgent messaging that emphasizes the product\u2019s ease of use and the benefits it offers.<\/p>\n<h3>A Brief Note on Trust Signals as Benefits<\/h3>\n<p>A moment ago, I mentioned that Square being a subsidiary organization of American Express is important. This is because, similarly to the implied benefits of the features highlighted in the automotive ad example above, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/27\/trust-signals\">trust signals<\/a> can also be extraordinarily effective when positioned as implied benefits.<\/p>\n<p>Think of it this way \u2013 would you rather entrust your business\u2019 ability to process vital credit card payments to a scrappy startup staffed by a handful of computer science graduates subletting a basement office somewhere in the Valley, or to a company owned by one of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/features-vs-benefits-trust-signals.png\" alt=\"Featurs vs benefits trust signal logos\" width=\"600\" height=\"153\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This principle is often utilized to great effect in the travel and hospitality industries. Name recognition is extremely important when purchasing big-ticket items such as a vacation package, and although brand-name association isn\u2019t a specific customer benefit in itself, it does imply the tangential benefit of the experience and resources that large, well-known brands like airlines and credit card companies can offer that smaller companies often cannot. This is why accreditations from organizations such as the Better Business Bureau are so coveted (even if actual membership benefits vary widely).<\/p>\n<h2>Features vs. Benefits in Ad Copy<\/h2>\n<p>By now, it should be clear that focusing on the benefits of your products or services can be significantly more effective than highlighting its features. But how does this translate when it comes to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/14\/ppc-ad-copywriting\">ad copy<\/a>, the vital first step in securing new business for many advertisers?<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at two real ads to illustrate how focusing on benefits can be much more powerful than highlighting features.<\/p>\n<p>Both of the following ads were served to me after entering the search query \u201cbookkeeping software\u201d into Google (using an Incognito browsing session to eliminate as much unique browsing identity information as possible). Here\u2019s the first ad:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/features-vs-benefits-bookkeeping-ad-1.png\" alt=\"Features vs benefits ad example 1\" width=\"622\" height=\"154\" \/><\/div>\n<p>QuickBooks is definitely one of the best-known bookkeeping software solutions available on the market. However, there\u2019s very little branding going on in this ad, missing an opportunity to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/03\/19\/why-bid-on-branded-terms-ppc\">leverage potential brand-name recognition<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The headline also needs work. Personally, I\u2019m not looking to \u201ccompare product features\u201d because this immediately suggests that there\u2019s even more work to be done on my part to find a product that meets my needs.<\/p>\n<p>The first line of ad text isn\u2019t particularly compelling, either \u2013 I\u2019d expect all bookkeeping software to \u201cmanage my business in one place\u201d, at least in this context \u2013 nor is the copy urging me to \u201cGet a 30-Day Trial\u201d or \u201cSign Up Now!\u201d The trust signal in the second line of copy isn\u2019t especially persuasive, either.<\/p>\n<p>Now let\u2019s take a look at another ad:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/features-vs-benefits-bookkeeping-ad-2.png\" alt=\"Features vs benefits ad example 2\" width=\"532\" height=\"116\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Paychex is another major player in the bookkeeping software space, something that the headline reinforces by including the brand name in the copy, alongside its promises to help users \u201cAccomplish More\u201d. Also, the inclusion of the adjective \u201cEffortless\u201d in the headline is a very strong start.<\/p>\n<p>However, it\u2019s the actual ad copy itself we\u2019re most interested in. Take a look \u2013 six of the eight points outlined in the ad copy are benefits-driven, emphasizing the ease of use that Paychex offers, the availability of its customer support, and the security of the product, among other benefits. In the interests of fairness, the trust signal beneath the main copy of this ad isn\u2019t that persuasive, either, but that doesn\u2019t matter as much in this example, as the ad has already focused on the benefits that could potentially entice prospects into clicking through.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that without actual conversion data, it\u2019s impossible to know which of these two ads is most effective \u2013 the ad for QuickBooks may well convert like gangbusters. However, from a purely theoretical perspective, it\u2019s difficult to deny that Paychex\u2019s ad is significantly more compelling <strong>because it focuses primarily on the common problems that users are likely looking to solve <\/strong>and uses <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/08\/persuasive-landing-pages\">persuasive language<\/a> to appeal to users\u2019 desire to solve these problems.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/features-vs-benefits-ab-testing.jpg\" alt=\"Features vs benefits A\/B testing example\" width=\"640\" height=\"347\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If you\u2019re not sure whether a feature- or benefits-driven approach is right for your campaigns, conduct <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/06\/16\/ab-testing-tips\">statistically significant A\/B tests<\/a> and let your users tell you what they want \u2013 then act accordingly.<\/p>\n<h2>Marketing Campaigns (with Benefits)<\/h2>\n<p>As we\u2019ve seen, feature-based marketing can \u2013 and does \u2013 work well for certain businesses and product lines. However, for many small businesses, identifying and highlighting how their products and services can improve the lives of their customers is often a much more powerful strategy, from the very first ad of a campaign to the copy used on a website.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless, if you remember the Five Magic Words \u2013 \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s hard to go wrong with your messaging and positioning. As always, get at me in the comments with ideas or examples of campaigns that get this important distinction right.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to features versus benefits, what&#8217;s the difference and why does it matter?
