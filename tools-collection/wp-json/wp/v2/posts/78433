Here are some tips on creating marketing proposals that win over clients.<\/p>\n<h3>Do your prep work<\/h3>\n<p>The proposal should come after a thorough discovery session where you get all of the information you need. Take detailed notes so your proposal doesn\u2019t just satisfy their needs, but reflects that you listen carefully and care about and will cater to their individual preferences.<\/p>\n<p>Information to gather in the discovery session:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Goals and challenges (short and long-term)<\/li>\n<li>The problem and the source of the problem<\/li>\n<li>Past\/existing strategies\/successes\/failures (including other agencies)<\/li>\n<li>Existing metrics\/What will success look like<\/li>\n<li>Priorities<\/li>\n<li>Emotions involved (frustrations, desires, pain points)<\/li>\n<li>The personalities and work styles of the client\u2019s team members<\/li>\n<li>Their timeline, budget, stakeholders<\/li>\n<li>Their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">target audience<\/a>, brand messaging, and customer journey<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Do additional research<\/h3>\n<p>Your client knows their business best, but you should still do additional research both before and after the discovery session. Gather as much as you can about the client before the session so you can demonstrate your diligence, alleviate them from having to educate you, and free up more time for the more nuanced details.<\/p>\n<p>Do research after the session, on the market, competition, and anything pertinent to the session. This will allow you to add stats and examples to your proposal that can strengthen your case and further <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-demonstrate-value-to-your-customers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">demonstrate your value<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Make it easy to read and visual<\/h3>\n<p>This is the same tip I give for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usehatchapp.com\/blog\/hvac-service-contract-templates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">service businesses in their service contracts<\/a>. Don\u2019t write in complex or formal language to try and impress your client! Keep it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/05\/conversational-tone\">conversational <\/a>and easy to read. Use terms they use, and constantly refer back to the problems and goals they are focused on. Also, visualize wherever you can, such as with timelines:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/marketing-proposal-timeline.webp\" alt=\"how to write a marketing proposal - example of timelines in marketing proposal\" width=\"936\" height=\"545\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-78447\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/marketing-proposal-timeline.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/marketing-proposal-timeline-480x279.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Keep it client-focused<\/h3>\n<p>While a marketing proposal is an opportunity to show your value and set yourself apart from competitors, it needs to stay focused on the client, not you. Any time you highlight something great about your business, be sure to connect it back to what value that provides for the clent.<\/p>\n<h3>Walk through it with them<\/h3>\n<p>Don\u2019t just email the proposal over to your client. Set a time to meet and walk through it together. This will ensure the proposal communicates the information and messaging that you intended and ensures the client sees the details in your work. You can then send the proposal after the meeting and give them time to digest it, think it over, and come up with any other questions before signing.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteGrowYourMarketingAgency.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Agency_StrategiestoGrowYourAgency_Download\">The 6 Absolute Best Strategies to Grow Your Digital Marketing Agency<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"marketing-proposal-templates\"><\/div>\n<h2>Marketing proposal templates<\/h2>\n<p>Here are some marketing proposal templates from a range of resources, including marketing agencies, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/07\/proposal-generator\">online proposal generators<\/a>, and marketing blogs.<\/p>\n<h3>1.
