By developing honest and meaningful relationships, you are hoping to avoid these poor reviews altogether\u2014but that might not be the only way reviews are helpful.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/learn.g2crowd.com\/customer-reviews-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">G2Crowd<\/a>, 94% of customers read online reviews. With the majority of customers reading reviews, a negative review can be devastating. However, 72% of B2B buyers say negative reviews give depth and insight into a product.<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/b2b-vs-b2b-marketing-reviews.png\" alt=\"b2b vs b2c marketing - stat about negative reviews\" width=\"669\" height=\"366\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-59320\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/b2b-vs-b2b-marketing-reviews.png 669w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/b2b-vs-b2b-marketing-reviews-480x263.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 669px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Wait, bad reviews may result in a positive? Yes! When a website only has positive results, they can come across as fake and untrustworthy. Remember, even the best of the best have some haters out there. By <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-respond-to-google-reviews-with-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">responding to negative and positive reviews<\/a>, you can tweak your approach to business accordingly. Further, you are able to show the reviewer you truly care and that you are a real person responding to the needs and opinions of customers.<\/p>\n<h3>B2C marketing builds transactional relationships<\/h3>\n<p>The goal of B2C marketing is to push consumers to products on your company\u2019s website and drive sales. To do this, the customer needs to have a near-perfect customer experience with your website.<\/p>\n<p>Ever heard the phrase \u201ctime is money\u201d?<\/p>\n<p>B2C businesses value efficiency and, therefore, minimize the amount of time spent getting to know the customer, which ultimately causes the relationship to become transactional. This doesn&#8217;t mean the relationship can&#8217;t be personalized. But it will not involve direct communication between customer and business.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/b2b-vs-b2c-marketing-personalized-marketing.png\" alt=\"b2b vs b2c marketing - personalized gift\" width=\"400\" height=\"659\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-59322\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/b2b-vs-b2c-marketing-personalized-marketing.png 400w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/b2b-vs-b2c-marketing-personalized-marketing-182x300.png 182w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>B2C businesses can and should practice hyper-personalized marketing, but not all practices are scalable for every customer.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The marketing strategy focuses on selling the product, and the majority of time here is on delivering high-quality products at the quickest rate possible.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike reviews in B2B business, reviews are buried by an influx of high-quality, positive reviews.

At the top of the conversion funnel, a B2C marketer must be able to create influential advertisements that give the consumer the need for a product.<\/p>\n<p>Once the consumer has identified a need, they already have a clear understanding of what kind of product they are looking to purchase. Unlike B2B businesses, consumers are much more flexible when looking at a specific product to buy.<\/p>\n<p>As a marketer, it is essential that you continue to appeal to the consumer and ways to get them what they\u2019re looking for by simplifying the decision-making process. Unless the consumer has made a firm decision to purchase your product, often they look at your competitors to see if they can get similar products quicker and for a better deal.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/b2b-vs-b2b-marketing-beauty-dupes_0.png\" alt=\"beauty sponge dupes\" width=\"625\" height=\"415\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Beauty blender dupes via <a href=\"https:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/essencegant\/makeup-dupes-way-cheaper-than-your-faves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buzzfeed<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>As a search marketer, it is essential to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">identify focus keywords<\/a> that a consumer will search for when looking for similar products and try to rank for those keywords. The higher you rank, the closer you are to bringing customers back to your site.<\/p>\n<p>When evaluating the conversion funnel, we see three sets of keywords we can potentially go after to grab their attention.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if the customer wants to learn more about electric bikes, they may search for the long-tail variation of the keyword \u201celectric bikes\u201d such as \u201c<strong><em>what is an electric bike<\/em><\/strong>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Once the customer learns about the electric bike, they may want to learn about electric bike brands that are trustworthy and high-quality. So, they will search \u201c<strong><em>best electric bikes<\/em><\/strong>\u201d next.<\/p>\n<p>Once they search through the various brands, they may find the exact brand they want to purchase from, and now they are ready to buy. So, they search \u201c<strong><em>[insert brand] electric bike<\/em><\/strong>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As a B2C search marketer, make sure that all of these portions of the conversion funnel are covered and targeted by blogs, core pages, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/06\/01\/product-pages\">product pages<\/a> so you have a higher chance of capturing potential customers in the space.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, as solid as your conversion funnel is, if your checkout process is confusing, it can turn your customers away and leave room for others to steal them. Optimize your conversion funnels, minimize the complexity of these processes, and work toward the conversions you\u2019re looking for.<\/p>\n<h2>B2B vs B2C marketing: Audience targeting<\/h2>\n<p>While B2B marketing involves finding a niche for audience targeting, B2C marketing is a little more funnel-focused.<\/p>\n<h3>B2B: Find your niche<\/h3>\n<p>B2B businesses usually work in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/28\/niche-marketing\">niche market,<\/a> and it is imperative to understand your target audience\u2019s demographic. To effectively attract them, compile and analyze accurate data.<\/p>\n<p>Your data focus can come in numerous forms, both qualitative and quantitative. Some of the more effective tactics for data collection is through Google Analytics and keyword research. <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/b2b-vs-b2c-marketing-how-to-find-your-target-audience-infographic.png\" alt=\"b2b vs b2c marketing - target audience\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-59328\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/b2b-vs-b2c-marketing-how-to-find-your-target-audience-infographic.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/b2b-vs-b2c-marketing-how-to-find-your-target-audience-infographic-480x640.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.launchwithrika.com\/how-to-find-your-target-audience\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/p>\n<p>You can also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/18\/beginners-guide-to-target-markets\">determine who your target audience is<\/a> by going to Google and evaluating the search engine results pages for your keywords.<\/p>\n<p>By actively going through the SERP and seeing what the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/26\/intent-marketing\">user\u2019s intent<\/a> for certain keywords is, you are able to infer what kinds of searches certain people are performing.

Search marketers heavily weigh the importance of following the marketing funnel when acquiring customers.<\/p>\n<p>Starting at the top of the funnel, pushing advertisements that are skewed toward emotional and product-driven purchases can cast a wide net and try to gain some qualified top-of-funnel leads. By analyzing the demographics of the top-of-funnel leads, you can create a warm lead list and remarket to those people in hopes to generate sales from those leads.<\/p>\n<p>Another critical audience targeting strategy emphasized in B2C is the implementation of highly effective <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/24\/pop-ups-vs-chatbots\">CRO tactics<\/a>. Writing enticing copy, creating quality and easy landing pages to navigate, and implementing simple but effective conversion funnels can change the sales game in B2C business.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/b2b-vs-b2c-marketing-funnels-compared.png\" alt=\"b2b vs b2c marketing funnels compared\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-59329\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/b2b-vs-b2c-marketing-funnels-compared.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/b2b-vs-b2c-marketing-funnels-compared-480x270.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.vmgstudios.com\/b2b-vs-b2c-sales-funnel-convert\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>B2B vs B2C marketing: Ad copy<\/h2>\n<p>In B2B marketing, ad copy tends to use the terms their clients are familiar with, while in B2C marketing, ad copy can be more playfuland emotional.<\/p>\n<h3>B2B: Learn the lingo<\/h3>\n<p>B2B businesses are much more likely to want to purchase services or products from an expert who understands their terminology, processes, and even the decisions they have to make during the buying process.<\/p>\n<p>So, to reach your target audience, speak their language!<\/p>\n<p>For example, a B2B business that sells a $50,000 piece of software does not focus on writing fluffy copy that entices the reader to purchase their software on impulse.
