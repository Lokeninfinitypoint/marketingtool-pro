To separate the most-probably from the pipe dreams, I dove into the data and came up with some ideas as to what lies ahead.<\/p>\n<p>And so, without further ado, I present to you my eight data-backed PPC predictions for 2018!<\/p>\n<h2>#1. Facebook Ads Expand Beyond Your Social Feed<\/h2>\n<p>One thing should immediately stick out in the industry from the past year \u2013 Facebook\u2019s growth is truly explosive. The ad platform added 4 million new advertisers in just 18 months, effectively doubling the network, and it\u2019s posed to keep growing in 2018!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a0efb7c8-e6b8-49ec-b9f6-aa7d69585f72\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-advertising-revenue-growth-yoy.png\" alt=\"facebook advertising growth metrics 2018\" width=\"1058\" height=\"341\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>But there\u2019s ultimately a cap on the number of ads they can serve users while they scroll through their social feeds, which is why Facebook has been growing beyond just Facebook.com.<\/p>\n<p>In 2015, the company made Messenger a standalone platform, and very late in 2017, Facebook introduced a way to monetize the new app with <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/31\/facebook-messenger-ads\">Messenger ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c8a40c6f-8bb2-4b60-bb27-6cf5a4c1f978\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-messenger-ads-2018-useful.png\" alt=\"facebook messenger ad 2018\" width=\"401\" height=\"656\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Now we as we\u2019re seeing Instagram looking to break their messaging equivalent Instagram Direct into a separate app, we should expect Instagram Direct ads to follow suite with ad similar ads.<\/p>\n<p>But Facebook\u2019s ad opportunities are even greater beyond their current flagship products. Over the years, Facebook has acquired 65(!) companies \u2013 and the tech giant has invested in everything from Fitness Tracking and Speech recognition to Rural communications.<\/p>\n<p>Consider their $19 Billion purchase of WhatsApp in 2014. WhatsApp has over 1 Billion active users and is the most popular messaging application of all time. WhatsApp currently doesn\u2019t support any kind of advertising and once said it never would. But recently, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MattNavarra\/status\/906195063562268672\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Matt Navarra<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/09\/08\/whatsapp-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TechCrunch<\/a> discovered that within the Facebook ad manager code, there was hints that WhatsApp message ads may be in our near future!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"22517895-feb6-44c4-8504-2950db2639df\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/2018-whatsap-message-ads.png\" alt=\"whatsap messaging 2018\" width=\"680\" height=\"72\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Facebook\u2019s other major acquisition of 2014, Oculus VR, may also allow Facebook to break out of your social feeds into the fast-growing Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality space in 2018.<\/p>\n<h2>#2. An Explosion of New Search Ad Formats and Extensions<\/h2>\n<p>If 2017 taught us anything, it\u2019s that Google isn\u2019t happy coasting off its flagship search ads. Last year, AdWords retired the standard text ad it had relied on for 16 years to give advertisers more space with their <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/26\/expanded-text-ad-best-practices\">expanded text ads.<\/a> Google knew that even if search isn\u2019t going anywhere, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/14\/evolved-text-ads\">search was certainly evolving<\/a> and how we advertisers answer searchers&#8217; questions needs to evolve too.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2196fad6-5b82-49f7-b5de-8d6bf0686848\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/2018-search-ad-formats-new-ad-extensions.png\" alt=\"new ad formats coming to adwords 2018\" width=\"671\" height=\"938\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Through the year, Google has improved their <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/04\/google-shopping-campaigns-tips-tricks\">shopping ads<\/a> to cater towards people differently. Shopping ads remain a staple in any ecommerce advertisers\u2019 campaigns, but late in 2017, Google started serving <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/17\/showcase-shopping-ads\">Shopping Showcase Ads<\/a> to people casually searching for top of the funnel, non-branded product searches. Google may soon also allow for people who are ready to purchase to convert via a \u201c<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/08\/purchases-on-google\">Buy on Google<\/a>\u201d extension directly on the SERP!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1955034d-6521-441c-937d-9c50b105b2b5\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-food-ordering-map-ads.png\" alt=\"google food ordering map ads\" width=\"722\" height=\"529\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>How we connect with customers via search ads has been evolving quickly too. Google enabled <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2011\/10\/06\/google-adwords-call-extensions\">call extensions<\/a> in 2011 allowing us to place a call directly from the SERP. Four years later, Google enabled advertisers more control over how they drive calls to their business with <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/11\/11\/call-only-campaigns\">call-only ads<\/a> and then two years later enabled <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/25\/new-adwords-experience-features\">call bid adjustments.<\/a> In 2016, Google allowed us to connect to our customers via text with <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/19\/adwords-message-extensions\">message extensions<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The next era of communication from our search ads may be with <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/04\/chatbots\">chatbots<\/a>, as it appears that some brands are experimenting with <a href=\"https:\/\/advertise.bingads.microsoft.com\/en-us\/blog\/post\/september-2017\/microsoft-leverages-ai-to-create-intelligent-solutions-for-advertisers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new chatbot extensions<\/a> per a late 2017 Bing Ads post.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2058aba5-c0d6-49c5-b7ca-9f2bb1178600\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-local-service-ads-2018.png\" alt=\"adwords local service ads\" width=\"781\" height=\"371\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>How Google Ads connects us to businesses is also likely to change in 2018. In 2015, Google <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/30\/local-service-provider-ad-format\">began testing local service ads<\/a> for plumbers and locksmiths in the San Francisco Bay Area. Over the years, Google has tested local service ads in more markets across the United States and for other services such as HVAC, Electricians, Garage Door, Carpet Cleaning, Towing, and even Tutoring and Maid Services!<\/p>\n<p>As Google irons out legalities and liabilities to these services, you should expect them to become readily available to advertisers of all sizes in different local service industries in the US and abroad. Using <a href=\"https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/simple_image\/public\/images\/voice-search-ads-2018-adwords.gif?VIyEvgJfGA0431f8H5sKhQOdQcFQEesC&amp;itok=u2-MZzpf\">these ads<\/a>, searchers can find and directly book appointments through the SERP on desktop, mobile, and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.blog.google\/products\/assistant\/get-local-help-from-your-google-assistant\/\">even via Voice Search.<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>#3. Voice Search Goes Mainstream<\/h2>\n<p>Google advertises for its own products \u2013 a lot, in fact. If you\u2019re paying close attention, you\u2019ll realize that Google\u2019s ads are never specifically about search. Instead, Google advertises its personal assistant app, or its assistant powered Android phones, or its assistant powered Google Home devices.<\/p>\n<p>The subtle push to get people searching more has been effective \u2013 on Friday, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blog.google\/products\/assistant\/how-google-home-and-google-assistant-helped-you-get-more-done-in-2017\/\">Google announced<\/a> that over 400 million devices are enabled with Google Assistant. For perspective, the US population is 323 million, so Google Assistants outnumber us! Add in Alexa, Cortana, and Siri enabled devices and it\u2019s clear that Voice Search is more than just a passing fad. In 2017, 20% of all search occurs via voice search rather than a typed query, and ComScore estimates that by 2020, more than 50% of all search will be driven by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/04\/10\/voice-search-statistics-2018\">voice search<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/14\/google-voice-search\">Optimizing for Voice Search<\/a> will require a new search strategy. Knowing that people\u2019s natural language is different from their typed queries, you\u2019ll need to prep your content and your ads to answer their questions, rather than match their keywords. Have your content answer questions people will naturally ask their devices such as \u201cWho\u201d, \u201cWhen\u201d, \u201cWhere\u201d and \u201cHow\u201d as they complete their searches.<\/p>\n<p>Structured data will also be preferred over semantic data. If you ask your Google device \u201cWhere can I buy a copy of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban?\u201d it won\u2019t show you the nearest answer or even the cheapest \u2013 but it will show you the answer that Google can find the easiest, and that will likely be in an advertisers <a href=\"https:\/\/affiliate.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/09\/06\/new-google-merchant-center\">merchant feed<\/a> or serving a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/01\/google-maps-local-search-ads\">local inventory ad<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>#4. The Rise of Visual Search<\/h2>\n<p>Visual search may sound new and experimental to many advertisers, but Pinterest actually grew their platform almost entirely as a visual search engine. Pinterest may not the largest search engine, but it\u2019s effectively grown a monopoly on visual search and more than doubled their revenue each year in the past 2 years!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3e3e5ea5-102a-41fb-826d-8b7d49010fe6\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/2018-pinterest-ad-growth.png\" alt=\"2017 pinterest ad revenue growth\" width=\"736\" height=\"344\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Visual search is something that\u2019s clearly caught the attention of the big search engines, as both Google and Bing are beginning to play with the feature.

Search Audiences Replace Search Keywords<\/h2>\n<p>The keyword isn\u2019t dead \u2013 but it\u2019s no longer what controls your paid search. In 2014, we saw keywords lose their meaning when <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/15\/rip-exact-match\">close variants were automatically introduced<\/a> and then again in 2017 we saw <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/20\/exact-match-keywords\">exact match type keywords<\/a> serve to additional queries including reordered words with functional words added or removed. The keyword is no longer the best way to control who sees our ads \u2013 but audience targeting may replace it.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s been slowly expanding its offering of audience solutions over the years \u2013 first allowing us to target returning visitors with <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/12\/remarketing-lists-for-search-ads\">Remarketing Lists of Search Ads<\/a>, then our customer lists with <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/11\/02\/adwords-customer-match-setup\">Customer Match<\/a> (first by matching users email addresses, but now by <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/28\/customer-match-phone-number-address\">phone number and address<\/a> as well), and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/25\/similar-audiences-for-search-campaigns\">similar audiences for search campaigns<\/a>.

Although Google and Facebook are both making efforts to prevent this kind of content from serving ads in the future, in an age of increased automation it\u2019s unlikely that the situation is destined to get better.

New Bing Ad Targeting May Outpower AdWords<\/h2>\n<p>Google\u2019s strong hold on the search market and Facebook\u2019s fast growth have many saying the two companies are effectively making the digital advertising market a duopoly. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/the-race-is-on-to-challenge-google-facebook-duopoly-in-digital-advertising-1497864602\">Wall Street Journal<\/a> estimates that 77 cents of every new digital advertising dollar in 2017 was spent on either a Google or Facebook property.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"e1ae8071-54db-484d-98db-a2e6919d235e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/new-bing-ad-targeting-2018-1.jpg\" alt=\"new bing ad features in 2018\" width=\"750\" height=\"340\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Although the digital marketing industry is currently booming, duopolies seldom are efficient markets and generally hinder new growth. In order for a new competitor to rise, they usually need to be willing to drop considerable resources in technology capital to compete. So all eyes are on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.visualcapitalist.com\/chart-5-tech-giants-make-billions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the other 3 largest tech companies<\/a> to rise in the market \u2013 Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/15\/apple-innovations-for-sems\">Apple has put some investment in advertising,<\/a> but they\u2019re unlikely to compete with Google at that level. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/11\/amazon-advertising\">Amazon advertising<\/a> has grown recently, but most of Amazon\u2019s revenue still comes from product sales.<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft may be our best change to compete against Google and Facebook. Although Bing is certainly an underdog, it does reach a surprisingly large 35.6% market share of the US Search Market. The preferred search engine of Microsoft\u2019s own products (Windows, Edge, Office, Skype, Xbox) as well as the preferred search engine of Amazon\u2019s Alexa \u2013 Bing can certainly compete in a growing voice search market.<\/p>\n<p>But Bing\u2019s real power might be in another Microsoft product \u2013 LinkedIn. In 2016, Microsoft bought LinkedIn for $26 Billion and invested in it a lot since. Similar to Microsoft\u2019s Bing, however, the largest professional social network is still definitely in Facebook\u2019s shadow.<\/p>\n<p>Where Microsoft could steal the show, however, is if they were to partner their search and social networks together. PPC pros already know that advertising on both search &amp; social can improve both the performance on both networks and even increase the number of repeat visitors and branded searches. But where Bing would really shine is if it were possible to leverage LinkedIn\u2019s ad targeting directly on the SERP.
