When you\u2019re competing in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/articles\/what-is-google-adwords\">the Google Ads auction<\/a>, you\u2019re assigned an Ad Rank based on your bid and your Quality Score.

In other words, if you achieve the top ad position (1) in a given <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/24\/goal-talk-episode-7\">auction<\/a>, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that your ad is showing at the top of the SERP. It could very well be showing under the organic search results.<\/p>\n<p>As such, your <strong>average position<\/strong> doesn\u2019t tell you the whole story in terms of where your Search ads are showing. Certainly, this caveat has caused business owners and account managers alike some confusion.<\/p>\n<p>First, let\u2019s talk about why Google Ads is doing this. Then, we\u2019ll dive into some of the reactions from WordStream employees and other PPC experts. We\u2019ll wrap up with some perspective and a couple action items.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Why is average position going away?<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In short: because Google doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a terribly useful metric anymore.<\/p>\n<p>Accordingly, last November, Google Ads rolled out a suite of new metrics pertaining to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/articles\/ultimate-quality-score-guide\">auction performance<\/a> and SERP visibility:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Top impression rate<\/strong> tells you the percentage of your total impressions that are coming from the top of the SERP (above the organic results).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Top impression rate = Top impressions \/ Total impressions<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Absolute top impression rate<\/strong> tells you the percentage of your total impressions that are coming from the very top of the SERP.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Absolute top impression rate = Absolute top impressions \/ Total impressions<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Top impression share<\/strong> tells you the rate at which you\u2019re turning <em>opportunities<\/em> to appear at the top of the SERP into <em>actual impressions<\/em> at the top of the SERP.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>Top impression share = Top impressions \/ Eligible top impressions<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Absolute top impression share<\/strong> tells you the rate at which you\u2019re turning <em>opportunities<\/em> to appear at the very top of the SERP into <em>actual\u00a0impressions<\/em> at the very top of the SERP.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>Absolute top impression share = Absolute top impressions \/ Eligible absolute top impressions<\/em><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"9ba3247a-1e0e-4689-a998-3c546bbe15b2\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-sunsets-average-position-serp-final.jpg\" alt=\"google-sunsets-average-position-desktop-serp\" width=\"800\" height=\"595\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>Via Google.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/9263492\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announcement post<\/a>, Google Ads product manager Pallavi Naresh gave the following rationale for the decision: \u201cThese new metrics give you a much clearer view of your prominence on the page than average position does.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Having a clear idea of your prominence on the SERP is essential to making <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/11\/easy-adwords-bidding-strategies\">informed bidding decisions<\/a>. Evidently, Naresh and the rest of the team at Google think the four new metrics are more insightful as far as bidding strategy is concerned.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What do PPC experts think?<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Google is certain that these four new metrics are more insightful than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/14\/goodbye-average-position\">average position<\/a>, and the PPC community doesn\u2019t seem all that sad to see the\u00a0metric go\u2014for the most part. I spoke to some folks around the office to get their takes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is another step in Google Ads\u2019 shift to focusing on automated bidding strategies,\u201d said Holly Niemiec, a member of our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/marketing-services\">marketing services<\/a> team. \u201cBecause the goal of automated strategies is to get your ad wherever it has the best chance to convert\u2014versus owning the top of the SERP\u2014I think this decision reiterates the shift to automation and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/28\/google-ads\">away from AdWords<\/a>.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"efcc34bf-9eaf-44ee-831d-e13f098dbaaa\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-sunsets-average-position-target-roas.jpg\" alt=\"google-sunsets-average-position-target-roas-automated-bidding-strategy\" width=\"1308\" height=\"582\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>One of Google Ads\u2019 automated bidding strategies lets you target ROAS.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Holly\u2019s perspective falls somewhat in line with that of Frederick Vallaeys, who said the following in a <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/googles-next-chapter-for-metrics-to-focus-on-clarity-once-average-position-is-removed-312947#.XHWP4-OKnQI.twitter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Search Engine Land article<\/a>: \u201cNowadays, automated bidding is so ubiquitous and cheap that [manual] bid-to-position strategies simply don\u2019t make a lot of sense for the majority of advertisers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Courtney Charroux, a member of our Customer Success team, was <em>slightly<\/em> critical: \u201cI\u2019m an avid user of average position. I have a client in a very popular industry, and I like having those hard averages to identify\u00a0my success with the account and to know where I should adjust.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Note that Courtney shared this opinion in the context of a\u00a0particular client. She told me, broadly speaking, that she thinks Google Ads&#8217; impression-based metrics are, in fact, useful.<\/p>\n<p>Dave Thorsen, also from our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/marketing-services\">marketing services<\/a> team, finds average position useful\u2014as long as it\u2019s understood <strong>in conjunction with top impression share<\/strong>. \u201cOtherwise, average position is a relative metric, and you don\u2019t <em>really<\/em> know what it\u2019s relative to.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe Google Ads would get rid of such an important metric,\u201d said Kristina Simonson, who runs paid search and social campaigns on our own marketing team, \u201cuntil I realized I hadn\u2019t used it to assess performance in months.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe Google Ads would get rid of such an important metric\u2014until I realized I hadn\u2019t used it to assess performance in months.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Although, like Courtney and Dave, Kristina still finds value in average position, she knows she\u2019ll be able to rely on impression metrics when assessing performance.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to WordStream HQ, the PPC world has been buzzing since the announcement. Here\u2019s what <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PPCKirk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kirk Williams of ZATO Marketing<\/a> had to say, in line with Holly and Kristina:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"41358d46-8781-41c3-b016-d5d13f013fdb\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-sunsets-average-position-kirk-tweet-1.png\" alt=\"google-sunsets-average-position-kirk-williams\" width=\"606\" height=\"363\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bigalittlea\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Aaron Levy of Elite SEM<\/a> seems similarly unconcerned.

With six months to prepare and the ability to influence page placement with the Target Impression Share bidding strategy, Kamlyn is certain you\u2019ll emerge (relatively) unscathed.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What comes next?<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The consensus seems pretty clear.\u00a0Although average position has provided valuable insights to advertisers over the years, its impending removal from your Google Ads account is far from the end of the world.<\/p>\n<p>You hear this all the time\u2014and you\u2019re probably tired of hearing it\u2014but it\u2019s true: PPC is a constantly evolving method of advertising. And as plenty of people at WordStream and beyond have pointed out in the wake of this announcement, automation is becoming increasingly commonplace. The sunsetting of average position\u2014long leveraged for the sake of <em>manual<\/em> bidding strategy\u2014reflects that.<\/p>\n<p>Does that mean the days of account managers are numbered? Not at all. As useful as automation is, it\u2019s not a replacement\u2014it\u2019s a supplement. You won\u2019t be able to kick your feet up and let machines do all the heavy lifting any time soon.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some action items you can walk away with:<\/p>\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\n<li>If you find average position useful, continue to take advantage of it while you can. Every Google Ads account is different, and if you\u2019ve used average position to optimize your bids in the past, there\u2019s no reason that needs to change before September.<\/li>\n<li>Become more familiar with automated bidding strategies, particularly Target Impression Share. We have a complete guide to these strategies <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/19\/google-ads-automated-bidding\">here<\/a>. Your comfort with these will only become more important as time goes on.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/products?camplink=mainnavbar&amp;campname=OurSoftware\">a WordStream customer<\/a> and you\u2019re wondering how we\u2019ll adapt Advisor to reflect this change, don\u2019t worry. Taylor Chan, one of our product managers, told me this: \u201cWe\u2019re excited to adopt the newer Google Ads\u2019 metrics, given the deficiencies of average position. We\u2019re working on a solution that makes the most sense for our customers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Have any questions? Fire away!<\/p>\n<h2>Update: August\u00a02019<\/h2>\n<p>On August 12, 2019, Google <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/9439546\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced<\/a> that average position will officially retire on\u00a0<strong>Monday, September 30.\u00a0<\/strong>As of that date, you&#8217;ll no longer see the metric in your Google Ads account. More importantly, any rules, custom columns, or reports\u00a0using average position will be <strong>disabled<\/strong>. To compensate, you should adopt search top impression rate and search absolute top impression rate as your new metrics. Finally, be sure to review any scripts you&#8217;re running to make sure they don&#8217;t depend on average position.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google Ads will sunset the average position metric in September 2019.
