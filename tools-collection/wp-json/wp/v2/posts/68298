Expanded text ads finally meet their end...<\/h2>\n<p>Every marketer puts pride into crafting the perfect text ad, and for the past 22 years, advertisers have been manually writing, testing, and optimizing their PPC ads on Google. Over the years, Google\u2019s introduced several new search ad formats. In 2016, Google doubled the size of its standard text ads with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/25\/google-expanded-text-ads\">Expanded Text Ads<\/a>. And in 2018, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/22\/new-expanded-text-ads\">Expanded Text Ads grew even larger again<\/a>. But after several years of change, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/02\/google-sunsetting-expanded-text-ads\">Google finally killed off Expanded Text Ads in June, <\/a>no longer allowing advertisers to create the format that defined PPC advertising for years.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-retiring-expanded-text-ads-boooo-tweet.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"128\" class=\"size-full wp-image-50616 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-retiring-expanded-text-ads-boooo-tweet.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-retiring-expanded-text-ads-boooo-tweet-480x102.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Instead, Google\u2019s new default ad type is the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/10\/responsive-search-ads\">responsive search ad<\/a> (RSA), which allows advertisers to provide multiple different text assets for Google to piece together to build the ad that loads on the SERP for every search.<\/p>\n<p>This asset-driven and machine learning-powered ad format has considerable potential to serve over 40,000 unique variations of an ad with enough assets. But critics are quick to note that RSAs can create some poor combinations and may not always perform well. The change effectively limits brands\u2019 control of their ads\u2019 messages and testing processes on the SERP.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-sunsetting-expanded-text-ads-greg-finn-tweet.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"156\" class=\"size-full wp-image-50621 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-sunsetting-expanded-text-ads-greg-finn-tweet.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-sunsetting-expanded-text-ads-greg-finn-tweet-480x125.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Microsoft had planned to follow Google\u2019s change and end support for their Expanded Text Ad over the summer as well, but they\u2019ve since pushed that <a href=\"https:\/\/about.ads.microsoft.com\/en-us\/blog\/post\/august-2022\/you-have-5-additional-months-to-migrate-to-responsive-search-ads-deadline-extended-to-february-1-2023\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">deadline for ETAs back to February 2023<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Make RSAs a breeze in 2023:<\/h3>\n<p>RSAs are going nowhere fast.

In 2018, Google released its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/30\/google-smart-shopping\">Smart Shopping campaign<\/a> type to help businesses promote their shopping ads across Search, Display, and YouTube. With just a product feed in Google Merchant Center, Google\u2019s reach of high-value placements across the web was easily available for all small businesses. Similarly, Google introduced Local Campaigns in 2019 to help local businesses <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/08\/what-is-google-my-business\">promote their Google Business Profile<\/a> across Google Search, Maps, Gmail, Display, and YouTube.<\/p>\n<p>Both of these campaigns offered small businesses great ROI on smaller budgets and helped automate much of their campaign management. However, earlier this year, Google stopped allowing advertisers to create both these campaign types and began <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/10\/google-ads-updates\">automating \u201cupgrading\u201d them to Google\u2019s newest campaign type, Performance Max<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s Performance Max campaigns have several unique features and offer even more reach across new ad placements, including Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/12\/google-discovery-ads-vs-display\">Discovery feed<\/a>. And to many, this is plenty to celebrate! More reach, more placements, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/04\/google-ads-automation\">more automation<\/a> let many advertisers boast a significant increase in conversions with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/11\/07\/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead-google-ads\">lower CPA<\/a> without the hassle of managing more campaigns.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/google-ads-performance-max-pros.png\" alt=\"benefits of google ads perfomance max case study\" width=\"720\" height=\"216\" class=\"size-full wp-image-60292 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/google-ads-performance-max-pros.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/google-ads-performance-max-pros-480x144.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/future-of-marketing\/emerging-technology\/performance-max-campaign-automation\/#:~:text=Its%20Performance%20Max%20campaign%20focused%20on%20driving%20new,a%20baseline%20CPA%20target%20while%20spending%20its%20budget.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>But not all advertisers are celebrating the loss of Smart Shopping and Local campaigns. Google\u2019s fully automated Performance Max campaigns require a healthy amount of data and budget before they hum along smoothly. Although you can technically run these campaigns at any budget, advertisers see better results with bigger budgets of at least $100\/day. This new ad inventory included in Performance Max may be celebrated as incremental reach to some, while others may lament the additional uncontrolled costs.<\/p>\n<h3>Handle PMax with ease in 2023:<\/h3>\n<p>Google continues to come out with new features and tools for its new prize campaign type, but should you use it?

The success of rival <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/facebook-lookalike-audiences\">Facebook\u2019s lookalike audiences<\/a> brought Google to double down on its Similar Audiences. Since then, they\u2019ve become a cornerstone of many advertisers\u2019 Google Ad campaigns. However, new privacy standards have hit both Google and Facebook\u2019s audience solutions hard. That\u2019s why in November, <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/12929853\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google announced that it plans to transition away from Similar Audiences<\/a> for \u201cmore powerful and durable\u201d audience solutions next year.<\/p>\n<p>Advertisers have about six more months to use Google\u2019s Similar Audiences in their campaigns. Then starting in May 2023, Similar Audiences will no longer be available to add to new campaigns or ad groups. Shortly after, in August 2023, they will be removed from all campaign targeting.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/similar-audiences-retiring.png\" alt=\"google deprecating similar audiences\" width=\"720\" height=\"543\" class=\"size-full wp-image-68302 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/similar-audiences-retiring.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/similar-audiences-retiring-480x362.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Google urges advertisers to update their audiences ahead of the migration.

Additionally, Google recommends taking advantage of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/15\/smart-bidding\">Smart Bidding strategies<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/22\/google-ads-optimized-targeting\">optimized targeting<\/a> to continue optimizing their campaigns' performance.

With those efforts, Google launched My Ad Center in October, allowing searchers to explore how advertisers reach them.<\/p>\n<p>Among the features within My Ad Center is a powerful new tool called \u201cAdvertiser Pages.\u201d These Advertiser Pages let users see all the other ads that the advertiser has run over the past 30 days.<\/p>\n<p>To view a company\u2019s Advertiser Page, you\u2019ll need to click on the three stacked dots next to an ad.

Automotive gets a new ad type<\/h2>\n<p>The past two years have forced several industries to constantly adjust their strategies as supply chain issues, pandemic restrictions, and economic turbulence continue to upend our lives. While some changes to Google Ads have felt more like salt on the wound, there are some that have been positive. For example, back in March at NADA, Google introduced <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/ads-commerce\/introducing-vehicle-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vehicle Listing Ads<\/a> to help car dealerships highlight the new and used cars they had on their lot.<\/p>\n<p>Similar to a Local Inventory Ad on Google, this new Vehicle Listings Ad is featured prominently at the top of the SERP and highlights the cars\u2019 image, price, condition, and location. Microsoft Advertising also introduced a similar <a href=\"https:\/\/about.ads.microsoft.com\/en-us\/blog\/post\/march-2021\/automotive-ads-showcase-your-offerings-on-microsoft-advertising\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Automotive Ad format<\/a> for local dealerships (as well as a few other <a href=\"https:\/\/about.ads.microsoft.com\/en-us\/blog\/post\/may-2022\/keep-performance-high-with-vertical-ads?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ad formats for verticals like finance and travel<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/google-ads-automotive-ad-format.png\" alt=\"google ads automotive ad format\" width=\"367\" height=\"496\" class=\"wp-image-68308 aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p>These new Vehicle Listing Ads are managed nearly identically to Shopping Ads and require an active inventory feed to be regularly submitted and approved through Google Merchant Center. Previously, Google Merchant Center had <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/merchants\/answer\/6150006?hl=en\">strict policies<\/a> prohibiting most motor vehicles from their platform.<\/p>\n<h3>For economic peace in 2023:<\/h3>\n<p>At the end of the day, every industry is experiencing the impact of the pandemic and its economic repercussions.

New voiceover features for video ads<\/h2>\n<p>In part driven by the rapid rise of TikTok and its easily accessible editing features, Google introduced <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/12383985?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new features for its video ad content<\/a> this summer. Among the improvements, advertisers can now <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/10\/google-ads-updates\">add a voice-over to their existing YouTube video ads<\/a> without additional editing. Previously, Google shared that fewer than half of video ads included a voice-over. According to Google\u2019s research, including a voice-over in these ads can increase ad recall by 25% and lower the cost per lifted user by 50% compared to the original advertisements.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/google-ads-updates-text-to-speech-voice-over-example.jpg\" alt=\"google ads updates - example in platform of text to speech voice over in a video ad\" width=\"600\" height=\"429\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63544 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/google-ads-updates-text-to-speech-voice-over-example.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/google-ads-updates-text-to-speech-voice-over-example-480x343.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Advertisers can choose eight different voices (four male, four female) for their voice-overs and provide their script, preview, and edit their voice-overs directly within Google Ads without any additional <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/12\/15\/best-video-editing-software-for-beginners\">video editing software<\/a> or video experience.<\/p>\n<h3>Turn up the video heat in 2023:<\/h3>\n<p>Video marketing gets more popular every year, and Google isn't the only platform helping us to make better video ad content:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/03\/how-to-advertise-on-youtube\">guide to advertising on YouTube <\/a>with pro tips from Jyll Saskin Gales to get started.<\/li>\n<li>Save money with these<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/13\/video-ad-tools\"> three tricks to create video ads on a budget<\/a> from Joe Martinez.<\/li>\n<li>Get up to speed on some sneaky nuances with these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/29\/google-ads-video-campaign-settings\">four fine-print settings in video campaigns to be aware of.<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>9.

Google eagerly announced that it'd be meeting this demand on its growing audiences of music and podcast listeners across YouTube earlier this year with its <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/12920511\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new audio ad campaigns<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This new video campaign subtype is designed for advertisers to reach users while listening to music or podcasts, where highly visual video content wouldn\u2019t typically perform well.<\/p>\n<p>Here's an example of an audio ad from Google:<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/_t6UAuvLKFs\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h3>Make your ads speak in 2023:<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/10227746\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google's best practices for Audio Ads<\/a> recommend using a static image or simple animation and focusing on sound quality, a conversational tone, and a short effective call to action.<\/p>\n<p>To complement this new Audio Ad format, Google also rolled out targeting for new content placements across YouTube, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/12867999\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Music Mood Lineups<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/12921482\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Podcast Lineups<\/a>, so that advertisers can target their audio ads to the placements where they\u2019re most likely to find their target audience listening.<\/p>\n<h2>10. A broad match beta test leaves us...uncertain<\/h2>\n<p>So there has been a mix of positive and negative changes. This last one we'll leave up to you...<\/p>\n<p>In October, Google launched a limited beta feature that allows advertisers to turn on broad keyword targeting at the campaign level. This is not surprising, given its constant push for broad match plus Smart Bidding, but it was a little scary to see an option with no match types\u2014even if just a beta test.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/13\/future-of-keyword-match-types\">Is a future with no keyword match types in sight?<\/a> We don't know.
