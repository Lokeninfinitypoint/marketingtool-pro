Either navigate to the Attributes dropdown or search for \u201cAdd\u201d in the filters like I did in the image above, and choose the Added\/Excluded option from the dropdown.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/add-terms-search-terms-report-png.webp\" alt=\"add\/excluded filter in search terms report\" width=\"824\" height=\"282\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91143\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/add-terms-search-terms-report-png.webp 824w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/add-terms-search-terms-report-480x164.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 824px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>From there, check the box next to None.

It\u2019s laid out in their prioritization documents.

Gather your competitors<\/h3>\n<p>The first stage in this process is to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-find-your-competitors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">get a list of competitors<\/a> you want to use to review for gaps. There are two different types of competitors I want you to think about for this exercise.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Traditional competitors: <\/strong>These are companies that do the same things you do, and you likely compete directly for the same customers. Think large brands like Dunkin\u2019 and Starbucks, or smaller scale like one roofing company vs another.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Active advertisers: <\/strong>These are the companies that are bidding on your keywords. For this, conduct a simple search with your existing keywords and see who comes up. These are folks that you are literally competing with in search, even if they don\u2019t do the same things you do.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/who-to-include-in-ppc-keyword-gap-analysis-png.webp\" alt=\"who to include in ppc keyword gap analysis circle chart\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91146\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/who-to-include-in-ppc-keyword-gap-analysis-png.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/who-to-include-in-ppc-keyword-gap-analysis-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The reason we use both groups is because of the diagram above. There are some companies that are direct competitors and they aren\u2019t bidding against you, others that aren\u2019t really competitors but are bidding against you, and the group we\u2019ll likely learn the most from is the cross-section of the two: those who are your competitors and are bidding on your terms.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f <strong>Want an even deeper look at what your competitors are doing?<\/strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/how-to-spy-on-competitors?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_SpyOnCompetitors_Download\">How to Spy on Your Competitors: 7 Ways to Become a Competitive Supersleuth<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"scan-your-competitors-sites\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Scan the websites<\/h3>\n<p>Now that we have our list of competitors, we\u2019re going to use their websites for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/competitors-ads\">some light snooping<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re going to use the Google Ads Keyword Planner and select the \u201cStart with a Website\u201d option and input each of the sites from the competitor.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/keyword-planner-scan-websites-for-keywords-png.webp\" alt=\"scan websites for keywords in the google ads keyword planner\" width=\"1666\" height=\"649\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91148\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/keyword-planner-scan-websites-for-keywords-png.webp 1666w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/keyword-planner-scan-websites-for-keywords-1280x499.webp 1280w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/keyword-planner-scan-websites-for-keywords-980x382.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/keyword-planner-scan-websites-for-keywords-480x187.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1666px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The results listed will show all the keywords Google thinks the website is about. This can give you all sorts of ideas based just on the content of your competitor\u2019s site.<\/p>\n<p>The best part: there\u2019s a column on the far right that will show you if you already have a keyword in your account or not. This is a very quick way for you to review a keyword for relevancy and then to easily check if you\u2019ve already been using it or if it\u2019s a new term you can test out.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/keywords-in-account-status-png.webp\" alt=\"keywords in account in google ads keyword planner\" width=\"1980\" height=\"624\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91149\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/keywords-in-account-status-png.webp 1980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/keywords-in-account-status-1280x403.webp 1280w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/keywords-in-account-status-980x309.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/keywords-in-account-status-480x151.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1980px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>At times, a company\u2019s entire website can be a bit broad. If you\u2019re finding lots of irrelevant terms but you\u2019re confident the company is relevant to your business, try using individual pages from the site rather than the whole site. If possible, even grab some of their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/great-landing-pages\">landing pages<\/a> and run those through the tool to see what you can come up with.<\/p>\n<div id=\"ppc-keyword-gap-analysis-example\"><\/div>\n<h2>A PPC keyword gap analysis example<\/h2>\n<p>While the Google Ads Keyword Planner can be a great tool for identifying new terms and easily comparing them to your accounts, I\u2019m a really big fan of the functionality in some of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/09\/competitor-keywords\">paid research tools<\/a> out there. One of my favorites is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.spyfu.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SpyFu<\/a>, but others have similar functionality.<\/p>\n<p>With SpyFu, you can take all of your competitors (direct or indirect), put their websites into the tool, and see all sorts of information about their paid search campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the data points you can see:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Search terms their ads have shown for<\/li>\n<li>Average ad budget<\/li>\n<li>Number of active keywords<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Caveat before we go further: <\/strong>All of this is inferred data. SpuFu can\u2019t actually know what a competitor&#8217;s keywords are or how much they spend. They can only see the search terms an advertiser showed up for and reverse engineer the number of active keywords and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-shared-budgets\">ad budget<\/a> from there.<\/p>\n<p>While this data isn\u2019t perfect, there\u2019s still plenty we can learn from it. So if you can accept this caveat, which you should, then keep reading.<\/p>\n<p>Still here?<\/p>\n<p>Great!<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s start by taking an example website, Lowes.com. (Yes, I\u2019ve been doing home improvement projects, so Lowe&#8217;s is top of mind.<\/p>\n<p>If we input lowes.com into SpuFu, then navigate to the PPC Research section, then choose PPC Keywords, we\u2019ll see a report that looks like this. It has the top performing PPC search queries that Lowes has been showing up for.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/lowes-keywords-spyfu-png.webp\" alt=\"lowes ppc keywords in spyfu\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1262\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91150\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/lowes-keywords-spyfu-png.webp 1999w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/lowes-keywords-spyfu-1280x808.webp 1280w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/lowes-keywords-spyfu-980x619.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/lowes-keywords-spyfu-480x303.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1999px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As you can see, the report is truncated to only the top five terms since we\u2019re in a free account, but if you were to pay for SpyFu, you\u2019d see a lot more variants show up here.<\/p>\n<p>Each of these terms could be a valuable keyword for you to target if you\u2019re a competitor of Lowe&#8217;s and want to show up in the same SERPs that they are. A similar process can be done for all of your competitors to find the top terms they show up for and try to take some new themes for yourself.<\/p>\n<p>That said, my favorite report in SpyFu is the Kombat report. On this tab, you can input multiple competitors, then see how their search term coverage overlaps in a Venn Diagram.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/spyfu-kombat-report-png.webp\" alt=\"spyfu kombat report for lowes\" width=\"1999\" height=\"884\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91151\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/spyfu-kombat-report-png.webp 1999w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/spyfu-kombat-report-1280x566.webp 1280w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/spyfu-kombat-report-980x433.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/spyfu-kombat-report-480x212.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1999px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here, you can see Home Depot and Menards\u2019 search term coverage against Lowe&#8217;s. There\u2019s a group of 118 \u201cCore Keywords,\u201d meaning all three brands bid on these terms.<\/p>\n<p>But the gems come from seeing which terms either Home Depot or Menards bid on that Lowe&#8217;s doesn\u2019t. Specifically, the \u201cConsider Buying\u201d section, in this instance with 70 keywords, shows the search terms Home Depot and Menards are showing for that Lowe&#8217;s isn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/keyword-gap-on-spyfu-png.webp\" alt=\"lowes keyword gap on spyfu\" width=\"1846\" height=\"524\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91152\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/keyword-gap-on-spyfu-png.webp 1846w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/keyword-gap-on-spyfu-1280x363.webp 1280w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/keyword-gap-on-spyfu-980x278.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/keyword-gap-on-spyfu-480x136.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1846px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In this instance, two competitors are showing for the above terms, while Lowe&#8217;s is left out. If you\u2019re the Paid Search Manager for Lowe&#8217;s and you know you offer Owens Corning Duration Shingles, that might be a good term for you to look into.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, three of the five listed terms are for \u201cappliances\u201d plus a city, state location. That could be an entire keyword theme Lowe&#8217;s should look into researching and building out to ensure they have coverage for folks looking for appliances in areas where they have stores.<\/p>\n<p>Again, these are only the queries Home Depot and Menards are showing for, not the specific keywords, but they\u2019re both onto something with the location terms, and it appears Lowe&#8217;s is being left out of that market conversation.
