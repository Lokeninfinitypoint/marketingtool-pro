These tools are helpful for understanding your performance in relation to competitors, but because they scrape the SERPs to gather keyword ranking\u00a0data, the information can be incomplete and backdated.<\/p>\n<p>Those tools only see about 30-40% of your website&#8217;s total keyword rankings because they crawl a limited number of SERPs and not on a daily basis. For example, compare the total number of <a href=\"\/keyword-ranking\">keyword rankings<\/a> that Ahrefs sees in comparison to LinkGraph\u2019s GSC Insights (which is built over Google\u2019s API) for the same website.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-use-google-search-console-linkgraphs-google-search-console-insights-1.png\" alt=\"how to use google search console linkgraph google search console insights\" width=\"944\" height=\"352\" \/><\/div>\n<p>That\u2019s a pretty significant gap in keyword rankings data. When it comes to the search for SEO truth, no other platform can compare to Google&#8217;s dataset.<\/p>\n<p>But why is it so important to understand <strong>all<\/strong> of the keywords where your web pages rank?<\/p>\n<p>Because every relevant <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">keyword<\/a> query represents a new opportunity for your business to earn real customers and clients.<\/p>\n<h2>How to use Google Search Console to drive more traffic to your site<\/h2>\n<p>If you only occasionally\u00a0log in to your Google Search Console\u00a0dashboard to see your overall impressions and clicks, you are unlikely to harness its metrics and tools to their full potential.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to using Google Search Console right, here\u2019s how to maximize the value of the platform and transform that data into strategic optimization decisions.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Quickly confirm that Google understands the keywords you\u2019re targeting<\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to increasing the total number of keyword phrases that your website ranks for, the best strategy is to regularly publish <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/15\/quality-content-defined\">high-quality content<\/a> that highlights your brand&#8217;s knowledge and expertise in your industry niche.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-use-google-search-console-when-google-finds-high-quality-content-1.jpg\" alt=\"how to use google search console when google finds high-quality content meme\" width=\"454\" height=\"372\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Instead of waiting 30 days, you can use Google Search Console to quickly\u00a0confirm that your content is pulling its weight and ranking for your targeted search terms.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s how to use Google Search Console in this manner for each piece of content you publish:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"\/find-keywords\">Choose a relevant keyword<\/a> target or cluster that you want the web page to rank for.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/01\/17\/seo-content-beginners-guide\">Optimize your content<\/a> for that relevant target keyword.<\/li>\n<li>Publish your content on your website.<\/li>\n<li>After a few days, confirm whether Google understands the relevance of your content and is showing it in the SERPs for relevant keyword phrases.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>For example, we recently published a blog article that compared the accuracy and features of various keyword tracking software. The blog was optimized for the keyword phrase, \u201caccurate SEO rank tracking.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A few days after publication, we went to Google Search Console to confirm that Google was understanding the relevance of our content.\u00a0We found that the blog earned over a thousand impressions for our target keyword phrase, \u201caccurate SEO rank tracking\u201d as well as hundreds of additional impressions for nearly 256 short and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/11\/07\/how-to-find-long-tail-keywords\">long-tail keyword phrases<\/a> with similar search <a href=\"\/keyword-intent\">intent<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-use-google-search-console-real-time-search-results-performance-1.png\" alt=\"how to use google search console real-time search performance results\" width=\"944\" height=\"546\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Because Google Search Console updates keyword rankings on a daily basis, we were able to confirm within a few days if we optimized this content effectively.<\/p>\n<p>Once we knew that the content is indeed ranking for appropriate keywords, we could then focus on other SEO factors to elevate its position across those many search queries.<\/p>\n<p>If you find that your content is not ranking high for the target keywords you originally aimed for (or it\u2019s not ranking at all), it\u2019s likely that Google doesn\u2019t perceive the content as relevant to the targeted keyword or as high-quality. Here&#8217;s what you can try:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Check your metadata<\/strong>: Make sure your page title, meta description, and other meta tags are SEO-friendly and include your target keywords.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Revise the content<\/strong>: Focus on your headings and subheadings for keyword inclusion and enhance the content with more topical depth and semantic-richness<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use a content tool<\/strong>: A content tool can guide your writing process by suggesting powerful terms to include in your content. Here are a few tools you can try for free from <a href=\"https:\/\/dashboard.linkgraph.io\/\">LinkGraph<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/cognitiveseo.com\/blog\/14919\/keyword-tool-content-assistant\/\">CognitiveSEO<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/lsigraph.com\/\">LSIGraph<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Build your site authority<\/strong>: Your site might not have enough authority to rank in the SERPs. You may need to take some time to build\u00a0your site authority with <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2010\/04\/01\/build-amazing-backlinks\">backlinking<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you want the time and effort you&#8217;ve spent on creating\u00a0a quality piece of content to be worth it, it needs to pull its weight. That means ranking in relevant search queries and earning impressions and organic traffic for your website. Google Search Console is the quickest, and fastest way to confirm that your pages are indeed doing their part.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Check that Google is properly crawling and indexing your web pages<\/h3>\n<p>Before your web pages can rank for relevant search queries, they have to be properly crawled and indexed by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/search-engine-spider\">search engine spiders<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-use-google-search-console-check-for-crawling-indexing-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"how to use google search console diagram of google crawling and indexing\" width=\"472\" height=\"268\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Google Search Console is the best way to see which of your pages have been indexed, when they were last crawled, and if Google identified any enhancements\u2014like breadcrumbs or sitelinks that will influence how your SERP result appears.<\/p>\n<p>Why is this information so valuable to marketers and SEOs who want to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-improve-seo-for-your-local-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">elevate their overall SEO<\/a> performance? A few reasons:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>When you make <a href=\"\/on-page-seo-efforts\">on-page optimizations<\/a> to a web page, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/30\/google-algorithm-updates-2021\">Google\u2019s algorithm<\/a> will not weigh those improvements until the page\u2019s next crawl. <strong>Don\u2019t try to confirm the effectiveness of your optimizations until they have actually been seen by Google<\/strong>!<\/li>\n<li>For websites with hundreds to thousands of l<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/10\/high-converting-landing-pages\">anding pages<\/a>, you could potentially max out your crawl budget. <strong>Make sure Google only crawls your most important pages by adding robots tags with <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/linkgraph.io\/noindex-nofollow-and-disallow-search-crawler-directives\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>\u201cnoindex, nofollow\u201d directives<\/strong><\/a><strong>\u00a0to any low-value pages<\/strong>!<\/li>\n<li>Enhancements help your web pages more clickable in the SERPs. If you add schema.org markup to your site to appear in certain rich results, <strong>confirm that your code is correct and they are indeed showing up in the SERPs!<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you want to have more agency over which pages of your website Google promotes to searchers, you can also use Google Search Console to submit a sitemap. A sitemap will communicate to Google which pages on your website are most important and should therefore be crawled and promoted more often.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-use-google-search-console-add-new-sitemap-1.png\" alt=\"how to use google search console add new sitemap button\" width=\"944\" height=\"160\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>3. Troubleshoot technical and page performance issues<\/h3>\n<p>Relevant, high-quality content is not the only requirement for <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/rank-your-business-higher-on-google\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ranking in Google<\/a>. The <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/28\/technical-seo\">technical performance of your website <\/a>strongly influences Google&#8217;s level of trust in\u2014and your visitors&#8217; perception of\u2014your business.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s crawlers want to see that your pages are responsive, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/08\/lazy-loading-seo\">fast-loading<\/a>, and provide a quality page experience for users who discover them through search.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-use-google-search-console-google-page-experience-update-1.jpg\" alt=\"how to use google search console google page experience update graphic\" width=\"944\" height=\"490\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Troubleshooting technical problems on your website can be a bit intimidating, particularly if you don\u2019t have the most extensive knowledge of working on the backend of your website. But Google Search Console simplifies that process so site owners can identify and address any technical or page performance issues that could impact their keyword rankings and positions.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/09\/google-ranking-factors\">Google\u2019s ranking algorithm<\/a> weighs the following signals to understand the quality of web page\u2019s overall experience:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Core Web Vitals<\/strong>: This includes the site speed,<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/22\/google-page-speed\"> load times<\/a>, interactivity, and visual stability of your web pages.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mobile Usability<\/strong>: Due to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/15\/mobile-first-indexing\">mobile-first indexing<\/a>, Google likes web pages that are responsive, fast-loading, and high-performing on mobile devices.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Security<\/strong>: Web pages should provide safe browsing and be secure for users.<\/li>\n<li><strong>HTTPS<\/strong>: HTTPS is more secure than HTTP. Too many urls with HTTP protocols could result in worse SEO performance because of the lack of encryption<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If your web pages suffer in any of the above areas, Google will tell you in the Experience feature of your Google Search Console account. They will let you know what problems they\u2019ve detected and on which web pages.<\/p>\n<p>For example, this website has over 109 landing pages that Google sees as providing a low-quality page experience. Unless this website resolves those technical problems, they are unlikely to see their overall SEO performance\u2014and therefore their organic traffic\u2014improve.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-use-google-search-console-low-quality-page-experience-1.png\" alt=\"how to use google search console low quality pages detected\" width=\"944\" height=\"810\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If you are seeing similar page experience metrics in your own Google Search Console account, here are the next steps you should take:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify the specific web page that has been flagged and the specified error type.<\/li>\n<li>Send this information to your web developer or whoever will attempt to resolve the issue on the backend of your website.<\/li>\n<li>Once the problem has been fixed, confirm the problem is resolved by using the \u201cValidate Fix\u201d feature in your Google Search Console Account.\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-use-google-search-console-validate-fix-1.png\" alt=\"how to use google search console validate fix prompt\" width=\"944\" height=\"430\" \/><\/div>\n<\/li>\n<li>You should get confirmation of your validation submission. It will take Google about 28 days to confirm whether the issue has been resolved.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-use-google-search-console-validation-started-1.png\" alt=\"how to use google search console validation started\" width=\"944\" height=\"370\" \/><\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s important to identify and resolve technical and page performance issues as quickly as possible. Although there are other tools available to troubleshoot page experience issues, Google Search Console gives you the most direct guidance on where to focus your efforts.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure you perform <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/20\/seo-audit\">SEO audits<\/a> regularly to ensure everything looks good beneath the hood of your website.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Run SEO A\/B tests with the help of Google Search Console&#8217;s daily rank tracking<\/h3>\n<p>Once you know your web pages are ranking for relevant keywords and that your page performance, security, and mobile usability meet Google\u2019s standards, you can use Google Search Console to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/24\/seo-testing\">A\/B test<\/a> specific optimizations to try and improve your average positions across all of your keywords.<\/p>\n<p>With daily keyword tracking in Google Search Console, you can confirm fairly quickly whether those optimizations were successful.<\/p>\n<p>To run a split test in Google Search Console, follow these steps:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Choose what page you want to test and the specific variant you would like to test. <strong>Don\u2019t test more than one variant<\/strong>, or it will be difficult to determine which resulted in improved rankings, impressions, or organic traffic<\/li>\n<li>Make your optimization to your page (whether that be a\u00a0page title, internal links, web design, meta description, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>Wait 7-10 days<\/li>\n<li>Log in to Google Search Console to see whether the page improved in impressions, average position, clicks, or click-through-rate<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>For example, my content team attempted to improve the total keyword rankings for a piece of\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/05\/longform-content\">long-form content<\/a>\u00a0on our website by increasing the word count and topical depth of the content. Our writers improved the word count of the page from about 1500 to over 4000.<\/p>\n<p>The content was updated on the website on December 29th, 2020. Here are the Google Search Console\u00a0metrics for the landing page from the past six\u00a0months.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-use-google-search-console-metrics-six-months-1.png\" alt=\"how to use google search console metrics over six months\" width=\"944\" height=\"218\" \/><\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s clear that Google responded to our content changes. Within seven\u00a0days, our impressions improved by 420% and our average position improved by over 20 positions. As a result, we changed the same variant (content length) on other pages of our website and saw similar results.<\/p>\n<p>Although Google Search Console makes it easy to quickly analyze the results of your split tests, there isn\u2019t any way to track the changes you make to your website within the platform. To track your optimizations and Google metrics in the same tool, try a keyword rank tracking tools that include SEO A\/B testing features like <a href=\"https:\/\/linkgraph.io\/google-search-console-tool\/\">GSC Insights<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rankscience.com\/seo-ab-testing-tool?gclid=CjwKCAjwy42FBhB2EiwAJY0yQr9uCq4WB7LDXy4849EFqc28kLQG5GYePJ4DykiSJPxYwARIVI4CxhoCA5AQAvD_BwE\">Rank Science<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-use-google-search-console-seo-ab-tracking-1.png\" alt=\"how to use google search console SEO A\/B testing results\" width=\"936\" height=\"238\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>SEO A\/B Test Tracking in Google Search Console Insights<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Google Search Console is the best way to narrow in on which optimizations in your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/24\/seo-testing\">SEO testing<\/a> actually result in improved rankings and impressions.
