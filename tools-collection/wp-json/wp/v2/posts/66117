Check up on your \u201climited by budget\u201d campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>One way you could lower your costs is by lowering your bids, and this comes down to your \"limited by budget\" campaigns. <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/2616012?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u201cLimited by budget\u201d<\/a> is a campaign status in Google Ads that means that your bids are high enough to make you eligible to enter a certain number of auctions, but that you don\u2019t have the budget to appear in that many auctions.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/lower-google-ads-cost-per-lead-limited-by-budget.png\" alt=\"how to lower cpl in google ads - limited by budget campaign status\" width=\"720\" height=\"423\" class=\"size-full wp-image-66280 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/lower-google-ads-cost-per-lead-limited-by-budget.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/lower-google-ads-cost-per-lead-limited-by-budget-480x282.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For campaigns with this status, you could:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Increase budget.<\/strong> If this is a high-value campaign and you can afford it, you can increase your budget.

Tighten up your account structure<\/h3>\n<p>Your account structure refers to the way you organize your keywords and ads into ad groups and then those ad groups into campaigns. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/10\/google-ads-account-structure\">proper account structure<\/a> is important in reducing CPA in a few ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/29\/single-theme-ad-groups\">Single-themed ad groups<\/a> will ensure your keywords, ads, and landing pages are tightly aligned, improving relevancy and therefore also Quality Score.<\/li>\n<li>Automated bidding strategies are set at the campaign level, so with the right organization, you ensure that you\u2019re giving Google both the adequate and consistent data it needs to optimize your bids and keep your costs in check.<\/li>\n<li>Since budgets are set at the campaign level, you can more easily distribute budgets when your campaigns are organized accordingly (such as by following tip #1).<\/li>\n<li>When your keywords are assembled into themed ad groups, you can more easily detect CPL patterns and distribute your budget according to how the keywords in those ad groups are performing (more on that later on).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/google-ads-account-structure-right-roofing.png\" alt=\"google ads account structure - roofing account example\" width=\"720\" height=\"369\" class=\"size-full wp-image-60973 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/google-ads-account-structure-right-roofing.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/google-ads-account-structure-right-roofing-480x246.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>4. Tune up your bids\u2026<\/h3>\n<p>Take a look at your campaigns and make sure you\u2019re not leaking any spend on campaign settings or targeting. If you're using Manual or Enhanced CPC bidding, you can make bid adjustments based on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Device:<\/strong> Desktop, mobile, tablet, etc.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Demographic:<\/strong> Age, gender, location, etc.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Audience:<\/strong> Detailed demographics, in-market, affinity, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/18\/google-ads-custom-segments\">custom segments<\/a>, etc.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Networks: <\/strong>Search, Display, or Partner network.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Time of day:<\/strong> Depending on your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/13\/how-to-set-up-ad-scheduling\">ad schedule<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If a particular time of day, network, location, or device is lagging in conversion rates, exclude those segments or adjust your bids accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/lower-cost-per-lead-google-ads-bid-adjustments.png\" alt=\"how to lower cost per lead in google ads - bid adjustments\" width=\"720\" height=\"507\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66302\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/lower-cost-per-lead-google-ads-bid-adjustments.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/lower-cost-per-lead-google-ads-bid-adjustments-480x338.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>5. \u2026or your targets<\/h3>\n<p>If you're using an automated bidding strategy, your ability to adjust bids is much more limited, but you can adjust your targets. For example, if you're using the Max Conversions bidding strategy, you can set a target CPA (tCPA).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-bidding-tcpa.png\" alt=\"google ads performance max - tcpa bidding\" width=\"720\" height=\"294\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62448\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-bidding-tcpa.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-bidding-tcpa-480x196.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you know what a conversion needs to cost in order to be profitable, setting a target CPA is a great way to control costs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Just make sure you set a realistic target.<\/strong> If you set your goal too low, Google may have a hard time finding auctions that meet those conditions\u2014this can result in fewer impressions, which can lead to fewer clicks and eventually fewer conversions, which will hike up your CPL.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Clean up your keywords<\/h3>\n<p>As mentioned in tip #3, having an optimal account structure allows you to more easily detect patterns in keyword performance. Here are some of the patterns to look out for and what action you can take for lowering your CPL.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Nurture your high-performing keywords: <\/strong>Find keywords with low costs per click and high conversion rates and allocate more budget to those campaigns.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Maintain a negative keyword list. <\/strong>Use the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/16\/google-ads-search-terms-report-changes\">search terms report<\/a> and look for keywords that have:\n<ul>\n<li>Lots of clicks but low\/no conversions.<\/li>\n<li>At least 3 conversions but a CPA way over your target (3-4x higher).<\/li>\n<li>Decent impression count but low click-through rate<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pause keywords.<\/strong> You may also want to pause keywords that have CPAs 2x higher than your account average. You could remove them but you may as well pause them to preserve historical data.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Make sure keyword volume is sufficient. <\/strong>Improving the Quality Score of your keywords is all well and good, but this will not make a dent on your CPL numbers if your high QS keywords have super-low volume.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/lower-cost-per-lead-google-ads-negative-keywords.png\" alt=\"how to lower your cost per lead in google ads - search terms report example with negative keywords\" width=\"720\" height=\"366\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66303\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/lower-cost-per-lead-google-ads-negative-keywords.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/lower-cost-per-lead-google-ads-negative-keywords-480x244.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>7.
