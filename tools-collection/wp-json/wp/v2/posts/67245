Some of these may be general platforms or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/12\/cross-functional-collaboration\">cross-functional collaboration<\/a> tools that your new hires are already familiar with, such as Google Analytics or Slack. But, there are probably others that are proprietary to your agency.<\/p>\n<p>These internal systems are typically meant to simplify campaign management, reporting, and communication, but they can present their own sets of challenges for new users.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-train-new-hires-learning-a-new-technology.png\" alt=\"how to onboard and train new hires - technology learning curve\" width=\"540\" height=\"417\" class=\"wp-image-67359 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-train-new-hires-learning-a-new-technology.png 540w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-train-new-hires-learning-a-new-technology-480x371.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 540px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.stephencalenderblog.com\/?p=371\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important during the onboarding and training process to outline the different tools, systems, and platforms your new hires are expected to use, the best ways to use these systems, and any tips or tricks for using them the right way.<\/p>\n<p>By taking the time to detail the agency systems and tools they\u2019ll be using\u2014often on a daily basis\u2014you can set them up for a quick turnaround from training to running and managing campaigns or performing their day-to-day tasks.<\/p>\n<h3>It&#8217;s important for knowledge sharing &amp; best practices<\/h3>\n<p>After working within your agency for a couple of months, your employees gain tips and best practices that may not be documented anywhere. These are the small pieces of information they pick up after doing the job consistently. This is one of the reasons retaining employees is so valuable; existing employees understand the ins-and-outs of your business, your clients, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/10\/time-management-tips\">how to perform efficiently<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>A formal training program should include documented best practices, tips, and insights to give hires a solid understanding of the work they\u2019ll be doing and how to do it according to your agency\u2019s standards. But your program should also include job shadowing and knowledge sharing from your existing employees.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-train-new-employees-training-template.png\" alt=\"training new hire template from monday\" width=\"720\" height=\"349\" class=\"size-full wp-image-67360 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-train-new-employees-training-template.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-train-new-employees-training-template-480x233.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>This <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/monday.com\/blog\/task-management\/employee-training-plan-template\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>training plan template<\/em><\/a><em> includes sessions with different departments.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s one thing to talk about how to do something, but it\u2019s another to see how it\u2019s done and try it yourself.<\/p>\n<p>By equipping new employees with this in-house knowledge during the training process, you\u2019re setting them up for success.<\/p>\n<h3>It impacts the client experience<\/h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/05\/maximize-agency-profitability\">success of your agency<\/a> comes down to the service and results you provide your clients.

Clearly outline expectations<\/h3>\n<p>Setting expectations is a great first step when training a new employee. This not only means setting expectations about what the training and onboarding process will look like, but expectations around what you expect from your new employee.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some ways to do that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Clearly-defined job description.<\/strong> A good job description is helpful beyond the recruitment and hiring process. It should be reiterated when training new employees because it clearly outlines what\u2019s expected of them long-term but also what they can expect to be doing on a daily basis. If your job descriptions don\u2019t explicitly outline daily job duties as well as overall goals, give them a refresh for the onboarding process.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Formal training process. <\/strong>Documenting and presenting a formal training process outlines what new employees can expect from their first week (or weeks) of working with your agency. This can include training sessions they\u2019ll be attending, objectives for learning, and shadowing existing employees.<\/li>\n<li><strong>30\/60\/90-day plan.<\/strong> Creating a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/10\/09\/306090-day-plan\">30\/60\/90-day plan<\/a> for your new employee that communicates what you want them to accomplish and learn within 30, 60, and 90-days can keep them on track during the onboarding process. This plan can include specific milestones your agency sees as a key to success, such as conducting a first client call, closing a new client, or completing an online course.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-train-onboard-new-hires-30-60-90-day-plan-template.png\" alt=\"30-60-90 plan for training new hires\" width=\"739\" height=\"589\" class=\" wp-image-67352 aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p>By putting together these documented plans and processes, you\u2019re clearly communicating with your new hire and giving them a roadmap for success with your agency.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Understand your new hire\u2019s needs and opportunities<\/h3>\n<p>Each new hire will be different in terms of their background, experience, and gaps. While you\u2019ll likely gather much of this information during the hiring process, it\u2019s important to get a true sense of your new hire\u2019s needs and opportunities during training.<\/p>\n<p>This can be done in a few different ways, including an informal conversation or a standardized assessment your agency creates.<\/p>\n<p>Giving your new hire opportunities to ask questions throughout the training process can also give you an idea of where they may need more focused practice.<\/p>\n<p>By tailoring your training to your new hire\u2019s needs, you can keep them engaged and excited rather than bored by areas of expertise they\u2019ve already masted.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Share your mission statement or agency purpose<\/h3>\n<p>Your new hire is now part of your team. You want them to embrace your mission and your purpose. In fact, employees that are aligned with a business\u2019s mission are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.qualtrics.com\/blog\/company-values-employee-retention\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">less likely<\/a> to think about leaving their company and are more engaged. Engaged employees can contribute an additional <a href=\"https:\/\/vrmintel.com\/engaged-employees-lead-profitable-business-outcomes\/\">21%<\/a> in profitability and a <a href=\"https:\/\/vrmintel.com\/engaged-employees-lead-profitable-business-outcomes\/\">20%<\/a> increase in productivity.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-train-new-hires-engaged-employee-stats.png\" alt=\"training new hires - stats about engaged employees\" width=\"720\" height=\"462\" class=\"size-full wp-image-67353 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-train-new-hires-engaged-employee-stats.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-train-new-hires-engaged-employee-stats-480x308.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Share your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/02\/how-to-write-a-business-mission-statement\">mission statement<\/a> or agency purpose with your new hire. You can also provide an overview of why your agency exists, who you exist for, and any other areas you\u2019re most proud of.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if your agency offers matched volunteer hours, share an example of some of the organizations employees have supported through those hours in the past.<\/p>\n<p>You can also share <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/03\/how-to-write-a-case-study\">case studies<\/a> and stories about your clients and how your agency has helped them. By showing a passion for your business\u2014and your clients\u2019 businesses\u2014you can get new employees excited about the work they\u2019ll be doing.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Share internal knowledge<\/h3>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, training is a prime opportunity for existing employees to share learned best practices and insights.<\/p>\n<p>By partnering your new hires with existing employees, you can also help foster connections. This can lead to a better experience for the new employees and increased retention. One study found that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pushfar.com\/article\/mentoring-statistics-everything-you-need-to-know\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">86%<\/a> of new employees who had a mentor during the onboarding phase were more likely to stay with their company long-term.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-train-new-hires-mentor-stat.png\" alt=\"how to train new hires - employees with mentors stay with their company long-term\" width=\"720\" height=\"456\" class=\"size-full wp-image-67354 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-train-new-hires-mentor-stat.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-train-new-hires-mentor-stat-480x304.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is also a great opportunity to spotlight your superstar employees, giving them an outlet to showcase their expertise and show how much you value their knowledge and contributions to your agency.<\/p>\n<p>Have existing employees either create and present their experience with your agency, what they\u2019ve learned, and their favorite thing about working with you. Or have new hires book time one-on-one with existing employees to either ask questions or shadow them on the job.<\/p>\n<p>This hands-on learning can build on the foundational information you\u2019re providing new hires and show them what it looks like in action.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Schedule mock client calls<\/h3>\n<p>If your new employees will be working with clients, you can incorporate practice sessions into your training program.<\/p>\n<p>Mock client calls can help you gauge where a new hire has grasped the necessary information from your training and where they might need to improve. It also lets them see what they might expect from clients.<\/p>\n<p>Treat these mock calls like the real deal by having new hires reach out as if you were a client, schedule the call via Zoom (or whatever program you use), and record the call for training purposes.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-train-new-hires-practice-call.png\" alt=\"training new hires - practice call invite\" width=\"720\" height=\"513\" class=\"size-full wp-image-67355 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-train-new-hires-practice-call.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-train-new-hires-practice-call-480x342.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>By replicating the process from start-to-finish, you\u2019re giving your new hires the full experience and building their confidence with the material.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Keep your new hire engaged<\/h3>\n<p>The training and onboarding process can be tedious and overwhelming for new hires. There\u2019s a lot to learn in a short amount of time. And if your agency has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/16\/working-remotely\">remote employees<\/a>, it may be even more difficult to keep them engaged\u2014or gauge how they\u2019re feeling.<\/p>\n<p>Build in different types of learning throughout your training program to cater to the different ways people learn. Some enjoy watching videos while others enjoy learning from others (or learning by doing).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-train-onboard-new-hires-learning-pyramid.png\" alt=\"how to train new hires - the learning pyramid\" width=\"720\" height=\"557\" class=\"size-full wp-image-67356 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-train-onboard-new-hires-learning-pyramid.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-train-onboard-new-hires-learning-pyramid-480x371.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sketchbubble.com\/en\/presentation-learning-pyramid.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>You might also consider building in less structured time where new hires can network with existing employees, ask questions, or just learn more about the agency and the people who work there.<\/p>\n<p>Building a strong culture is important and can start for new hires during the training process.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Check in after onboarding<\/h3>\n<p>Once your new employee is fully trained and has flown the nest, schedule time to check in so they can ask questions, share what they\u2019ve learned, or follow up on an area they were hoping to improve.<\/p>\n<p>This is also a great time to talk with your new employee about career goals and growth. Once they\u2019ve had a little experience and time working with your agency, they may have an idea of the paths for growth. By giving them to space to share these goals and provide feedback, you can focus on retaining them long-term.<\/p>\n<h2>Make training new hires work for your agency<\/h2>\n<p>Creating the right training program for your agency will likely take some trial and error.
