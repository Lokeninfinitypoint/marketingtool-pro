Therefore your vanity URLs should be easy to remember, use, and share.<\/p>\n<p>There are many benefits to being the first to claim your vanity URL \u2013 and just as many setbacks if someone else beats you to it. Many social media websites such as <a href=\"http:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLDoesFBAdvWork.html?camplink=InContentCTA\">Facebook<\/a>, LinkedIn, Twitter, and most recently, Google Plus offer users and brands the option to customize their gplus profile URLs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pro tip:<\/strong> Vanity URLs should not be confused with vanity domains, which are domains named after the owner\u2019s name. e.g.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/vanity-domains.png\" alt=\"vanity domains are not the same as vanity urls\" width=\"1036\" height=\"228\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>My friend David was beaten to the vanity domain DavidScott.com \u2013 which may seem disadvantageous at first, but I think his pentasyllabic name sounds more catchy and memorable.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"why vanity urls are awesome\"><\/a>7 Reasons Why Vanity URLs Are Awesome, Plus Actionable Examples<\/h2>\n<p>To get your brains rolling as to how you can take online marking offline and into the real world, I\u2019ve highlighted 7 reasons and some creative ways to use vanity URLs. We\u2019ll be using our newly acquired Google plus vanity URL to showcase these vanity url examples.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-vanity-url.png\" alt=\"google plus vanity url comparison\" width=\"868\" height=\"369\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>1. Easier to Remember<\/h2>\n<p>Have you ever recommended a website to someone but <a href=\"http:\/\/lmgtfy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">they were too lazy to Google it<\/a>? Worse yet, have you ever found something cool on the web but can\u2019t get the right keyword combination to have it show up on search engines? With an easy-to-remember web address, potential website visitors are less likely to give up before they even reach your website. Plus (hah, get it?), it also looks a lot more pleasing to the eye. This is the reason why URL shortening services like bit.ly and tinyurl are so popular.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Builds More Trust<\/h2>\n<p>What\u2019s more pleasing to the eye also builds more trust. This is common sense not commonly applied here. Which of these two would I have second thoughts about clicking on?<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how I see it: there\u2019s irrefutable harmony in our new vanity URL \u2013 the call to action matches up with a beautifully honest URL. Without a vanity URL for Google plus, you would create a nasty case of cognitive dissonance to the user. Can I really trust a garbled mess of numbers to lead me to where you say it will? Hyperbole aside, establishing trust on the internet is hard stuff.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Easier to Share<\/h2>\n<p>By being obviously shorter, easier to remember, and more trustworthy, our GPlus vanity URL is also engineered to be more sharable than before. Because it\u2019s made up of words instead of random numbers, we can now share it verbally without reading out the numbers \u2013 heck, who would ever read out our old Google Plus URL? In most cases, people would resort to search to find it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pro-tip<\/strong>: Want to keep things shorter and simpler without losing trust? Here are the shortest links you can possibly create on the \u201cbig 4\u201d of social media in order of brevity.<\/p>\n<p>Google Plus: <a href=\"http:\/\/google.com\/+wordstream\">google.com\/+WordStream<\/a><br \/>\nTwitter: <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/wordstream\">twitter.com\/wordstream<\/a><br \/>\nFacebook: <a href=\"http:\/\/facebook.com\/wordstream\">facebook.com\/wordstream<\/a><br \/>\nLinkedIn: <a href=\"http:\/\/linkedin.com\/company\/wordstream\">linkedin.com\/company\/wordstream<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>4. Easier to Use<\/h2>\n<p>Now that it\u2019s easy to remember, share, and evokes trust, we\u2019ll actually want to include our Google plus URL when we\u2019re offering options for our fans to follow us.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sharing-vanity-urls.png\" alt=\"Custom Url vs Plain URL\" width=\"1072\" height=\"801\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>This is a rendition of what your thank you slides may\u2019ve looked like.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve seen our webinar thank you pages, you might notice that we\u2019ve never included a method to follow us on Google Plus \u2013 simply because it was hard to use. Font sizes or formats have to be changed to accommodate a URL which doesn\u2019t clearly represent what it does. If it\u2019s hard to use internally, it\u2019ll be hard to push out externally to customers. Now that it\u2019s easier to use, we\u2019ll make it available to our growing Google Plus fan base.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Empowers Online Sharing<\/h2>\n<p>Isn\u2019t it amazing? Just a small cosmetic change can have a huge impact on your marketing efforts. If you have a strong Google Plus brand presence and active community \u2013 or you plan to have one \u2013 then it\u2019s smart to build a supporting infrastructure around it. Here are some examples of what you can now do that was previously unfeasible because of one dinky, ugly-looking URL.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Corporate Emails<\/strong><\/h3>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-vanity-url.png\" alt=\"Using custom urls in emails\" width=\"431\" height=\"181\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Press Releases<\/h3>\n<p>Don&#8217;t miss our guide on\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/04\/how-to-write-a-press-release\">how to write a great press release<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/press-release-vanity-urls.png\" alt=\"Customized urls for press releases\" width=\"381\" height=\"240\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><strong>Online Presentation Slides<\/strong><\/h3>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/powerpoint-vanity-url.png\" alt=\"Custom urls to encourage participation\" width=\"747\" height=\"606\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>6.

The easier it is the more likely people will act on it. Vanity URLs are the start of easier word of mouth sharing, since your customers may choose to visit your brand not through your website, but your presence in social media.<\/p>\n<h2>8. Bonus Round: Dominate Your Branded SERP With Vanity URL SEO<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s no secret that when users are looking for a brand, Google loves to put Google Plus, LinkedIn, and <a href=\"http:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLDoesFBAdvWork.html?camplink=InContentCTA\">Facebook <\/a>on the search engine results page. Some SEO\u2019s will even argue that this is in part due to the exact keyword match that you\u2019ve customized in the URL. By having the vanity URL to your brand on multiple web properties, you should be able to dominate your SERP with your own marketing message (and not what Wikipedia has to say about you!).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pro-tip:<\/strong> If you have a verified Google Plus brand page, the <a href=\"http:\/\/blog\/ws\/2013\/02\/01\/knowledge-graph-conspiracy-confirmed\">Google Knowledge Graph will give it preference over Google Maps<\/a> (if you\u2019re a business) or Wikipedia (if you\u2019re a person).<\/p>\n<p>Great Scott, vanity URLs are certainly marketing enablers! <em>Just how did WordStream get one for Google Plus?<\/em> I\u2019m glad you asked.<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"how to get your vanity url\"><\/a>How To Get Your Google Plus Vanity URL<\/h2>\n<p>In order to be considered for Google\u2019s initial custom URL rollout, you first have to have a <a href=\"http:\/\/support.google.com\/plus\/bin\/request.py?hl=en&amp;contact_type=page_verification&amp;rd=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">verified<\/a>, active Google+ page with user activity.
