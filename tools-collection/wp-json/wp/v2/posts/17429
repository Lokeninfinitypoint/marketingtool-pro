Its goal is simple: to scrub the web of interstitial riff raff and other invasive advertising experiences. Now, advertisers have stared down the barrel of the almighty ad blocker before (and most lived to tell the tale), but this is the first ad blocker baked directly into the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/article\/chrome-is-the-most-popular-web-browser-of-all\/\">most popular browser <\/a>on the planet.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"664bf9d8-f4c3-4df4-b050-47d4b0257cda\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/chrome-most-popular-browser.png\" alt=\"chrome is the most popular browser in the world\" width=\"700\" height=\"499\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Per <\/em><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/chart\/10402\/worldwide-browser-market-share-by-platform\/\">Statista<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>It would appear that the primary purpose of this fright-inducing new feature is to combat and eradicate poor mobile browsing experiences. This aligns with other recent Google innovations, like, say, the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/14\/amp-stories\">AMP Stories<\/a> we talked about earlier in the week and the so-called Speed Update.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what the new Chrome ad filter is actually going to do (and how it\u2019s going to do it).<\/p>\n<h2>Why Is Google Releasing an Ad Filter for Chrome?<\/h2>\n<p>Per Google, \u201cWhile most advertising on the web is respectful of user experience, over the years we&#8217;ve increasingly heard from our users that some advertising can be particularly intrusive.\u201d While third-party tools have been banging this drum for a minute now, Google\u2019s finally decided to work its own solution directly into its browser. Google\u2019s blog post on the new<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.chromium.org\/2018\/02\/how-chromes-ad-filtering-works.html\"> ad filter update<\/a> goes on to state that, more often than not, the problems stem from issues with ad delivery on third-party sites, <em>not the advertisements (and by extension, the advertisers) themselves.<\/em><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4119deab-51c0-4676-8675-11f9c8ff063d\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/coalition-for-better-ads.png\" alt=\"the coalition for better ads\" width=\"600\" height=\"170\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Google\u2019s shiny new ad blocker is a product of some extensive research conducted by the Coalition for Better Ads (an altruistic watchdog group that combats heinous browsing experiences), specifically, a survey that polled 40,000 internet users and inquired as to which advertisements they felt most impeded their ability to do everything from online shopping to to inhaling spicy takes.<\/p>\n<p>As you can imagine, the Coalition\u2019s research revealed that distracting flash-animated banner ads, autoplaying video pop-ups, and those absolutely dreadful full-page monstrosities that make browsing completely impossible are some of the greatest offenders. That being said, there are plenty of other culprits that the filter will work to root out.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"b2a2ea4b-9eb8-4d9f-85a2-a2582279e596\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/example-of-awful-desktop-browser-ad-experience.png\" alt=\"bad desktop ad experience\" width=\"800\" height=\"413\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>How Will Chrome\u2019s Ad Blocker Work?<\/h2>\n<p>This is a bit over my head, but here\u2019s my understanding of it&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Chrome\u2019s ad blocker is all about pattern matching. There isn\u2019t a little dude in a bunker checking out pages in search of awful browsing experiences. Instead, the filter cross-references websites against a list of sites known to fail the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.betterads.org\/standards\/\">Better Ad Standards<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"13f7f98f-2189-457f-89e9-8ef0f90d6dd9\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-chrome-ad-filter.png\" alt=\"google chrome ad filter\" width=\"446\" height=\"446\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>A site\u2019s inclusion on the list is determined by an evaluation process. Sample pages are reviewed and, depending on the number of violations uncovered, the site is assigned a status: Pass, Warning, or Fail.<\/p>\n<p>If a site\u2019s on the list, the filter digs into images and JavaScript on the page a searcher has navigated to in an attempt to detect \u201cad-related URL patterns.\u201d If there\u2019s a match, Chrome hits the ads on said page with a big stiff arm to the chin and sends the searcher on her merry way, free to browse obstruction-free.<\/p>\n<p>For those browsing on a desktop, ad block notifications will look as they currently do on Chrome; if you\u2019re using an Android device, you\u2019ll see a message bar at the bottom of your browser that looks something like this:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"94975b25-6ef2-48a3-a8b9-4e132f15b9cd\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/chrome-ad-blocker-mobile1.png\" alt=\"chrome ad blocker mobile display\" width=\"647\" height=\"562\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a closer look at the types of ads that Google has deemed problematic.<\/p>\n<h2>Ad Blocker: Desktop Edition<\/h2>\n<p>In keeping with the general theme of mobile centricity (from mobile-first rankings to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/01\/22\/google-speed-update\">page speed updates<\/a> designed to improve site experience on hand-held devices), it makes complete sense that Chrome\u2019s new ad blocker doesn\u2019t do much to kill bad ads on desktop.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"815391ca-49dd-4279-801f-2563c618f7a1\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/poor-desktop-ad-placements-styles.png\" alt=\"desktop ad formats blocked by chrome's ad filter\" width=\"750\" height=\"230\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>That being said, the Coalition for Better Ads has identified the following desktop ad experiences as problematic:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pop-Up Ads<\/li>\n<li>Auto-Playing Video with Sound<\/li>\n<li>Prestitial Ads with Countdown<\/li>\n<li>Large Sticky Ads<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you\u2019ve ever had the unfortunate luck to come across one of these suckers, you know how annoying they are. I\u2019m particularly stoked that large, sticky ads have been deemed too disruptive to exist; you can click out of a pop-up, but without an ad blocker there\u2019s no way to escape a big stupid bar that follows you as you read.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks, Google!<\/p>\n<h2>Ad Blocker: Mobile Edition<\/h2>\n<p>And now for the piece de resistance&#8230;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f58d2fff-9ea3-42cc-be47-966348c05a68\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/mobile-chrome-ad-blocker-bad-ad-formats.png\" alt=\"mobile ad formats blocked by chrome ad filter\" width=\"800\" height=\"445\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>As you can see in the diagram above, Google\u2019s focus on cleaning up the mobile browsing experience is glaring. The ad formats that the Coalition for Better Ads and Google deem bothersome enough to block on mobile devices moving forward are as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pop-Up Ads<\/li>\n<li>Prestitial Ads<\/li>\n<li>Ad Density Higher than 30%<\/li>\n<li>Flashing Animated Ads<\/li>\n<li>Auto-Playing Video Ads with Sound<\/li>\n<li>Postitial Ads with Countdown<\/li>\n<li>Full-Screen Scrollover Ads<\/li>\n<li>Large Sticky Ads<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Outside of preroll\/midroll video ads, inoffensive banner creative, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/07\/native-advertising-examples\">native ads<\/a>, advertorials, and, of course, search ads, sites that host ads will now be pretty restricted in their ability to serve up valuable on-screen real estate to paying customers.<\/p>\n<h2>Will Chrome\u2019s Ad Blocker Impact Your Paid Search &amp; Social Advertising?<\/h2>\n<p>\u2026Nah!<\/p>\n<p>Chrome\u2019s ad blocker will not interrupt your <a href=\"\/paid-search\">paid search advertising<\/a> in the slightest (unless Google\u2019s willing to call a handful of ads on a mobile SERP 30% saturation. Somehow, I don\u2019t see that happening). If you\u2019re prospecting or <a href=\"\/google-remarketing\">remarketing<\/a> on the Display Network, it\u2019s possible that your ads will be blocked due to issues with your placements; a site serving too many ads via AdSense could very well be penalized, but you won\u2019t be forced to pay for their indiscretion.<\/p>\n<p>This is due to the fact that Google has not made its own network exempt from the pattern-scanning that underpins Chrome\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/adblockers-and-wordstream\">ad blocker<\/a>. It\u2019s also worth noting that, at this time, there\u2019s no way for you to view a potential ad placement&#8217;s pass\/warning\/fail status and use that information to exclude non-compliant sites.<\/p>\n<p>Now, if you use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/adwords-vs-adsense\">AdSense <\/a>to generate revenue on your site by hosting Display ads, you\u2019re going to want to ensure that you don\u2019t have banners all over the screen (particularly on mobile devices).<\/p>\n<p>In terms of other ads you might be running on your website (those you sell privately or are affiliated with another programmatic network), you can use the new and improved Google Search Console to view your site\u2019s Ad Experience Report. If you\u2019ve got beef, you can hit Google with a request for a re-review. Provided you remedy what Chrome has deemed non-compliant, you should be fine to run ads moving forward.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google just launched a new ad blocker for Chrome.
