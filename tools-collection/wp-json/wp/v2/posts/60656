That\u2019s according to Chris Gadek, vice president of growth at outdoor advertising firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adquick.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AdQuick<\/a>, who noted customers are often willing to pay more when a brand\u2019s identity aligns with their beliefs.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor this reason, businesses must embrace CSR in their brand ethos to have a competitive advantage,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, promoting your business&#8217;s CSR initiatives without tooting your own horn can be tricky. But, through a well-crafted social media campaign, you can invite customers on your brand&#8217;s journey to effect positive change in the world.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>You can even go as far as getting a third-party certification, such as becoming a B Corp.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCertified B Corp status is a recognizable certification that verifies your brand&#8217;s sustainability efforts and having a third party make the sustainability claims is more legitimate to consumers than the brand making the claims themselves because there&#8217;s less bias,\u201d said Calloway Cook, president of supplement maker <a href=\"https:\/\/illuminatelabs.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Illuminate Labs<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Get your green marketing strategy in gear<\/h2>\n<p>To recap, here are eight ways to implement green marketing:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pick the right initiative<\/li>\n<li>Keep your efforts genuine<\/li>\n<li>Adjust your messaging to the different levels of &#8220;green&#8221; in your audience<\/li>\n<li>Implement eco-conscious design<\/li>\n<li>Use plastic-free products and packaging<\/li>\n<li>Reduce your emissions<\/li>\n<li>Use renewable energy<\/li>\n<li>Assume social responsibility<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The sooner you start, the sooner you can feel good about saving the planet.
