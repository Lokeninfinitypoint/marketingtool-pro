But we can glean some important details from what Google\u2019s told us already. The good news is that the world\u2019s largest search engine says they&#8217;re still focused on driving traffic to websites and keeping search ads a \u201cnative part of SGE.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at how Google will make good on those promises and what SGE will mean for marketers and advertisers at businesses of all sizes.<\/p>\n<h2>What is Google\u2019s Search Generative Experience?<\/h2>\n<p>SGE (now called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-overviews-breaking-search\">AI Overviews<\/a>) is an experimental version of Google\u2019s search engine that uses artificial intelligence to generate contextual answers to complex questions.<\/p>\n<p>There are three ways SGE uses AI to enhance the search experience:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AI snapshot:<\/strong> Generates a unique summary for some longer queries<\/li>\n<li><strong>Conversational mode:<\/strong> Answers follow-up questions while retaining the context of the original search<\/li>\n<li><strong>Vertical experiences:<\/strong> Provides a preferred list of features and more product details in commercial searches<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We\u2019ll dive a little deeper into each of these pieces next.<\/p>\n<h2>What makes up Google\u2019s Search Generative Experience?<\/h2>\n<p>While all of these features are meant to help people find better answers faster, they are also designed to encourage the exploration of online content.<\/p>\n<h3>AI snapshot<\/h3>\n<p>Ask Google how many visitors Bryce Canyon National Park gets every year and it\u2019ll quickly present a trustworthy article that says 1.5 million.

This time, it\u2019s a list of aspects you should consider for your new bike. If you want to refine the search to find red bikes that fit the bill, you ask a follow-up question.<\/p>\n<p>Since this search is clearly commercial, SGE prepares a list of potential products. Each option includes an AI-generated description along with reviews, prices, and a thumbnail. Tap one and you\u2019ll see a larger image plus stores selling that bike, their prices, and other helpful info like if they have it in stock.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The bottom line: <\/strong>Shopping suggestions are nothing new for Google.

If a shopper is able to learn and refine their search before clicking, they\u2019ll likely be a higher intent buyer by the time they reach your site. In this case, SGE acts like a sales bot that helps qualify shoppers before they visit a store.<\/p>\n<p>Google says they\u2019ll monitor how SGE affects ad traffic and evolve as needed.
