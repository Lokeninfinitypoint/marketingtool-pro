While paid search was not among Edison\u2019s various areas of expertise, his words of wisdom most definitely apply to how to run an effective Google Ads campaign.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re a newcomer to Google Ads (formerly known as Google AdWords)\u00a0or have been running PPC campaigns since Google launched the platform in 2000 (with a grand total of 350 customers), you\u2019ve probably given a great deal of thought to which keywords will result in <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/11\/average-click-through-rate\">more clicks<\/a> and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/03\/how-to-increase-conversion-rate\">higher conversions<\/a> \u2013 not to mention that vacation home in Lake Tahoe you\u2019ve been dreaming about.<\/p>\n<p>However, fewer businesses devote as much time and energy to building a <strong>negative keyword list<\/strong>, despite the crucial role that negative keywords play in maximizing the ROI of a Google Ads\u00a0campaign. In fact, our research shows that almost half of advertisers don\u2019t add a single negative keyword to their accounts over the course of a month. Simply put, they\u2019re missing out on chances to maximize the effectiveness of their PPC spend, because negative keyword strategies often wear overalls and look a lot like work.<\/p>\n<p>Stop throwing money away, roll up your sleeves and get ready to seize new opportunities with negative keywords \u2013 just like Edison.<\/p>\n<h2>Negative Keywords 101<\/h2>\n<p>You probably know by now that <a href=\"\/articles\/what-is-google-adwords\">Google Ads works like an auction<\/a>, and the way you get your ad in front of interested audiences is by bidding on keywords. If your bid is right and your ad is relevant, you stand a chance of showing up in the search results. Booyah!<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/negative-keyword-list-guide-1.png\" alt=\"negative keyword list\" width=\"900\" height=\"436\" \/><\/div>\n<p>But how do you <em>prevent<\/em> your ad from showing when you know the audience <em>isn\u2019t<\/em> interested? That\u2019s where a negative keyword list comes in.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say your company produces calendars. It stands to reason that potential customers might search for \u201ccalendar\u201d or \u201cmonthly calendar\u201d when searching for a calendar that features kittens, castles or kittens and castles (and you <em>know<\/em> that someone, somewhere, is looking for a calendar like this). As such, these are keywords you\u2019re likely to bid on as part of your Google Ads\u00a0campaign.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/cat-castle-calendar-cover-1.jpg\" alt=\"negative keywords\" width=\"504\" height=\"360\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Similarly, if you\u2019re trying to sell hard-copy calendars that your customers can use to spruce up their kitchen or office cubicle, you won\u2019t want keywords like \u201conline calendar\u201d or \u201cprintable calendar\u201d to trigger your ads, and you should <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/09\/google-ads-audience-exclusions\">exclude<\/a> them from your campaign as <em>negative keywords<\/em>. Negative keywords tell Google what search queries are <em>not<\/em> relevant to your business, so you don\u2019t rack up ad impressions for searches that won\u2019t lead to sales.<\/p>\n<p>These two terms are a good place to start, but if you\u2019re content to leave it at that, you could still end up wasting (lots of) money on irrelevant keywords. What about other phrases that aren\u2019t likely to end up in conversions, such as \u201cMayan calendar\u201d? Unless your product features major national holidays <em>and<\/em> Mesoamerican doomsday prophecies, this term probably won\u2019t deliver much in the way of ROI \u2013 and people could still click on it anyway, thus wasting your precious PPC budget and putting that lakeside cabin one step further beyond your reach.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/mayan-weather-forecast-negative-keywords-1.jpg\" alt=\"find negative keywords\" width=\"622\" height=\"346\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>How to Find Negative Keywords<\/h2>\n<p>One of the best ways to find negative keywords is \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 by examining a<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/03\/google-search-terms-report-changes\">ctual user query data<\/a> based on how people search. This can be done through the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/04\/25\/keyword-planner\">Google Ads\u00a0Keyword Planner<\/a> and Search Terms Report.<\/p>\n<h3>Finding Negative Keywords with Keyword Planner<\/h3>\n<p>The Google Ads\u00a0Keyword Planner is intended to help you find keywords to bid on, not to exclude. (Google doesn\u2019t really <em>mind<\/em> if you spend a few extra dollars on clicks you don\u2019t need.) But you can also use it to find negative keyword ideas for your list. When you search for a term like \u201ccalendars,\u201d you\u2019ll see a list of related keyword searches along with some data on their search volume and competition.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/keyword-planner-negative-keyword-list-1.png\" alt=\"Negative Keyword Planner\" width=\"655\" height=\"656\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If you see terms in the list that you know don\u2019t apply to your business (like \u201cfree\u201d and \u201cprintable\u201d here), consider adding them to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/06\/negative-keyword-guide\">negative keyword<\/a> list.<\/p>\n<h3>Finding Negative Keywords with the Search Terms Report<\/h3>\n<p>The Search Terms Report shows you the actual search queries that people typed into Google to trigger your\u00a0ads. Once you have a firm grasp on the types of search queries that triggered your ad, you can begin to put together lists of both positive and negative keywords. This method can yield some solid results.<\/p>\n<p>For example, you can sort results of the Search Terms Report by the highest number of impressions, which provides you with a list of the most popular search queries that trigger your ads. This data can then be further refined to show which terms have higher click-through and conversion rates. Even terms you assumed may work in your favor might not be performing as well as you thought they would. If this is the case, you should consider adding them to your list of negative keywords \u2013 even if they might appear to be closely related to your business or product.<\/p>\n<p>Some people are happy enough to make this the first and only stage of their negative keyword strategy, but not you. Like Sylvester Stallone sprinting up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art in \u201cRocky,\u201d only the best is good enough for you. But what else can you do?<\/p>\n<h2>Get Creative with Your Negative Keyword List<\/h2>\n<p>It pays to be creative when creating lists of negative keywords. This concept strikes fear into the hearts of some people (is it wearing overalls?), but if you\u2019re tempted to skip this step, just picture that cabin in Tahoe. See? Infinitely more motivational than a poster of a mountain range coupled with a generic slogan about overcoming obstacles.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/negative-keyword-list-demotivational-poster-1.jpg\" alt=\"negative keyword list guide\" width=\"522\" height=\"415\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Let\u2019s go back to our calendar example. You might think you\u2019ve saved yourself thousands of dollars in PPC spend by including \u201cMayan calendar\u201d as a negative keyword \u2013 and maybe you have \u2013 but there are many more opportunities to eliminate wasted clicks. For instance, a user searching for \u201ccalendar girls\u201d may be looking for information about:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 2003 feel-good British movie of the same name starring Dame Helen Mirren.<\/li>\n<li>The lesser-known 1993 comedy drama <em>Calendar Girl<\/em> featuring throwback teen heartthrob Jason Priestly.<\/li>\n<li>The 1961 Neil Sedaka song.<\/li>\n<li>Something entirely more risqu\u00e9.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Regardless of their intent, they\u2019re probably not interested in calendars of kittens wearing argyle sweaters posed against dramatic panoramas of Cork \u2013 and if you don\u2019t include \u201ccalendar girls\u201d as a negative keyword, they could be costing you money.<\/p>\n<h2>Do Your Homework: Competitive Research for Negative Keywords<\/h2>\n<p>Performing a Google search of your primary keywords is another excellent launch point for unearthing even more negative keywords. Anything that shows up on the first couple of pages is information that Google deems relevant to the search. So if you see stuff that isn\u2019t transactional, add those terms to your list.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/calendar-serp-negative-keyword-list-1.jpg\" alt=\"how to find negative keyword ideas\" width=\"659\" height=\"508\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>How to Add Negative Keywords to Your Google Ads\u00a0Account<\/h2>\n<p>By now you should have a robust list of <a href=\"\/negative-keywords\">negative keywords<\/a>, but to start saving money on clicks, you need to actually add them to your account (duh). To learn how, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adwords\/answer\/2453972?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this guide by Google<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Accept the Truth About Negative Keywords<\/h2>\n<p>So, we\u2019ve established that having a negative keyword strategy is officially a Big Deal\u2122, and that you should put time and effort into compiling your list of negative search terms. However, maybe you\u2019re sitting there thinking, \u201cI already know all this, Dan. My negative keyword strategy is airtight.\u201d Some of the entrants who participated in our recent Grade and Get Paid competition certainly thought so. However, for many of the businesses that entered, the experience was an eye-opener, to say the least. (Check out our <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/18\/getoutfitted-case-study\">case study with the big winner here<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>At the outset of the contest, entrants were asked to run our <a href=\"\/google-adwords\">AdWords Performance Grader<\/a> on their PPC campaigns. After 30 days, they ran it again to see how the results measured up. Overall, advertisers added 29% more text ads, 109% more Ad Groups and 663% more keywords based on the results of the initial assessment \u2013 but that\u2019s not the most exciting part. In the 30 days after getting their first report, entrants added <strong>103,410<\/strong> more negative keywords, averaging around 186 additional negative search terms per account.<\/p>\n<p>Pretty awesome, right? Think of all the money saved! You too could be taking back thousands of dollars a year from Google, so start working on expanding your negative keyword list.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Few businesses devote enough time and energy to building negative keyword lists, despite the crucial role that negative keywords play in maximizing the ROI of an AdWords campaign.
