It\u2019s a strategy known as Facebook ad arbitrage. But as ad costs have risen, it\u2019s also a strategy that\u2019s essentially extinct.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-traffic-ad-best-practices-facebook-ad-costs-1.png\" alt=\"best practices for facebook traffic ads\u2014facebook cpc benchmarks graph\" width=\"600\" height=\"501\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Of course, the \u201ctraffic\u201d objective still has its uses in 2021.\u00a0Some sites use it to bring top-of-funnel awareness to their product or service. Others still use a form of arbitrage, where they\u2019re monetizing via affiliate offers.<\/p>\n<p>The strategy I\u2019ve used to grow my personal finance website has been to combine both of those approaches, simultaneously building my brand and monetizing Facebook traffic through affiliate offers.\u00a0I first started using Facebook to drive traffic to informational content in 2017. Between then and now, we\u2019ve brought in over 10 million visitors, with Facebook being our #1 referrer. And most importantly, our ad costs have remained flat since 2019.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve tested hundreds of different ideas and strategies over that time, and my best practices are constantly changing. In this post, I\u2019m sharing\u00a0the strategies that helped me bring in high-quality traffic at what was an average cost per visitor of $0.05 in January of 2021.<\/p>\n<p>So first, let\u2019s take a look at the basics of Facebook traffic ads and why these best practices work.<\/p>\n<h2>What are Facebook traffic ads?<\/h2>\n<p>When you are setting up a new Facebook or Instagram ad, you can select one of five objectives for your campaign: engagement, app installs, video views, lead generation, and of course, traffic. Facebook traffic ads are those which use the traffic objective and can be used to send traffic to a website, mobile or desktop app, or Messenger conversation.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-traffic-ad-best-practices-ad-example-2-1.png\" alt=\"facebook traffic ad best practices ad example\" width=\"531\" height=\"446\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>Why are Facebook traffic ads so cheap?<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/28\/facebook-advertising-benchmarks\">Facebook Ad benchmark studies<\/a> are useful for comparing what others in your industry are doing. However, they&#8217;re just as useful for understanding what strategies advertisers are <em>not<\/em> using.<\/p>\n<p>For example, we know that conversions are the most popular objective on Facebook. We also know that people who are known to convert\u2014specifically, people who would buy a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/29\/how-to-promote-a-product\">product or service<\/a> from a new brand as the direct result of an ad\u2014are some of the most highly-targeted users on Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>As such, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/14\/facebook-advertising-cost\">cost of advertising<\/a> to those users is higher on average.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, there are more people who are likely to click a link and read <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/05\/longform-content\">a piece of content<\/a> that interests them than people who will <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/28\/facebook-conversions\">convert quickly<\/a>. And naturally, because fewer advertisers are targeting these users, reaching them is more affordable.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-practices-for-facebook-traffic-ads-2021-facebook-users-1-1.png\" alt=\"best practices for facebook traffic ads 2021\u2014principle showing importance of valuable content for ad clicks\" width=\"800\" height=\"157\" \/><\/div>\n<p>A second principle that\u2019s important to understand for running traffic ads is that Facebook\u2019s goal isn\u2019t just to constantly show ads to the small group of people who have a history of making quick purchasing decisions.<\/p>\n<p>To maximize revenue, Facebook wants to show relevant ads to as many people as possible. After all, if users are not known to convert, constantly seeing ads asking them to buy something is a poor experience\u2014which means both the advertiser and Facebook loses.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s also important is that the number of Facebook users in your total addressable market is greater than the number of Facebook users who are in your total addressable market <em>and<\/em> are known to purchase directly from a new brand as the result of an ad.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-practices-for-facebook-traffic-ads-2021-facebook-users-2-1.png\" alt=\"best practices for facebook traffic ads\u2014total addressable market principle\" width=\"800\" height=\"165\" \/><\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s not that the first group will <em>never<\/em> convert.

Make the content good (really good)<\/h3>\n<p>To get the lowest possible cost per click on your Facebook ads, priority number one is making your content so good that it encourages positive engagement (aim for a like or a share).<\/p>\n<p>Shares drive down your overall cost per <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/02\/landing-page-tips-and-tricks\">landing page<\/a> view, and likes let Facebook know that your ad is of high quality and they can show it to more people.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><em>Quick reminder<\/em><\/strong><em>: The more people Facebook knows it can show your ad to, the wider your overall reach and the more you\u2019re able to target users who are rarely targeted. <\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Of course, every marketer thinks they have the absolute best content. So this is where it\u2019s useful to have a third-party perspective on the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/15\/quality-content-defined\">quality of your content<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-traffic-ad-best-practices-quality-content-1.jpg\" alt=\"facebook traffic ad best practices quality content example\" width=\"477\" height=\"456\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>High-quality content is actionable and visual (<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.brainlabsdigital.com\/blog\/how-to-produce-high-quality-written-content\/\">Image source<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>A question I like to ask myself about the content to which I\u2019m sending cold traffic is: <em>Would a subreddit moderator find this valuable?\u00a0<\/em>As any site owner who has submitted their content to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/24\/reddit-advertising\">Reddit<\/a> knows, it\u2019s a tough crowd. So a good litmus test for\u00a0whether your content would get the positive engagement needed to have super-cheap costs is whether it\u2019s good enough for Reddit.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve also hired people on Fiverr to compare and contrast my content to other top-performing articles in the space.<\/p>\n<p>The end goal is to create content that readers find valuable and share or like, as this is what causes positive engagement on your ad (which Facebook really likes).<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-traffic-ad-example-1.png\" alt=\"best practices for facebook traffic ads 2021 facebook traffic ad example\" width=\"600\" height=\"564\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t make a profit or have <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/07\/call-to-action-marketing\">a call to action<\/a> on the page; it just means that you need to provide real value first.<\/p>\n<h3>2.\u00a0Nudge people to share<\/h3>\n<p>While making the content so good people want to share it, you can use specific <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/27\/facebook-ad-copy-tests\">copy<\/a> to nudge them in that direction.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>My rule is that someone viewing my ad should have a specific person in mind that they\u2019d share the content with, even before they read the article.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>As an example, the text on one of my long-standing control ads reads:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-practices-for-facebook-traffic-ads-nudge-people-to-share_0-1.png\" alt=\"best practices for facebook traffic ads\u2014example caption &quot;i wish i had known this&quot; \" width=\"800\" height=\"143\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Reading through the comments, this content is often shared from a parent to a child in their 20s \u2014 both of whom can be my target market.<\/p>\n<p>Personality traits or hobbies can also work well here. For example, in driving traffic to an article on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thewaystowealth.com\/make-money\/gig-economy-jobs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gig economy jobs<\/a>, I\u2019ve used the personality trait \u201cintroverts\u201d in the ad text.\u00a0Ideally, they\u2019ll want to check out the content themselves, as well as have a specific person in mind that they can share it with.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Create content with mass appeal<\/h3>\n<p>Because positive engagement decreases your ad costs, you want a large percentage of the people viewing your ad and content to like or share it. That means it\u2019s best to create ads and content that appeal to as many people as possible.<\/p>\n<p>From my testing, larger audience sizes have resulted in the lowest cost per click. In fact, my minimum audience size is a 1% lookalike audience, which reaches over 2 million people.<\/p>\n<p>For those with a smaller <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/28\/niche-marketing\">niche<\/a> audience, this can require some outside-the-box thinking (which we\u2019ll cover below).<\/p>\n<h3>4. Test different campaign objectives<\/h3>\n<p>I start my campaigns using Facebook\u2019s traffic objective and having it optimize for landing page views. Earlier, I also mentioned that for the cheapest possible clicks you need large audiences.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The big question is this: How do you bring in high-quality traffic \u2014i.e. traffic that will\u00a0eventually convert\u2014 while maintaining large audience sizes?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In my experience, I\u2019ve found that testing different campaign objectives works best.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-practices-for-facebook-traffic-ads-2021-marketing-objective-1.png\" alt=\"best practices for facebook traffic ads 2021\u2014facebook ad objectives\" width=\"936\" height=\"508\" \/><\/div>\n<p>While the goal is still to bring in top-of-funnel awareness by getting people to read your content, there are in fact a number of campaign objectives in Facebook that allow you to do this.<\/p>\n<p>Say you\u2019re a direct-to-consumer organic baby clothing brand. You start by driving users to a piece of content they love, such as a blog post titled \u201cHow to Create a Minimalist Eco-Friendly Wardrobe For Your Newborn,\u201d which features your products.<\/p>\n<p>You then use a 1% lookalike audience from people who\u2019ve visited that page. From there, you create campaigns with different campaign objectives. This could include:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Landing page views<\/li>\n<li>Time on page<\/li>\n<li>Vertical scroll rate<\/li>\n<li>Engagement<\/li>\n<li>Conversions<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>By targeting different types of users, and by publishing content that has wide appeal to your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/18\/beginners-guide-to-target-markets\">target market<\/a>, you\u2019re exponentially expanding the amount of people you can reach on the platform.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Create content solely for lookalike audiences<\/h3>\n<p>Because having a large audience is important for driving costs down, it\u2019s important to constantly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/01\/facebook-audiences\">test new audiences<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve found that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/facebook-lookalike-audiences\">lookalike audiences,<\/a> which significantly increase the amount of people I target, work the best.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-practices-for-facebook-traffic-ads-2021-audience-1.png\" alt=\"best practices for facebook traffic ads 2021\u2014custom audience vs lookalike audience\" width=\"795\" height=\"451\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wordstream.com%2Fblog%2Fws%2F2019%2F04%2F03%2Ffacebook-removes-more-targeting-options&amp;psig=AOvVaw1AoLaZtvT0qLN2rSl7I0Nk&amp;ust=1613063124852000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCJij48jm3-4CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>One of my favorite ways to get lookalike audiences is from other pieces of content on my site, which is at the end-stage of a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/01\/03\/informational-keywords\"> buying cycle<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if I\u2019m driving traffic to a page on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thewaystowealth.com\/make-money\/money-making-apps\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">money-making apps<\/a>, I\u2019ll use the lookalike audience from one of the reviews from a product mentioned, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thewaystowealth.com\/reviews\/capital-one-shopping-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Capital One Shopping<\/a> (a very popular rewards app mentioned in the apps article that gets high-intent search traffic).<\/p>\n<p>In the past, I\u2019ve even created content not because I knew it would do well in search, but because the few people who would read it are my ideal readers.<\/p>\n<p>So, say our DTC organic baby clothing brand from the previous example has found that women in their third trimester have the highest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/10\/cac-vs-clv\">lifetime term value<\/a>. In this case, this company might <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/09\/how-to-write-a-blog-post\">create a blog post <\/a>titled \u201cA Checklist For Preparing For Your Baby In Your Third Trimester.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Once they drive some traffic to that page via their own social channels and through outreach, they can create a lookalike audience from visitors of that page, driving traffic to their guide on \u201cHow To Create A Minimalist Eco-Friendly Wardrobe For You Newborn,\u201d as this is their ideal customer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>This ideal customer may not have been reached if they were just using the \u201cconversion\u201d objective. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Plus, if this company <em>did<\/em> want to run a conversion campaign retargeting users who viewed their checklist, they\u2019ve expanded their audience size (which allows for cheaper retargeting ads).<\/p>\n<h2>Final thoughts on Facebook traffic ads<\/h2>\n<p>As the number of advertisers on Facebook increases, it\u2019s only natural that when deploying the same strategies as everyone else \u2014 e.g., using only the conversion objective \u2014 costs will increase.<\/p>\n<p>Utilizing the lesser-known \u201ctraffic\u201d objective is a chance to play a different game than the majority of other advertisers.<\/p>\n<p>And if played right, it presents a chance to acquire customers at a cost far below what your competitors are paying.<\/p>\n<h3>About the author<\/h3>\n<p>R.J.
