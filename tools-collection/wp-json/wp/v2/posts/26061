Curious how they might have changed as Google has changed their SEO\/SEM formats and rankings.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Overall, these CTRs have risen and CPCs have fallen.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p><strong>Wondering how you measure up? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Grade your account with the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Free Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<p><strong>FYI. Your implied CPM on google search is $57.42. I don&#8217;t think so. In general, I think you&#8217;re numbers skew more favorable to the search network than reality. Just sayin&#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The averages here are the median of our client accounts. I\u2019m happy to hear that you find that our clients are overperforming your expectations on the search network!<\/p>\n<p><strong>I wanted to clarify &#8220;conversion rate.&#8221; Is that percentage of people who click on the ad? Eg. 1.9% click on the ad, then 2.7% of that 1.9% make a purchase?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The conversion rate is the likelihood of someone completing the action we\u2019re looking for them to do after clicking the ad. You can calculate conversion rate by taking the number of conversions by the number of clicks.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why would conversion rate be higher than CTR? By definition CTR is always higher than conversion rate isnt it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No. The total number of conversions will be lower than the total number of clicks, but the conversion RATE can be higher. For example, if only 1 out of 100 people click your ad, but every single person who clicks your ad converts, that&#8217;s a 1% click-through rate but a 100% conversion rate. The conversion rate is based on people who click, not the total # of people who saw the ad from the beginning.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why is there a specific category for e-commerce? Would that not apply to all of the other categories?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Not all advertisers are ecommerce. Many are looking to provide services or lead generation for their business.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Could you just explain what you define the &#8220;Advocacy&#8221; industry as?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Advocacy groups aim to create support, awareness, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/22\/cause-based-marketing\">fundraising for a cause<\/a>, policy, or organization.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is search inclusive of shopping? Or is this text ads only?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, shopping campaigns live on the search network.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Can you recommend PPC networks which are better than Google in terms of targeting and CTR?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Bing generally posts higher CTRs and CVRs, as well as lower CPCs and CPAs than Google. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/06\/bing-ads-performance-benchmarks\">We have additional benchmarks for Bing here<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/17\/google-mobile-benchmarks-by-ad-type\">Google Mobile Benchmarks \u2013 by Ad Type<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We all want to create unicorn ads that have the highest CTRs and the best conversion rates.
