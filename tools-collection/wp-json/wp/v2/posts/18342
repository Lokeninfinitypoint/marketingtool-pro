WordStream\u2019s Free Keyword Tool<\/h3>\n<p>One of the best ways to find competitor keywords (if we do say so ourselves) is by using <strong>WordStream\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>How can we use WordStream\u2019s Free Keyword Tool to find competitor keywords? Just enter a competitor\u2019s URL into the tool (instead of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/07\/google-search-statistics\">a search term<\/a>) and hit \u201cSearch.\u201d For the sake of example, I\u2019ve chosen to run a sample report for the Content Marketing Institute\u2019s website by entering the URL of the CMI website into the Keyword field, and I\u2019ve restricted results to the United States by selecting it from the drop-down menu on the right:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/competitor-keyword-tools-wordstream.png\" alt=\"competitor keyword tools - wordstream's keyword tool\" width=\"720\" height=\"324\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-61616\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/competitor-keyword-tools-wordstream.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/competitor-keyword-tools-wordstream-480x216.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll then be shown a range of competitive keyword data based on your search. This keyword data can be sorted and displayed by any of the four metrics included in the report \u2013 Google search volume, Competition, CPC, and Opportunity Score:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/competitor-keyword-tools-free-keyword-tool-wordstream.png\" alt=\"competitor keyword tools - wordstream's keyword tool\" width=\"720\" height=\"478\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-61617\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/competitor-keyword-tools-free-keyword-tool-wordstream.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/competitor-keyword-tools-free-keyword-tool-wordstream-480x319.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In this example, our results are displayed in descending order based on Opportunity Score, a unique metric proprietary to WordStream\u2019s Free Keyword Tool.<\/p>\n<p>These reports can be downloaded as .CSV files for easy uploading to your Google Ads or <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/06\/bing-ads-performance-benchmarks\">Bing Ads<\/a> account (which you can do directly within WordStream Advisor, too), making the Free Keyword Tool an excellent launch point for further competitive intelligence research.<\/p>\n<h3>2. BuzzSumo<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019ve talked about <a href=\"http:\/\/buzzsumo.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BuzzSumo<\/a> numerous times in the past, and that\u2019s because it\u2019s awesome. (And no, BuzzSumo didn\u2019t pay me to say that.) For content marketers, it\u2019s pretty much <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/28\/free-content-marketing-tools\">the perfect tool<\/a> for competitive analysis, and one of BuzzSumo\u2019s strengths is identifying potential competitors you may not have been aware of.<\/p>\n<p>For example, most digital marketers are familiar with Moz. They produce excellent content, develop their own suite of awesome tools, and also lay on a pretty great annual conference, too. If you run an SEO blog or publish SEO-related content, you almost undoubtedly already know that Moz is among your most fierce competitors. But what about smaller, independent sites that are also doing well?<\/p>\n<p>Enter BuzzSumo.<\/p>\n<p>In the example search below, I entered \u201cSEO\u201d as my initial query \u2013 an incredibly broad term with millions of potential results. Here\u2019s what BuzzSumo unearthed for me:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-find-competitor-keywords-buzzsumo-compressor_0.png\" alt=\"Competitor Keywords\" width=\"1112\" height=\"597\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Obviously, we\u2019re not interested in the top two results, as they both pertain to South Korean actress Park Seo Joon. But what about the next two results? Both were published by Mike Johnson at a site called getstarted.net \u2013 a site I\u2019d never heard of prior to conducting this search. Check out those social share numbers, though \u2013 <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/31\/content-amplification\">more than 35,000 shares<\/a> for each article! This gives us a great starting point for our competitive intelligence research, but we need to go deeper. Fortunately, BuzzSumo\u2019s competitive analysis tools are top-notch.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re going to use BuzzSumo\u2019s Domain Comparison tool to compare two different domains across a range of parameters. For the sake of example, I\u2019ve chosen to compare the Content Marketing Institute\u2019s site against Copyblogger:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-find-competitor-keywords-buzzsumo-domain-comparison-compressor_0.png\" alt=\"Competitor Keywords\" width=\"847\" height=\"420\" \/><\/p>\n<p>BuzzSumo will then provide you with a breakdown of how to two domains compare to one another. There are a range of reports available in the Domain Comparison tool, but two of the most interesting are the Average Shares by Content Type and Average Shares by Content Length reports:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-find-competitor-keywords-buzzsumo-domain-comparison-results-1.png\" alt=\"Ways to find competitor keywords BuzzSumo domain comparison results\" width=\"1050\" height=\"423\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As you can see, the most popular content type for both the Content Marketing Institute and Copyblogger are lists, followed closely by how-to articles. This is already proving to be valuable data, but we can go deeper to see which articles are being shared the most by length:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-find-competitor-keywords-buzzsumo-domain-comparison-results-2.png\" alt=\"Ways to find competitor keywords BuzzSumo domain comparison tool results\" width=\"1040\" height=\"427\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now we\u2019re getting a much clearer picture of what\u2019s working for these two publishers. As the graph above illustrates, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/05\/longform-content\">long-form content<\/a> performs well in terms of social shares, even at lengths of between 3,000-10,000 words.<\/p>\n<p>But what about specific content and those sweet, sweet keywords? Let\u2019s dive into BuzzSumo\u2019s Content Analysis tool:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-find-competitor-keywords-buzzsumo-content-analysis.png\" alt=\"Ways to find competitor keywords BuzzSumo Content Analysis tool\" width=\"1050\" height=\"562\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In the example search above, I\u2019ve chosen to examine CMI\u2019s website. First, we\u2019re provided with an overview of content on the domain we\u2019ve specified, which includes a detailed summary of that domain, including the number of articles analyzed, total and average social shares, and average shares by platform and content type as we saw in our domain comparison query earlier:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-find-competitor-keywords-buzzsumo-content-analysis-overview-1.png\" alt=\"Ways to find competitor keywords BuzzSumo content analysis dashboard\" width=\"1113\" height=\"638\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This overview is certainly interesting, but it\u2019s not what we\u2019re looking for \u2013 we want to know which individual articles have performed strongly during the past year. We can see this data by scrolling down past the dashboard summary to the Top Pieces of Content report:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-find-competitor-keywords-buzzsumo-content-analysis-top-content.png\" alt=\"Ways to find competitor keywords BuzzSumo content analysis top content\" width=\"915\" height=\"605\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The top result \u2013 50 Best Social Media Tools From 50 Most Influential Marketers Online \u2013 is far and away the most popular article published by CMI within the past year with more than 10,000 shares, twice the share volume of the second-most popular article. Armed with this knowledge, <strong>we can use the URL of that article in another keyword tool to examine which specific keywords CMI\u2019s most popular article contains<\/strong>. Sneaky, huh?<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to competitive keyword research, BuzzSumo doesn\u2019t offer a great deal of keyword-specific data. It has, however, given us an excellent starting point for further research.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RELATED:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/01\/competitor-keyword-analysis\">The 5-Step Competitor Keyword Analysis (+Template!)<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>3. Semrush<\/h3>\n<p>Our next competitive intelligence tool is <a href=\"http:\/\/semrush.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEM Rush<\/a>, an impressive suite of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/20\/cross-platform-keyword-research-tools\">keyword research tools<\/a> that can help you identify competitor keywords quickly and easily. You can search by keyword or URL, filter results by geographical area or country, specify different <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/20\/exact-match-keywords\">match types for PPC keywords<\/a>, and examine domain analytics data for entire sites.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-find-competitor-keywords-sem-rush-overview.png\" alt=\"Ways to find competitor keywords SEM Rush overview\" width=\"1333\" height=\"507\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say we want to continue the research we began in BuzzSumo to find CMI\u2019s top competitors. We can do this by selecting the \u201cCompetitors\u201d dashboard, which can be found via the Domain Analytics &gt; Organic Research menu:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-find-competitor-keywords-sem-rush-competitors-compressor.png\" alt=\"Competitor Keywords\" width=\"807\" height=\"246\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For this example, we\u2019re analyzing CMI\u2019s organic keywords from Google.com data for desktop searches within the United States. You can change this to localized British, German, or French Google results if needed, and you can also choose between desktop or mobile traffic data.<\/p>\n<p>Next up, I want to see how CMI stacks up against similar publishers in terms of their organic keywords in relation to their organic search traffic. I can find this data by examining the graph that SEM Rush generates as part of this report.<\/p>\n<p>As you can see below, CMI is very close to content marketing productivity app CoSchedule\u2019s site in both organic keyword volume and organic search traffic. We can also see that there are more than 51,000 organic keywords across the CMI website, as well as traffic data and the estimated cost of attracting that traffic:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-find-competitor-keywords-sem-rush-cmi-graph-compressor.png\" alt=\"Competitor Keywords\" width=\"1098\" height=\"313\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This data is definitely useful, but I want more \u2013 specifically, how CMI\u2019s competitors rank for their keywords. This data can be found beneath the reports above, in the Organic Competitors report:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-find-competitor-keywords-sem-rush-keyword-list-compressor.png\" alt=\"Competitor Keywords\" width=\"1088\" height=\"494\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is where things get <em>really<\/em> interesting.<\/p>\n<p>As the table above shows, CMI\u2019s top organic competitor is Curata. If we look at the traffic\/keyword overview graph above, Curata appears to be of little threat to CMI; it ranks lower for both volume of organic keywords and organic search traffic, yet it\u2019s listed as the top organic competitor in the above table. Why? Because SEM Rush doesn\u2019t just factor in organic keywords and organic search traffic \u2013 it also factors in how many keywords a competitor\u2019s site has in common with yours, as well as the number of paid keywords on the site (in Curata\u2019s case, just one), as well as the traffic price, the estimated cost of those keywords in Google Ads.<\/p>\n<p>We can also see that Curata has approximately 15,300 search engine keywords on its site. What if we want to see what those keywords are? All we have to do is click on the data we want to examine:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-find-competitor-keywords-sem-rush-keyword-list.png\" alt=\"Ways to find competitor keywords SEM Rush keyword list\" width=\"1088\" height=\"494\" \/><\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s more like it! <strong>With just a few clicks, we can now see a wealth of competitive keyword data for Curata<\/strong>, such as the keywords themselves, their average organic position in the SERP, approximate search volume, the keyword\u2019s difficulty (how hard it will be to rank for that specific keyword), average CPC, the share of traffic driven to the site by a particular keyword (displayed as a percentage), as well as costs, competitive density, volume of results, trend data over time, and an example SERP.

SpyFu<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.spyfu.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SpyFu<\/a> is another popular competitive intelligence tool that can help you find competitor keywords. Unlike similar tools, however, SpyFu is a tool dedicated solely to competitive intelligence research.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-find-competitor-keywords-spyfu-overview.png\" alt=\"Ways to find competitor keywords SpyFu domain overview dashboard\" width=\"1201\" height=\"562\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>An overview of the domain dashboard within SpyFu<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s actually pretty remarkable how much data <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/spyfu\">SpyFu<\/a> can provide, even for basic or cursory searches. Data on everything from local and global monthly search volume, CTR, ad spend, advertisement history, ranking history, backlinks, and ad groups is readily available, offering invaluable insight into your competitors\u2019 keyword strategies.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s continue our research by selecting \u201cCompetition\u201d from the menu to the left of our domain overview as seen above. This brings us to a novel and very cool feature of SpyFu known as Kombat, which allows you to pit three domains against one another to determine how competitive they are:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-find-competitor-keywords-spyfu-kombat.png\" alt=\"Ways to find competitor keywords SpyFu Kombat tool\" width=\"1179\" height=\"595\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Even in a single click, we\u2019re provided with a range of very interesting competitive intelligence data. These results are visualized as a Venn diagram, allowing you to quickly and easily get an idea of how CMI stacks up against Curata and CoSchedule, CMI\u2019s two biggest competitors. On the right-hand side, you can select one of several submenus. Let\u2019s take a look at the Weaknesses report, which lists all the keywords that both other competitors in our example rank for, but that CMI does not:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-find-competitor-keywords-spyfu-weaknesses.png\" alt=\"Ways to find competitor keywords SpyFu weaknesses report\" width=\"709\" height=\"289\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This list of keyword weaknesses (or opportunities, if you\u2019re a glass-half-full kind of person) can be sorted by <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/23\/keyword-search-volume\">search volume<\/a>, exact CPC, and keyword difficulty, and allows you to <strong>quickly and easily discover keywords your competitors are ranking for that your site is not<\/strong> \u2013 an invaluable part of your competitive intelligence analysis.<\/p>\n<p>We can also drill further down into SpyFu\u2019s keyword data to examine specific keywords from a competing site, in this case Curata. This is accessed by navigating to the Keyword Research &gt; Related Keywords report:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-find-competitor-keywords-spyfu-related-keywords.png\" alt=\"Ways to find competitor keywords SpyFu related keywords report\" width=\"1236\" height=\"276\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This brings us to a comprehensive table of keyword data for Curata. This table contains data on pretty much every keyword metric you could ever need, including difficulty, CPCs for all three major keyword match types, local and global average search volume, and CTR for each match type.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-find-competitor-keywords-spyfu-related-keywords-results.png\" alt=\"Ways to find competitor keywords SpyFu related keywords report results\" width=\"932\" height=\"248\" \/><\/p>\n<p>SpyFu is a seriously powerful tool, and when you use it alongside other tools as part of your competitor keyword research workflow, you\u2019ll be amazed at the data you can dig up.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Ahrefs\u2019 Keywords Explorer<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ahrefs<\/a> is one of the most widely read SEO blogs on the Web. In addition, Ahrefs is also the developer of a tool called Keywords Explorer, and while this isn\u2019t a free tool, it certainly flexes a lot of muscle.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-find-competitor-keywords-ahrefs-keyword-explorer.png\" alt=\"Ways to find competitor keywords Ahrefs Keyword Explorer overview\" width=\"949\" height=\"586\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via Ahrefs<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Keywords Explorer offers users tons of functionality and data that is invaluable to advertisers and SEOs alike. One of the coolest features, however, takes a slightly different approach to keyword research that is gaining traction in the SEO community, known as \u201cTop Pages.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This feature allows users to identify dozens or even hundreds of relevant keywords by focusing on the topic of a page or article, rather than the individual keywords themselves. Let\u2019s see how this works courtesy of an example from Ahrefs.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you already know who at least one of your top competitors is. You want to know what topics and keywords that competitor site ranks for, so you browse organic keyword data for that site \u2013 in the example below, our good friends at Moz:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-find-competitor-keywords-ahrefs-top-pages.jpg\" alt=\"Ways to find competitor keywords Ahrefs Keyword Explorer organic keywords\" width=\"900\" height=\"559\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/keyword-generator\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Ahrefs<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>As you can see in the image above, one of Moz\u2019s articles \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/how-to-choose-a-domain-name-whiteboard-friday\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a Whiteboard Friday video<\/a> focusing on how to choose a domain name \u2013 has decent enough traffic, but <strong>look at the number of keywords this article ranks for<\/strong> (highlighted in blue). More than 1,000 keywords in a single article! Each individual keyword has accompanying volume data, meaning you can see new potential keyword ideas and their approximate search volume in the same table \u2013 very handy.<\/p>\n<p>Conventional SEO wisdom might suggest targeting each specific keyword with a separate page or article, and you could certainly take that approach if you have the time and resources for such an ambitious project. Using this technique, however, allows you to identify new competitor keywords by parent topic \u2013 in the above example, how to choose a domain name \u2013 as well as dozens or even hundreds or relevant, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/27\/lsi-keywords\">semantically related keywords<\/a> at the same time, allowing you to do what Moz has done, which is target many different relevant keywords in a single article.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to other useful data, such as search volume, CPC, traffic, and search result volume, Ahrefs\u2019 Keywords Explorer also offers a wealth of historical keyword data such as SERP Overview and Position History to provide additional context to keywords that have waned in interest, volume, or average SERP position over time. This data could help you identify not only which specific topics and keywords have waned in popularity, but also how strongly each topic performed at its peak.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-find-competitor-keywords-ahrefs-parent-topic.jpg\" alt=\"Ways to find competitor keywords Ahrefs Keyword Explorer keyword metrics report\" width=\"900\" height=\"373\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Even cooler is the fact that you can \u201creverse engineer\u201d this technique; you can enter the keywords identified in the example above into Keywords Explorer, and the tool will show those keywords\u2019 parent topic. This allows you to identify strongly performing articles and pages based on clusters of semantically related keywords \u2013 very cool.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Google Ads Auction Insights<\/h3>\n<p>Our next technique for discovering competitor keywords is platform-centric, but it\u2019s too useful to overlook \u2013 using Google Ads data to find out who your top-performing competitors are and what they\u2019re ranking for.<\/p>\n<p>To do this, we\u2019ll be using Google Ads Auction Insights functionality. Experienced Google Ads advertisers may already be familiar with this report, but <a href=\"\/learn\">newcomers to PPC<\/a> often overlook this data. To access it, simply navigate to an active Google Ads campaign, then select \u201cAll\u201d under the \u201cAuction Insights\u201d tab:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-find-competitor-keywords-adwords-auction-insights-tab.png\" alt=\"Ways to find competitor keywords Google AdWords Auction Insights tab\" width=\"715\" height=\"203\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve accessed the Auction Insights report, <strong>you\u2019ll be able to see a range of competitive analysis data from your Google Ads competitors<\/strong>, including impression share, average ad position, overlap rate (how often your ads are displayed alongside those of a competitor), position-above rate (how often your ads outperformed a competitor\u2019s ad), top-of-page rate (how often your ads appeared at the top of search results), and outranking share (how frequently a competitor\u2019s ad showed above yours or when your ads aren\u2019t shown at all).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-find-competitor-keywords-adwords-auction-insights.png\" alt=\"Ways to find competitor keywords Google AdWords Auction Insights results\" width=\"1655\" height=\"400\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This data will be displayed in an easy-to-read read report that shows you at-a-glance how your recent campaigns have performed compared to your competitors\u2019 campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>Google Ads Auction Insights reports can be filtered and refined based on a wide range of criteria. For one, you can view Auction Insights reports at the Campaign, Ad Group, and Keyword level. We\u2019re most interested in the Keywords report, and by selecting the Keywords tab, you can filter the results to display the data you need. You can filter results by bidding strategy, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/26\/search-impression-share\">impression share<\/a>, maximum CPC, Quality Score, match type, and even individual keyword text, alongside many other filtering options:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-find-competitor-keywords-adwords-auction-insights-keyword-filters-compressor.png\" alt=\"Competitor Keywords\" width=\"682\" height=\"574\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adwords\/answer\/2579754?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Google Support<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>One drawback of Google Ads Auction Insights report is that it only displays data for advertisers that have participated in the same ad auctions that you have, not all competitors with the same account settings or targeting parameters. This means that, by default, you\u2019ll be missing some data regardless, as not every advertiser will compete in a given ad auction.<\/p>\n<p>Still, considering that all this data is available from directly within the Google Ads interface, without the use of third-party tools, the Auction Insights feature is very powerful \u2013 be sure you don\u2019t overlook it as part of your competitor keyword research workflow.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Crowdsourcing Keyword Research<\/h3>\n<p>Here at WordStream, we often tell our readers that hard data about how people behave is always better than baseless assumptions about how we think users will behave. This is why A\/B tests are so important; they show us what users are actually doing, not what we think they\u2019re doing. But how can you apply this principle to your competitive keyword research? By crowdsourcing your queries.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.seedkeywords.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Seed Keywords<\/a> is a free tool you can use to crowdsource your keyword research. The tool allows you to <strong>create custom scenarios by posing hypothetical questions to your friends or coworkers, which can then be used as the basis of actual searches<\/strong> from which we will pull our data.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example scenario provided by Seed Keywords:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-find-competitor-keywords-seed-keywords-scenario.png\" alt=\"Ways to find competitor keywords Seed Keywords example scenario\" width=\"1058\" height=\"620\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is what your friends or coworkers will see when you create your own scenario. In the example above, users are asked what they would search for if they discovered a fault with their computer.<\/p>\n<p>Seed Keywords then allows you to specify which search engine you would like to use in your scenario. By default, the tool offers results for google.co.uk, but since I\u2019m located in the United States, I selected google.com as the search engine I wanted to use, which gave me the following results:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-find-competitor-keywords-seed-keywords-results.png\" alt=\"Ways to find competitor keywords Seed Keywords results\" width=\"759\" height=\"632\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As you can see, some of these results are very broad and predictable, such as \u201cpc repair\u201d and \u201cfaulty pc fix.\u201d Others, however, are more specific, and may be more revealing of how users would actually behave in this scenario, such as \u201chard disk corrupt.\u201d The tool also allows you to download your keyword suggestions as .CSV files for upload to Google Ads and Bing Ads by match type, which is very handy.<\/p>\n<p>Before you get too excited, it\u2019s worth remembering that although this tool allows you to see what people actually search for within the parameters of your scenario, this information may not be truly representative of an actual audience segment; unless you ask hundreds of people to complete your custom scenario, you won\u2019t be working with a statistically significant data set. This doesn\u2019t mean the tool \u2013 or the data it gives you \u2013 is of no use, it\u2019s just something to consider if you\u2019re seeking representative data.<\/p>\n<p>As its name suggests, Seed Keywords is designed to help you find \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 seed keywords, or keywords that help you identify potential keyword niches as well as competing advertisers or sites as a starting point for further research. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t use Seed Keywords as the basis of competitive keyword research \u2013 it all depends on how you structure your custom scenario.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Tag Clouds<\/h3>\n<p>Ever seen those word clouds that show you the most commonly used words on a page or site? Although this technique is usually reserved for creating inexpensive <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/13\/infographic-templates\">infographics or visual assets<\/a>, they can also be used to find keywords on your competitors\u2019 pages.<\/p>\n<p>There are plenty of tools that you can use to create word or tag clouds. For example, let\u2019s say you run an SEO blog and want to find out which keywords your major competitors are using. You can use a software program such as <a href=\"https:\/\/tagcrowd.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tag Crowd<\/a> to see which words are used most frequently on a specific site.<\/p>\n<p>In the example below, I used Tag Crowd to see which are the most commonly used words on the official John Deere website by entering the URL into the appropriate field.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-find-competitor-keywords-tag-crowd.png\" alt=\"Ways to find competitor keywords Tag Crowd URL function\" width=\"557\" height=\"219\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Based on our criteria, <strong>Tag Cloud presents us with a visualization of the most common words on John Deere\u2019s website<\/strong>. As you can see, the keywords \u201cattachments\u201d, \u201cequipment\u201d, and \u201ctractors\u201d all feature prominently on John Deere\u2019s site, but there are other frequently used keywords that could serve as the basis for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/06\/adwords-account-structure\">new ad group ideas<\/a>, such as \u201cengine\u201d, \u201cloaders\u201d, \u201cutility\u201d, and \u201cmowers parts.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-find-competitor-keywords-tag-cloud-results.png\" alt=\"Ways to find competitor keywords tag cloud results\" width=\"801\" height=\"354\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This technique is also very effective for content marketers seeking to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/09\/21\/thought-leadership-marketing\">identify new topic areas<\/a> that your competitors are targeting, and can be used in concert with functionality offered by tools such as BuzzSumo in our examples above.<\/p>\n<h2>Seek and ye shall find [competitor keywords]<\/h2>\n<p>These are just a few of our favorite tools and tactics for discovering the keywords our competitors are targeting and ranking for. Whatever tool you choose to use for keyword research, don&#8217;t forget about your competitors; they might be doing something you can learn from!<\/p>\n<p>One final note: bidding on competitor keywords is highly effective but can get expensive. If you&#8217;re in need of some lower-cost alternatives, we&#8217;ve got you covered! Here are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/20\/target-competitor-audiences-without-search-ads\">three ways to target your competitors on Google without Search<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/26\/target-competitors-paid-social\">three more ways to target your competitors on using paid social.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Need to see what keywords your competitors are using?
