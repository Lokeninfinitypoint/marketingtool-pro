Who Bloody Knows!<\/h2>\n<p>Eric Enge of Stone Temple Consulting recently published a post with a headline stating that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stonetemple.com\/why-ctr-isnt-a-ranking-factor\/\">CTR isn&#8217;t a ranking factor<\/a>. He clarifies within that post that Google doesn&#8217;t use CTR as a <em>direct<\/em> ranking factor.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s the difference between a direct and indirect ranking factor?<\/strong> Well, I suggest you watch <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/seos-direct-ranking-signals-google-whiteboard-friday\">Rand Fishkin&#8217;s awesome video<\/a> on this very topic.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"videos\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_video\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7b6dbd98-e085-4645-98b5-bc6317aff50e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/mzA7-qNyB5Q?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Basically, we know certain things directly impact rankings (I got a link from a reputable website, hooray!), but there are many other things that don&#8217;t have a direct impact, but nevertheless do impact ranking (some big-time influencer tweeted about my company and now tons of people are searching for us and checking out our site, awesome!).<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s essentially the same issue as last touch attribution, which assigns all the credit to the last interaction. But in reality, multiple channels (PPC, organic, social, email, affiliates, etc.) can play important roles in the path to conversion.<\/p>\n<p>The same is true with ranking. Many factors influence ranking.<\/p>\n<p>So here&#8217;s my response: Direct, indirect, who cares? <strong>CTR might not be a \u201cdirect core ranking signal,\u201d but if it impacts rank (and I believe it does), then it matters.<\/strong> Further, even if it <em>doesn\u2019t<\/em> impact rank, you should still care!<\/p>\n<p>But don&#8217;t take my word for it that Google has the technology.

He included a couple eye-opening quotes that I&#8217;ll share here because they are important. The first from Edmond Lau, a former Google engineer:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It\u2019s pretty clear that any reasonable search engine would use click data on their own results to feed back into ranking to improve the quality of search results. Infrequently clicked results should drop toward the bottom because they\u2019re less relevant, and frequently clicked results bubble toward the top. Building a feedback loop is a fairly obvious step forward in quality for both search and recommendations systems, and a smart search engine would incorporate the data.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The second from Marissa Mayer in <em>2007<\/em> talking about how Google used CTR as a way to determine when to display a OneBox:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We hold them to a very high click-through rate expectation and if they don\u2019t meet that click-through rate, the OneBox gets turned off on that particular query. We have an automated system that looks at click-through rates per OneBox presentation per query. So it might be that news is performing really well on Bush today but it\u2019s not performing very well on another term, it ultimately gets turned off due to lack of click-through rates. We are authorizing it in a way that\u2019s scalable and does a pretty good job enforcing relevance.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Also, check out this amazing excerpt from an FTC document that was obtained by the <a href=\"http:\/\/graphics.wsj.com\/google-ftc-report\/img\/ftc-ocr-watermark.pdf\">WSJ<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In addition, click data (the website links on which a user actually clicks) is important for evaluating the quality of the search results page. As Google&#8217;s former chief of search quality Udi Manber testified:<\/p>\n<p>The ranking itself is affected by the click data. If we discover that, for a particular query, hypothetically, 80 percent of people click on Result No. 2 and only 10 percent click on Result No. 1, after a while we figure out, well, probably Result 2 is the one people want. So we&#8217;ll switch it.<\/p>\n<p>Testimony from Sergey Brin and Eric Schmidt confirms that click data is important for many purposes, including, most importantly, providing &#8216;feedback&#8217; on whether Google&#8217;s search algorithms are offering its users high quality results.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Why Organic Google CTR Matters<\/h2>\n<p>If you have great positions in the SERPs, that&#8217;s awesome. But even high rankings don&#8217;t guarantee visits to your site.<\/p>\n<p>What really matters is how many people are <em>clicking<\/em> on your listing (and not bouncing back immediately). You want to attract more visitors who are likely to stick around and then convert.<\/p>\n<p>In 2009, the head of Google&#8217;s webspam team at the time, Matt Cutts, was asked about the importance of maximizing your organic CTR. Here&#8217;s a key quote that says it all:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t really matter how often you show up. It matters how often you get clicked on and then how often you \u2026 convert those to whatever you really want (sales, purchases, subscriptions)\u2026 Do spend some time looking at your title, your URL, and your snippet that Google generates, and see if you can find ways to improve that and make it better for users because then they&#8217;re more likely to click. You&#8217;ll get more visitors, you&#8217;ll get better return on your investment.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"videos\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_video\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"e52efe5e-2633-40ec-8a8b-65d532ffc912\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/THYguer_JrM?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=421aTJI2Nxc\">another video<\/a>, he talked about the importance of titles, especially on your important web pages: &#8220;you want to make something that people will actually click on when they see it in the search results \u2013 something that lets them know you&#8217;re gonna have the answer they&#8217;re looking for.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Bottom line: <strong>Google cares a lot about overall user engagement<\/strong> with the results they show in the SERPs. So if Google is testing your page for relevancy to a particular keyword search, and you want that test to go your way, you better have a great CTR (and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/07\/29\/great-content\">great content<\/a> and great task completion rates). Otherwise, you\u2019ll fail the quality test and someone else will get chosen.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p>Want to improve your CTR?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Free guide <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLWebBlogInContentTextLinkTrickstoClicks.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_TrickstoClicks_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&gt;&gt; Tricks to get the Click: 10 Tips for Writing Better Ad Copy<\/a><\/strong><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h2>Testing the Real Impact of Organic CTR on Google<\/h2>\n<p>Rand Fishkin conducted one of the most popular\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/rand\/queries-clicks-influence-googles-results\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tests of the influence of CTR on Google&#8217;s search results<\/a>.

This is the oldest trick in the book and it doesn&#8217;t work. (Sorry.)<\/p>\n<h3>Isn&#8217;t CTR Too Easy to Game?<\/h3>\n<p>The results of\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/searchengineland.com\/ctr-ranking-factor-227162\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">another experiment<\/a>\u00a0appeared on Search Engine Land last August and concluded that CTR isn&#8217;t a ranking factor. But this test had a pretty significant flaw \u00ad\u2013 it relied on bots artificially inflating CTRs and search volume (and this test was only for a single two-word keyword: &#8220;negative SEO&#8221;). So essentially, <strong>this test was the organic search equivalent of click fraud<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen a lot of people saying Google will never use CTR in organic rankings because &#8220;it&#8217;s too easy to game&#8221; or &#8220;too easy to fake.&#8221; I disagree. Google Ads (formerly known as AdWords)\u00a0has been fighting <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/08\/17\/click-fraud\">click fraud<\/a> for 15 years and they can\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/adwords.blogspot.com\/2016\/02\/booting-bots-new-botnet-protections.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">easily apply these learnings<\/a>\u00a0to organic search. There are plenty of ways to detect unnatural clicking. What did I just say about old tricks?<\/p>\n<p>Before we look at the data, a final &#8220;disclaimer.&#8221; I don\u2019t know if what this data reveals is due to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/16\/rankbrain-seo\">RankBrain<\/a>, or another machine-learning-based ranking signal that&#8217;s already part of the core Google algorithm. Regardless, there&#8217;s something here \u2013 and I can most certainly say with confidence that CTR is impacting rank.<\/p>\n<h2>NEW DATA: Does Organic CTR Impact SEO Rankings?<\/h2>\n<p>Google has said that RankBrain is being tested on long-tail terms, which makes sense. Google wants to start testing its machine-learning system with searches they have little to no data on \u2013 and 99 percent of pages have zero external links pointing to them.<\/p>\n<p>How is Google able to tell which pages should rank in these cases?<\/p>\n<p><strong>By examining engagement and relevance. CTR is one of the best indicators of both.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>High-volume head terms, as far as we know, aren&#8217;t being exposed to RankBrain right now. So by observing the differences between the organic search CTRs of long-tail terms versus head terms, we should be able to spot the difference:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ba0a1c66-be39-4272-9ddb-f19b7ee51e98\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ctr-vs-organic-search-position-data.png\" alt=\"google ctr versus organic ranking\" width=\"800\" height=\"395\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>So here\u2019s what we did: We looked at 1,000 keywords in the\u00a0same\u00a0keyword niche (to isolate external factors like Google shopping and other SERP features that can alter CTR characteristics). The keywords are all from my own website: wordstream.com.<\/p>\n<p>I compared CTR versus rank for one- or two-word search terms, and did the same thing for long-tail keywords (search terms between 4 to 10 words).<\/p>\n<p>Notice how <strong>the long-tail terms get much higher average CTRs for a given position<\/strong>. For example, in this data set, the head term in position 1 got an average CTR of 17.5 percent, whereas the long-tail term in position 1 had a remarkably high CTR, at an average of 33 percent.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019re probably thinking: &#8220;Well, that makes sense. You\u2019d expect long-tail terms to have stronger <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/26\/intent-marketing\">query intent<\/a>, thus higher CTRs.&#8221; That\u2019s true, actually.<\/p>\n<p>But why is that long-tail keyword terms with high CTRs are so much more likely to <a href=\"https:\/\/thrivehive.com\/how-to-get-to-the-top-of-google\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">be in top positions<\/a> versus bottom-of-page organic positions? That&#8217;s a little weird, right?<\/p>\n<p>OK, let&#8217;s do an analysis of paid search queries in the same niche. We use\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/using-adwords-data-for-seo-unlocking-the-ultimate-keyword-research-treasure-trove-arrrgh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">organic search to come up with paid search keyword ideas<\/a>\u00a0and vice versa, so we\u2019re looking at the same keywords in many cases.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"38a8ce08-6011-4579-8db5-805f0a03e14f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ctr-vs-position-paid-search-1.png\" alt=\"position vs google click through rate\" width=\"800\" height=\"458\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Long-tail terms in this same vertical get higher CTRs than head terms. However, the difference between long-tail and head term CTR is very small in positions 1\u20132, and becomes huge as you go out to lower positions.<\/p>\n<p>So in summary, something unusual is happening:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In paid search, long-tail and head terms do roughly the same CTR in high ad spots (1\u20132) and see huge differences in CTR for lower spots (3\u20137).<\/li>\n<li>But in organic search, the long-tail and head terms in spots 1\u20132 have huge differences in CTR and very little difference as you go down the page.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Why are the same keywords behaving so differently in organic versus paid?<\/p>\n<p>The difference (we think) is that pages with higher organic click-through rates are getting a search ranking boost.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Beat the Expected Organic Search CTR<\/h2>\n<p>CTR and ranking are codependent variables. There\u2019s obviously a relationship between the two, but which is causing what? In order to get to the bottom of this \u201cchicken versus egg\u201d situation, we\u2019re going to have to do a bit more analysis.<\/p>\n<p>The following graph takes the difference between an observed organic search CTR minus the expected CTR, to figure out if your page is beating \u2014 or being beaten by \u2014 the expected average CTR for a given organic position.<\/p>\n<p>By only looking at the extent by which a keyword beats or is beaten by the predicted CTR, you are essentially isolating the natural relationship between CTR and ranking in order to get a better picture of what\u2019s going on.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"27db9ac3-c709-4d41-8ac2-3f89011cf0e1\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ctr-rankbrain-rewards-penalties1.png\" alt=\"google ctr and rankbrain\" width=\"800\" height=\"446\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>We found that, on average, if you beat the expected CTR, then you&#8217;re\u00a0far\u00a0more likely to rank in more prominent positions. Failing to beat the expected CTR makes it more likely you&#8217;ll appear in positions 6\u201310.<\/p>\n<p>So, based on our example of long-tail search terms for this niche, if a page:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Beats the expected CTR for a given position by 20 percent, you&#8217;re likely to appear in position 1.<\/li>\n<li>Beats the expected CTR for a given position by 12 percent, then you&#8217;re likely to appear in position 2.<\/li>\n<li>Falls below the expected CTR for a given position by 6 percent, then you&#8217;re likely to appear in position 10.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And so on.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a greatly simplified rule of thumb:<\/p>\n<p><strong>The more your pages\u00a0beat\u00a0the expected organic CTR for a given position, the more likely you are to appear in\u00a0prominent organic positions.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If your pages\u00a0fall below\u00a0the expected organic Google search CTR, then you&#8217;ll find your pages in\u00a0lower organic positions\u00a0on the SERP.<\/p>\n<p>Want to move up by one position in Google&#8217;s rankings? Increase your CTR by 3 percent. Want to move up another spot? Increase your CTR by another 3 percent.<\/p>\n<p>If you can\u2019t beat the expected click-through rate for a given position, you\u2019re unlikely to appear in positions 1\u20135.<\/p>\n<p>Essentially, you can think of all of this as though Google is giving bonus points to pages that have high click-through rates. The fact that it looks punitive is just a natural side effect.<\/p>\n<p>If Google gives &#8220;high CTR bonus points&#8221; to other websites, then your relative performance will decline. It&#8217;s not that you got penalized; it&#8217;s just that you didn&#8217;t get the rewards.<\/p>\n<h2>4 Crucial Ways to Raise Your Google CTRs<\/h2>\n<p>Many &#8220;expert&#8221; SEOs will tell you not to waste time trying to maximize your CTRs since it\u2019s supposedly \u201cnot a direct ranking signal.\u201d &#8220;Let&#8217;s build more links and make more infographics,&#8221; they say.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c3c6e549-f22e-4fc7-93a6-ede95cb0700c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/what-you-talkin-bout-willis-quote-1.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t disagree more.

We&#8217;ve already seen evidence that CTR is important to Google.<\/p>\n<p>So how do you raise your Google CTRs \u2013 not just for a few days, but in a sustained way? You should focus your efforts in four key areas:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Optimize pages with low &#8220;organic <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/quality-score-tool\">Quality Scores<\/a>.&#8221;<\/strong>\u00a0Download all of your query data from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/25\/new-google-search-console\">Google Search Console<\/a>. Sort your data, figure out which of your pages have below average CTRs, and prioritize those. Don&#8217;t risk turning one of your unicorn pages with an awesome CTR into a donkey with a terrible CTR! It&#8217;s far less risky turning a donkey into unicorn!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Combine your SEO keywords with emotional triggers to create irresistible headlines.<\/strong>\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/11\/09\/emotional-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Emotions<\/a> like anger, disgust, affirmation, and fear are proven to increase click-through rates and conversion rates. If everyone who you want to beat already has crafted\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/learn\/seo\/title-tag\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">optimized title tags<\/a>, then packing an emotional wallop will give you the edge you need and make your listing stand out.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Work to improve other user engagement metrics.<\/strong>\u00a0Like click-through rate, we believe you need to have better-than-expected engagement metrics (e.g. time on site and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/07\/reduce-bounce-rate\">bounce rate<\/a>). This is a critical relevance signal! Google has enough data to know the expected conversion and engagement rates based on a variety of factors (e.g. industry, query, location, time of day, device type). If your content performs well, you\u2019re likely going to get a rankings boost.
