Bottom line, they are the best ad unit for Facebook lead capture.\u00a0This user-friendly, mobile-friendly ad format enables potential customers to provide you with their contact details and further information about the products or services they are interested in. Not only do lead ads allow people to request specific information, but they also allow you to capture customer details for later targeting without the person visiting your site. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Lead form ads include a call-to-action that opens a form pre-populated with any information the user has already provided via the Facebook platform. These details can then be reviewed and edited before submission. <\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"73335afa-7bcd-4945-b909-fc1884f44287\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lead-ads-form.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook lead ads form\" width=\"337\" height=\"278\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Why you should use Facebook lead ads<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>By skipping the need to visit your website, Facebook lead ads make filling out Facebook lead forms shorter and easier for your potential leads.

Give people a reason to fill out your lead ad<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">To get someone to give you their personal information, you need to be offering them something they want \u2013 it\u2019s important to consider this before <a href=\"https:\/\/upbeatagency.com\/create-facebook-lead-form-ad\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">creating your ad<\/a>. Think of something specific to your business that\u2019s an achievable giveaway at little cost and gets you the information you want from a relevant target audience, enabling you to achieve your objective. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">For example, a lot of lead ads offer free content. This is great for people trying to increase their reach and expand their mailing list. However, if you\u2019re a business offering a bespoke service, you may want a lead form ad that offers a free consultation or quote. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Other things you could offer to people in return for form submission include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Competition entry<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Event registration <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Test drives <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Newsletters\u00a0 <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Early access to new products or services<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"34583391-338c-4526-88b4-79ac0328703f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lead-ads-get-deal.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook lead ads deal\" width=\"307\" height=\"514\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>2. Know what information you require<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Lead ads are a useful way to gather information from your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/17\/online-audiences\">target audience<\/a>, but it\u2019s important not to request too much information. This can be time consuming and deter potential leads. And, after all, this would contradict the very appeal of an easy, user-friendly lead form ad. For this reason, it is important that you focus on the information you require to meet your objective and <em>nothing else<\/em>. Facebook offers a lot of fields to request for data, but don\u2019t be tempted to ask for more than you need. <\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ec7b53c3-afe6-476d-8381-79f3b655e1f1\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lead-ads-questions.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook lead ads questions\" width=\"628\" height=\"454\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>3. Customize your questions<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">While Facebook provides a large selection of default questions that can be included in your form, make sure you get the information you really want by asking customized questions. The questions you want to ask will depend on your business goals and what your lead ad is offering. <\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"978f9b06-7121-4e05-bee4-49bea21b3c35\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lead-ads-business-goals.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook lead ads business goals\" width=\"500\" height=\"970\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/1607931762802448\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook Business<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">You can add up to 15 of these to your form, but in most instances it\u2019s better to include just a few at the most. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>4. Target the right people<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">As with all ad formats, it\u2019s important that you target the right people. To gain conversions, your easiest audience to start with is a lookalike of lead audience. To target this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/04\/23\/facebook-custom-audience-changes\">custom audience<\/a>, upload a customer database of your leads and then create a 1-2% lookalike of this database. If you don\u2019t want to target all of your leads you can target a lookalike of purchasers only. You can also target people who \u00a0have engaged with your business, and you can use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/27\/facebook-ad-targeting-options-infographic\">Facebook\u2019s engagement targeting options<\/a> to reach these people. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>5. Verify the details<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">In order to ensure the information you collect is accurate and prevent the likelihood of typos, add a page that allows people to check their details. This is also useful in case someone\u2019s contact details have changed since they last filled them out on Facebook. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">To add this option to your form, select \u201cHigher intent\u201d when choosing your form type. <\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"39dcf14c-7af5-44ad-bec4-5a1e1c1131ef\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lead-ads-create-form.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook lead ads create form\" width=\"501\" height=\"539\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>6. Customize the thank you page<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">A customized <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/03\/thank-you-pages\">thank you page<\/a> is a great way to encourage people to stay engaged with your business after they submit their lead form. Add a headline to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/05\/brand-awareness-campaigns\">promote brand awareness<\/a> and include a call-to-action button to entice your new leads.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"320ce7b1-c400-4072-b0f1-d148573ab19a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lead-ads-thank-you.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook lead ads thank you page example\" width=\"600\" height=\"518\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Thank you page via <a href=\"https:\/\/copyhackers.com\/thank-you-double-opt-in\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Copy Hackers<\/a><\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">These CTAs work well on thank you pages:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\">View website: <\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Direct people to your website.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Download an offer: <\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Allow people to download a white paper or coupons, for example. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Call business<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\">: Encourage prospects to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/07\/call-only-ads\">call your business<\/a> for more information.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Turning Leads into Deals<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The overall objective of each these six steps is to customize your ad to suit your business, reach your objective, and gain high-quality leads.
