By the end of this blog post, you\u2019ll know:<\/p>\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\n<li>What gallery ads are<\/li>\n<li>What they\u2019re designed to accomplish<\/li>\n<li>Who can benefit from using them<\/li>\n<li>Why you should be excited about them<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What are gallery ads?<\/h2>\n<p>Introduced by Google\u2019s own Sissie Hsiao, VP of Product Management in the Mobile App Advertising department, gallery ads are interactive ads that sit at the top of the mobile SERP. Underneath a standard text headline and a display URL, they feature swipeable image carousels\u2014much like the ones users often see in their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/21\/facebook-carousel-ads\">Facebook and Instagram feeds<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4a51f85a-d370-4f24-83a4-2244f174f2fe\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/gallery-ads-devour-example-2.png\" alt=\"devour-foods-gallery-ad\" width=\"662\" height=\"640\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>Via Google.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to the ad\u2019s headline, each individual image is accompanied by a tagline. The headline (which, as always, directs people to your landing page) remains at the top of the screen as the user swipes through your carousel. You can include a minimum of four images and a maximum of eight, and each tagline caps at 70 characters. Best of all, because you\u2019re allowed to write up to three unique headlines, you can test all kinds of combinations of different value propositions and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/29\/great-cta\">CTAs<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As far as performance goes, early testing shows that gallery ads drive 25% more engagement (as measured by clicks and swipes) than standard text ads do.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What are gallery ads designed to accomplish?<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In short: <strong>to more effectively communicate the value of your business<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>People\u2014smartphone users in particular\u2014turn to Google for information. When we have problems or desires, we use Google to learn more about the products and services that can help us. Whether you\u2019re a hungover college kid looking for the best breakfast sandwich in town or an overworked business owner searching for an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/products\">online advertising management software<\/a>, it\u2019s more than likely that you\u2019re consulting Google for help.<\/p>\n<p>As marketers, we buy real estate on the SERP so we can be there to offer solutions to our prospects. The key to driving returns on that ad spend, of course, is communicating the value our products and services can deliver.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Alone, words are pretty good at communicating value. Paired with images, they\u2019re even better.<\/strong><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7e2ea1ac-f144-4dec-815b-0a642c837250\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/gallery-ads-standard-text-ad-example-1.png\" alt=\"gallery-ads-text-ad\" width=\"593\" height=\"160\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>Snooooooze.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Take another look at that Devour ad and imagine the image has been replaced with a description. Although it certainly wouldn\u2019t be a <em>bad<\/em> ad, it wouldn\u2019t be nearly as effective. Why? Because the image of cajun-style alfredo with chicken and sausage does a really good job of letting people know <em>our products taste great and satisfy your hunger.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This applies throughout the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/12\/06\/sales-funnel-stages\">marketing funnel<\/a>, too. If you saw that Devour ad at the very beginning of your customer journey, it would probably leave a strong impression on you. If you saw it near the <em>end<\/em> of your customer journey, the enticing pictures might be enough to close the deal.<\/p>\n<p>Now that we know what gallery ads are meant to accomplish, let\u2019s talk about who they\u2019re meant to accomplish it <em>for<\/em>.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Who can benefit from using gallery ads?<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although my knee-jerk reaction was that gallery ads were designed with consumer brands in mind, I\u2019m confident both B2C and B2B companies can make effective use of them. Let\u2019s start with B2C. Restaurants, gyms, hotels, car dealers, travel agencies, spas\u2014if you sell something that lends itself naturally to visual images, you should give gallery ads a shot. With the ability to showcase several products, services, or experiences\u2014or several features of a <em>particular<\/em> product, service, or experience\u2014within a single ad, you can make a seriously persuasive pitch.<\/p>\n<p>(I\u2019m hesitant to mention ecommerce businesses. Product-oriented search queries will almost always trigger <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/01\/shopping-ads-benchmarks\">Shopping ads<\/a>, which, as we know, dominate mobile phone screens.)<\/p>\n<p>As an example, let\u2019s say you work for a travel agency and you\u2019re advertising Caribbean resorts. In order to drive high-funnel mobile traffic to your website, you could create an ad group with a couple gallery ads and keywords along the lines of \u201ctropical vacation,\u201d \u201cCaribbean destinations,\u201d and \u201cDominican resorts.\u201d How could a prospective traveler looking for inspiration resist a carousel of your best offerings? Sure\u2014they\u2019re far from converting. But that\u2019s a hell of a way to make a first impression.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c6796434-f936-4726-915e-73a399dcf94b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/gallery-ads-standard-mobile-text-ad.jpg\" alt=\"gallery-ads-mobile-text-ad-example\" width=\"525\" height=\"813\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>This is a great ad, but picture it with images of Punta Cana resorts &#8230;<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let\u2019s move on to B2B\u2014the less obvious benefactors of gallery ads. If you\u2019re selling a software solution or digital marketing services, it probably doesn\u2019t seem like you have anything to gain from an image-heavy ad format. I tend to disagree. Rather than thinking in terms of products or services, think instead in terms of <strong>processes<\/strong>. Gallery ads present an awesome opportunity to illustrate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\">the victories you enable your customers to achieve<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For example, imagine you\u2019re in charge of the paid search efforts at a SaaS company that helps small businesses build landing pages for their ad campaigns. As impeccable and intuitive as your UI may be, screenshots of it probably won\u2019t make for the most appealing ad. Alternatively, illustrated representations of the different benefits you provide\u2014better Quality Scores, higher conversion rates, lower CPA\u2014could go a long way towards communicating the value of your product and branding your business as a friendly resource.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re in B2C or B2B, you still may not be sold on gallery ads. Let\u2019s chip away at that skepticism.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Why should you be excited about gallery ads?<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let\u2019s shift from marketing to neuroscience for a moment. Take a look at these six statistics:<\/p>\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\n<li>The human brain processes imagery <a href=\"http:\/\/www.t-sciences.com\/news\/humans-process-visual-data-better\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">60,000<\/a> times faster than text.<\/li>\n<li>People form first impressions within <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/01449290500330448\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">50 milliseconds<\/a> &#8230;<\/li>\n<li>\u2026 and process images in <a href=\"https:\/\/rocketium.com\/academy\/impact-visual-content-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">13 milliseconds<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Consumers are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/3035856\/why-were-more-likely-to-remember-content-with-images-and-video-infogr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more likely<\/a> to retain content that incorporates visual imagery.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.retaildive.com\/ex\/mobilecommercedaily\/visuals-are-indispensable-for-converting-millennial-shoppers-on-mobile-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">55% <\/a>of millennials say visuals are the most important part of shopping on mobile.<\/li>\n<li>People remember <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginepeople.com\/blog\/925-image-stats.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">80%<\/a> of what they see vs. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginepeople.com\/blog\/925-image-stats.html'\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">20%<\/a> of what they read.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Quite simply, gallery ads are promising because <strong>imagery is harder-hitting and more memorable than plain text<\/strong>. Forget about making a <em>lasting<\/em> impression on your prospects; with a standard text ad, you may not be making any impression at all. Get some visuals in the mix, however, and you have a better chance of grabbing attention and capturing mindshare.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s shift back to marketing. The other reason you should feel confident about gallery ads is that a similar concept\u2014the carousel ad\u2014has proven to work on Facebook and Instagram. Take <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/success\/designs-by-juju\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Designs by Juju<\/a>, for example\u2014a company of 12 people that sells embroidery designs. With a Facebook Ads campaign spearheaded by carousel ads, they achieved a 16x improvement in ROAS and exceeded their cost per purchase goal by a mile. Elsewhere, beach lifestyle brand <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/success\/city-beach\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">City Beach<\/a> used carousel ads to drive a 52% increase in ROAS and a 50% decrease in CPA.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3b7da40b-bd0f-45d7-bc04-1665c21bd316\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/gallery-ads-facebook-carousel-example.jpg\" alt=\"gallery-ads-facebook-carousel\" width=\"318\" height=\"642\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>Via Facebook.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Evidently, consumers respond to ads with swipeable image galleries. True\u2014they use social media and search engines with completely different mindsets. But, then again, why wouldn\u2019t the higher commercial intent of search amplify their interest?<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Adopt gallery ads early!<\/h2>\n<p>In the increasingly competitive and saturated digital marketing landscape, it pays to get in on the next big thing early. <strong>Start creating gallery ads as soon as they\u2019re available to you<\/strong>. As of August 2019, they&#8217;re <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/9430978\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">available<\/a> to select advertisers as a beta! The earlier you are, the greater the advantage you\u2019ll hold over your competition. The <em>worst<\/em> case scenario is that they\u2019re not as effective as you\u2019d like them to be. If that\u2019s how it pans out, you can always pause them and re-evaluate. Getting in early poses little risk but offers huge rewards. Although getting in late isn\u2019t <em>risky<\/em>, per se, it\u2019s certainly not rewarding, either. Good luck!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google&#8217;s new gallery ads, which combine the intent of search with the creative of display, are beyond promising.
