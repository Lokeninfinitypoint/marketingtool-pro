The better your ad quality, the lower your costs and the more people get to see your ads. For Google Ads, that metric is <a href=\"\/quality-score\">Quality Score<\/a>. For Facebook, that metric is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/13\/facebook-sunsets-relevance-score\">Relevance Score<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In an ideal world, this quality metric would be hyper-transparent, helping advertisers understand what they\u2019re doing wrong and rewarding those who put in the work with lower CPCs and advantageous placements. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t live in an ideal world. Things like the Google Ads Quality Score and Facebook Relevance score are notoriously difficult to wrap your head around.<\/p>\n<p>As Facebook ads become more prevalent among advertisers of all sizes, so too does the focus on the channel\u2019s proprietary health metric, Relevance Score. Today I\u2019ll dive into Facebook\u2019s Relevance Score, addressing what it is, how it\u2019s calculated, and, most important, what you can do to improve your ads\u2019 performance.<\/p>\n<h2>1. What Is Facebook Relevance Score?<\/h2>\n<p>Relevance Score is Facebook\u2019s measure of the quality and engagement level of your ads. Your Relevance Score is important because it determines both your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/28\/facebook-advertising-benchmarks\">cost per click on Facebook<\/a> and how frequently Facebook shows your ad. It&#8217;s their way of telling you one of two things: either \u201chey, your ad kicks ass\u201d or \u201cget outta here with that junk.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Like the Google Ads Quality Score, Relevance Score exists at the base unit of your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/30\/facebook-ads-account-structure\">Facebook account structure<\/a> (in Google Ads, that\u2019s the keyword level; in Facebook, the ad) and is presented as a number between 1 and 10.<\/p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s a good Relevance Score in Facebook?<\/h3>\n<p>A Relevance Score of 1 is bad. It means that your ad barely pertains to your audience and in order for Facebook to continue to serve it, you\u2019re going to have to pay a premium.<\/p>\n<p>Conversely, a high Relevance Score\u2014somewhere in the 8, 9, or 10 range\u2014increases the likelihood of your ad being served. So a good Relevance Score is a higher Relevance Score, with anything from 7 &#8211; 10 representing a good number to shoot for.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"67ba048e-436f-402e-af5b-421a76806858\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ad-relevance-score-example-creative.png\" alt=\"example of a facebook ad with a great relevance score\" width=\"316\" height=\"408\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Half a dozen paragraphs into this post I\u2019ve used some form of the word \u201crelevance\u201d an annoying number of times.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m sorry: it\u2019s only going to get worse.<\/p>\n<h2>2. The Components of Relevance Score<\/h2>\n<p>While the components of the Google Ads Quality Score (expected CTR, ad relevance, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/09\/20\/adwords-landing-page-experience-below-average\">landing page experience<\/a>) are straightforward enough, Facebook Relevance Score is a bit more subjective. It\u2019s primarily based on <em>expected<\/em> positive and negative feedback.<\/p>\n<p>Once your ad has been served more than 500 times it will be assigned a score. Facebook decided that\u2019s the number of impressions it requires to determine your audience\u2019s <em>expected <\/em>reaction to your ad creative (note that if you\u2019ve got a small budget or you manually selected your placements this could take a while).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1481bbca-e3fd-4feb-8530-823a390484b0\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/components-facebook-ad-relevance-score1-3.png\" alt=\"Facebook ad costs relevance score concept\" width=\"758\" height=\"498\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>I\u2019ve italicized <em>expected<\/em> because Relevance Score isn\u2019t based on actual feedback (likes, shares, comments, views, conversions, etc.). Instead, Facebook calculates an audience\u2019s anticipated response to your ad using your campaign goal and audience granularity to determine the likelihood of your desired action being taken (positive feedback) or your ad being hidden or flagged (negative feedback).<\/p>\n<p>If, after your ad\u2019s been served more than 500 times, you\u2019ve got a Relevance Score of 10, congratulations! You\u2019ve successfully aligned your ad creative and offer with your audience, and Facebook\u2019s algorithm says they\u2019re probably going to drink the Kool-Aid.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, you won\u2019t be able to rest on your laurels for long.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1fbfeb21-c371-48e6-8190-447afde47d10\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ad-relevance-score-component-breakdown-in-ui.png\" alt=\"expected feedback and its impact on relevance score\" width=\"458\" height=\"389\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Relevance Score is not static. In fact, it can fluctuate daily. This is Facebook\u2019s way of mitigating staleness; when your Facebook ad\u2019s engagement starts falling off a cliff, it\u2019s time to present that audience with something new.<\/p>\n<p>Putting a ton of effort into understanding <em>who<\/em> you\u2019re advertising to and how your offering addresses one of their problems\u2014be it a top-of-funnel content promotion or a product to be purchased\u2014is the best way to position yourself for success. From there, it\u2019s all about continuously creating <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/24\/facebook-creative-hub\">Facebook ads that stand out <\/a>in a sea of parental complaints and food porn.<\/p>\n<h2>3. How to Find Your Facebook Ad Relevance Scores<\/h2>\n<p>Wondering where to find your Facebook Relevance Score?

How to Improve Your Relevance Score<\/h2>\n<p>As you already know, Relevance Score is all about the relationship between an ad and its target audience. And you need a high Relevance Score if you want to save money on your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/30\/facebook-ads-account-structure\">Facebook ad campaigns<\/a> and get higher ROI.<\/p>\n<p>As such, the two most important factors you can work on to improve your ad&#8217;s Relevance Sore are targeting (what your audience looks like) and your Facebook ad creative.<\/p>\n<h3>Hyper-specific targeting<\/h3>\n<p>Really <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/13\/facebook-interest-targeting\">whittling down your audiences<\/a> will allow you to ensure a high degree of commonality among each member of a given audience. That means you can craft ads and offers that speak to the exact needs of a given group. If your company offers PPC software for savvy digital marketers, an audience that looks like this:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"93cf940e-89a6-402e-8cd9-1f19fd3cb0eb\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-audience-impact-on-relevance-score-example.png\" alt=\"the key to relevance score is granular audience defnition\" width=\"800\" height=\"680\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;will inherently possess a higher relevance score than one comprised of all men and women between 18-65 years of age living the continental US.<\/p>\n<p>Granular audience construction becomes even easier when you leverage <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/27\/facebook-custom-audiences\">custom audiences<\/a> to target people who have taken specific action on your website.<\/p>\n<h3>Make great ads<\/h3>\n<p>Facebook\u2019s sea of statuses and offerings can create a lot of static; people scroll blindly as a force of habit and stand a decent chance of skipping over your ad. Unless it\u2019s completely unmissable. Like this:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"0b7bf1e0-2078-461d-ad7e-412edc1a714f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/wordstream-top-performing-facebook-ad.png\" alt=\"wordstream's top performing facebook ad based on relevance score uses bold image creative\" width=\"509\" height=\"524\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is an undoubtedly attention-grabbing image.
