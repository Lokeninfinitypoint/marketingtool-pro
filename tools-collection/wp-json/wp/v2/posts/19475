In other common industries, average cost per click for an ad varies from as low as 19 cents to $3 to $4 per click. Generally, the most expensive the product or service for sale, the more expensive the ads.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/27\/most-expensive-keywords\">most expensive keywords in AdWords<\/a> are in niches like business services and asset management.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/online-advertising-costs-top-5-most-expensive-keywords.jpg\" alt=\"Online advertising costs Top 5 Most Expensive Keywords AdWords\" width=\"1200\" height=\"628\" \/><\/div>\n<p>To put this data in context, the average <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/26\/google-ads-monthly-spend-limit\">monthly PPC spend<\/a> of a WordStream customer is $9,813.

This allows you to specify windows of time throughout the day when your ads can be shown. For example, a brick-and-mortar retail business may want to maximize foot traffic to its physical locations, and using dayparting enables advertisers to restrict ads to hours or days when the store is open.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/online-advertising-costs-dayparting-adwords.png\" alt=\"Online advertising costs adjusting dayparting settings Google AdWords\" width=\"302\" height=\"524\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Adjusting dayparting settings in Google Ads.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Aside from offering greater control over when ads are displayed, dayparting can be used to reduce costs, even during \u201csuboptimal\u201d windows. If you look at the figure below, you\u2019ll see that the average cost-per-action (CPA) can fluctuate widely depending on the time of day. This offers canny advertisers an opportunity to reduce costs if ad budgets are being stretched thin.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/online-advertising-costs-ad-scheduling-cpa.png\" alt=\"Online advertising costs ad scheduling impact on cost per acquisition\" width=\"697\" height=\"313\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>CPA by time of day, across both weekday and weekend searches. Notice how weekend CPAs tend to be significantly higher than weekday CPAs.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Another way to control your Google Ads budget is through <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/11\/13\/adwords-geotargeting-local-ppc-guide\">geotargeting<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To continue our real-world retail business example from above, the same business hoping to attract foot traffic to a physical store probably isn\u2019t going to see much return on ads being shown to users that live outside that business\u2019 service area.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/online-advertising-costs-adwords-geotargeting.png\" alt=\"Online advertising costs AdWords geotargeting options physical radius\" width=\"1108\" height=\"549\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Geotargeting options in effect in Google Ads. This example shows a physical radius of 20 miles around Boston.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This is what makes geotargeting so powerful; it allows advertisers to target the locations that are likely to have the greatest impact. Combined with dayparting, this affords advertisers much greater control over where and when their ads can be displayed.<\/p>\n<p>Yet another method you can use to keep your advertising budget under control in AdWords is <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/18\/mobile-ad-strategies\">device targeting<\/a>. Again, using our physical store as an example, device targeting allows advertisers to \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 target specific devices with their ads and bid higher for searches performed on mobile devices.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/online-advertising-costs-enhanced-campaign-bid-adjustment.jpg\" alt=\"Online advertising costs enhanced campaign bid adjustment device targeting AdWords\" width=\"774\" height=\"499\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>In the figure above, Enhanced Campaign bid adjustments are used to modify bids based on Locations. Advertisers can use bid adjustments in the Devices tab. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>This means that advertisers can bid on higher-cost keywords, such as <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/14\/google-voice-search\">highly lucrative \u201cnear me\u201d searches<\/a>, as these keywords often have much stronger <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/30\/commercial-intent-keywords\">commercial intent<\/a> and signify much greater likelihood of that searcher following through on their search by visiting a nearby store \u2013 in our example, the store advertising on AdWords.<\/p>\n<h3>Google Ads: Cost vs. Performance<\/h3>\n<p>Although certain keywords cost more than others, Google Ads offers an excellent return on investment for advertisers of all sizes. The average costs you can expect to pay will vary depending on your budget and industry, but contrary to popular misconception, paid search marketing isn\u2019t just for huge brands with deep pockets \u2013 even small mom-and-pops can <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/12\/does-google-adwords-work\">grow their business cost-effectively with AdWords<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>While Google Ads tend to be costlier than online ads on Bing or Facebook, search intent is hard to beat, and these ads are extremely effective for capturing sales right when people are ready to buy, which makes them worth a little extra cost.<\/p>\n<h2>Online Advertising Costs: How Much Do Facebook Ads Cost?<\/h2>\n<p>Next up in our analysis of online advertising costs is Facebook Ads.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/online-advertising-costs-facebook-ads-concept.png\" alt=\"Online advertising costs Facebook Ads concept illustration\" width=\"576\" height=\"401\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As the world\u2019s largest and most widely used social network, Facebook is a true juggernaut in the online advertising world. It\u2019s not at all uncommon for a single business to operate multiple online advertising campaigns across both PPC and paid social, and Facebook Ads are an excellent way to diversify your digital strategy and drive leads and sales.<\/p>\n<h3>How Does Facebook Ads\u2019 Pricing Model Work?<\/h3>\n<p>Essentially, Facebook Ads\u2019 pricing model works similarly to advertising on Google. Advertisers can set a daily budget for their campaign (regardless of what their campaign objectives are), and when that daily budget is depleted, ads are paused until the next day.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/online-advertising-costs-facebook-ads-per-day-budget.jpg\" alt=\"Online advertising costs Facebook Ads per day budget\" width=\"599\" height=\"310\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Advertisers can also <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/27\/how-to-compete-in-facebook-ads\">set bids to control how their ad budget is allocated<\/a>. In addition to specifying the maximum daily budget they\u2019re comfortable spending, advertisers can also set maximum bids for their campaigns. Just like with Google, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/07\/goal-talk-episode-9\">Facebook ads auction<\/a> allows\u00a0advertisers to control how much they spend on certain actions (such as a user downloading a piece of content or signing up for a newsletter) in concert with their daily budgets. This gives advertisers a great deal of control over how and when their ad budget is used.<\/p>\n<p>While Facebook\u2019s pricing model for its online advertising inventory offers advertisers the control they need to run effective campaigns even on modest ad budgets, it\u2019s still a little confusing to newcomers \u2013 especially if they\u2019re coming from the comparatively more straightforward world of PPC and CPM models. Let\u2019s take a look at it in a little more depth.<\/p>\n<h3>Facebook Ads Costs<\/h3>\n<p>Although Facebook Ads offers advertisers a lot of flexibility in terms of campaign objectives, the costs can still be broken down into real CPCs.

With an average CPC of just $1.72, Facebook Ads represent an excellent ROI for advertisers, particularly smaller companies with limited budgets. Advertisers in the apparel, retail, and travel and hospitality verticals are particularly well-positioned to take advantage of Facebook\u2019s low CPCs.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the average cost-per-action (CPA) on Facebook is significantly lower than on AdWords:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/online-advertising-costs-facebook-ads-average-cost-per-action-graphic-1.png\" alt=\"Online advertising costs Facebook Ads average cost per acquisition\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1085\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Average Cost Per Action (CPA) for Facebook Ads by Industry<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Industry<\/th>\n<th>Average CPA<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Apparel<\/td>\n<td>$10.98<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Auto<\/td>\n<td>$43.84<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0B2B<\/td>\n<td>$23.77<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Beauty<\/td>\n<td>$25.49<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Consumer Services<\/td>\n<td>$31.11<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Education<\/td>\n<td>$7.85<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Employment &amp; Job Training<\/td>\n<td>$23.24<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Finance &amp; Insurance<\/td>\n<td>$41.43<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Fitness<\/td>\n<td>$13.29<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Home Improvement<\/td>\n<td>$44.66<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Healthcare<\/td>\n<td>$12.31<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Industrial Services<\/td>\n<td>$38.21<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Legal<\/td>\n<td>$28.70<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Real Estate<\/td>\n<td>$16.92<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Retail<\/td>\n<td>$21.47<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Technology<\/td>\n<td>$55.21<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Travel &amp; Hospitality<\/td>\n<td>$22.50<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>How Can I Lower My Facebook Ads Costs?<\/h3>\n<p>Fortunately, Facebook makes it easy to manage and control how much you\u2019re spending on Facebook Ads.<\/p>\n<p>The easiest and most straightforward way to control your budget in Facebook Ads is to set your maximum daily or lifetime budgets to an amount you\u2019re comfortable with. As it implies, setting a maximum daily budget means that once your daily maximum has been met \u2013 regardless of your campaign type or objectives \u2013 your ads will be paused until the next day.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/online-advertising-costs-facebook-ads-daily-budget.png\" alt=\"Online advertising costs Facebook Ads daily budget settings\" width=\"1334\" height=\"854\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Facebook makes it easy to manage your budget without getting stuck in the weeds.<\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\">Lifetime budgets function similarly to daily budgets, but instead of being limited to a given day, the lifetime budget refers to the lifecycle of the entire campaign. Let\u2019s say you set a daily budget of $50 in your campaign settings. You can either specify that the campaign should run for six days, or you could set a lifetime budget of $300 \u2013 the result will be the same. Note that you don\u2019t have to set both a lifetime <em>and<\/em> daily budget; you can also choose to set one or the other, depending on your needs.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re working with a lower daily budget, you can also set maximum bids you\u2019re comfortable with to ensure that more modest campaign budgets don\u2019t expire immediately due to higher CPCs or CPAs. For example, you could set a maximum daily budget of $50 and a maximum <em>bid<\/em> of $5.<\/p>\n<p>Read more about Facebook Ads\u2019 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/527780867299597\">budgeting, bidding, and scheduling at the official Facebook Ads site<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Another way to control your online ad costs on Facebook is by taking advantage of the platform\u2019s <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/27\/facebook-ad-targeting-options-infographic\">huge array of targeting options<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/online-advertising-costs-facebook-targeting-options.png\" alt=\"Online advertising costs Facebook targeting options\" width=\"552\" height=\"509\" \/><\/div>\n<p>By only showing your ads to demographics that are likely to be interested in your offers, you\u2019ll get a much stronger ROI on your Facebook ads.<\/p>\n<h3>Facebook Ads: Cost vs. Performance<\/h3>\n<p>Overall, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/25\/does-facebook-advertising-work\">Facebook Ads perform extremely well<\/a> and offer outstanding ROI, particularly for small businesses or brands with a highly niche focus, due to its highly sophisticated targeting options. There aren\u2019t many online advertising platforms that offer a decent return on an ad budget of $50, but even this modest sum can go a long way on Facebook Ads.<\/p>\n<p>Remember: People browsing (or wasting time) on Facebook don&#8217;t show as much intent to purchase as people searching for exactly what they want on AdWords, but running Facebook ads is an excellent way to reach new audiences, influencing them toward your brand when they <em>are<\/em> ready to buy.<\/p>\n<h2>Online Advertising Costs: How Much Do Instagram Ads Cost?<\/h2>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/online-advertising-costs-instagram-ads.png\" alt=\"Online advertising costs Instagram ads\" width=\"990\" height=\"510\" \/><\/div>\n<p>When Facebook acquired Instagram for $1 billion in cash and stock in 2012, it wasn\u2019t just one of the largest tech acquisitions in recent memory at that time \u2013 it was a strategic acquisition that would allow Facebook to expand its already vast global media empire.<\/p>\n<h3>How Does Instagram Ads\u2019 Pricing Model Work?<\/h3>\n<p>As part of Facebook, Instagram\u2019s advertising pricing models function very similarly to those of Facebook Ads itself. This is great news for newcomers and experienced Facebook advertisers; if you\u2019ve never advertised on either platform, it\u2019s easy to get started, and if you\u2019re already familiar with Facebook Ads, launching your first Instagram campaign will be very straightforward.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/online-advertising-costs-instagram-ad-placement.png\" alt=\"Online advertising costs managing Instagram ads via Facebook Power Editor\" width=\"1071\" height=\"728\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Instagram campaigns can be managed from the Facebook Ads Power Editor dashboard. Note that ad creative such as images can be reused seamlessly between the two platforms.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Given how Instagram works as a primarily visual platform, ads on Instagram are typically priced using the CPM model. Not so long ago, Instagram ads cost significantly less than Facebook Ads. As we explained in <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/05\/instagram-ads-cost\">a recent blog post about the cost of Instagram ads<\/a>, CPMs on Instagram used to be considerably lower than CPMs on Facebook \u2013 around half the price, according to consultant Keith Baumwald.<\/p>\n<p>Today, however, the gap between the costs of advertising on Facebook vs. Instagram is narrowing, bringing costs across the two platforms much closer together. When Instagram first began allowing advertisers to launch campaigns across the platform, average CPMs were roughly between $5 and $6.50. Now, they\u2019re inching closer to the $10 CPM mark \u2013 around the same price as Facebook.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/online-advertising-costs-facebook-vs-instagram-ad-performance.png\" alt=\"Online advertising costs Facebook vs. Instagram ad performance\" width=\"546\" height=\"254\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Benchmark data for Facebook and Instagram\u2019s App Install ad format.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Instagram Ads Costs<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s no secret that the cost of advertising on Instagram has risen as the platform has grown in popularity. However, if we\u2019re going to look at Instagram advertising costs objectively, we have to frame these costs within the context of Instagram and Facebook\u2019s <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/10\/20\/facebook-audience\">remarkably granular and powerful targeting options<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Although advertisers may expect to pay more today than they would have even a couple of years ago, it\u2019s crucial that advertisers consider how strong user engagement with ads can be on Instagram. Take a look at the figure below:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/online-advertising-costs-instagram-engagement-statistics.gif\" alt=\"Online advertising costs Instagram engagement stats\" width=\"600\" height=\"472\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As you can see, brands are absolutely crushing it on Instagram. Boasting the highest engagement statistics of any social media platform by far (seriously, Twitter, LOL), this data shows how strong the potential return on an Instagram campaign could be, especially for engagement-driven campaign objectives.<\/p>\n<p>When ads first came to Instagram, only a select few major brands were invited to advertise on the platform. This was not only to maintain an air of exclusivity, but also to test how primarily visual ads would perform on the platform. If the data above is any indication, it\u2019s probably safe to say it went very well.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/online-advertising-costs-instagram-ad-creative.png\" alt=\"Online advertising costs Instagram ad creative examples\" width=\"1000\" height=\"535\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Instagram ads can perform very well, but user expectations in terms of ad creative can be much higher than those for PPC ads.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>However, this does raise the stakes in terms of overhead \u2013 though not necessarily in terms of CPM or other metrics. As we established earlier, the introductorily lower CPMs advertisers could expect to pay are close to achieving parity with Facebook\u2019s rates, but one problem for newcomers to paid social (on both Facebook and Instagram) is the necessity of creating high-quality ads to run. This means either you\u2019ll have to create your ads yourself, or hire someone to create them for you.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, creating high-quality content to use in your ads doesn\u2019t have to cost an arm and a leg.

It\u2019s even controlled by the same campaign settings in the same section of the Power Editor dashboard.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few specific ways to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/05\/instagram-ads-cost\">lower your Instagram ads costs<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make your Instagram ads look as \u201cnative\u201d and natural as possible<\/li>\n<li>Look into which demographics are generating the most expensive results, then omit those audiences from your targeting<\/li>\n<li>Create dedicated landing pages for each Instagram ad<\/li>\n<li>Retarget to people who have already visited your site<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Instagram Ads: Cost vs. Performance<\/h3>\n<p>As we\u2019ve established, the costs of Instagram Ads are likely to increase until they achieve parity with Facebook Ads costs. However, as we\u2019ve also established, engagement with sponsored or branded content on Instagram is by far the strongest of any online advertising platform, period. With this in mind, rising costs \u2013 particularly CPA \u2013 may not necessarily mean reduced returns. As such, Instagram Ads offer very strong potential ROI, particularly for engagement-driven campaigns and for businesses whose target customers are <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/20\/instagram-statistics\">heavy Instagram users<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How much do online ads cost?
