Most SMBs <em>still<\/em> aren\u2019t investing in paid search<\/h3>\n<p>According to the report, only 45% of SMBs are investing in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/search-advertising\">search advertising<\/a>\u2014up from 40% last year, which means the majority of small businesses are still not running ads on top search engines like Google and Bing.<\/p>\n<p>But, more SMBs are investing in SEO than last year\u201453% compared to 39% in 2024, which means small businesses are primed to capture high-intent, local searchers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-channels.webp\" alt=\"smb marketing channels 2025 vs 2024\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1688\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-95196\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-channels.webp 1500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-channels-1280x1440.webp 1280w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-channels-980x1103.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-channels-480x540.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1500px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 <strong>Running Google Ads already and worried you&#8217;re wasting spend?<\/strong> Find out with a free, instant audit &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>2. But SMBs running paid search are satisfied with results<\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to how satisfied small businesses are with their marketing investments, search advertising was one of the top tactics they were pleased with\u2014behind video marketing and advertising and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/reputation-management\">reputation management<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Search advertising is effective at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/12\/how-to-generate-leads\">driving leads<\/a> and can be pretty easy to measure and tie back to ROI, so it\u2019s not a surprise to see it so high on the list.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-results-satisfaction.webp\" alt=\"smb marketing channel satisfaction 2025\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1398\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-95198\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-results-satisfaction.webp 1500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-results-satisfaction-1280x1193.webp 1280w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-results-satisfaction-980x913.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-results-satisfaction-480x447.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1500px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>3. Low-cost strategies have grown in importance<\/h3>\n<p>Last year, low-cost marketing strategies like listings, reputation management, and content marketing were fairly low on the list of channels small businesses were investing in. But, in 2025, more SMBs are investing here.<\/p>\n<p>As more small businesses reel in spending while keeping an eye on the economy (more on this later), it makes sense that low-cost or basically free strategies would become more important. Small businesses are looking for ways to stretch their budgets, and listings, reputation management, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/content-marketing\">content marketing<\/a>\u2014along with SEO\u2014can help them get in front of local searchers looking to make a purchase.<\/p>\n<p>One low-cost strategy small businesses still aren\u2019t investing in, though, is website chat. This could be an opportunity for small businesses to provide a contact method that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/2025-08-27-gartner-survey-finds-self-service-and-live-chat-will-surpass-traditional-channels-as-top-customer-service-technologies-by-2027\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most consumers actually prefer<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc40 <strong>Looking for more low-cost ways to promote your business?<\/strong> Download now &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite30BestWaysToPromote.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Marketing_The30BestWaysToPromoteYourBusiness_Download\">30+ Ways to Promote Your Business (On Any Budget!)<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>4. Facebook continues to be the most popular social platform SMBs are using for marketing<\/h3>\n<p>Social media marketing and advertising are, unsurprisingly, still big hits for businesses, with 66% investing in social media marketing and 56% investing in social ads.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook was the most popular social platform for SMBs to use for marketing for the second year in a row.<\/p>\n<p>Of those businesses investing in social media marketing or social ads, a whopping 91% (up from 80% last year) were doing so on Facebook, followed by Instagram and LinkedIn.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-social-media-channels.webp\" alt=\"smb social media platforms used 2025 vs 2024\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1722\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-95199\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-social-media-channels.webp 1500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-social-media-channels-1280x1469.webp 1280w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-social-media-channels-980x1125.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-social-media-channels-480x551.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1500px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/social-media-marketing\">Social media marketing<\/a> and advertising continues to be a winning strategy for small businesses\u2014it\u2019s a great place to engage and grow an audience while ads make it easy to expand and find similar prospects.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Smaller businesses have small budgets (unsurprisingly)<\/h3>\n<p>I mean, this is kind of obvious. But understanding the typical <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-budget\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing budget<\/a> for your SMB competitors is really handy. LocaliQ found that less than 10% of SMBs had no budget and 52% (up from 38% in 2024) had monthly budgets under $2,500.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-budget.webp\" alt=\"2025 smb marketing budgets by monthly spend\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1748\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-95200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-budget.webp 1500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-budget-1280x1492.webp 1280w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-budget-980x1142.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-budget-480x559.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1500px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And because the report was able to break down marketing budgets by business size, we were able to see a clear correlation between business size and budget. Which, again, isn\u2019t necessarily a surprise, but it should be validating to small businesses who are doing so much with not a lot.<\/p>\n<p>This just shows the importance of adopting those low-cost strategies we mentioned earlier and taking advantage of creative marketing ideas to get in front of potential customers.<\/p>\n<p>We have some you may like here:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/09\/free-and-low-budget-marketing-ideas\">27 Free &amp; Low-Budget Marketing Ideas for Any Business<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/15\/local-marketing-ideas\">42 Powerful Local Marketing Ideas That Work (+Examples!)<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/free-marketing-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">32 Free &amp; Creative Marketing Ideas for Small Businesses<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>6. They\u2019re also less likely to have dedicated marketing support<\/h3>\n<p>The smaller the business, the less likely they are to have staff dedicated to marketing. Which does make mastering marketing strategies a challenge\u2014those often take some kind of time commitment.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s also interesting is that this year\u2019s report found that fewer SMBs were working with a marketing partner (only 34% in 2025 compared to 60% in 2024!)\u2014meaning these businesses are taking on the majority of the marketing work themselves, even if they have no or few employees dedicated to marketing.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-agency-partner.webp\" alt=\"2025 smbs working with marketing partner\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1331\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-95201\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-agency-partner.webp 1500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-agency-partner-1280x1136.webp 1280w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-agency-partner-980x870.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-agency-partner-480x426.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1500px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This may explain why low-cost strategies like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/03\/01\/business-directory-listings\">listings<\/a> and reputation management were so well-represented; they\u2019re often quicker to get off the ground (even if they may require more back-end work later) and don\u2019t require a lot of time or budget to start driving results.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Most SMBs are using AI<\/h3>\n<p>Most small businesses are fully on board the AI train. 56% of SMBs are using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-uses-in-marketing\">AI for some part of their marketing<\/a>! Most are using it to save time and generate ideas for activities like content creation, design, social media management, and more.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-ai.webp\" alt=\"smb ai use 2025\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1296\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-95202\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-ai.webp 1500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-ai-1280x1106.webp 1280w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-ai-980x847.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-ai-480x415.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1500px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd16 <strong>Want to use AI the right way? <\/strong>Free download &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/emergency-ai-guide?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_AIMarketing_Download\">The Complete Guide to AI for Marketing<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>8. The economy continues to be a concern<\/h3>\n<p>66% of SMBs noted that economic uncertainty will be their biggest challenge in 2026, up from 48% in 2025.<\/p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t shocking as the economy has remained unstable over the last few years and the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/small-businesses-and-tariffs-impact\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">introduction of tariffs in 2025<\/a> has had many SMBs hesitant to make changes to their budgets or spending behaviors.<\/p>\n<p>Not only was the economy the biggest challenge SMBs noted, but it was also the main reason they were planning to decrease their budgets in 2026.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-challenges.webp\" alt=\"smb biggest challenges for businesses 2026\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1393\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-95203\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-challenges.webp 1500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-challenges-1280x1189.webp 1280w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-challenges-980x910.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-challenges-480x446.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1500px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>9.
