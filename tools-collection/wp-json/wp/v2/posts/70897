Here\u2019s how.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Think big<\/h3>\n<p>You want to draft a great vision statement that describes your company\u2019s long-term goals and the impact of achieving them to inspire your customers, your employees, and your community. That means thinking big during a brainstorm before narrowing your ideas and messages down.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some questions to start with:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What do you want your business to change for your customers? For the world?<\/li>\n<li>How does your product or offering help your customers? How would it change the industry if everyone was your customer?<\/li>\n<li>How does that value you provide your customers change their lives? How does that change society?<\/li>\n<li>What does the success of your business look like in 10 years? What does that success look like for your customers?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Go through and answer these questions to start identifying the bigger impact of your business. And remember not to edit yourself just yet\u2014giant goals like solving the housing crisis or improving access to healthcare are on the table. This is your vision for the long term, not exactly your promise to deliver right now.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Connect to your mission<\/h3>\n<p>Even though your vision statement should be future-looking, it should still be logically connected to what your company is working on today. That\u2019s where connecting your mission statement comes in.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have a few big ideas that you want to cover, pair these up with your mission statement. Does achieving your mission accomplish these big ideas?<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s consider an example. LinkedIn\u2019s vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce. Its mission is to connect the world\u2019s professionals to make them more productive and successful.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/vision-statement-example-linkedin.jpg\" alt=\"vision statement example from linkedin with their mission statement listed\" width=\"936\" height=\"477\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-70902\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/vision-statement-example-linkedin.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/vision-statement-example-linkedin-480x245.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Even though the vision is an expansive and aspirational one, it\u2019s still connected to the mission. If you can connect all professionals and enable productivity and success, then you can create economic opportunities for the workforce globally.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, it shouldn\u2019t be the next step result of your mission, but it should be related.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Make sure you\u2019re including emotion<\/h3>\n<p>The scope of your vision should be inspiring, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re off the hook with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/01\/psychology-copywriting-tips-examples\">copywriting<\/a>. Once you have the ideas down\u2014the long terms goal or goals and the impact of achieving these\u2014it\u2019s time to start fine-tuning.<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re determining which words to use in your vision statement, remember you want to evoke an emotional reaction.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/emotional-phrases-wheel.jpg\" alt=\"wheel that shows different emotions and words you can use to describe emotions in your vision statement\" width=\"607\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-70903\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/emotional-phrases-wheel.jpg 607w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/emotional-phrases-wheel-480x474.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 607px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.calm.com\/blog\/the-feelings-wheel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>The emotional reaction should be positive, and it should be motivating. Other than this, though, it depends on your brand whether you\u2019re hoping to inspire joy, action, peacefulness, or anything else. Once you determine how you want people to feel in reaction to your vision statement, make sure to choose your words accordingly.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>Free guide &gt;&gt; <u><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite120WordsforMarketingWithEmotion.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_120WordsPhrases_Download\">The 120 Best Words &amp; Phrases for Marketing with Emotion<\/a><\/u> \ud83d\ude0c<\/div><\/div>\n<h3>4. Keep it short<\/h3>\n<p>Your vision statement should be one or two sentences at most. If it\u2019s helpful to create a longer document that breaks down the vision for your company for your leadership team or board, that\u2019s a worthwhile exercise. But that shouldn\u2019t be the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/22\/marketing-copy\">marketing copy<\/a> that you\u2019re using in your branding.<\/p>\n<p>Keep it short, simple, and straightforward. That\u2019s the best way for everyone to understand, remember, and most importantly connect with your vision.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Share it widely<\/h3>\n<p>Your vision statement is foundational marketing copy, and you should make the most of it\u2014-for your company culture, your customer marketing, and even your prospective employees.<\/p>\n<p>You should be sure to include your vision statement in your employer branding, whether that\u2019s on your career page or in your company descriptions. In fact, LinkedIn found that a strong corporate brand can reduce cost per hire by <a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/content\/dam\/business\/talent-solutions\/global\/en_us\/c\/pdfs\/ultimate-list-of-employer-brand-stats.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more than 50%<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>And be sure not to focus only on sharing with people outside of the company. Your employees are working towards your company\u2019s mission each day, but that\u2019s still on the path of your vision. Make sure to communicate that clearly.<\/p>\n<div id=\"examples\">\n<a class=\"subhead-anchor\" rel=\"#examples\"><svg width=\"19\" height=\"19\" viewbox=\"0 0 14 14\"><g fill=\"none\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\"><path d=\"M0 0h14v14H0z\"><\/path><path d=\"M7.45 9.887l-1.62 1.621c-.92.92-2.418.92-3.338 0a2.364 2.364 0 0 1 0-3.339l1.62-1.62-1.273-1.272-1.62 1.62a4.161 4.161 0 1 0 5.885 5.884l1.62-1.62L7.45 9.886zM5.527 5.135L7.17 3.492c.92-.92 2.418-.92 3.339 0 .92.92.92 2.418 0 3.339L8.866 8.473l1.272 1.273 1.644-1.643A4.161 4.161 0 1 0 5.897 2.22L4.254 3.863l1.272 1.272zm-.66 3.998a.749.749 0 0 1 0-1.06l2.208-2.206a.749.749 0 1 1 1.06 1.06L5.928 9.133a.75.75 0 0 1-1.061 0z\"><\/path><\/g><\/svg><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>11 inspiring vision statement examples<\/h2>\n<\/div>\n<p>I don\u2019t know about you, but I hate starting from a blank page.
