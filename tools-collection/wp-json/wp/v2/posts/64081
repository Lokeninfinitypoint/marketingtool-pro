However, as clear-cut proof that you should only use the conclusions from studies like these as a baseline to find your own time to post, Hootsuite dug into its own data and found that the best time for its own account to post on Facebook is at 6:15am and 12:15pm on weekdays\u2014which is outside of those hours.<br \/>\n<a id=\"day\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Best times to post on Facebook by day<\/h2>\n<p>Coschedule&#8217;s data also breaks down the best time to post on Facebook by day of the week.

Specifically, the best time to post for the agriculture, food, beverage, and hospitality industries is 9 am-12 pm. HubSpot mentioned that 50% of respondents in the ag, food, and beverage industries selected this window as the best time to post while 100% in the hospitality industry chose it.<\/p>\n<h3>Sprout Social<\/h3>\n<p>Sprout Social was able to drill down to specific posting times for <a href=\"https:\/\/sproutsocial.com\/insights\/best-times-to-post-on-facebook\/#facebook-industry-times\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10 different industries<\/a>. Some industries still follow the typical before work\/at lunch\/after work check-in cadence.

Use Facebook Insights<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/24\/facebook-insights\">Facebook\u2019s built-in analytics<\/a> platform tells you when your audience is most active during the week and at what time, based on parameters and characteristics you choose. You should also look back on your past posts that generated solid engagement and see if there were any patterns in posting days or times.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/best-time-to-post-on-facebook-insights.png\" alt=\"how to find your best time to post on facebook - facebook insights dashboard\" width=\"720\" height=\"420\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64086 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/best-time-to-post-on-facebook-insights.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/best-time-to-post-on-facebook-insights-480x280.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>2. Do your own market research<\/h3>\n<p>If Insights isn\u2019t giving you the info you need, do your own customer research for the most specific, tailored results. This doesn\u2019t have to be complicated. Offer customers 10% off their next order if they fill out a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/10\/best-online-survey-tools\">survey<\/a>. Ask simple, multiple-choice questions about what they want to see on Facebook and when they\u2019re the most active on the site. Or host a focus group with a few active customers to identify their social media behaviors and preferences.<\/p>\n<h3>3. If all else fails \u2014 trial and error<\/h3>\n<p>If all of this strategy is overwhelming, you can always try the KISS (keep it super simple) method. Post online when it makes sense to you or is most convenient. Then track your posts for a month. At the end of the month, look at the top performers and see if there\u2019s any common ground with posting times. Keep posting at that time to see if engagement stays high; if not, adjust accordingly.<\/p>\n<h2>Become a Facebook posting powerhouse<\/h2>\n<p>Well, there you have it, clear as mud. The definitive answer on when to post on Facebook? It depends. The good news is, posting time is only one small part of earning engagement. Focus on producing things your audience will enjoy reading and commenting on, and go from there.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re going to do research on your audience (and you should), use it to learn what content they most want to interact with. Then pick one of these posting time suggestions, give it a shot, and adjust as needed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Want more ideal social media posting times? <\/strong>Two additional posts, comin&#8217; in hot:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/09\/best-time-to-post-on-tiktok\">The Best Time to Post on TikTok<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/12\/01\/best-time-to-post-on-instagram\">The Best Time to Post on Instagram<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/08\/best-time-to-post-on-youtube\">The Best Time to Post on YouTube<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Four studies, two super-helpful visuals, one way to find out.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87,"featured_media":64209,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[7],"tags":[],"dipi_cpt_category":[],"class_list":["post-64081","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-social-media"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v25.8 -
