Fortunately, there is a solution. I\u2019m talking about the trusty marketing one-pager (aka a one-sheet or sell sheet). In this post, I&#8217;m going to cover:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What a one-pager is (and what it is not), and why it is essential for marketing.<\/li>\n<li>The core elements you need when writing a one-sheet (with copy suggestions).<\/li>\n<li>Real examples of marketing one-pagers to help you visualize and gain some inspiration.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;ll also provide some tools and resources that can help you bring a great one-pager to life for your business. So let&#8217;s get started.<\/p>\n<div id=\"what-is-a-one-pager\"><\/div>\n<h2>What is a marketing one-pager?<\/h2>\n<p>As you may have deduced, it\u2019s a <em>single page <\/em>that distills down what your company does and for whom. (It can also be a single page about what a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/29\/how-to-promote-a-product\"><em>product<\/em> or <em>service<\/em><\/a> does for specific target markets.)<\/p>\n<p>Think of the one-sheet as what\u2019s commonly called an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/16\/elevator-pitch-examples-templates\">elevator speech or pitch<\/a>. The name suggests that your\u00a0marketing message should be delivered in the time span of an elevator ride. Its general purpose is to intrigue the listener enough to want to hear the entire <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\">value proposition<\/a> in the\u00a0near future.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Its general purpose is to intrigue the listener enough to want to hear the entire proposition in the\u00a0near future.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The noticeable difference with a marketing one-sheet is that it&#8217;s in written format and is portable: it can be\u00a0emailed, shared on social media, downloaded, printed out and mailed, and so forth.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing20one-pager20example_0.png\" alt=\"marketing one-pager example\" width=\"396\" height=\"724\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/how-write-one-pager-kaego-ogbechie-rust\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>One-pager example source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>So while your homepage might have a lot of the core information about your business, it&#8217;s designed to send visitors out to its other pages, where they can get a holistic view of your business. With a one-pager, you present a full snapshot of your business in, well, one page.<\/p>\n<p>An effective marketing one-pager quickly orients the reader to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/07\/unique-selling-proposition\">value of your business<\/a>, whether the reader is a\u00a0customer, investor, potential partner, etc.\u00a0Its overarching benefit is that it provides the clear, concise, benefits-driven communication that people desire when learning about a business.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><em>The overarching benefit of a one-sheeter: It forces clear, concise, benefits-driven communication.<\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\ud83d\udcda <strong>Free guide download &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite120WordsforMarketingWithEmotion.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_120WordsPhrases_Download\">135 of the Best Words &amp; Phrases for Marketing with Emotion<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"do-i-need-marketing-one-pager\"><\/div>\n<h2>Do I need a marketing one-pager?<\/h2>\n<p>Aside from the scenario above, the one-pager\u00a0is becoming a necessity in companies\u2019 and individuals\u2019 marketing toolkits.

And it\u2019s doing so precisely because of its brevity. Moreover, it has tangible marketing value: It narrows your prospect\u2019s focus (amid all the distractions of today), which bolsters your engagement chances.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing20one-pager20brevity_0.png\" alt=\"marketing one-pager brevity\" width=\"800\" height=\"351\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>So the answer to the above question? Yes, you need a marketing one-pager, to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide a clear snapshot of your business in a noisy and content-saturated world.<\/li>\n<li>Align with <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/18\/post-covid-19-customers\">current consumer behaviors<\/a> and attention spans.<\/li>\n<li>Increase the chances of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/04\/nurture-marketing\">further engagement by prospects<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Convey your company&#8217;s value.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"how-to-create-one-pager\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to build your marketing one-pager<\/h2>\n<p>When\u00a0assembling your one-sheet, be selective about what you include. The layout and design are paramount. The one-sheeter must be visually appealing and inviting to read\u2014without making it look like a lot of work to get through. Ultimately, your reader must comprehend it quickly and absorb the material in a useful way. The key here, and as is the case with any <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/03\/copywriting-examples\">copywriting<\/a>, you want the reader to <strong>take action<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Below I will provide the <strong>essential elements<\/strong> your one-pager should have (note: several real-world examples follow below). The pieces follow the typical top, middle, and bottom flow for written material. (For more copywriting help, these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/16\/copywriting-formulas\">formulas<\/a> might be of interest to you).<\/p>\n<p>Are there exceptions to the layout and elements? Of course! This is marketing, and grey areas abound. But these elements should typically\u00a0outweigh any <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/13\/retargeting-ad-ideas\">creative, outside-the-lines thinking<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Elements to have at the top of your one-pager<\/h3>\n<p>Here are the elements you&#8217;ll want at the top of your one-sheet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Company name and logo: <\/strong>Kind of a no-brainer here, right? You want to let the reader know who the content is from. Be mindful of the fact you have limited space\u2014it is one sheet after all.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pain points: <\/strong>Call out what your target audience suffers from or needs help with. Be as specific as possible. Remember: you can&#8217;t be everything to everybody. Test this element of the one-sheeter repeatedly until you find the best performer. In essence, your<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/28\/pain-points\"> pain point i<\/a>s your headline for your one-sheeter. So it has to grab attention.<\/p>\n<p>For example, instead of saying something like \u201cThe Bay Area\u2019s Number One HVAC Company\u201d \u2013 bland, boring \u2013 it could be \u201cHad Enough of Your Outdated Furnace Giving You the Cold Shoulder at Night?\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>The bottom line is, you\u2019re hoping the reader is nodding her head \u201cyes\u201d when reading the pain point(s) of your one-sheet.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Solution: <\/strong>This is the <strong>pivotal point<\/strong> of the one-sheeter. It&#8217;s where you give your reader what they want more than anything, and that&#8217;s HOPE\u2014hope that you can solve their problems. So if you\u2019re our HVAC friend, then lay it out for the reader.<\/p>\n<p>For example:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cWe\u2019ve helped Bay Area folks stay cozy at night since 1948.

You have so much to offer and want to tell it all, but when it comes to your one-sheet, resist\u00a0the urge to make it all about your company. Make it about how your company knows and\u00a0is the solution to your customer&#8217;s problems.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>The one-sheeter is about the customer.
