In this post I\u2019m going to walk you through the process I\u2019ve used at my agency, Rank Tree, to usurp competitors, <em>Game of Thrones<\/em>-style<em>,<\/em> on my clients\u2019 behalf.<\/p>\n<h3>Table of contents<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#what\">What is competitor keyword analysis?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#how\">How to do competitor keyword analysis<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#tools\">Competitor keyword analysis tools<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#template\">Competitor keyword analysis template<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a id=\"what\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>What is a competitor keyword analysis?<\/h2>\n<p>A competitor keyword analysis is the process of figuring out the queries your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/competitive-analysis\">competitors<\/a> are ranking for in search results, and reverse engineering what they did to outrank them.<\/p>\n<p>It can be used for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">doing keyword research for both SEO and PPC<\/a>, and is one of the quickest and easiest ways to find the highest intent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/keyword-prioritization\">keywords<\/a> for your business (meaning those that lead to conversions on your website and sales).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/semrush-competitor-keyword-analysis.png\" alt=\"competitor keyword analysis example using semrush\" width=\"460\" height=\"383\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61484\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/features\/organic-research\/?second_level_id=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>And I can verify this. Competitor keywords, in just about every campaign we do, are one of the biggest factors in the SEO decisions we make.<\/p>\n<p>But despite its wonderful powers, a lot of people do it wrong. And making the same common mistakes other people do can completely sabotage you. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll avoid in the process below.<br \/>\n<a id=\"how\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>How to do quick &amp; effective competitor keyword analysis<\/h2>\n<p>Use this process to find what I call <strong>golden keywords<\/strong>: high-intent, high-volume keywords that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/11\/14\/how-to-rank-for-a-keyword\">your site can rank for<\/a> quickly.<\/p>\n<h3>Step #1: Understand what your customers search<\/h3>\n<p>One of the most common mistakes people make with SEO and PPC in general is chasing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/23\/keyword-search-volume\">keywords with high volume<\/a>. This is deadly because ranking for a high volume keyword doesn\u2019t always (and often doesn\u2019t) translate into leads and conversions.<\/p>\n<p>For example, the keyword &#8220;content marketing&#8221; has a monthly search volume of 14,000. I could rank my site for this keyword and get thousands of visitors, but none of them are going to turn into customers. The people searching that phrase in Google are simply trying to figure out what content marketing is. Most of them likely aren\u2019t looking to purchase content marketing services.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/keyword-intent-volume.png\" alt=\"keyword volume vs likelihood of conversion \" width=\"534\" height=\"330\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61477\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/keyword-intent-volume.png 534w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/keyword-intent-volume-480x297.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 534px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why figuring out what your customers actually search in Google before you begin this process is so important. To do this, you need to know far more than just your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">target audience&#8217;s<\/a> demographics. You need to know:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Questions they ask<\/li>\n<li>Problems they struggle with<\/li>\n<li>Goals they have<\/li>\n<li>Things they talk about<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This helps you map out keywords based on things your customers think and struggle with while they\u2019re at the top, middle, and bottom of your funnel. And this context is what separates sites with tons of traffic but no conversions from sites with tons of traffic <em>and<\/em> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/website-conversion\">tons of conversions<\/a>. If you need help with this, I created this <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.writesonic.com\/how-to-create-a-content-plan-that-drives-traffic-and-leads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">step-by-step process for mapping keywords to your funnel<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/keyword-funnel.png\" alt=\"keyword intent funnel\" width=\"538\" height=\"465\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61478\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/keyword-funnel.png 538w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/keyword-funnel-480x414.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 538px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Blog_InContentTextLink_FKT\"><strong><em>Not sure what your audience is searching? Use our Free Keyword Tool to find out!<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Step #2: Determine your top 3 competitors<\/h3>\n<p>With a mile-deep knowledge of what your potential customers search in Google, it\u2019s time to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/18\/ppc-competitor-analysis\">identify your top competitors<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>There are likely hundreds of different companies providing products or services that are somewhat similar to yours, but for this exercise, we need to identify your main <strong>three<\/strong> competitors.<\/p>\n<p>There are two main reasons I recommend only looking for your top three competitors:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>No one has time to perform competitor keyword research on 100 competitors.<\/li>\n<li>Your closest competitors are your best bet for finding the highest intent keywords in your market.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This is the 80\/20 of competitor keyword research and I\u2019ve found tons of amazing keywords countless times from only researching three competitors.<\/p>\n<p><strong>We\u2019re looking for those competitors who are the bane of your existence. The ones who:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Target the same customer base.<\/li>\n<li>Are most similar to you (in terms of products or services).<\/li>\n<li>Stay on your mind the most.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a id=\"tools\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Step 3. Select your competitor keyword analysis tools<\/h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/09\/competitor-keywords\">tool you use to find competitor keywords<\/a> can make or break you. Why? Because the metrics these tools provide dictate which keywords you decide to go after, and some tools have more accurate metrics than others.<\/p>\n<p>I recommend going with more well-known tools with access to tons of data because they will have more accurate metrics on just how much a term gets searched and how competitive it is. I usually use a combination of:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>SEO tools like Ahrefs and Semrush to identify the keywords.<\/li>\n<li>Reporting tools like Google Search Console and <a href=\"https:\/\/measuremindsgroup.com\/set-up-and-understand-google-analytics-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Analytics 4<\/a> to make comparisons between your competitive analysis and the existing traffic coming to your site. You may find you\u2019re already hitting some of the keywords bubbling up in your research and that your content just needs refinement (can we interest you in some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/05\/blog-post-templates\">SEO-optimized blog post templates<\/a>?).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/competitor-keyword-analysis-search-console.png\" alt=\"google search console search appearance report\" width=\"720\" height=\"420\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-61486\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/competitor-keyword-analysis-search-console.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/competitor-keyword-analysis-search-console-480x280.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not suggesting these are the <em>only <\/em>tools you should use\u2013just make sure you understand (at a high level) how a tool is calculating its metrics. Pass on any tool that doesn\u2019t have a track record of accurate data and calculations. Too many people completely ignore this to their own peril.<\/p>\n<h3>Step #4: Analyze your competitors&#8217; URLs<\/h3>\n<p>Now we\u2019re down to the good stuff. Grab the URLs of your top three competitors selected in Step #2 and use your tool of choice to analyze the keywords they rank for.<\/p>\n<p>Most tools will have some version of a \u201cSite Explorer\u201d like Ahrefs has where you can see paid keywords, organic keywords, backlinks, rankings, and more for whatever URL you enter.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/competitor-keyword-analysis-example.png\" alt=\"competitor keyword analysis example in ahrefs\" width=\"720\" height=\"372\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-61480\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/competitor-keyword-analysis-example.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/competitor-keyword-analysis-example-480x248.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>In this example, I filtered the keywords to contain &#8220;how to&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Some tools also have keyword or content gap reports where you can enter multiple competitors and compare their rankings to yours with the click of a button.

Identify your golden keywords<\/h3>\n<p>Regardless of which tool you use, the key here is identifying keywords your competitors rank for that:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Drive the right kind of visitors (i.e. they drive customers, not just visitors).<\/li>\n<li>You can <a href=\"https:\/\/themistakenman.com\/best-ai-content-writing-softwares\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">create content<\/a> (or optimize existing content) for that\u2019s better than your competitors.<\/li>\n<li>Have enough search volume to be worth investing towards.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>These are the \u201cgolden keywords\u201d we talked about in Step #1\u2014the ones you should try to steal from your competitors.

Google wants to give people the best answer to their query, so we can reasonably assume that the top-ranking results provide the best answers (in Google\u2019s opinion) in most cases.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes you\u2019ll find a keyword you think is a home run and then the SERP will show completely irrelevant results or a branded term for a product, service, or company that you\u2019d never want to waste your time on.<\/p>\n<h4>Don\u2019t just look at keyword difficulty metrics<\/h4>\n<p>Generally speaking, keyword difficulty metrics measure the number of links the top-ranking URLs have for a particular keyword. They aren\u2019t 100% accurate measurements of how hard it will be to rank.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why I recommend also looking at the Domain Rating (DR) or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/12\/domain-authority\">Domain Authority (DA)<\/a> of each of the top results for any keywords you\u2019re considering. Sometimes you\u2019ll see a keyword that a tool says is \u201cvery hard\u201d with super-low DR sites (like 20) in the top 10, and vice versa. This is usually an indicator that it\u2019s actually easier or harder to rank for than the difficulty metrics claim.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/domain-authority-example-moz-serp-analysis.png\" alt=\"domain authority - moz serp analysis example\" width=\"600\" height=\"441\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-55534\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/domain-authority-example-moz-serp-analysis.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/domain-authority-example-moz-serp-analysis-480x353.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Make competitive keyword analysis a staple in your PPC &amp; SEO strategies<\/h2>\n<p>Competitive keyword research helps you quickly and easily uncover the best keywords in your niche. It\u2019s by far the most fruitful strategy I\u2019ve used, and I know many people who almost solely find their keywords this way.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, this is a quality over quantity game. The right traffic is better than a lot of traffic. And this process will help you define the \u201cright\u201d traffic for your site.
