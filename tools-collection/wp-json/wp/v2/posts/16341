Put more eloquently (thanks, Sridhar), \u201cPeople don\u2019t see value in advertising if they don\u2019t feel valued by advertising.\u201d<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From high-level overviews of recently released tools like TrueView for Action, to the announcement of brand new features like automated shopping feeds [insert fire emoji], Google has made strides across its freshly rebranded solutions to help advertisers meet the needs of an increasingly savvy, mobile, and data-conscious public.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cool? Cool.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With that, here are the 11 most interesting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/20\/google-ads-innovations\">features and changes<\/a> announced at Google Marketing Live. Hopefully we can get through this without too many gratuitous NSYNC references.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Update! <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/24\/google-marketing-live\">&gt;&gt; Google Marketing Live 2022 Recap &gt;&gt;<\/a><\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">#1: \u201cMy Account\u201d Makes it Easier to Opt Out of Ad Personalization<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In keeping with core themes of the event (value, trust, and transparency for those who skipped the intro) the first item to receive any semblance of explanation is the user\u2019s ability to opt out of ad personalization. While it isn\u2019t a spankin\u2019-new feature, the ability to stop advertisers from tailoring your individual experience is an essential step towards, uhhh, not falling into the same hot water that Facebook\u2019s been treading in for the better part of 2018.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This, friends, is a good thing.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"82e9cc8e-2912-43b9-978a-1f01b1af9f41\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-marketing-live-2018.png\" alt=\"Google Marketing Live 2018\" width=\"614\" height=\"383\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Yes, this is a pain for advertisers who rely on audience-centric targeting methods to reach net-new prospects. But offering ad personalization options paints Google as a more trustworthy entity, which keeps users placated and engaged.<\/p>\n<p>This, friends, is a good thing.<\/p>\n<h2>#2: AdWords Becomes Google Ads<\/h2>\n<p>This isn\u2019t so much an announcement as an inevitability.<\/p>\n<p>A mere week ago, Google announced the switch from AdWords to the shiny new catch-all brand <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/28\/google-ads\">Google Ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7084bac2-7900-4531-b3c8-0cdcce4a4f32\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-marketing-live-2018-google-ads.png\" alt=\"Google Marketing Live 2018\" width=\"192\" height=\"205\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With this new name comes better alignment with Google&#8217;s entire suite of advertising solutions. \u201cGoogle Ads\u201d is a broader moniker capable of adequately housing ads across search, display, map, video, in-app, and more without generating confusion.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">#3: Google Marketing Elevates Programmatic Advertising Through Collaboration<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the same vein, Analytics 360 and DoubleClick have formed like Voltron within the new enterprise (and agency) solution called Google Marketing, which will launch in the coming weeks.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Combining these formerly siloed tools allows Google to offer big-spenders a complete set of tools that help plan, buy, measure, and optimize both media and consumer experience. An end-to-end solution if ever one existed. The platform will feature:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">100+ integrations with exchanges and measurement solutions managed from a single interface<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Search Ads 360, which will allow advertisers to plan, buy, and measure search ads<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Display Ads 360, which will allow advertisers to manage bids and audiences from a central location<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But the most interesting component of the Google Marketing platform is the way in which it will unlock collaboration between media buyers, creatives, and their bosses (or clients). In an interface that looks somewhat like the updated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/24\/facebook-creative-hub\">Facebook Creative Hub<\/a>, this feature will allow brands and the brains behind them to generate better campaigns without the hassle of constant email chains.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f08fbb20-2e08-4f59-aca1-77de1a2ec95c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-marketing-live-2018-google-marketing.png\" alt=\"Google Marketing Live 2018 Marketing Platform\" width=\"1024\" height=\"605\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Oh, and one more thing\u2026<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Google also invented pivot tables! (They\u2019re called \u201cInstant Reports\u201d and they exist to help those who own video ad metrics generate answers at lightning speed).<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">#4:TrueView For Reach + TrueView For Action + Maximize Lift Bidding = Full-Funnel Video Ads<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Numbers time\u2026<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>People watch more than a billion hours of video on YouTube every day, and 91% of smartphone users have bought or planned to buy something after seeing a video ad.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With metrics like those, and this&#8230;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"634fbeee-bd46-4ab4-b283-826aac65b74f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-marketing-live-2018-conversion-growth.png\" alt=\"Google Marketing Live 2018 Conversions\" width=\"740\" height=\"452\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It\u2019s no wonder Google is pushing video hard this year through a whole mess of exciting new YouTube functionality.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At Marketing Live, Google touched on two important TrueView features that have been out for a minute now but haven\u2019t received much fanfare. The first, TrueView for reach, allows you to hit more prospects with your video creative using CPM bidding, which can be insanely efficient. \u00a0The latter, TrueView for action, helps you advertise to prospects on YouTube who have recently searched for your products or services on Google.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"56c38464-c029-4ea6-99d1-5d9df99915a1\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-marketing-live-2018-mobile.png\" alt=\"Google Marketing Live 2018 Mobile\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As far as net-new YouTube features go, Google just announces a new Smart Bidding strategy called Maximize Lift, which will help advertisers reach prospects who are likely to search for their brand after watching a video. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blog.google\/technology\/ads\/machine-learning-hands-advertisers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">It <\/a>\u201cautomatically adjusts bids at auction time to maximize the impact your video ads have on brand perception throughout the consumer journey.\u201d<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Using all three features in concert lets you build a full funnel approach to video-centric advertising that leads to, yup, real conversions. That\u2019s right: no more fluffy impression-based KPIs!<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">#5: Lead Ads On YouTube?!<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For my money, this is <strong>the coolest thing that was mentioned in the entire keynote<\/strong>, yet it inexplicably received little more than lip service. Advertisers have been slaying with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/24\/facebook-lead-ads\">Facebook lead ads<\/a> for some time now, but Google hasn\u2019t had a comparable offering.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Until now\u2026<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lead ads on YouTube will combine the unfathomable reach of the world\u2019s most popular video platform with robust audience targeting and the ability to capture the contact information of valuable top of funnel prospects without asking them to go allllll the way to your website before forking it over.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stay tuned for more info; I\u2019m willing to bet a month\u2019s pay we roll out a post when there\u2019s more information to be had.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">#6: Gigantic Responsive Search Ads Are Coming to a SERP Near You<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What has 15 headlines, 4 descriptions, and probably won\u2019t incite nearly as much hullabaloo as Expanded Text Ads circa 2016?<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Why, it\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/10\/responsive-search-ads\">Responsive Search Ads <\/a>of course!<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"e4f63713-1dd8-4e36-b97b-8433c0924489\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-marketing-live-2018-serp.png\" alt=\"Google Marketing Live 2018 SERP\" width=\"800\" height=\"589\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Per our acclaimed Senior Data Scientist, Mark Irvine, the headlines and descriptions you\u2019ll need to upload in order to create a responsive text ad will afford you the opportunity to create 43,680 different permutations: good luck generating that much copy by hand\u2026<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Instead of writing components explicitly for the purpose of working together, RSA gives Google a pool of copy to work from; from there, the platform will automatically test different combinations of headlines and descriptions and learn which combinations perform best. Over time, your Responsive Search Ads will serve the best message to different searchers depending on the keyword they search for, their device, their past browsing behavior, and other signals.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Interested?<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can apply to the newly expanded beta through the Google Ads blog or just wait a few months, at which point Responsive Search Ads will be released (in English only) to everyone.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">#7: Mobile Speed Score Gets a Column<\/h2>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6c85fdf1-3977-483d-84c9-b5e360c8146a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-marketing-live-2018-mobile-speed.png\" alt=\"Google Marketing Live 2018 Mobile Speed\" width=\"1073\" height=\"614\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What good are responsive search ads if your mobile landing pages aren\u2019t up to snuff? Not very, according to Google Ads Project Management Director Anthony Chavez: 50% of users will move on from a potential purchase if the landing page is slow to load.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Just a day removed from announcing that the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/01\/22\/google-speed-update\">Speed Update<\/a> had officially rolled out to all users, Google announced the release of a Mobile Landing Page Speed Score column on the Landing Pages page within Google Ads. The tool scores landing page speed on a ten-point scale&#8211;from \u201cvery slow\u201d to \u201cextremely fast\u201d&#8211;and does so based on a number of factors, including the relationship between <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/24\/page-speed\">page speed <\/a>and potential conversion rate.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wait, what about <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/speed\/pagespeed\/insights\/\">PageSpeed Insights<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/testmysite.thinkwithgoogle.com\/\">Test My Site<\/a>? How is this different?<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Well, not only does the Mobile Landing Page Speed Score column live within the Google Ads UI&#8211;so you no longer have to leave <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/01\/new-google-ads-features-for-agencies\">Google Ads<\/a> to assess page speed&#8211;not only is it automatically updated daily, but it\u2019s the first of Google\u2019s speed tools to take potential ad performance into account when ascribing a score. For paid search advertisers, this is sure to be the page speed tool of choice.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">#8: Cross-Device Reporting Comes to Google Analytics<\/h2>\n<p>Cross-device reporting is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/06\/17\/cross-device-conversions\">nothing novel<\/a>, and reports like the Device report and the Device Paths report have long allowed advertisers to attribute conversions to multiple devices. Now, for the first time, cross-device reporting is coming to Google Analytics.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"9bd816b8-3fe0-407c-8b15-07b16185a625\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-marketing-live-2018-devices.jpg\" alt=\"Google Marketing Live 2018 Devices\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Cross Device reports live within the Audience section of Google Analytics, and are divided into three sub-reports:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/analytics\/answer\/3123674\">Device Overlap<\/a>: Find out what type and how many devices are used to access your content.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/analytics\/answer\/3123733\">Device Paths<\/a>: Discover the last 5 device types used before a conversion.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/analytics\/answer\/3123672\">Acquisition Device<\/a>: See the relationship between acquisitions and conversions.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now you can compare segments, visualize data, and distinguish usage across desktop, mobile, and tablet at each stage of your purchasing funnel&#8211;all within Google Analytics.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">#9: Smart Campaigns: A New Solution for Small Businesses<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Google <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/outreach-initiatives\/small-business\/google-ads-helping-businesses\/\">officially announced<\/a> Smart Campaigns two weeks ago; and it used Google Marketing Live to continue building the hype. Google Ads\u2019 new \u201cdefault ad experience,\u201d Smart Campaigns are tailor-made for small businesses with little in the way of paid search expertise, and little in the way of time.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"658d1fae-738e-4f6c-9281-5968ec8d7301\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-marketing-live-2018-shopping.png\" alt=\"Google Marketing Live 2018 Shopping\" width=\"800\" height=\"429\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Smart Campaigns give small businesses the tools to get up and running within just a few minutes, and drive the results they care about&#8211;making their phones ring, driving actions on their websites, and bringing customers to their stores (at least that\u2019s how Google\u2019s billing them).<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Smart Campaigns are similar to (thought not the same as) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/08\/11\/google-adwords-express-review\">AdWords Express<\/a>&#8211;while fast, small businesses with bigger budgets may find themselves wanting more control over their ad spend. Still: if you\u2019re truly strapped for time and are just looking to get some ads in the field with a smallish budget, Smart Campaigns might be worth testing.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">#10: Don\u2019t Have a Website? No Problem!<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nearly half of all small business owners in the United States don\u2019t have a website (whoa). Among them, even fewer have the time and expertise to create websites and landing pages that are optimized for search ads. As a potential solution to that common predicament, Google is now testing auto-optimized landing pages. The functionality will live within Smart Campaigns, and will provide business owners an appealing alternative to creating resource-consuming, product-centric websites.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"02a1c6cd-c98f-49e6-a1e5-87adda77111e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-marketing-live-2018-landing-pages.jpg\" alt=\"Google Marketing Live 2018 Landing Pages\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Auto-optimized landing pages use machine learning to pull information about your products and services directly from your ad, and match that to your on-page creative. Google has also built conversion tracking and reporting directly into the experience; so ad creation, landing page creation, and conversion tracking and reporting now all live within the Smart Campaigns UI.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">#11: Major Innovations Come to Google Shopping<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Did you know that in any given 48-hour period, 80% of Americans are shopping online? It\u2019s a fact! To account for the glut of online shopping, Google has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/19\/google-shopping-new-features\">ramped up it\u2019s shopping experience<\/a> with Smart Shopping. That\u2019s right. Machine learning has rolled over into the shopping game now, too.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d328c943-70ce-41e1-8b11-c05828c1cbaf\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-marketing-live-2018-shopping2.png\" alt=\"Google Marketing Live 2018 Shopping\" width=\"1060\" height=\"424\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Early tests have shown a 20% increase in conversion value at a similar cost when using Smart Shopping. Beyond maximizing conversion value, Smart Shopping now gives advertisers the option to select store visits and new customers as goals. Machine learning does the rest&#8211;making pragmatic bid adjustments, optimizing your ad placements, and optimizing which products are featured&#8211;based on a wide range of factors, from seasonal demand to pricing.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The soon-to-be-launched \u201cautomated feeds\u201d will also give advertisers the ability to create comprehensive product feeds with the touch of a button. Google Ads will pull all your products from your website directly into its UI. The best part? Smart Shopping is now integrated with leading e-commerce platforms like Shopify; so if you\u2019re a Shopify user, you can manage and track ad performance right from your CMS.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Bye, Bye, Bye<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What a whirlwind! A year removed from drastically changing the paid search experience, Google has seemingly topped themselves. From Smart Shopping to Responsive Search Ads; from YouTube lead ads to Mobile Speed Score; Google has taken it\u2019s already bustling suite of marketing and advertising features and amplified it. The jury\u2019s still out on if\/how machine learning will contribute to lower CPAs, but the thought is there&#8211;time will tell if the execution is too!<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>A huge shout-out to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/gordon-donnelly-2472\">Gordon Donnelly<\/a> who co-wrote this post.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are whole slew of exciting new Google Ads features and innovations in the works!
