Since then, the tech giant has enjoyed a nearly unbroken string of growth and dominance in the search engine market.<\/p>\n<p>But Google\u2019s had some hiccups lately. <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/2024-google-updates\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Recent updates<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-overviews-breaking-search\">new features<\/a> haven\u2019t landed well, and complaints from users and marketers hoping to attract them are getting louder and more frequent.<\/p>\n<p>Now, a new school of competitive sharks circles the search engine whale, hoping to feast off its follies. Some are search engines with innovative features that address what people don\u2019t like about Google. Others are apps not built for search, but searchers use them to look for things they would have otherwise found through Google.<\/p>\n<p>These unexpected Google competitors offer new opportunities for users and marketers.

Searchers, especially younger users, are turning to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/chatgpt-alternatives\">alternatives<\/a> like<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/11\/most-popular-social-media-platforms\"> social media apps<\/a> and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/chatbots\"> AI chatbots<\/a> to find what they need online.<\/p>\n<h3>TikTok<\/h3>\n<p>A growing number of searchers, especially Gen Zers, say they\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/advisor\/business\/software\/social-media-new-google\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">turning to TikTok<\/a> to find their next accountant or pair of strappy sandals. Even more telling is that 38% of people also use the short-form video-sharing app to search for information.<\/p>\n<p>The shift is so noticeable that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/07\/12\/google-exec-suggests-instagram-and-tiktok-are-eating-into-googles-core-products-search-and-maps\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google executives have acknowledged TikTok as\u00a0a viable threat<\/a> to its core search business.<\/p>\n<h4>Pros<\/h4>\n<p>TikTok offers users a more authentic way to learn about brands and products.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/26\/influencer-marketing\"> Influencers<\/a> and experts don\u2019t just promote things to buy; they share how to use them, where to find them, and when to buy for the best deals.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-tiktok.webp\" alt=\"Surprising Google competitors - TikTok screenshot.\" width=\"378\" height=\"585\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84291 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-tiktok.webp 378w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-tiktok-194x300.webp 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Plus, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/07\/how-to-get-on-tiktok-fyp\">For You Page<\/a> is constantly updated by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/tiktok-algorithm\">TikTok algorithm<\/a>, so you get exposure to relevant ideas and information you wouldn\u2019t have thought to search for (something Google can\u2019t do).<\/p>\n<p>For marketers, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/11\/advertising-on-tiktok\">TikTok offers<\/a> a surprisingly diverse audience, versatile <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/22\/tiktok-ads\">ad formats<\/a>, and highly engaged consumers.<\/p>\n<h4>Cons<\/h4>\n<p>You won\u2019t find content that is not native to the TikTok app by searching on TikTok. That\u2019s the biggest constraint of using it as a search engine. This is why it won\u2019t ever fully replace Google\u2014even if it does siphon some searchers from traditional search platforms.<\/p>\n<p>Marketers need to be aware of the time investment it takes to be successful on TikTok. You have to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/20\/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok\">post regularly<\/a>. And since it\u2019s a video-only platform, you can\u2019t get away with a quickly written quip or link to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/09\/how-to-write-a-blog-post\">blog post<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Facebook and Instagram<\/h3>\n<p>Unlike TikTok, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/04\/15\/facebook-marketing\">Facebook<\/a> is more focused on helping you stay in contact with people you know. So while you can learn new information and discover brands organically, Facebook ads (and its Meta cousin Instagram ads) are the real threat to Google.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-facebook-ad.webp\" alt=\"Surprising Google competitors - Facebook ad \" width=\"629\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84292 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-facebook-ad.webp 629w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-facebook-ad-480x458.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 629px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Meta raked in nearly<a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/271258\/facebooks-advertising-revenue-worldwide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> $132 billion<\/a> in ad revenue in 2023\u2014not as much as Google, but a huge chunk of marketing dollars that may have otherwise been spent on its ad network.<\/p>\n<p>In a lesser way, Facebook Marketplace diverts some traffic away from Google. Marketplace shoppers peruse products sold by individual sellers (not retailers). Over<a href=\"https:\/\/capitaloneshopping.com\/research\/facebook-marketplace-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> 1.2 billion<\/a> people use Marketplace monthly, many of whom would have searched for \u201cdiscount gaming tower\u201d or \u201cused furniture near me\u201d on Google.<\/p>\n<h4>Pros<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/12\/06\/facebook-advertising-trends\">Facebook advertising<\/a> provides a better financial return for many marketers. On average, an<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/11\/28\/facebook-ads-benchmarks\"> ad click on Facebook<\/a> costs less than half of what an<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/ppc-benchmarks\"> ad click costs on Google<\/a>. And Facebook\u2019s average conversion rate is much higher.<\/p>\n<p>Like TikTok, Facebook and Instagram offer users more passive discovery options than Google gives. While flipping through those feeds, you\u2019ll stumble on informational and promotional posts you didn\u2019t know you wanted.<\/p>\n<h4>Cons<\/h4>\n<p>Facebook and Instagram aren\u2019t great for active informational searches. Not many users will head there first when they want to know how tall the Eiffel Tower is or when the Chicago Bears last won the Super Bowl.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also become increasingly difficult for marketers to gain a foothold on Facebook and Instagram organically. So, while you still have a good chance of driving search traffic with your brilliant blog posts, you may be frustrated with your non-paid traffic from Facebook.<\/p>\n<h3>ChatGPT<\/h3>\n<p>No other app burst on the scene faster than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/03\/06\/how-to-use-chatgpt-for-small-business-marketing\">ChatGPT<\/a>. In just a couple of short years, the AI-powered chatbot has over <a href=\"http:\/\/-\">180.5<\/a> million monthly users.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, many people use the various versions of ChatGPT to write funny song lyrics and mock legal letters. But, a growing portion of users have found it to be a great platform for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/short-reads\/2024\/03\/26\/americans-use-of-chatgpt-is-ticking-up-but-few-trust-its-election-information\/#how-have-americans-used-chatgpt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">learning new things<\/a>\u2014one of the primary use cases for search engines.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-chatgpt.webp\" alt=\"Surprising Google competitors - chatgpt response.\" width=\"547\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84293 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-chatgpt.webp 547w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-chatgpt-480x527.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 547px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There are even rumors of an upcoming ChatGPT-powered search engine, which <a href=\"https:\/\/aibusiness.com\/google\/google-fears-chatgpt-will-threaten-its-search-dominance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">caused a little anxiety<\/a> at Google.<\/p>\n<h4>Pros<\/h4>\n<p>The big plug for ChatGPT in the search space is that it can mimic more natural conversation. In that way, it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/people-really-using-chat-gpt-instead-google-vruyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">acts more like a search assistant<\/a>, allowing you to ask questions and continue conversations instead of trying to find a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-tools\">keyword<\/a> to coax information from a search engine. And there are no ads on the app, which makes for a clean user experience.<\/p>\n<p>Some brands have<a href=\"https:\/\/letterdrop.com\/blog\/how-to-get-your-brand-to-appear-in-chatgpt#:~:text=To%20increase%20the%20chances%20of,in%20AI%2Dpowered%20search%20results.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> started to see qualified traffic<\/a> come from ChatGPT. That traffic comes mostly from the citation links the app adds to its responses.<\/p>\n<h4>Cons<\/h4>\n<p>The huge audience using ChatGPT doesn\u2019t benefit marketers much since the app doesn\u2019t offer paid ads. It\u2019s also difficult, if not impossible, to motivate the app to cite your website in its answers. Like AI Overviews, ChatGPT is also<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/90866834\/a-search-engine-researcher-explains-the-pros-and-cons-of-letting-chatgpt-and-other-chatbots-search-the-web-for-you\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> prone to regurgitating content<\/a> from existing sources, meaning it could closely paraphrase your content without sending you traffic.<\/p>\n<p>Users may find that ChatGPT<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/90866834\/a-search-engine-researcher-explains-the-pros-and-cons-of-letting-chatgpt-and-other-chatbots-search-the-web-for-you\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> fills in false information<\/a>, sometimes making up facts and even conjuring citations out of thin air. Learning <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/03\/06\/how-to-use-chatgpt-for-small-business-marketing\">how to prompt<\/a> the chatbot for usable results properly can take time.<\/p>\n<h3>Reddit and Quora<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/drive-traffic-from-reddit\">Reddit<\/a> has an interesting relationship with Google. On one hand, the two platforms benefit greatly from each other. Reddit is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/why-reddit-is-taking-over-google-right-now-2024-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">taking over Google results pages<\/a> and getting a lot more traffic as a result. Meanwhile, Google <a href=\"https:\/\/www.socialmediatoday.com\/news\/reddit-partners-google-new-data-sharing-deal\/708268\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">inked a deal<\/a> to let its large language model train on Reddit\u2019s vast cache of conversational content.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-reddit.webp\" alt=\"Surprising Google competitors - Reddit post on Google results.\" width=\"869\" height=\"449\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84294 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-reddit.webp 869w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-reddit-480x248.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 869px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, many users skip the middleman and search on Reddit directly, which is why Reddit is on this list of Google competitors. If enough people make Reddit their first stop for answers, it\u2019ll eat away a significant portion of Google\u2019s traffic.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, Quora has seen a similar representation in Google results and a corresponding traffic bump. But some will head right to Quora for answers without passing through Google first.<\/p>\n<h4>Pros<\/h4>\n<p>On Reddit and Quora, you get answers from real people who, to a varying degree, have direct experience with the topic at hand. You can also interact with them, asking follow-up questions and sharing your opinion. You cannot do that with a blog post you found on Google.<\/p>\n<p>Forums like Reddit and Quora also have a faster quality feedback loop. Users can upvote or downvote a post or reply immediately, which dictates how visible the content is to future searchers. On Google, an algorithm works as an imperfect proxy to user sentiment, often prioritizing copycat content over unique points of view.<\/p>\n<h4>Cons<\/h4>\n<p>Paradoxically, the faster feedback loop slows down marketing efforts on Reddit and Quora. You need to put in the work to build lots of trust before sending people a link to your website or mentioning your product. Get too salesy too fast and face a dogpile of downvotes and potential expulsion by the forum moderator.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re using forums as your informational search source, you have to remember the forum can be filled with falsehoods, either intentionally or by mistake. Well-meaning commenters may share \u201cfacts\u201d they remember with zero credible sources to back them up. And antagonists could mislead people on purpose for their own agenda.<\/p>\n<h3>Amazon and Walmart.com<\/h3>\n<p>Here\u2019s an interesting factoid: more shoppers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.junglescout.com\/resources\/articles\/amazon-statistics-2024\/#:~:text=3.,%2C%20and%20Facebook%20(10%25).\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">start their search for products on Amazon<\/a> than on search engines. That\u2019s quite a boast for the one-time online bookstore.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-amazon.webp\" alt=\"Surprising Google competitors - Amazon screenshot.\" width=\"853\" height=\"429\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84295 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-amazon.webp 853w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-amazon-480x241.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 853px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also notable that Walmart, the undisputed heavyweight of brick-and-mortar retail, isn\u2019t far behind, with nearly a third of shoppers clicking to its website to start their product searches.<\/p>\n<p>This suggests that lots of shoppers feel Amazon and Walmart offer a better product discovery experience than search engines. That has to give Google pause, especially since it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/kaleighmoore\/2024\/04\/02\/new-google-shopping-features-aim-to-improve-online-shopping-experience\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">continues to invest<\/a> in its Google Shopping features.<\/p>\n<h4>Pros<\/h4>\n<p>Sure, both Walmart.com and Amazon have immense catalogs with hundreds of millions of products. But that\u2019s not the differentiator (Google\u2019s \u201ccatalog\u201d includes listings from both websites, plus millions of other resellers).<\/p>\n<p>What makes both Amazon and Walmart attractive to shoppers is consistency. On Google, you\u2019ll get results from dozens of businesses, each with its own user experience and trust signals. On Walmart.com, you get a single, unified experience no matter what you buy.<\/p>\n<h4>Cons<\/h4>\n<p>The big dig for marketers here is that there\u2019s no real room for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/25\/benefits-of-content-marketing\">content marketing<\/a>. If you\u2019re not selling a product through one of these platforms, you can\u2019t drive traffic from them (without<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/11\/amazon-advertising\"> paid ads<\/a>\u2014and even that wouldn\u2019t work for many business types like B2B software).<\/p>\n<p>Of course, as a user, you\u2019re not going to Amazon or Walmart to search for general knowledge. From that standpoint, they don\u2019t compete with Google.<\/p>\n<div id=\"5-search-engines-also-battling-for-googles-business\"><\/div>\n<h2>5 search engines also battling for Google\u2019s business<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/19\/most-expensive-keywords-bing-ads\">Microsoft\u2019s Bing<\/a> is Google\u2019s largest search competitor, with about<a href=\"https:\/\/gs.statcounter.com\/search-engine-market-share\/all\/worldwide\/2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> 3.4%<\/a> of the worldwide search market (and growing). But it\u2019s also backed by a tech behemoth and similar enough to Google Search in operation.<\/p>\n<p>What we\u2019re looking for are the smaller players here. The little (search) engines that could. We want to see how they\u2019re creating a truly different online experience<\/p>\n<h3>DuckDuckGo<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/what-is-duckduckgo\">DuckDuckGo<\/a> was launched in 2008. It\u2019s held roughly 2% of the US search market for the last few years, an impressive feat given the competition from new search engines.<\/p>\n<p>The search results on DuckDuckGo look like Google maybe 10 or 15 years ago. There are paid ads and image results, but little else on the unfussy page.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-duckduckgo.webp\" alt=\"Surprising Google competitors - DuckDuckGo results page.\" width=\"466\" height=\"589\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84296 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-duckduckgo.webp 466w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-duckduckgo-237x300.webp 237w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Pros<\/h4>\n<p>If privacy is your main concern, DuckDuckGo is your search engine. It never stores your IP addresses, browsing behavior, or search history. In short, DuckDuckGo doesn\u2019t track you.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also get a cleaner page experience than Bing and fewer forum results (like Reddit or Quora) than Google from \u201cthe Duck.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>Cons<\/h4>\n<p>Since you\u2019re not being tracked, don\u2019t look for a lot of personalization on DuckDuckGo results. That may feel a little jarring if you\u2019ve taught Google your preferences over time. Also, the simplicity of the search results means there are fewer additional features, like Google\u2019s News, Books, and Flights options.<\/p>\n<h3>YouChat<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/about.you.com\/youchat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouChat<\/a> is a personalized search assistant. Like ChatGPT, you can interact with YouChat more conversationally, and it will provide an AI-generated answer.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-AI-embargo.webp\" alt=\"Surprising Google competitors - YouChat results page.\" width=\"733\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84297 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-AI-embargo.webp 733w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-AI-embargo-480x393.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 733px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The search bot has several modes you can unlock by signing up for a free account.<\/p>\n<h4>Pros<\/h4>\n<p>YouChat works more like a real-time search engine than some other<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency\"> generative AI tools<\/a>. For example, the app gave more comprehensive and correct answers in a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.toolify.ai\/gpts\/ai-battle-royale-chatgpt-vs-youchat-vs-perplexity-al-67530\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> head-to-head comparison<\/a> with ChatGPT.<\/p>\n<h4>Cons<\/h4>\n<p>Even though it\u2019s <em>more <\/em>reliable than some other search assistants, YouChat can still give erroneous answers. Plus, you\u2019re limited in the citations you get from each query. It\u2019s a little harder to quickly move between sources if you want to skim several articles.<\/p>\n<h3>Arc Search<\/h3>\n<p>When you enter a search query and click the \u201cBrowse for me\u201d button on <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/arc-search-find-it-faster\/id6472513080\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Arc Search<\/a>, you don\u2019t just get a list of links. You get a uniquely created webpage with a list of key details and several image-based links.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-verge.webp\" alt=\"Surprising Google competitors - Arc Search result.\" width=\"873\" height=\"588\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84298 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-verge.webp 873w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-verge-480x323.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 873px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/1\/28\/24053882\/arc-search-browser-web-app-ios\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This new take on search is the brainchild of The Browser Company, a small startup blurring the lines between search engines, web browsers, and AI chatbots.<\/p>\n<h4>Pros<\/h4>\n<p>Arc Search uses AI differently than other apps in this list. Instead of attempting to spin up a new piece of content from scraped data, Arc gives you the topline information in quick bullet points while creating a webpage for each result that\u2019s easy to explore.<\/p>\n<h4>Cons<\/h4>\n<p>Arc Search and the Arc Browser only work with Windows 11, Mac, and iOS. Your Android device and older Windows machine aren\u2019t supported.<\/p>\n<p>Arc is also a very new player in the field. It doesn\u2019t have all the functionality of the much more mature Google. Ideally, that\u2019ll change over time.<\/p>\n<h3>Brave Search<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/search.brave.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brave Search<\/a> is a privacy-focused search engine that blocks most ads and trackers by default. Its initial user experience is closer to that of Bing or Google. However, Brave offers more text for each result.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-brave.webp\" alt=\"Surprising Google competitors - Brave search result. \" width=\"854\" height=\"429\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84299 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-brave.webp 854w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-brave-480x241.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 854px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Brave provides AI answers to queries, but you have a couple of ways to control when they appear. You can click the \u201cAnswer with AI\u201d option at the end of the query bar. Or you can pose your query in the form of a question. For example, the query \u201cPR embargo\u201d will get you a list of links, while the query \u201cWhat is a PR embargo?\u201d pulls up an AI answer before the links.<\/p>\n<p>Like Arc, Brave Search is part of an ecosystem that includes a web browser, a video conferencing feature, its own cryptocurrency (which it offers as a reward to users who view ads), and more.<\/p>\n<h4>Pros<\/h4>\n<p>Brave\u2019s default ad and tracker blocking is fantastic, but that\u2019s almost table stakes for any search engine that wants to attract users from Google. Another feature, called Goggles, really sets Brave apart.<\/p>\n<p>Brave Goggles lets you personalize your results pages with unique ranking signals. For example, you can prioritize articles from tech blogs or remove Pinterest results from your page.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-goggles.webp\" alt=\"Surprising Google competitors - Brave Search Goggle feature.\" width=\"626\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84300 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-goggles.webp 626w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-goggles-480x460.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 626px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You have the option of using a pre-made Goggle or submitting one of your own. There\u2019s an existing Goggle that lets you remove copycat content, which could be really useful.<\/p>\n<h4>Cons<\/h4>\n<p>There are complaints about Brave Search returning irrelevant results. That could be because it\u2019s based on its own home-grown index (which helps it remain unbiased). The best way to judge is to test it for yourself.<\/p>\n<h3>Perplexity AI<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.perplexity.ai\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Perplexity AI<\/a> is a chatbot-powered conversational search engine. Its interface works a little like ChatGPT, where you prompt it for a response. However, Perplexity AI is focused on helping you surface and organize web results rather than generating new content.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-perplexity.webp\" alt=\"Surprising Google competitors - Perplexity answer.\" width=\"775\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84301 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-perplexity.webp 775w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/Surprising-google-competitors-wordstream-perplexity-480x372.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 775px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can use Perplexity AI for free, but a paid Pro version (formerly Copilot) also leads you through complex searches with clarifying questions.<\/p>\n<h4>Pros<\/h4>\n<p>There\u2019s a lot to love about using Perplexity AI for research. The Pro version is especially handy since it acts like a librarian, guiding you through the stacks of irrelevant content to find what you need.<\/p>\n<p>Also, if you\u2019re the type of searcher who sometimes needs to return to a search session, the Threads feature will be super helpful. It lets you store previous interactions, title them, share them, and edit or continue them as needed.<\/p>\n<h4>Cons<\/h4>\n<p>It\u2019s a bit repetitive at this point, but Perplexity AI is prone to add incorrect facts to its answers. As with any AI output, it pays to double-check things before quoting them.<\/p>\n<p>Another knock on this app is that it lacks the hugely diverse indexed data from more established options. That leads to sometimes short and vague responses.<\/p>\n<h2>Google\u2019s death by a thousand cuts is a call for diversification and repurposing<\/h2>\n<p>Google is still the 8,000-pound gorilla in non-paid traffic. No other platform delivers nearly the same level of repeatable site visitation.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s unlikely any competitor will eat Google whole. DuckDuckGo, for example, has been treading water at around a 2% share of search for years. And some promising startups, like Neeva\u2019s AI search engine, have<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2023\/5\/20\/23731397\/neeva-search-engine-google-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> barely lasted a year<\/a> going up against Google. Instead, we\u2019ll see dozens of competitors taking little bites.<\/p>\n<p>For marketers, this calls for diversification and repurposing. Diversifying traffic sources will allow you to buffer the volatility of Google Search with site visits from other platforms.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/03\/repurposing-content\"> Repurposing content<\/a> lets you address multiple sources in meaningful ways without multiplying the resources you spend doing it.<\/p>\n<p>If you have questions about how to get more out of your search engine marketing, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/marketing-services?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Demo_Blog_Demo\">contact us<\/a>.
