Every year since then we\u2019ve gotten more and more <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/05\/google-adwords-livestream\">mobile ad types and features<\/a>, and this year is no different.<\/p>\n<p>Google continues to emphasize mobile-first, which means that the look of the SERP is changing in ways that favor the mobile experience. Of course, paid ads need to adapt to the mobile-first world too, and today Google has announced some new and interesting changes to Google Ads (formerly known as AdWords), rolling out over the next few months, that PPC marketers need to know about.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday I flew out to the Google Performance Summit and got an exclusive first look at the newest ad formats and features coming to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/01\/google-advertising\">Google advertising<\/a>. Here\u2019s everything you need to know moving forward about these big changes coming soon to Google Ads.<\/p>\n<p>Check out: <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/01\/industry-reactions-google-summit\">Industry Reactions to the Big News from #GoogleSummit<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>1. New Local Search Ads to Appear on Google Maps<\/h2>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ea7db9b7-32e2-438a-8a30-fd19eb036478\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-mobile-first-maps-local-ads.jpg\" alt=\"new google maps ads\" width=\"797\" height=\"617\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Last month, my colleague Erin Sagin wrote about Google\u2019s announcement that <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/22\/google-maps-now-search-network\">Maps would be part of the Search Network<\/a> moving forward, speculating that \u201cwe\u2019re likely to see significantly more ads appearing on the maps platform.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She was right. Google had unveiled what it calls the \u201cnext generation\u201d of local search ads. These new ads will appear within Google Maps (on the app as well as both the desktop and mobile versions of the site), as well as across Google.com.<\/p>\n<p>In the new ads, brand logos and offers will appear directly on the surface of the map, rather than just alongside the map. For example, if you were to search on Google Maps for [electronics store], you\u2019d see the following:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"fcd0dcbc-6ded-4201-be7a-0c1fff20dd51\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/new-google-maps-ads-example.jpg\" alt=\"google maps ad example\" width=\"797\" height=\"741\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>You can clearly see Best Buy\u2019s logo on the map. Clicking on that logo leads to this mobile local inventory ad format:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2a8fa6d7-bf32-46be-9d39-9e72e69d22aa\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/mobile-local-inventory-ad-format.jpg\" alt=\"mobile local mobile ads\" width=\"800\" height=\"626\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Why the Focus on Google Maps?<\/h3>\n<p>Google Maps now has more than a billion users and people visit 1.5 billion destinations based on their Google searches. As Google noted, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/06\/11\/local-ppc-tips\">location-related searches<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Account for nearly a <strong>third<\/strong> of all mobile searches.<\/li>\n<li>Have grown <strong>50 percent faster<\/strong> than overall mobile searches in the past year.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To drive more online traffic from Maps to local businesses, Google is working on other new ad formats, such as promotion pins. Here\u2019s an example of a promotion from Walgreens:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"abd748ab-6822-4e68-9fb8-61c16dd5e52d\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-maps-promotion-pins-ad-1.png\" alt=\"google maps promotion pins\" width=\"510\" height=\"907\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>You can see that an offer for $3 off contact lens solution appears right below the map and local store information.<\/p>\n<p>Also, Google is revamping local business pages. Two key changes here: Advertisers can highlight an in-store promotion, and users can search local inventory. Have a look:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5fd647ad-06fa-4e3e-9ad2-46f32c62eaa6\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-mobile-local-business-page-revamp-1.png\" alt=\"new google local business pages\" width=\"407\" height=\"827\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>This is a nice integration, giving advertisers the ability to add logos and offers.<\/p>\n<p>However, the ad targeting here is a bit complicated. Ads show based on queries, but <strong>Google is also looking at several other context signals<\/strong> (similar to display advertising), such as personal browsing history, similar users, time of day, interests, and behaviors.<\/p>\n<p>This should open up a good amount of local ad inventory. I know I use Google Maps a lot \u2013 not as much as search, but when I\u2019m looking for local business I\u2019m equally likely to look on Maps or Search.<\/p>\n<p>For more coverage of Google Maps Search Ads: <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/01\/google-maps-local-search-ads\">10 Things You Need to Know About the New Google Maps Local Search Ads<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>2. Expanded Text Ads Get Double Headlines &amp; More Characters<\/h2>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"9700e0a8-46ff-4bf3-abf5-837f2c89f2ac\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-mobile-text-ads-new-look.jpg\" alt=\"bigger google mobile ads\" width=\"799\" height=\"710\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/22\/google-kills-off-right-side-ads\">Google eliminated right side ads<\/a> from the desktop SERP in February as a way to create a more unified Google experience across devices.

In early testing, Google found this change <em>dramatically<\/em> increased CTR \u2013 by as much as 25 percent.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a look at the difference between old ads and new expanded text ads on both mobile and desktop:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"589bbf71-4ad7-4c56-94e4-88ef0ddaeaee\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/expanded-text-ads-before-vs-after1-2.png\" alt=\"Expanded Text Ad example\" width=\"918\" height=\"364\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>At WordStream, we\u2019ve found that adding an ad extension or call extension to mobile text ads tends to increase CTR by about 12 percent. So it makes complete sense that the CTRs for double headlines would be even higher.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to more clicks, Google said longer headlines will be more useful for \u00a0advertisers, and result in better qualified traffic for advertisers.<\/p>\n<p>This change is huge \u2013 literally. Particularly with so little space on the smartphone screen, this headline change is great news for advertisers (as usual, not so much for those on the organic side).<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Google is expanding the number of characters that can be in the description line. Advertisers will soon have the ability to write a single 80-character description line, a 5-character increase over the current pair of 35-character description lines. You&#8217;ll also notice that the display URL has been removed, as AdWords will automatically extract the domain from the final URL. Advertisers can then add in one to two paths to enhance the display URL.<\/p>\n<p>Note that these bigger ads are coming to both mobile AND desktop. You&#8217;ll want to jump on this opportunity right away rather than let <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/16\/competitive-advertising\">your competitors<\/a> beat you to the bigger ads.<\/p>\n<p>You can learn more about the new ads in this post: <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/25\/google-expanded-text-ads\">10 Things You Need to Know About Expanded Text Ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Better Measurement of In-Store Conversions<\/h2>\n<p>You know people are clicking on your AdWords ads and this is driving traffic to your local business, but how much exactly? Google Ads\u00a0can now help more businesses bridge the gap between the digital and physical worlds by measuring in-store conversions.<\/p>\n<p>Technically this isn\u2019t \u201cnew\u201d (Google says more than 1 billion store visits have been measured so far in the past two years), but it\u2019s still a pretty big deal. Soon in-store conversions will become more widely available to more types of businesses, which is critical considering 90 percent of sales will happen in stores, as opposed to online.<\/p>\n<p>The beautiful part is that <strong>Google simply looks at phone location history to determine whether the person who searched and clicked on your ad ended up walking into the store.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As an example, Google cited Nissan UK, which discovered 6 percent of people who clicked on ads went to the dealership, resulting in 25x ROI.<\/p>\n<h2>4. New Responsive Display Ads<\/h2>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2bf3a6cb-51dd-49de-8d63-fd65ca81930a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-adwords-responsive-display-ads.png\" alt=\"responsive display ads\" width=\"720\" height=\"482\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Get ready for Responsive Display Ads. Soon you will just have to give Google a URL, headline, description, and image, and <strong>Google will create responsive display ads for you<\/strong>. You will be able to run ads that adapt to the content of the websites they\u2019re on and apps in the GDN. This includes native ad inventory.<\/p>\n<p>This is really cool because it\u2019s a pain to create ads for all the different formats (skyscraper, leaderboard, square, rectangle, etc). Google is eliminating this hassle with Responsive Display Ads \u2013 they will figure out the best format for your ad depending on where it is being served.<\/p>\n<p>Expect all these changes to roll out later this year.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Changes to Device Bidding<\/h2>\n<p>Finally, some changes are coming to the Google Ads\u00a0bidding process.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, advertisers set a base desktop bid and then <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/04\/09\/combined-bid-adjustments\">set mobile bids as a multiplier<\/a> on the base bid. This was introduced with Enhanced Campaigns. (And tablet is stuck with desktop, something a lot of PPC people have complained about, though tablet searches only account for about 5% of traffic and aren&#8217;t growing.)<\/p>\n<p>Going forward, this is all being decoupled. You will have the ability to set mobile bids, desktop bids, and tablet bids independently or make them dependent on each other. This gives advertisers a little more flexibility and further enforces Google&#8217;s mobile-first viewpoint (why start with the desktop bid if everything is moving to mobile-first?).<\/p>\n<h2>A Note on the Updated Google Ads Interface<\/h2>\n<p>At the Performance Summit, Google also revealed an early look at the newly designed Google Ads\u00a0interface, which is coming in 2017. I provide a more in-depth look at <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/25\/new-adwords-interface\">the new design and features in this post<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Get More Info in My Webinar<\/h2>\n<p>We live in a mobile world. More than 50 percent of the trillions of searches conducted on Google every year come from mobile.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why, every year, Google is innovating in mobile to provide a compelling experience for users and make sure advertisers are able to reach consumers at key moments.<\/p>\n<p>At a bare minimum, you\u2019ll need to <a href=\"\/google-mobile-advertising\">leverage mobile ad formats<\/a>, and get ready for these new formats on the horizon, to make sure you\u2019re attracting and converting mobile searchers when they\u2019re using commercial search queries and looking to find a business fast.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s a mobile-first world, and Google knows it!
