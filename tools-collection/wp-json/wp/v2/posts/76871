Recent developments in the digital ecosystem, such as the iOS updates, particularly Safari&#8217;s Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) and Enhanced Tracking Protection (ETP), along with the ongoing debate surrounding cookie deprecation, have significantly complicated the process of understanding the impact of online ads on offline conversions.<\/p>\n<p>One of the prevalent methods used for offline conversion tracking has been the Google Click Identifier (GCLID).

Imagine this company runs online ads to attract potential homebuyers. These ads grab the attention of people actively looking for mortgages. Curious, they click on the ads to learn more about what the company offers. In addition, to stay in touch, these interested folks often complete a contact form on the company&#8217;s website, sharing their email addresses and phone numbers.<\/p>\n<p>Afterward, these prospects might take the next step by visiting the mortgage company&#8217;s local office to meet with a loan officer, discuss mortgage options, and initiate the application process. Eventually, some of them secure mortgages and purchase their dream homes.<\/p>\n<p>In this scenario, while the initial interaction with the mortgage company occurred online through the ad clicks, the ultimate conversion\u2014the home purchase\u2014happened offline.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/how-enhanced-conversions-for-leads-work.webp\" alt=\"how enhanced conversions for leads works in google ads\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76940\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/how-enhanced-conversions-for-leads-work.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/how-enhanced-conversions-for-leads-work-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.seroundtable.com\/google-ads-enhanced-conversions-for-leads-32980.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<div id=\"why-track-offline-conversions\"><\/div>\n<h2>Why track offline conversions?<\/h2>\n<p>Recognizing the significance of these offline conversions, it becomes clear that tracking them is indispensable.<\/p>\n<p>Relying solely on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/08\/google-ads-conversion-tracking-mistakes\">online conversion data<\/a> would neglect crucial insights into how online ads drive real-world actions like mortgage applications and home purchases.<\/p>\n<p>To gain a holistic understanding of the effectiveness of their advertising efforts, businesses must measure these offline conversions.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 Is your Google Ads campaign optimized to drive the most conversions?
