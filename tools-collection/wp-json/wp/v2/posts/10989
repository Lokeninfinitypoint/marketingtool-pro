So,\u00a0to spare you the hours of figuring it all out, I&#8217;ve broken it all down into one easy-to-read post so that you can get up and running as quickly as possible.

So let&#8217;s get started.<\/p>\n<h2>What is email marketing automation?<\/h2>\n<p>Don\u2019t worry, this isn\u2019t a silly question. There are two different types of automated emails: transactional, or<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/28\/trigger-emails\"> triggered emails<\/a>, and drip marketing campaigns, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/30\/lead-nurturing-campaign-emails\">email nurture<\/a>. Transactional emails are the ones that you don\u2019t need permission to send; like order and shipping confirmations.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1f0b6385-4367-4d25-947d-2fd1f45ecc03\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/automated20email20marketing20confirmation20email.png\" alt=\"automated email marketing confirmation email\" width=\"663\" height=\"748\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Nurture emails are marketing campaigns, so you do need permission\u2014these marketing emails help <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/21\/facebook-funnel\">move your prospects through the funnel <\/a>by automatically sending curated content on a pre-determined basis.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind, you\u2019ll need a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/21\/cost-effective-marketing-automation-tools-small-businesses\">marketing automation platform <\/a>to get started with automated emails. There are plenty of options out there, and if you\u2019re already running <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/21\/promotional-email-examples\">promotional emails<\/a> or one-off email campaigns, your provider likely has an option for drip campaigns as well.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"269baf15-0c36-488f-ae68-6fb924d9265a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/automated20email20marketing20lifecycle20of20a20drip20email.png\" alt=\"automated email marketing lifecycle of a drip email\" width=\"800\" height=\"284\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>How to get started with automated email marketing<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019ll need to make sure there is a collection point for email submissions\u00a0on your website. Once you have that set up, you\u2019ll need to follow the steps laid out below to get your automated email nurture program up and running:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Collect Lead Information<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re not already doing this, place lead forms throughout your website,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/12\/great-landing-pages\"> landing pages<\/a>, and ads to collect necessary information from your prospects. You can create these landing pages based on the information you want to leverage&#8211;common fields include name, email address, company, budget, industry, and location.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the more fields you require leads to fill out, the more ways you\u2019ll be able to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/06\/personalized-marketing\">personalize your emails<\/a>. Bur tread carefully: leads are less willing to fill out a lengthy form and may abandon if it is too robust.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"229f559b-8cd9-40ce-bdcc-6c8bf769c6c3\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/automated20email20marketing20form20fill.png\" alt=\"automated email marketing form fill\" width=\"800\" height=\"452\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>2.\u00a0Choose a Goal<\/h3>\n<p>Like any marketing campaign, you\u2019ll need to think about what action you want to drive from automated emails. Of course, you\u2019ll want great <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/31\/email-subject-lines\">open and click-through rates<\/a>, but do you want them to sign up for a demo of your product? Are you looking for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/19\/conversion-rate-benchmarks\">conversions<\/a>\u00a0or a specific number of purchases? What about calling a number, making a donation, registering for another newsletter, or signing up to volunteer?<\/p>\n<p>Once your goal is set, you can work backward to develop the content needed for your drip campaign.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Set Qualifying Criteria<\/h3>\n<p>Okay, I have *another* confession. Sometimes I waffle between creating content and setting up qualifiers. This is just a note that you can do both at the same time! They should play off of each other to create the perfect waterfall of wonderful marketing messaging.<\/p>\n<p>Back to business. You\u2019ll want to score your leads in order to move them through the funnel\u00a0and your drip campaign.\u00a0You can create your own scale, but whichever <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/05\/b2b-marketing-automation-tactics\">marketing automation<\/a> system you\u2019re using may already have suggestions. Some simple guidelines: you can disqualify based on location (e.g. outside your delivery range), budget, company, etc. If your lead has the exact job title or political party membership that you\u2019re<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/13\/targeted-email-marketing-strategies\"> targeting with your email<\/a>, considering scoring them higher.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of content, less actionable pieces should have a lower score, let\u2019s say 1 or 2. Content that tends to convert <em>and<\/em> informs a lead about your product is more valuable, so your sales team has to do less leg work on the phone. You could score <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/03\/how-to-write-a-case-study\">case studies<\/a>, product marketing materials, and demos 10 out of 10 and push them out of your drip campaign to \u201ccompletion.\u201d Just depends on what your goal is!<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5aa38347-3ad7-4d64-9e0e-6ee00cde8193\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/automated20email20marketing20scheudle20a20demo.png\" alt=\"automated email marketing schedule a demo\" width=\"800\" height=\"1398\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>4. Create Content for the Funnel<\/h3>\n<p>Start with the content you already have. What performs well in terms of clicks and opens? What is a big converter? Does your sales team have any particular favorite blog posts, case studies, or product one-pagers that really get prospects on the hook?<\/p>\n<p>Once you have a cache of existing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/01\/content-marketing-funnel\">content funnel<\/a>, you can start to fill in the gaps.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p>\ud83d\udceb<strong> Free email templates!<\/strong>\u00a0 <strong>&gt;&gt; <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteEmailExampleTemplate.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Email_EmailTemplates_Download\">30 Free Small Business Email Examples &amp; Templates<\/a><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h3>5. Test, test, test<\/h3>\n<p>Like any new marketing campaign or channel, you\u2019re going to need to test everything before finding your sweet spot. It\u2019s unlikely that <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-email-marketing\/\">automated email marketing<\/a> isn\u2019t going to work for your business, but you\u2019ll have to work to find the right messaging and scoring to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/12\/is-email-marketing-effective\">effectively<\/a> move leads down the funnel or convert. Some easy <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/26\/ab-testing-best-practices\">testing tips<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/22\/marketing-copy\">Write a lot of copy<\/a>; and a lot of different copy. Instead of having 3 variations on \u201cbuy now!\u201d try to have variations that encourage different actions or look at the value proposition from diverse angles.<\/li>\n<li>Design. You should be able to A\/B email layouts to find out if longer-form works, plain-text vs. HTML, CTAs above the fold, or basic navigation at the top of your emails.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/03\/repurposing-content\">Repurpose content<\/a>; if you saw great engagement with a particular blog post, whitepaper, product line, or promotion, place that into your automated email funnel. You can test new versions against what was sent previously.<\/li>\n<li>Scoring. While you may already know that requesting a demo is a qualifying action, maybe a case study isn\u2019t. Or a whitepaper is more of a branding effort than you first believe. Be flexible and communicate with your sales team to figure out the best way to score your leads.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1bc556fc-c5eb-44a2-bb33-037fc55c61e4\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/automated20email20marketing20marketo20lead20scoring20examples.png\" alt=\"automated email marketing marketo lead scoring examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"377\" \/><\/div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/04\/best-time-to-send-email-campaign\">Send times<\/a>; test time of day, day of the week, and so on to find the optimal time to get engagement.<\/li>\n<li>Subject and pre-header text; like the copy tip above, write variations for each subject line to see which gets opened at the highest rate.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Note: <\/strong>A\/B testing send times and subject lines is tricker now with the iOS 15 update. Learn <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/12\/27\/email-marketing-ios15\">13 post-iOS 15 email marketing strategies here.<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>6. Monitor Touchpoints<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s likely that email is not the only way you\u2019re reaching out to these leads. Remember, your automated email campaign doesn\u2019t live in a vacuum. If these leads are being <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/13\/retargeting-ad-ideas\">retargeted<\/a> on ad platforms or emailed outside of the nurture campaign, make sure not to inundate them with your brand. No one likes being digitally stalked.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Analyze and Optimize<\/h3>\n<p>This last one is obvious. After the campaign goes live, set reasonable expectations and success metrics. Adjust as you go. All marketing automation systems have analytics dashboards set-up for you to monitor performance; you should also keep an eye on the number of sends per email. If <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/08\/lead-quality\">leads are getting qualified<\/a> before they reach the end of the funnel, great! Consider reducing the number of emails in the queue to get the most relevant content out as soon as possible.\u00a0The same is true for the reverse; increase the number of emails to qualify prospects until they\u2019re ready to convert.<\/p>\n<h2>Great examples of automated marketing<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re still feeling lost and confused when it comes to the design of your automated emails, I understand. When I first started out, I used *a lot* of templates from Marketo,\u00a0Hubspot, and Mailchimp. Which is not a bad idea! But I&#8217;ve compiled some more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/31\/email-marketing-with-buyer-personas\">great email examples<\/a> to help jog your creativity.<\/p>\n<h3>Welcome email<\/h3>\n<p>When you get a new subscriber, you should welcome them to your community, introduce them to your products, and just confirm that yes, they are subscribed to your list. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/18\/welcome-email\">Welcome emails <\/a>are truly a time to shine for your brand; these should be fun and creative! It used to be commonplace to offer a discount in your welcome email, which I still recommend, but more often you\u2019ll find a summary of the business with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/29\/great-cta\">CTA<\/a> in the A Spot, followed by a series of category-specific sections and CTAs.<\/p>\n<p>This automated email example from Casper highlights their brand voice, offers a discount at the bottom, and has some helpful tips on why you should choose Casper in the body.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1f1e2632-aea5-4e98-bbe7-ac5cd79ff82e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email20marketing20automation20welcome20example20Bundles.png\" alt=\"email marketing automation welcome example Bundles\" width=\"500\" height=\"1612\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Feedback email example<\/h3>\n<p>Asking for constructive criticism is a great way to engage with your subscribers; they\u2019ll feel important and honored that you asked, and you\u2019ll gain an opportunity to grow from it.
