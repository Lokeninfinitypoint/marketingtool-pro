And even though most people don\u2019t think of YouTube primarily as a search engine, that\u2019s exactly what most visitors do on the site. YouTube\u2019s not just the second most popular website; it\u2019s also the second most popular search engine \u2013 topped only by Google. This means that the platform presents a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/13\/youtube-ad-placements\">huge potential for reach for your business<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The fact that YouTube is such a hugely popular platform also means that there is a lot of competition. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/259477\/hours-of-video-uploaded-to-youtube-every-minute\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Statista<\/a>, as of July 2015, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/259477\/hours-of-video-uploaded-to-youtube-every-minute\/\">400 hours of video<\/a> are uploaded to YouTube every minute. So, if you want to be successful on YouTube, you need to make sure that you have the time and the resources to publish quality content on a consistent basis. In other words, you\u2019ll need a good YouTube marketing plan.<\/p>\n<p>Another big reason why YouTube is such an attractive option for marketing purposes is that it\u2019s all about video \u2013 and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lilachbullock.com\/video-marketing-guide\/\">video marketing<\/a> is all the rage right now. Video has consistently proven itself as one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/08\/video-marketing-statistics\">best-performing forms of content<\/a> in terms of engagement, and just because you\u2019re creating them for YouTube doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t repurpose your videos. These videos would be great for your other social profiles, your email marketing campaigns, your website and landing pages, and any other platforms or channels you might be using.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1c93ab70-79e7-46d1-ac93-92ffd38cd7ef\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/editing-marketing-videos-shoot.jpg\" alt=\"Editing marketing videos professional video shoot\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>As for the issue of video production, it\u2019s not as difficult as it may seem to create marketing videos. You don\u2019t need a huge budget and you don\u2019t even need to make substantial investments in equipment\u2014in fact, you can even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/11\/at-home-diy-video\">produce quality marketing videos from your own home<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So, the short of it: is YouTube the right solution for your business? Yes, in most cases (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/27\/youtube-statistics\">the numbers don&#8217;t lie<\/a>). If you sell products, it\u2019s a great way to showcase and promote them and all of their uses. If you\u2019re a B2B company, it\u2019s a great platform for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/05\/brand-awareness-campaigns\">expanding your reach<\/a> and for generating more leads.<\/p>\n<h2>Developing a YouTube marketing strategy<\/h2>\n<p>Marketing on YouTube is like marketing on other social platforms: the first step is to create your strategy. In order to create your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/07\/youtube-ad-tv-placements\">YouTube marketing<\/a> strategy, you\u2019ll want to start by defining your goals.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1b3265b1-2c6d-4470-8ad9-997489c8bca5\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/youtube-marketing-phone.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube marketing phone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Write down the specific targets you want to achieve, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clicks\/traffic<\/li>\n<li>Engagement<\/li>\n<li>Reach\/subscriber numbers<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Use the SMART model to help you put together good objectives: specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound. This will help make sure that your objectives are specific, have a deadline, and are do-able.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, you also need to be able to measure your progress accurately. At this stage of strategizing, establish what your KPIs (key performance indicators) are to help you measure your results.<\/p>\n<h2>Commit to a schedule<\/h2>\n<p>Consistency is very important on YouTube if you want to keep growing your channel. As with blogging, the more content you put out there, the better the chances you\u2019ll reach a wider audience.<\/p>\n<p>Most successful YouTubers have a very strict publishing schedule \u2013 and they stick to it. \u00a0These YouTubers also promote new videos to their audience on other social media platforms so that even those who haven\u2019t subscribed to their channel can still know when a new video is coming out. While you\u2019re setting up a YouTube marketing strategy for your business, consider how often you can realistically commit to posting new content and make sure you can stick to it.<\/p>\n<p>Once you determine how often you can post, you should also consider when you release your videos. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oberlo.com\/blog\/best-time-post-social-media\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Oberlo<\/a>, most viewers watch YouTube videos in the evenings and on weekends. The best time to post your content is early afternoons during the week or early Saturday and Sunday mornings so that your videos will be indexed by the time your potential viewers are searching.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"8031f202-8fd5-48b3-be12-2617a591fd4a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/youtube-marketing-best-time.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube marketing best time to post\" width=\"800\" height=\"834\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.oberlo.com\/blog\/best-time-post-social-media\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Plus, at this stage, make a note of all the holidays and events coming up that are relevant to your audience so you\u2019ll know in advance about any opportunities to create any special content.<\/p>\n<h2>Types of marketing videos<\/h2>\n<p>So, now that you know what your goals are and when you want to publish, the question is, what types of videos can you create?<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to keep things varied in order to keep your audience entertained and coming back for more. Plus, it\u2019s worth experimenting early with different types of videos so you can understand which ones work best and which ones don\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few ideas to get you started:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listicles<\/strong>: Listicles are a very popular content format, both as blog posts and as media (videos, images, infographics, etc.). You can create listicles that highlight your products or services \u2013 like \u201cThe 10 most innovative ways you can use (your product)\u201d \u2013 or they can be educational, informational, or entertaining. Just remember, the lists should always be relevant to your audiences\u2019 interests and your business niche.<\/li>\n<li><strong>How-to videos<\/strong>: How-to videos tend to perform very well because they provide a lot of value to the viewer. For example, if you were selling social media software, you could create how-to videos showing your viewers how to get started with Twitter marketing or how to grow your Facebook following. You can look to top performing blog posts for material for these videos, or you can develop a plan for a recurring series.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/jetblue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JetBlue<\/a> has a series of \u201cFlight Etiquette\u201d videos that emphasize how <em>not <\/em>to travel:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"videos\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_video\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"fc405aab-2e28-43bb-a003-f984fad56795\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/xqHqyy0INaU?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Behind-the-scenes videos<\/strong>: YouTube is a social network \u2013 the keyword here being \u201csocial.\u201d One of the ways to humanize your brand and show that you\u2019re more than just a product or service is to share some behind-the-scenes videos.

Engagement is a big part of YouTube, so it\u2019s extremely important to take the time to not only respond to any comments you get, but also to drive engagement in other ways.<\/p>\n<p>A good way to manage your account is to use a tool to help automate the process. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.agorapulse.com\/youtube-management\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Agorapulse<\/a> lets you pre-moderate your comments, check and respond to comments from your dashboard\u2019s social inbox (which you can do as part of a team + you can assign tasks), as well as monitor YouTube for mentions of your brand in videos and comments. Other useful management features include saved replies (to respond to comments with a few clicks) and a social CRM tool to help keep track of your subscribers and connections.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"afc2ca33-1a06-46c4-8916-b0273c77ae20\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/youtube-marketing-agorapulse.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube marketing Agorapulse dashboard\" width=\"1378\" height=\"921\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Another good option for channel management is <a href=\"https:\/\/vidiq.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VidIQ<\/a>, which you can use to keep track of comments and respond when necessary, to collaborate with your team members, and to discover useful keywords and tags for optimizing your videos.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lilachbullock.com\/youtube-tips-tricks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube tips<\/a> to boost your engagement and views:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check your comments every day so you can respond promptly<\/li>\n<li>Use monitoring to find other mentions of your brand and identify engagement opportunities<\/li>\n<li>Ask questions of your viewers in your videos, as well as in your video descriptions to encourage them to leave a comment<\/li>\n<li>Use the \u201cCommunity\u201d tab (located in your channel\u2019s main page) to post images, GIFs, and video previews, as well as to poll your subscribers.

Just imagine all the potential reach with almost two billion monthly users!<\/p>\n<p>What this means is, quite simply, that if you take the time to optimize your videos and you produce quality video content on a regular basis, you can dramatically increase your chances of reaching a wide and targeted audience.<\/p>\n<p>So, how exactly do you do <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/10\/youtube-seo-tips\">YouTube SEO<\/a>?<\/p>\n<p>There are several important factors that count towards your search results ranking; some are completely in your control \u2013 like the keywords you use and how you use them \u2013 while with others, you don\u2019t have as much power over them (like how many people subscribe immediately after viewing one of your videos).<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d9c2e68b-8f6f-4a5f-b115-e6c82bdd20d6\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/video-seo-youtube-titles.png\" alt=\"Video SEO YouTube titles\" width=\"964\" height=\"572\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Here are some of the most important video ranking factors that you need to know about:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Your channel\u2019s keywords<\/strong>: Use the right tags to make sure that YouTube knows what your channel is about.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Video headlines and descriptions<\/strong>: Research keywords to find out what your audience is looking for and use these keywords in your video headlines and your descriptions. (Quick tip: the closer the keyword is to the beginning of the headline, the better!)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Video tags<\/strong>: In addition to keywords, you need to add tags to your videos \u2013 research tags to find out which ones perform best.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Video transcript<\/strong>: Including a video transcript is a great way to make your video more scrapable by search bots. It\u2019s also good for viewers: if they need to check spelling of a word or can\u2019t increase the volume to hear the video, they can still access the content.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Watch time<\/strong>: Your total video watch time (how many minutes\/hours\/etc. people watched of your videos) also counts towards your ranking. The bigger the watch time, the better!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Thumbnail Image<\/strong>: The thumbnail image will be visible whenever your video is indexed, so this should be compelling and relevant.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Engagement<\/strong>: YouTube also looks at your channel\u2019s engagement, including how many likes\/dislikes you get, as well as how many comments and shares.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Subscriber numbers<\/strong>: This doesn\u2019t just mean how many <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/12\/how-to-get-subscribers-on-youtube\">YouTube subscribers<\/a> you have. As I mentioned earlier, how many people subscribe after viewing one of your videos also matters. These subscribers show that your video was relevant and provided value to the viewer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In terms of useful SEO tools, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tubebuddy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TubeBuddy<\/a> is one of the best options because it has so many video SEO features, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/14\/youtube-keyword-research\">YouTube keyword research tools<\/a> to help you find the right long-tail keywords to target<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ecc3f9ef-0c16-4898-b98f-f801defe2e4d\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/youtube-marketing-search-explorer.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube marketing keyword search explorer\" width=\"391\" height=\"1008\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<ul>\n<li>Tag explorer, for discovering popular tags for your channel and your videos<\/li>\n<li>Keyword rank tracking to easily track your videos\u2019 ranking and success<\/li>\n<li>A\/B testing for videos<\/li>\n<li>View and copy video tags<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This last feature that allows you to check videos and see what tags they used.

Search crawlers won\u2019t go searching for a video hidden low on a page, and Google will typically only index the first video.<\/p>\n<p>Optimizing your video content is important for establishing your YouTube marketing strategy, and it can also help with content while you\u2019re getting started. Keyword research is a great tool for finding video ideas. Before you create any new videos, take the time to research keywords and create videos based on the keywords you want to target.<\/p>\n<h2>Next step: YouTube marketing success<\/h2>\n<p>If it\u2019s used right, YouTube can be a great way to promote brand awareness and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/12\/how-to-get-subscribers-on-youtube\">reach more potential customers<\/a>.\u00a0 You can make sure your YouTube marketing strategy is bound for success by getting started with these key steps:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strategize your YouTube presence ahead of time and plan your videos in advance to make sure you publish new content regularly<\/li>\n<li>Create different types of videos to appeal to a wider audience<\/li>\n<li>Take the time to engage with your subscribers and viewers, as well as try to boost engagement with every video<\/li>\n<li>Optimize your channel and your videos for the YouTube search engine to boost your reach<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>About the author<\/h3>\n<p>Highly regarded on the world speaker circuit, <a href=\"http:\/\/t.sidekickopen72.com\/e1t\/c\/5\/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t5XZs7dKKy0VRJ7Rb5v7vbvW3MhGXn56dNflf1hlB8-02?t=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lilachbullock.com%2F&amp;si=5308785829871616&amp;pi=bbb96b0c-541b-4701-8d75-624aeee201de\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lilach Bullock<\/a> has graced Forbes and Number 10 Downing Street.
