And according to Cisco, by 2021, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cisco.com\/c\/en\/us\/solutions\/collateral\/service-provider\/visual-networking-index-vni\/complete-white-paper-c11-481360.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">82% of all Internet traffic<\/a> will be video!<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll want to get in on the action. But the question is: how do you do that when you don\u2019t have a big budget for it?<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/royalty-free-background-music-sources.jpg\" alt=\"royalty free music for videos\" width=\"925\" height=\"617\" class=\"aligncenter skip-lazy\" \/><br \/>\nThere are a lot of costs involved in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/29\/how-to-build-video-culture\">making a video<\/a>, from equipment to post-production. Thus, you\u2019re going to have to find areas where you can cut costs.<\/p>\n<p>Thankfully, background music is an area where you can save your precious budget. Reducing costs doesn\u2019t mean cutting quality in this case. There are lots of great resources for free or cheap music to choose from.<\/p>\n<h2>What Are the Costs for Background Music?<\/h2>\n<p>Before we begin, let\u2019s quickly review the costs involved in acquiring background music for marketing videos.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Royalty-free music<\/strong> doesn\u2019t mean that the music is free; it merely means that you spend a one-time licensing fee and you can use the music however and whenever you want to, for infinity and beyond.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Public domain and Creative Commons works, on the other hand, are free.<\/strong> The difference between the two is that public domain doesn\u2019t require permission from whoever created the work, while Creative Commons often involves permission or attribution.<\/p>\n<p>Now, let\u2019s get into the music sources!<\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">1. YouTube Audio Library<\/span><\/h2>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/youtube-audio-library-free-music.png\" alt=\"free music for youtube videos\" width=\"1324\" height=\"612\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In the \u201cCreate\u201d section of YouTube, you\u2019ll find their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/audiolibrary\/music\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Audio Library<\/a>. It contains a bunch of music from different genres, from Dance &amp; Electronic to Country &amp; Folk.<\/p>\n<p>You can use any track for free in your video content. The music is a mix of public domain works and Creative Commons. All you have to do is to attribute the owner of the track.<\/p>\n<p>To get the most out of the library, make use of its search functions. For instance, you can search according to mood such as \u201ccalm,\u201d \u201cdramatic,\u201d or funky.\u201d Or you can search according to the duration of the track, which is a good idea to make sure it fits the length of your content.<\/p>\n<p>Another area that\u2019s interesting to check out on YouTube is their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/music_policies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Music Policies<\/a> section. Here you\u2019ll find a list of popular tracks and details on whether you\u2019re allowed to use them in YouTube videos or not, as well as how you can use them.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 Worried you&#8217;re wasting spend in Google Ads?

In the <a href=\"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/curator\/video\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Music for Video<\/a> section, there are various tracks which carry different licenses.<\/p>\n<p>These are mostly different types of Creative Commons licenses. Some are for non-commercial use only, others require attribution, and so on. For more info on the particular licenses, you can visit their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.freemusicarchive.org\/faq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FAQ section<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The good thing is that you can filter search results by license. So, because you want the music for marketing purposes, you would go ahead and uncheck the \u201cnon-commercial use\u201d box.<\/p>\n<p>As you\u2019ll see with most of these sites, you\u2019re not going to find a Beyonce-level track or anything. But the music at FMA is very pleasant and certainly suits the purpose. At the end of the day, it\u2019s free to download.<\/p>\n<p>You should also check out the site\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/curator\/Video\/blog\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Music for Video blog<\/a>, which showcases the music and where it might fit into different types of content.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RELATED: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/18\/music-in-ads\">How to Use Music in Ads (without Getting Sued!)<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">3.

Paid tracks start at $1.<\/p>\n<p>The site has a global community that uploads their own tracks. You can browse tracks through categories, recent items, or most popular. Once you find music that you like, you can download single tracks or bundles of tracks, called <a href=\"https:\/\/audiojungle.net\/category\/music-packs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">music packs<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The site also has an exciting new feature, <a href=\"https:\/\/audiojungle.net\/category\/music-kits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">music kits<\/a>. These kits offer music in a modular way so that you can manipulate the tracks yourself. It\u2019s a neat feature if you want to customize your music.

Amateur musicians and DJs use it to upload and share their music. That\u2019s why you sometimes come across tunes that are \u2026 questionable.<\/p>\n<p>But SoundCloud is an excellent source of music to use for marketing videos. You can filter your search to show tracks that are licensed for reuse. Type in \u201cbackground music,\u201d or try something like \u201cuplifting background music,\u201d \u201cambient beat,\u201d etc.<\/p>\n<p>SoundCloud has a social element, so you can see when a particular track already has a lot of \u201clikes,\u201d and you\u2019ll know people will enjoy your video if you use it.<\/p>\n<p>The best thing about getting your background music from SoundCloud is that the tracks sound more like real music, as opposed to a contrived track made for a marketing video.<\/p>\n<h2>6.

All of the available royalty-free music is classical.<\/p>\n<p>So, you\u2019ll be able to download hits from my main man Johann Sebastian Bach and many more.<\/p>\n<p>You can search according to instrument, composer, and author. This is useful if you have a specific idea or feel you want the music to have.<\/p>\n<p>The music on offer may not be entirely modern. But it will fit well if you want to give off a sophisticated or educated vibe. Plus, it can be highly recognizable, which makes your video memorable to the viewer.<\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">7.

(A loop is a short piece of music that\u2019s repeated seamlessly.)<\/p>\n<p>There are over 100,000 tracks on the site. Now, it\u2019s not free, unfortunately. But they do offer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.audioblocks.com\/join\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a good deal<\/a>: $149 for unlimited downloads for an entire year. That\u2019s not bad considering you get access to thousands upon thousands of pieces of music.<\/p>\n<p>You can filter your search to find music the exact length of your video. That\u2019s a great way to save you some editing time.<\/p>\n<p>They have some interesting categories for tracks, according to feelings or emotions, such as \u201cAggressive,\u201d \u201cSad,\u201d \u201cHappy,\u201d \u201cPlayful,\u201d and so on.

If you find a particular artist you like and want to see more from them, you can visit their profile in the <a href=\"http:\/\/ccmixter.org\/view\/media\/people\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u201cPeople\u201d section<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Alternatively, there\u2019s an old-school <a href=\"http:\/\/ccmixter.org\/tags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tag cloud<\/a> you can use, which makes finding the type of track you\u2019re looking for less complicated. When you click on a track, you can see a bunch of information about it, including its Creative Commons license.<\/p>\n<p>It can be a little tricky to navigate, but ease of use aside, ccMixter is an excellent resource for finding original background music.<\/p>\n<h2>9.

You can search their music library according to project type, which is a fantastic feature for our purposes.<\/p>\n<p>You have a couple of drop-down boxes. In the first, you choose the type of project. For example, \u201cadvertising,\u201d \u201csoftware,\u201d or \u201cvideo games.\u201d Then you choose the platform where the music will be featured \u2013 for example, \u201cFacebook,\u201d \u201cYouTube,\u201d \u201cInternet,\u201d or \u201cKickstarter.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I gave it a go and selected advertising and YouTube. It came up with some jazzy beats that you would expect to hear in those type of ads.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s also a search bar, and you can refine your results by genre, theme, instrument, speed, and duration.<\/p>\n<p>Jamendo is impressive, though not nearly as cheap as other providers. It costs about $50 to license a track \u2013 which is not so bad if you\u2019ve got at least a small budget to work with.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s also a <a href=\"https:\/\/licensing.jamendo.com\/en\/subscription?source=pricing_index\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">subscription option<\/a> to get unlimited access to all music.<\/p>\n<h2>10.

You can search through them using filters such as year, artist, or genre. Netlabels also offers a small section of foreign language music, which could be useful.<\/p>\n<p>Another valuable aspect of this site is that tracks have a view count. Most likely, those tracks that have a higher number of views are more popular.
