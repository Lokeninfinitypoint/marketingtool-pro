Here are 10 examples of interactive content marketing done right.<\/p>\n<p>But first, let\u2019s talk about why interactive content marketing is and why it can help your strategy.<\/p>\n<h2>What is interactive content marketing?<\/h2>\n<p>Interactive content is content a user can engage with and manipulate, like those aforementioned quizzes, as well as data visualizations, calculators or infographics, as Mitchell Kelly, digital marketing director of performance marketing company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pathfinderalliance.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pathfinder Alliance<\/a>, put it.<\/p>\n<p>Another common example is the free quotes consumers can receive on insurance company websites, said Greg Heilers, co-founder of SEO and content marketing firm Jolly SEO.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cInteractive content is one of the best ways to engage your audience and enhance the customer experience,\u201d Membrillo added. \u201cInteractive content allows the reader to actively participate, as opposed to passively reading, watching or listening.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Why is interactive content marketing effective?<\/h2>\n<p>Interactive content is indeed more engaging: BuzzFeed said <a href=\"https:\/\/digiday.com\/media\/buzzfeed-quizes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">96% of users<\/a> who start its sponsored quizzes finish them, for example.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ee74ba00-2893-452c-a6d8-63e5aab34ddc\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/interactive-content-buzzfeed-quizzes-graph_0.jpg\" alt=\"Buzzfeed quiz graph\" width=\"776\" height=\"702\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>\u201cSince customers engage more with interactive content, this leads to more views, resulting in more brand awareness, which eventually translates to more customers,\u201d Heilers said.<\/p>\n<p>Samantha Moss, editor and content ambassador of relationship blog Romantific, noted it\u2019s a form of content that helps brands <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/15\/audience-targeting\">target the right consumers<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMost of the people who will react to your content are people who are likely interested in your brand,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Kelly said there&#8217;s a lot of buzz about interactive content among publishers because of its potential to drive links, shares, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/30\/social-media-engagement\">engagement<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHowever, I think interactive content is being slept on big time in terms of its potential to skyrocket <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/19\/conversion-rate-benchmarks\">conversion rates<\/a> for both lead generation and ecommerce websites,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s in part because interactive content can be used to collect customer information, said Oli Graham, marketing manager for copywriting company RightlyWritten.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe bonus with interactive content is that the information gleaned from the customer when interacting with the content \u2026 can be used to segment your customers into different personas,\u201d he noted. \u201cThis will create better-converting funnels in the long term.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also a channel that enables users to send direct <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/24\/customer-feedback\">feedback<\/a> to brands.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith this feedback, the marketer immediately knows what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not working,\u201d said Tom De Spiegelaere, founder of digital marketing agency Tom Spicky.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It also provides an experience that <\/strong><strong>cannot be cited without a link.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cSay, for example, you write an article based around what a new interactive map shows people,\u201d Graham said. \u201cYou cannot create that story without linking to the map itself. Therefore, interactive content is highly linkable and becomes a linkable asset on your website.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Our 10 favorite examples of awesome interactive content<\/h2>\n<p>Now that we\u2019re clear on what interactive content is and why it\u2019s effective, let\u2019s move on to learning from some awesome examples. There are tons out there, but here are 10 favorites among digital marketers, which educate and entertain.<\/p>\n<h3>1.

HubSpot\u2019s Website Grader<\/h3>\n<p>This free website tool from marketing software HubSpot grades sites based on factors like performance, mobile readiness, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/20\/seo-audit\">SEO<\/a>, and security.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a6659f0e-2abc-4dd4-ad58-e07a37ba41a1\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/interactive-content-website-grader.jpg\" alt=\"interactive content example: HubSpot Website Grader\" width=\"507\" height=\"571\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/website.grader.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HubSpot\u2019s Website Grader<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Heilers called it a \u201cquick, free way to evaluate a website,\u201d adding, \u201cIt&#8217;s a great way for HubSpot to increase their leads, by offering to provide further advice to website owners with poor ratings.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>3. Allbirds: Why Our Future May Depend on Birds<\/h3>\n<p>Nate Nead, CEO of SEO firm SEO.co, pointed to DTC shoe brand Allbirds\u2019 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/paidpost\/allbirds\/the-view-from-above.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">paid post with the New York Times<\/a> on how birds impact the environment, how consumers can help protect birds, and how Allbirds makes \u201cbetter shoes in a better way.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"fd12f18a-6118-49e9-8e65-9a3cf6e6546c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/interactive-content-allbirds.jpg\" alt=\"interactive content example: Allbird NYT paid post\" width=\"782\" height=\"328\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The experience includes sounds of various bird calls, as well as visuals of the birds and their environments in motion.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the biggest boons to interactive content marketing is the stickiness factor,\u201d Nead said. \u201cWhen content is sticky and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/25\/dwell-time-seo\">dwell time<\/a> significantly increases, so, too, do rankings, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/22\/conversion-rate-optimizations\">conversions<\/a>, and sales. It tends to have a triple-net effect.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>4. Function of Beauty\u2019s Hair Quiz<\/h3>\n<p>For her part, marketing consultant Olga Tsimaraki pointed to the quiz on the website of DTC haircare brand <a href=\"https:\/\/www.functionofbeauty.com\/order\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Function of Beauty<\/a>, which asks visitors for information about their hair, goals, and fragrance and color preferences to come up with a personalized product recommendations.<\/p>\n<p>Tsimaraki said she likes this example because \u201cthey&#8217;re providing a simpler <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/29\/ux-conversion-rates\">customer\/user experience<\/a>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat people are looking for today is simple answers and interactive content allows companies to do just that,\u201d she added.<\/p>\n<h3>5.

Disney\u2019s My Disney Experience<\/h3>\n<p>According to Membrillo, <a href=\"https:\/\/disneyworld.disney.go.com\/plan\/my-disney-experience\/mobile-apps\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Disney\u2019s My Disney Experience app<\/a> proves it has \u201cmastered the art of interactive content.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It allows visitors to check in to the Disney Resort, find character greeting locations, make dining reservations, navigate the park, and, of course, shop.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUsers can select locations on their interactive map to view real-time wait times for attractions and plan their day by building an itinerary,\u201d he said. \u201cUtilizing Disney\u2019s Magic Band technology, guests can also use the My Photo feature on the app to view photos that automatically synced from attractions they were on.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>8.
