For third-party profiles, that\u2019s not usually an issue, but it\u2019s not a great idea to fire this type of activity at your main website.<\/li>\n<li>They will occasionally fail to get your page indexed (usually they\u2019ll refund in these instances), and it\u2019s not uncommon that they get a page indexed, and then it later falls out of the index (which is why it\u2019s a good idea to replicate citations that are already indexed, as it\u2019s a signal that Google is likely to index and leave indexed your own citations)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you\u2019re in a particularly competitive industry and geography and you want to go beyond the core citations and your direct competitors\u2019 best citations, there are a few ways to expand your citation reach:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Look at the towns you service outside of your physical location and research those competitors for citations unique to those towns.<\/li>\n<li>You can also use the loc: site search operator in Google to find different types of directory or industry opportunities you may not have uncovered:<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/directory-search-on-google.webp\" alt=\"how to do a directory search on google\" width=\"743\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87441\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/directory-search-on-google.webp 743w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/directory-search-on-google-480x386.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 743px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As with many tasks in your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/local-advertising-ideas\/\">local business<\/a>, however, you need to ask yourself the question: Should I be building these local citations myself in the first place?<\/p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd14 <strong>What are the biggest challenges small businesses are facing?<\/strong> Find out that and more in our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/smb-marketing-trends-report?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2025SmallBusinessMarketingTrendsReport_Download\">Small Business Marketing Trends Report<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"local-citations-recap\"><\/div>\n<h2>Bottom line this for me: What should I do in regards to local citations?<\/h2>\n<p>Here are your basic choices for building citations if you\u2019re a small business owner:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can hire a contractor specifically for citation building.<\/li>\n<li>You can ask your SEO company to execute this task (likely if you have an SEO vendor, they\u2019re doing this for you already in some capacity).<\/li>\n<li>You can do the work yourself on the cheap or with the use of a paid tool or multiple paid tools.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Things to consider here will be:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Industry and location competition<\/strong>: If your competitors in Google Maps all have a couple of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-online-reviews-impact-your-business\">reviews<\/a>, many don\u2019t seem to be building citations, and generally you know your industry\/area isn\u2019t competitive when it comes to SEO you may not need to be consistently building citations. Just the key citations and some you find key competitors have may be enough.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Resources:<\/strong> If you or an employee have both time and the ability to execute relatively simple data entry tasks <strong>and<\/strong> you\u2019re cash-constrained, this may be a good task to hand off to someone in the company. If you don\u2019t want to worry about handing this process off or completing it yourself and you can spare a few hundred dollars to have citations built and updated, and then potentially a monthly fee to build more citations over time in a competitive market, it may be worth it to outsource this task.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Given the fact that citation building can have a significant impact on local SEO results, tends to be time-intensive to execute on your own, and is a relatively low-cost service compared to other marketing activities, it\u2019s often the right choice to outsource. If you do hire an agency or contractor for this task, make sure:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You understand the types and volume of citations you\u2019re getting (ask about their process, and whether monitoring indexation and attempting to get citations indexed is included).<\/li>\n<li>They use an email you have access to and give you login information for any profiles they create on your behalf in a shared spreadsheet.<\/li>\n<li>They share the actual citations they\u2019ve built with you in a shared document (which you can then check for indexation yourself!).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Want help building local citations? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/marketing-services?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Demo_Blog_Demo\">Reach out for a demo<\/a>!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Local citations can help you get found in more places online and boost your local SEO.
