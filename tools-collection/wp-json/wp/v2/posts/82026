Customer data can act as the foundation for your marketing strategy, help you optimize and refine your campaigns, and influence the marketing messages you create.<\/p>\n<p>But as privacy becomes even more important and customers pay more attention to how businesses are collecting, storing, and using their information, this is turning into a pretty big challenge for businesses\u2014especially smaller, local businesses.

It includes demographic information, contact information, and more (we\u2019ll get into the types of customer data in a minute!).<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to collect <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2015\/05\/customer-data-designing-for-transparency-and-trust\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">customer data<\/a> so you can refine your campaign targeting, build segmented email lists, learn more about your audience, and more.<\/p>\n<p>Before we dive into the types of customer data, let\u2019s talk about the different sources of data:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Zero-party data:<\/strong> Data customers give to businesses willingly.<\/li>\n<li><strong>First-party data:<\/strong> Data businesses source directly from their customers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Second-party data:<\/strong> Data businesses have access to that they didn\u2019t collect and don\u2019t own. This data can come from a partner sharing data or insights.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Third-party data:<\/strong> Data businesses use that have no ties to the business. This is typically collected from multiple sources and can be purchased by businesses for specific campaigns or research.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/types-of-customer-data-collection.webp\" alt=\"types of customer data collection\" width=\"936\" height=\"563\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81603\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/types-of-customer-data-collection.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/types-of-customer-data-collection-480x289.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Zero- and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/12\/first-party-data\" rel=\"noopener\">first-party data<\/a> are the best types of data collection sources to use when sourcing customer data.

Use a lead management system<\/h3>\n<p>One of the best ways to collect customer data and learn more about your customers is by using a lead management system. A lead management system tracks where your leads are coming from, how they\u2019ve engaged with your business online, and their behavior with your products or services.<\/p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/customer-center\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lead management system<\/a> that uses a single lead inbox can also aggregate your customer data and help you identify interesting trends that can impact your overall marketing strategy and how you spend your budget.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/collect-customer-data-lead-management-inbox.webp\" alt=\"example of automated lead management system\" width=\"936\" height=\"545\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-82037\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/collect-customer-data-lead-management-inbox.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/collect-customer-data-lead-management-inbox-480x279.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This data customer collection method can also help you learn more about your specific customers\u2019 journey\u2014including how many touchpoints it takes a lead to convert or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics\">what marketing channels convert at the highest rate<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Offer a free downloadable resource<\/h3>\n<p>Another great way to build your email list and collect customer data is to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/15\/lead-magnet-ideas\" rel=\"noopener\">provide a free downloadable resource<\/a> that relates to your business.<\/p>\n<p>While this is a popular tactic in the B2B world, it can also work really well for B2C businesses. For example, a cleaning business can provide a downloadable spring cleaning checklist or a dentist can provide a downloadable guide on the foods to avoid for healthy teeth.<\/p>\n<p>The goal is to make your resource compelling enough for a prospect or customer to provide their information in exchange for what you\u2019re offering.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/downloadable-resources-opt-in.webp\" alt=\"example of downloadable resource with email opt in\" width=\"691\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-82038\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/downloadable-resources-opt-in.webp 691w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/downloadable-resources-opt-in-480x416.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 691px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/slumberkins.com\/pages\/caregiver-resources\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>By offering multiple downloadable resources, you can also collect customer data about the topics that drive the most downloads and tailor your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/13\/content-creation\">content creation<\/a> or campaigns to those topics or messages.<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-use-customer-data\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to use customer data for marketing<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve touched a little on how the types of customer data can impact your marketing, but let\u2019s dive a little deeper now that you have some ideas on how to collect it.<\/p>\n<h3>Identify the right marketing channels<\/h3>\n<p>When you understand more about your customers, including their demographic information and where they spend time online, you can choose the right marketing channels that will make the biggest impact on your business.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you know that most of your customers are Gen Zers, then you can assume that TikTok, Snapchat, and Instagram will be big drivers for your business.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/gen-z-tiktok-instagram-snapchat-use-chart.webp\" alt=\"chart that shows social media usage for gen z on tiktok, instagram, and snapchat\" width=\"734\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-82039\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/gen-z-tiktok-instagram-snapchat-use-chart.webp 734w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/gen-z-tiktok-instagram-snapchat-use-chart-480x392.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 734px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.insiderintelligence.com\/content\/more-us-gen-zers-now-use-tiktok-than-instagram\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i>Source<\/i><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Or, if through a survey, you find that most of your current customers found your business on Google, then you might consider focusing more of your marketing efforts on <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/seo-vs-ppc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search ads and SEO<\/a> so you can capture more customers there.<\/p>\n<p>Through collecting customer data, you may also identify some new channels that you hadn\u2019t considered\u2014which can help you test new strategies and make your marketing even more effective.<\/p>\n<h3>Refine marketing messages<\/h3>\n<p>When you understand how your customers engage with your business, what drives them to make a purchase with you, and their top pain points, you can better refine your marketing messages. This helps you personalize your marketing strategy to your most likely customers, which can drive better results.<\/p>\n<p>For example, after sending a survey to your plumbing customers, you may have found that most of them value your quick response time to emergency jobs. You can then use this information in your ad copy, on your website, and in your social media posts to influence potential new customers to give you a call or think of you when they have an emergency.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/plumbing-ad-example-using-customer-data.webp\" alt=\"plumbing ad copy using customer data \" width=\"936\" height=\"299\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-82040\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/plumbing-ad-example-using-customer-data.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/plumbing-ad-example-using-customer-data-480x153.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Optimize campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>Better understanding your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/target-market-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">target market<\/a> through customer data is extremely helpful for optimizing your campaigns and overall marketing strategy.<\/p>\n<p>And even the most basic data about your customers can help.

These targeted messages can help customers feel like they\u2019re getting a personalized experience and lead them to take action.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/personalized-email-madewell-example.webp\" alt=\"example of personalized marketing email from madewell\" width=\"426\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-82042\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/personalized-email-madewell-example.webp 426w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/personalized-email-madewell-example-213x300.webp 213w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Customer data can also help influence the type of content you create, which helps create a more personalized experience for your customers. This <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/content-distribution\">content can be distributed<\/a> across social media, your website, your newsletter, and more, which leads to more engagement on your marketing channels.<\/p>\n<h3>Influence nurture sequences<\/h3>\n<p>When you collect customer data that helps you understand your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-the-buyers-journey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">buyer\u2019s journey<\/a>, you can create nurture sequences meant to increase conversions.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/11\/03\/lead-nurturing\" rel=\"noopener\">Email nurturing<\/a> is when you send a series of emails meant to drive prospects through the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/sales-funnel-template\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sales funnel<\/a> until they convert into a customer.<\/p>\n<p>By collecting customer data about how your customers engage with your business throughout the funnel, you can optimize your nurture sequences to identify the right path for segments of potential customers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/lead-nurture-automation-template-examples.webp\" alt=\"example of lead nurturing sequences in localiq dashboard\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-82043\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/lead-nurture-automation-template-examples.webp 800w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/lead-nurture-automation-template-examples-480x360.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For example, say you\u2019re an SAT prep center. You might find that an email with tips for helping your child study for the SATs followed by an email from a parent and student testimonial who received stellar scores after preparing with your SAT prep center drove a high volume of calls or classes scheduled. That would then be a compelling nurture sequence to continue testing for better results.<\/p>\n<div id=\"tips-for-customer-data-collection-and-storage\"><\/div>\n<h2>Tips for ethical customer data collection and storage<\/h2>\n<p>We can\u2019t end this post without touching on some important tips for collecting and storing customer data.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Include unsubscribe buttons:<\/strong> Every email you send to your email list should include an unsubscribe button so people can opt out at any time.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Create a privacy policy\u2014and publish it on your website:<\/strong> A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.privacypolicies.com\/blog\/how-write-privacy-policy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">privacy policy<\/a> that outlines how you collect, use, and store customer data is essential.
