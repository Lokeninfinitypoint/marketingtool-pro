And content can be things like feature films or fiction novels. But what we\u2019re talking about in this article is digital content used specifically to help businesses get more leads and customers. In other words, it\u2019s content used as part of a marketing strategy.<\/p>\n<h3>Where content creators work<\/h3>\n<p>Digital content creators work in one of three scenarios:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Freelance:<\/strong> Self-employed, does work for several organizations<\/li>\n<li><strong>In-house:<\/strong> A direct company employee (that\u2019s me!)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Agency:<\/strong> A direct employee of a marketing agency<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Freelancers tend to have more flexibility but less security as they have to source their own gigs. In-house content creators have consistent work and pay but have a stricter work environment. Agency creators usually get a wide variety of work but have less influence on strategy and workflows.<\/p>\n<div id=\"whatdo\"><\/div>\n<h2>Types of content creators<\/h2>\n<p>A content creator\u2019s to-do list varies wildly between types of creators. And the line between them gets blurry; an influencer creating TikToks is also a videographer.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve kept it simple by listing the most common types of content creators so you can see how each one operates.<\/p>\n<h3>Influencers and brand ambassadors<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/digital-marketing\/influencer-marketing-tips\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Influencers<\/a> and brand ambassadors grow their own following on social media channels and make money by recommending or selling things to their audience.<\/p>\n<p>In many cases, brands pay influencers to show off their products.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/content-creators-influencer.png\" alt=\"content creator - screenshot of an influencer's post\" width=\"640\" height=\"429\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75863 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/content-creators-influencer.png 640w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/content-creators-influencer-480x322.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 640px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t need millions of people following your account to be an influencer.

They often manage the brand\u2019s social media accounts, too.<\/p>\n<p>Social media managers are jacks of many trades. They may capture images and videos, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/03\/social-media-copy\">write captions<\/a>, manage publishing calendars, and plan campaigns. There\u2019s usually some component of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/25\/social-listening-boolean-search\">social listening<\/a> to understand what the brand\u2019s reputation is online. On top of that, social media managers also track and report <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/05\/social-media-metrics\">metrics<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Zaria Parvez is a great person to follow if you want to get into this type of work.

Ecommerce brands especially need high-quality imagery and video to feed their ever-growing catalogs and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/18\/social-media-advertising\">social media ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/content-creators-product-2.jpg\" alt=\"Content creator - ad for sunglasses on Instagram\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75868 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/content-creators-product-2.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/content-creators-product-2-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Writers<\/h3>\n<p>Writers are absolutely the best category of content creators \ud83d\ude09.

You get to exercise your creativity and logic muscles. Plus it\u2019s just really cool to see things you create out in the wild being experienced by other people.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re interested in how to make the full or part-time jump to paid content creation, here are the seven actions I\u2019d take.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Watch other creators<\/h3>\n<p>The first advice I was given when I asked how to become a professional writer was \u201cread a <em>lot<\/em>.\u201d For visual creators like social media influencers, I\u2019d expand that and say \u201cwatch a lot.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Pick three creators you admire and consume everything they put out. Luckily, we\u2019re talking about a profession that\u2019s public by nature (it\u2019s not like we\u2019re learning the spy trade).<\/p>\n<p>You can do the same for specific topics. If you want to break into fitness content, follow a few fitness <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/20\/youtube-hashtags#:~:text=Adding%20hashtags%20to%20your%20YouTube%20videos%20is%20not,the%20hashtags%20we%20added%20are%20%23swotanalysis%20%23competitiveanalysis%20%23marketing\">hashtags<\/a> and look for themes across the most successful content.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/content-creators-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Content creator - screenshot of search results on YouTube\" width=\"901\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75873 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/content-creators-thumbnail.jpg 901w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/content-creators-thumbnail-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 901px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Notice the details like how often and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/12\/01\/best-time-to-post-on-instagram\">when they post<\/a>. What they use for <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/youtube-thumbnail-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">thumbnails<\/a>. And what topics they talk about.<\/p>\n<p>Then try to guess their strategy. How do you think they\u2019d <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">define their audience<\/a>? And can you tell how they <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/03\/repurposing-content\">repurpose content<\/a>?<\/p>\n<p>The more you learn, the more you\u2019ll notice, then the more you\u2019ll learn.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Join public creator groups<\/h3>\n<p>There are all sorts of public creator groups on networks like Facebook and Slack.<\/p>\n<p>I could list a dozen such groups here, but the way I find them is to Google \u201cgroups for [creator type] on [channel].\u201d So if I want to connect with other content marketers, I\u2019d search \u201cgroups for content marketers on Slack\u201d and see what comes up.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/content-creators-Google.jpg\" alt=\"Content creator - screenshot of a Google search for groups\" width=\"751\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75874 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/content-creators-Google.jpg 751w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/content-creators-Google-480x383.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 751px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve joined and are comfortable with the group\u2019s rules, jump in and ask questions.

Learn the skills<\/h3>\n<p>This is where you put in the\u2014sometimes frustrating\u2014work. The good news is that many companies offer free resources.<\/p>\n<p>Go to the website of any tool you\u2019d use (like <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-use-canva\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Canva<\/a> if you\u2019re into design). Most of these companies want you to learn the trade so you use their products.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/content-creators-Design-school-1.jpg\" alt=\"Content creator - screenshot of canva education page\" width=\"792\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75875 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/content-creators-Design-school-1.jpg 792w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/content-creators-Design-school-1-480x364.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 792px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re leaning towards content marketing and marketing in general, we have tons of free resources about writing on our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/category\/copywriting\">blog<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Social media platforms and search engines also have educational guides. Google, Meta (a.k.a. Facebook and Instagram), and TikTok all have creator resources.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Create, create, create<\/h3>\n<p>No one expects to land an NBA contract before they start playing basketball. The same holds true for content creators. You\u2019ll need to practice and show what you can do before getting paid to do it.<\/p>\n<p>The trick is getting over the fear of starting. Just grab your phone and take a picture of your puppy or current art project. Post it and copy the tone of your favorite influencer. Or rewrite a content marketer\u2019s post you like.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t worry if your first attempts aren\u2019t great. In fact, try to embrace that phase of your growth.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to get better, you have to put in the reps.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Hone your voice and style<\/h3>\n<p>In the early days of your creative process, you\u2019re going to copy other creators a lot. That\u2019s OK. The most creative people in the world have been influenced by other creators.<\/p>\n<p>How do you find your own <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/31\/brand-personality-messaging\">unique style<\/a>?<\/p>\n<p>Pay attention to the one or two things you like best about your favorite creators&#8217; work. Then add them to yours. Eventually, you have a dozen (or dozens) of things that mesh together and become something unique.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Create a portfolio<\/h3>\n<p>As soon as you write, video, or photograph your first piece of content\u2014for pay or practice\u2014save it somewhere.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/content-creators-portfolio.jpg\" alt=\"Content creator - screenshot of a photographer's portfolio\" width=\"703\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75876 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/content-creators-portfolio.jpg 703w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/content-creators-portfolio-480x409.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 703px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/bloggingwizard.com\/online-portfolio-hosting-sites\/#:~:text=Top%20free%20online%20portfolio%20hosting%20sites%201%201.,Adobe%20Portfolio%20...%208%208.%20Journo%20Portfolio%20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Start with Google Docs or another free tool. If things are stored in several files, keep a spreadsheet with links for easy reference.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t be shy about what does in there. You can also restrict access to certain items when you start to share it.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually, publish your portfolio on a public website. Here\u2019s a <a href=\"https:\/\/bloggingwizard.com\/online-portfolio-hosting-sites\/#:~:text=Top%20free%20online%20portfolio%20hosting%20sites%201%201.,Adobe%20Portfolio%20...%208%208.%20Journo%20Portfolio%20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">list of free places<\/a> to keep your portfolio online.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Network<\/h3>\n<p>The old saying that \u201cit\u2019s not what you know, but who you know\u201d is half right. You have to know how to create content. But who you know will help a ton when it\u2019s time to find paying gigs.<\/p>\n<p>LinkedIn is your first friend here. Follow people in your profession. Share, like, and reply to their posts. Ask to connect after they\u2019ve had a chance to see your name a few times.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a personal tip: Reach out to people after they\u2019ve been a guest on a relevant podcast. Most people want to know that their episode sounded good. So I send them a note on LinkedIn telling them how much I enjoyed the episode.<\/p>\n<p>You can do the same things in the industry groups you join and on places like Reddit.<\/p>\n<p>All those connections start to pay off when people recommend you for new opportunities.<\/p>\n<h2>Start your content creator journey today<\/h2>\n<p>It only takes one step to start a journey. Maybe today you post more thoughtfully on social media. Or read a blog post about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/09\/how-to-write-a-blog-post\">writing blog posts<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>No matter where you start, remember these tips:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learn from your favorite creators<\/li>\n<li>To become a content creator, start creating content<\/li>\n<li>Save all of your work in a portfolio<\/li>\n<li>Never stop networking with other creators<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Want to hire or become a content creator?
