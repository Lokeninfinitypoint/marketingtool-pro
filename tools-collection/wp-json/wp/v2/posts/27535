Web forms on landing pages are often subject to \u201cGoldilocks syndrome.\u201d Too long, and you risk deterring prospective customers from converting. Too short, and you may not gather the information you need to qualify visitors as worthwhile leads.<\/p>\n<p>Like Goldilocks and her pilfered porridge, they have to be <em>just<\/em> right.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/landing-page-forms-goldilocks.jpg\" alt=\"Landing page forms Goldilocks\" width=\"450\" height=\"318\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The face of a thief.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In today\u2019s post, I\u2019ll outline seven ways you can improve your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/22\/lead-capture-form\">landing page forms<\/a> to make them attractive to prospects and give you the data you need to qualify your leads. For more info on how to apply these tips for social, check out this post on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/11\/06\/facebook-landing-pages\">Facebook landing pages<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Only Ask for Information You MUST Have<\/h2>\n<p>Many marketers, especially <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/23\/ppc-for-b2b-software-companies\">B2B software companies<\/a>, ask for way too much information in their landing page forms. Let\u2019s look at this example from an enterprise datacenter provider:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/landing-page-forms-too-long-example.png\" alt=\"Landing page forms too long\" width=\"230\" height=\"800\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Now, don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 I realize that, for this kind of web form (that asks prospects to provide information to schedule a software demonstration), the company needs to know the visitor is serious and won\u2019t waste their time.<\/p>\n<p>However, this is asking for <em>way<\/em> too much information. Seriously, I\u2019ve applied for credit cards that asked for less information than this.<\/p>\n<h3>A Need to Know Basis<\/h3>\n<p>When <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/01\/email-validation\">designing a web form<\/a>, it\u2019s crucial to achieve the balance of requesting enough information from the user to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/25\/lead-qualification\">qualify them<\/a> as a valid lead or prospect, without asking them to essentially hand over their identity. Generally, after 7 fields in a landing page form, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/12\/09\/6-things-i-do-when-my-conversion-rates-suck-oli-gardner\">conversion rates start to drop off<\/a> steeply.<\/p>\n<p>Using the example above, let\u2019s take a look at what we could trim from this form. For starters, do you really need to know what state <em>and<\/em> country they\u2019re in? Sure, time zone differences are an issue you have to deal with during product demos, but at least make these fields drop-down menus if you have to have them.<\/p>\n<p>The same principle applies to the Title field. I understand that you\u2019d probably want to demo your software to someone with the authority to make a purchasing decision, but this could be easily determined by the information in the Role in Company field.<\/p>\n<p>This company offers enterprise-level cloud storage datacenter solutions. As such, it\u2019s highly likely that a prospect\u2019s \u201ccloud interest\u201d will be for these services. Why else would they be thinking about requesting a demo? This is a completely meaningless field that serves no purpose. Get rid of it.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Don\u2019t Be Afraid of White Space<\/h2>\n<p>So, now we know that you should ask for information from your prospects sparingly, we need to talk about how your form actually looks on your landing page.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you\u2019re only asking for a little information, your landing page form still needs to be aesthetically pleasing. This means not cramming what few fields you do have right next to one another. Give your web form some room to breathe. It\u2019ll make it less intimidating to the user, and will look nicer overall.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/landing-page-forms-cramped.png\" alt=\"Landing page forms too cramped\" width=\"590\" height=\"516\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Please don\u2019t do this.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>3. Spend Time Crafting the CTA<\/h2>\n<p>The call to action is one of the most important parts of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/19\/webinar-landing-pages\">landing page<\/a> form. Without a strong CTA, your prospects may wonder why the hell they\u2019re handing over all this personal information in the first place. A strong CTA, on the other hand, will reinforce their desire to get their hands on whatever you\u2019re offering and make sure they cross the line and convert.<\/p>\n<h3>Focus on the Benefits<\/h3>\n<p>Creating a compelling CTA is about more than using <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/08\/persuasive-landing-pages\">persuasive language<\/a> (though it definitely helps). Consider the benefits of your offer to the prospect, and then focus on these benefits in your CTA. The more strongly you can reinforce what visitors stand to get out of your offer, the more likely they are to convert.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at an example of a good CTA, versus its bland, boring predecessor:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/landing-page-forms-cta-benefit.png\" alt=\"Landing page forms call to action benefit\" width=\"760\" height=\"471\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Which of these forms is more compelling? Why would I \u201cjoin\u201d or \u201csign up\u201d for something, when I could get FREE stuff? Similarly, the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/20\/call-to-action-buttons\">CTA button<\/a> itself makes it clear what I\u2019ll be getting by signing up, whereas the control version doesn\u2019t offer any hint of what to expect at all.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s another <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/20\/call-to-action-examples\">example of (two) great CTAs<\/a>:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/landing-page-forms-benefits.png\" alt=\"Landing page forms benefits\" width=\"849\" height=\"346\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Even without the \u201cI want to\u2026\u201d above them, the benefits and desired outcomes of selecting either option are clear. <strong>The unspoken \u201cI want to\u201d rule is a great starting point for writing your calls to action<\/strong> \u2013 make sure that, whatever your CTA is, it could be prefaced by \u201cI want to\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Both of these examples are very clickable, make the benefits clear, and leave nothing to suggestion.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Use Radio Buttons to Minimize Typing<\/h2>\n<p><strong>People are lazy.<\/strong> They want to do as little as possible to accomplish their goal \u2013 so leverage their laziness and make it even easier for them to convert by including radio buttons.<\/p>\n<p>Radio buttons work very well for situations in which there are only a few options, or entering the data manually would be tedious for the user.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at a particularly good example of radio buttons being used on a landing page form:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/landing-page-forms-radio-buttons.png\" alt=\"Landing page forms radio buttons\" width=\"624\" height=\"657\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In addition to making it as easy as possible for the user to enter quite a lot of information, the inclusion of radio buttons on this web form mean that the only data the user has to enter manually is their zip code. Very clever, and this makes for a rather attractive form overall.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Use Directional Visual Cues<\/h2>\n<p>You might think it\u2019s obvious what users should do if they want to sign up for whatever you\u2019re offering, but users rarely do what you want them to do unless you make it painfully obvious.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you\u2019ve included your web form above the fold, used plenty of white space to make it attractive, and ask for the bare minimum of information, you could still risk losing them before they cross the line and convert. Why not make it even more obvious where they should enter their information by using visual directional cues to help them along?<\/p>\n<h3>You Can NEVER Make It Too Obvious<\/h3>\n<p>Check out this landing page form for a free gift card for Chipotle.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/landing-page-forms-directional-cues.jpg\" alt=\"Landing page forms directional cues\" width=\"1218\" height=\"807\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Chipotle is taking no chances with this web form. Not only is there a large, helpful arrow pointing to where hungry visitors should claim their free gift card, but they\u2019ve also included simple yes\/no checkboxes and a drop-down menu in the form itself. All the user has to enter manually is their email address.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, this is just the first step users have to complete, as shown by the 1-2-3 graphic at the bottom of the page, but as an example of how to get users to complete a web form, it works pretty well.<\/p>\n<h3>Line of Sight Cues<\/h3>\n<p>Another technique you can use to accomplish this is line-of-sight. Including an image of a person looking at the landing page form you want the user to complete is a more subtle, yet still effective, way of drawing the user\u2019s attention to the form, as this example from dating site Chemistry.com achieves to great effect:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/landing-page-forms-directional-cues-line-of-sight.jpg\" alt=\"Landing page forms directional line of sight cues\" width=\"560\" height=\"339\" \/><\/div>\n<p>However, while the use of a line-of-sight visual cue is very effective in this example, the web form itself is actually rather poor. It asks for a lot of information, as it\u2019s attempting to get users to create a dating profile directly from the landing page. The form itself is pretty cramped (an unfortunate byproduct of the design choices they\u2019ve made with the thought\/speech bubble motif they\u2019re using), and the CTA is weak.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Design Your Landing Page Forms for Mobile<\/h2>\n<p>I can\u2019t stress this one enough. SO many marketers ignore web forms on mobile in the assumption that \u201cpeople don\u2019t complete web forms on mobile.\u201d This might be true to an extent, but it\u2019s not a limitation of mobile devices or the fact that people don\u2019t want to sign up for stuff when they\u2019re on the go, but rather a design problem.<\/p>\n<p>Too many businesses design their web forms for desktop and leave it at that. If you\u2019re doing this, you\u2019re missing out on HUGE opportunities to convert mobile visitors. You absolutely HAVE TO design your landing page forms to be mobile-friendly, whether this is using responsive web design or designing an entirely separate <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/10\/mobile-landing-pages\">mobile landing page<\/a> altogether.<\/p>\n<h3>Consider User Behavior<\/h3>\n<p>Now, you might not be able to optimize certain web forms for mobile. Put another way, you have to consider user behavior and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/09\/04\/mobile-advertising\">how people use their mobile devices<\/a>, and the objectives of your web forms. You\u2019re probably not going to be able to include a 10-field landing page form asking someone to sign up for a software demo on mobile \u2013 it\u2019s just too much.<\/p>\n<p>You may, however, be able to ask someone to sign up for a newsletter, get a quote, or take another action that requires less information, like this example from insurance provide Progressive does:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/landing-page-forms-mobile-example.png\" alt=\"Landing page forms mobile example\" width=\"480\" height=\"761\" \/><\/div>\n<p>All the user has to enter to begin the quote process is enter their zip code. Cleverly, there\u2019s also a clickable \u201ccall\u201d icon at the top of the page, so if the user doesn\u2019t even want to enter their zip, they can call an agent directly. The CTA button is also bright and obvious, a mobile <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/12\/great-landing-pages\">landing page design best practice<\/a>, and the page itself aligns perfectly with the desktop version of the page, which looks like this:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/landing-page-forms-desktop-example.png\" alt=\"Landing page forms desktop example\" width=\"891\" height=\"367\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Sure, you\u2019re not going to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/28\/lead-capture\">capture many leads<\/a> for a software demo or get users to part with a ton of data, but by designing for mobile, you\u2019re at least capturing more potential leads and growing your business.<\/p>\n<h2>7. A\/B Test Everything<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s no use following the previous six tips if you\u2019re not going to rely on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/14\/marketing-data\">cold, hard data<\/a> to make your final decisions. You know what they say about assumptions!<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s crucial to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/26\/ab-testing-best-practices\">A\/B test<\/a> every aspect of your landing page forms before settling on a final design. Take the directional cues example above. WordStream tried including images of actual people on a landing page in one test, only to discover that our audience didn\u2019t respond well (at all) to them. We removed them in a separate design, only to find that our conversion rates improved considerably. As such, the advice above wouldn\u2019t necessarily apply to us and our audience, just as it might not apply to you.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/landing-page-forms-ab-testing.jpg\" alt=\"Landing page forms AB testing\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You&#8217;ll find seven options for A\/B testing and other <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/06\/24\/landing-page-tools\">landing page tools here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Landing page forms are one of the most important parts of a landing page.
