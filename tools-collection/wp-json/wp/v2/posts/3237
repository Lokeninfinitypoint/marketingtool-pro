These days, native advertising is everywhere \u2013 and it\u2019s getting harder and harder to spot.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/native-advertising-examples-turtle-burger1-1.jpg\" alt=\"Native advertising examples turtle disguised as a cheeseburger\" width=\"552\" height=\"294\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>There\u2019s something not quite right about this cheeseburger\u2026<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In today\u2019s post, we\u2019re going to look at what native advertising is, why it can be so <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/19\/most-controversial-ads\">controversial<\/a>, and several native advertising examples that are really impressive \u2013 as well as a few that are downright terrible.<\/p>\n<h2>What Is Native Advertising?<\/h2>\n<p>Simply put, <strong>native advertising is paid content<\/strong>. Articles, infographics, videos, you name it \u2013 if a content producer can make it, corporations can buy it and publishing platforms can promote it.<\/p>\n<p>Now, you might be thinking, \u201cHow does a native advertisement differ from an advertorial?\u201d Well, in order to be considered a true native advertisement, the content should align with the publication or site\u2019s established editorial style and tone, and must also provide the kind of information that the publication\u2019s audience typically expects.<\/p>\n<p>These qualities are what make native advertisements difficult to spot, as they often blend in with the \u201corganic\u201d content extremely well. This is made even more challenging by the fact that there are no defined rules or guidelines on how publishers must label native ads, and standards of transparency vary widely from one publication to another.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that native advertising is not necessarily the same thing as <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/28\/content-advertising\">content advertising<\/a>. Unfortunately, the overlap between the two disciplines and their similarity in name often result in confusion.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLWebBlogInContentTextLinkAllStarPlaybook.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_AllStarPlaybook_Download\"><em>&lt;&lt;Need help with your ads? Check out our (free!) All-Star Playbook to Online Advertising&gt;&gt;<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Why Is Native Advertising So Controversial?<\/h2>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t trick them. Don\u2019t piss them off.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This was the advice of Eric Goeres, director of innovation at Time magazine, speaking at the recent <a href=\"http:\/\/contently.com\/strategist\/2014\/06\/24\/dont-trick-them-dont-piss-them-off-the-sponsored-content-debate-heats-up\/\">Contently Summit<\/a>. Goeres spoke during the \u201cTruth in Advertising\u201d panel at the event, during which the topic of native advertising took center stage. Goeres\u2019 words of warning refer to the trust between a publisher and its audience, and he emphasized the dangers of angering readers by resorting to trickery and deception to make a quick buck.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/native-advertising-examples-simpsons-angry-mob-1.png\" alt=\"Native advertising examples angry mob from The Simpsons\" width=\"518\" height=\"214\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Brands and advertisers love native ads, mainly because the click-through rates tend to be much higher than typical advertisements and engagement is usually much stronger. However, not everyone is as enamored with native ads, particularly consumers.<\/p>\n<p>Several professional organizations have weighed in on the often vague nature of native advertising. The Federal Trade Commission is considering implementing regulatory measures on brands using native ads to promote their products, and the FTC has also indicated it may monitor the market closely to ensure that native advertising is being used in a manner that benefits consumers. The American Society of Magazine Editors has also called for greater transparency and oversight when it comes to native advertising.<\/p>\n<p>The reason that many publishers see native advertising as a risky proposition is the potential for this kind of content to erode the public\u2019s trust. After all, if The New York Times publishes a \u201cstory\u201d by Dell in exchange for money, can the Times objectively report on matters relating to Dell, or has every mention of the company been paid for? This is the dilemma facing publishers today.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/native-advertising-examples-new-york-times-building-1.jpg\" alt=\"Native advertising examples New York Times building exterior\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>Native Advertising Statistics<\/h2>\n<p>Before we look at some of the best native advertising examples (and a rogue\u2019s gallery of some of the worst), let\u2019s acquaint ourselves with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.copyblogger.com\/native-advertising-2014\/\">the state of the native advertising landscape<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Almost half of consumers have no idea what native advertising is<\/li>\n<li>Of those consumers who do, 51% are skeptical<\/li>\n<li>Three out of four publishers offer some form of native advertising on their sites<\/li>\n<li>90% of publishers either have or plan to launch native advertising campaigns<\/li>\n<li>41% of brands are currently using native advertising as part of wider promotional efforts<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>5 Great Native Advertising Examples<\/h2>\n<p>So, now that we\u2019ve established that native advertising is here to stay (for the time being at least), let\u2019s take a look at some of the best \u2013 and worst \u2013 native <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/13\/comparative-advertising\">advertising examples<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>1. &#8220;Woman Going to Take Quick Break After Filling Out Name, Address on Tax Forms,&#8221; The Onion<\/h3>\n<p>One of the funniest satirical sites on the web, The Onion also has a strong grasp on native advertising, as exemplified by this particularly well-known example.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/native-advertising-examples-hr-block-the-onion-1.jpg\" alt=\"Native advertising examples The Onion sponsored post\" width=\"975\" height=\"964\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This example is, admittedly, a little murky when it comes to the definition of native advertising above. Firstly, The Onion created this content specifically for its client (in this case, H&amp;R Block), rather than Block simply publishing its own content on the site. However, the content itself and its positioning still classify it as native advertising, rather than \u201ctraditional\u201d sponsored content, at least in my book.<\/p>\n<p>When this content was published in 2012, it was framed by several traditional vertical and horizontal banner ads for H&amp;R Block. Even if visitors didn\u2019t click on these banners (which they\u2019re unlikely to, as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/its-more-likely-you-will-survive-a-plane-crash-or-win-the-lottery-than-click-a-banner-ad-2011-6?op=1\">you\u2019re 475 times more likely to survive a plane crash than click a banner ad<\/a>, according to Solve Media), the result was significantly increased brand awareness.<\/p>\n<h3>Why It Works<\/h3>\n<p>Although the content of this post isn\u2019t about H&amp;R Block specifically, it does address the typically bland, dry topic of taxes in a fun, relatable and highly entertaining way, creating a positive association with the advertiser. This native ad even poked fun at the box that clearly marks the page as sponsored content by including an endorsement from The Onion\u2019s fictitious \u201cpublisher emeritus\u201d T. Herman Zweibel.<\/p>\n<p>Although the banners served as calls to action, the main purpose of the campaign was to further increase H&amp;R Block\u2019s brand awareness \u2013 a goal that this native advertising example accomplished admirably.<\/p>\n<h3>2. &#8220;Infographic: UPS\u2019s 2012 Change in the (Supply) Chain Survey,&#8221; Fast Company<\/h3>\n<p>This infographic highlighting UPS\u2019s innovations in its supply chain management operations is another excellent example of native advertising. It\u2019s not the prettiest infographic you\u2019ll ever see, but it gets the job done.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/native-advertising-examples-ups-fast-company-1.jpg\" alt=\"Native advertising examples UPS infographic\" width=\"970\" height=\"858\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Why It Works<\/h3>\n<p>What makes this infographic such a great example of native advertising is that its virtually indistinguishable from Fast Company\u2019s typical content. Notice the tiny gray \u201cAdvertisement\u201d tag at the top? It\u2019s definitely easy to miss. The infographic\u2019s use of UPS\u2019 brown and yellow color scheme further reinforces the content\u2019s brand messaging in a subtle way, and the infographic succeeds in selling UPS\u2019 services in the tried-and-trusted \u201cproblem\/solution\u201d format.<\/p>\n<h3>3. &#8220;10 Quotes Every Grad Needs to Read,&#8221; BuzzFeed<\/h3>\n<p>Alongside Upworthy, BuzzFeed is the most successful viral hit factory on the web. Is it any wonder that the site would eventually open up its coveted readership to sponsors with deep pockets? Case in point, the BuzzFeed \u201cCommunity\u201d pages, featuring brands like publishing giant HarperCollins:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/native-advertising-examples-harper-collins-buzzfeed-1.jpg\" alt=\"Native advertising examples HarperCollins BuzzFeed sponsored content\" width=\"849\" height=\"785\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As you can see above, posts made to the Community section of BuzzFeed have \u201cnot been vetted or endorsed by BuzzFeed\u2019s editorial staff,\u201d meaning that HarperCollins (and Mini, and Pepsi, and the other brands that publish content at BuzzFeed) have simply paid for the privilege of getting their brand in front of BuzzFeed\u2019s audience. Apart from the prominent HarperCollins logo above the social share buttons, there\u2019s little to set this apart from BuzzFeed\u2019s regular content.<\/p>\n<h3>Why It Works<\/h3>\n<p>Timeliness factors into the success of this native advertising example. Firstly, the post was published in late June, coinciding well with graduation season. Secondly, the basis of the post was teacher David McCullough, Jr.\u2019s famous \u201cYou Are Not Special\u201d commencement speech, which itself went viral.<\/p>\n<p>The post adheres strictly to BuzzFeed\u2019s popular animated .GIF\/listicle post format, making it easily digestible, and the headline is impeccably crafted for BuzzFeed\u2019s audience, as you\u2019d expect. There\u2019s very little obvious connection between the client (a major publishing house) to the content, aside from the implied relationship between college graduates and books, so the ad comes off as a \u201csoft sell,\u201d which is easier for audiences to stomach than forceful product placement.<\/p>\n<h3>4. &#8220;Should You Accept Your Employer\u2019s Pension Buyout Offer?&#8221;, Forbes<\/h3>\n<p>Forbes has published articles like this for years, but as the publication has transitioned from a full-time staff to a contributor-led model, it\u2019s hardly surprising that Forbes has begun to publish native advertising by financial institutions like this one from Fidelity Investments.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/native-advertising-examples-forbes-brandvoice-1.jpg\" alt=\"Native advertising examples Forbes promoted post\" width=\"1152\" height=\"769\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This is a particularly good example of native advertising, as while the post is most definitely branded and has an unmistakable angle, the post itself contains some real substance. It outlines the pros and cons of both monthly payment and lump sum pension buyout options, backed up with hard numbers about inflation rates and how accepting a pension buyout offer can affect your tax status.<\/p>\n<h3>Why It Works<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, it\u2019s blatantly branded content, and Fidelity makes no secret of its services, but this post actually contains more financial advice and insight than most typical Forbes finance and business content. Readers should most definitely remain aware of Fidelity\u2019s agenda when reading, but overall, this native advertisement provides real value to the reader, does so in a way that Forbes\u2019 audience would expect, and aligns with the publication\u2019s editorial and stylistic guidelines. A great example.<\/p>\n<h3>5. &#8220;Hennessy Fuels Our Chase for the Wild Rabbit \u2026 But What Does It All Mean?&#8221;, Vanity Fair<\/h3>\n<p>Vanity Fair has a long tradition of publishing effortlessly trendy lifestyle journalism, which makes it an ideal vehicle (pardon the pun) for native advertising.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/native-advertising-examples-vanity-fair-hennessy-1.jpg\" alt=\"Native advertising examples Vanity Fair Hennessy cognac ad\" width=\"1035\" height=\"900\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This native ad combines video and written content to go behind the scenes of a video about English race car driver Sir Malcolm Campbell, \u201cThe Fastest Man on Earth.\u201d Campbell was the first man to break the 300mph land speed record way back in 1935, and he remains an enduring symbol of ambition \u2013 the perfect gentleman to sell top-shelf liquor. Hennessy partnered with creative agency Droga5 to produce the video, which coincided with the drink maker\u2019s \u201cNever Stop, Never Settle\u201d campaign.<\/p>\n<h3>Why It Works<\/h3>\n<p>In addition to drawing a subtle yet striking comparison between Campbell\u2019s spirit of adventure and Hennessy\u2019s \u201cWild Rabbit\u201d campaign (\u201ca metaphor for one\u2019s inner drive to succeed\u201d, according to the article), the piece is genuinely interesting. The content\u2019s inevitable product placement is handled well, and it doesn\u2019t feel gratuitous or tenuously positioned alongside the subject matter. Finally, the piece is as stylish as a regular Vanity Fair feature, which results in an engaging experience for the reader.<\/p>\n<h2>The Hall of Shame: Terrible Native Advertising Examples<\/h2>\n<p>Now that we\u2019ve seen how the pros create sponsored content, how about we point and laugh at some of the very worst native advertising examples on the web?<\/p>\n<h3>&#8220;David Miscavige Leads Scientology to Milestone Year,&#8221; The Atlantic<\/h3>\n<p>Although The Atlantic was quick to pull this disastrous foray into native advertising from its site soon after it went live, <a href=\"http:\/\/poynter.org\/extra\/AtlanticScientology.pdf\">it will live on forever<\/a> thanks to the fine folks at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, who decided to permanently archive it \u2013 presumably to prevent such a tragedy from ever happening again.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/native-advertising-examples-atlantic-scientology-1.jpg\" alt=\"Native advertising examples Atlantic Scientology post\" width=\"739\" height=\"814\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Now, aside from the boatloads of cash The Atlantic must have received for publishing this shameless advertorial, I can\u2019t think of a single reason why shilling for what some describe as a dangerous cult in a reasonably well-respected national publication ever seemed like a good idea.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, The Atlantic had the common sense to highlight (with a bright yellow tag) that this was \u201cSponsor Content\u201d, but this did little to mitigate the damage. The publication was widely mocked in the mainstream media, and this classic blunder is routinely used as the poster child for bad native advertising examples.<\/p>\n<h3>&#8220;How to Transform into a Total Nerd Babe,&#8221; Gawker<\/h3>\n<p>I find everything about this content \u2013 and I do mean <em>everything<\/em> \u2013 utterly objectionable and completely offensive, from the vapid headline to the clich\u00e9d copy. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not even the worst part.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/native-advertising-examples-gawker-nerd-babe-1.jpg\" alt=\"Native advertising examples Gawker nerd babe ad\" width=\"995\" height=\"848\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This \u201ccontent\u201d was originally created to promote the TBS reality TV show \u201cKing of the Nerds.\u201d Aside from the tiny \u201cSponsored\u201d tag toward the top of the post (highlighted above), there is nothing to distinguish this ad from the type of drivel Gawker usually publishes. After the promo was over, the editorial staff at Gawker couldn\u2019t even be bothered to restructure the article to remain grammatically correct, and instead just deleted the name of the show (see the second paragraph). For shame.<\/p>\n<p>Gawker (deservedly) took a lot of heat for this and its other native ads, which led the publisher to implement a new policy of transparency. These days, a native Gawker ad looks like this:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/native-advertising-examples-new-gawker-ad-1.jpg\" alt=\"Native advertising examples new Gawker sponsored posts\" width=\"698\" height=\"899\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/native-advertising-examples-new-gawker-ad-strapline-1.jpg\" alt=\"Native advertising examples new Gawker ad strapline\" width=\"656\" height=\"300\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Gawker\u2019s native ads are now tagged by network, appear in a dedicated section of the site (Studio @ Gawker), have their own writers, and the nice, clear statements at the bottom indicating that this is, indeed, an ad. At least now it\u2019s easier to identify which posts should be avoided.<\/p>\n<h3>&#8220;Will Millennials Ever Completely Shun the Office?&#8221;, The New York Times<\/h3>\n<p>This advertorial is so bad, it\u2019s actually a little embarrassing.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/native-advertising-examples-nytimes-dell-1.jpg\" alt=\"Native advertising examples New York Times Dell content\" width=\"1002\" height=\"850\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Not only is the agenda of this piece completely transparent from the outset, the \u201cMillennial work ethic\u201d angle is so tired it\u2019s practically comatose. Even the question posed by the article is ridiculous \u2013 no, Millennials will not \u201cshun\u201d offices, because most of them are saddled with back-breaking student loan debt and can\u2019t find work. Oh, but if they <em>do<\/em> choose to shun the office, they can always use Dell hardware to telecommute, right?<\/p>\n<p>The only thing this native ad has going for it is that it\u2019s impossible to mistake this ad for the Times\u2019 actual editorial content. It also appears that (as of the time of this writing) the Times has removed Dell\u2019s other three sponsored posts, which I\u2019m guessing is because the whole experiment was an unmitigated disaster.<\/p>\n<p>Oh dear.<\/p>\n<h2>Native Ads: More Than Meets The Eye?<\/h2>\n<p>Done well, native ads can be interesting, informative <em>and<\/em> sell a product or build a brand. Get them wrong, however, and your readers will hate you for it. Knowing how to strike this delicate yet crucial balance is difficult, but that hasn\u2019t stopped publishers from jumping firmly on the native ads bandwagon. Only time will tell whether the FTC or other regulatory bodies will chime in on how these ads should be displayed, but for now, it seems likely that both brands and publishers will continue to try and discover the magic formula.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>These days, native advertising is everywhere.
