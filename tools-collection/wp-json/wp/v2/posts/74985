You need to understand their pain points, desires, wants, and needs.<\/p>\n<p>Today, you can use technology and customer surveys to gather information about your customers.

Technographic segmentation<\/h3>\n<p>Teghnographic segmentation separates your costumes by their comfort level with technology.<\/p>\n<p>You can gain this knowledge by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sending out customer surveys.<\/li>\n<li>Looking at how people access your site.<\/li>\n<li>Discovering what brand of devices customers use (Apple, Android, etc.).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/customer-segmentation-models-technographic-google-analytics.webp\" alt=\"customer segmentation models - technographic - example of data in google analytics\" width=\"936\" height=\"485\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-74993\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/customer-segmentation-models-technographic-google-analytics.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/customer-segmentation-models-technographic-google-analytics-480x249.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>You can see what devices people use to visit your website in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/23\/google-analytics-4-vs-universal-analytics\">Google Analytics<\/a>.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Then you can use this knowledge to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Decide if launching a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-market-an-app\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mobile app<\/a> is worth it.<\/li>\n<li>Understand how to improve your existing SaaS product.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/20\/product-positioning\">Design products<\/a> for people less familiar with technology.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can also use this information to determine if you should use a marketing strategy like <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/geofencing-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">geofencing<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/11\/09\/sms-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SMS marketing<\/a> to target people on their mobile devices (here are some <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/text-message-templates\/\">SMS marketing templates<\/a> to help).<\/p>\n<h3>7. Needs-based segmentation<\/h3>\n<p>Every customer needs something different from your company. With needs-based segmentation, you can figure out what you need to improve on. Needs-based segmentation groups customers by <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/types-of-customer-needs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">problems and desires<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For an example of needs-based segmentation, let&#8217;s look at food delivery. If Home Chef delivered its food boxes at the wrong time, customers would be upset about spoiled goods. But by allowing customers to choose delivery days, the company can provide better customer service.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s another example of needs-based segmentation: accessibility. Not all of your customers can see your brand photos, or hear your videos. By putting <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/ada-compliant-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">accessibility measures<\/a> in place, you can reach every one of your customers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/customer-segmentation-models-needs-based-example.webp\" alt=\"customer segmentation models - need-based - example for accessibility on website\" width=\"731\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-74994\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/customer-segmentation-models-needs-based-example.webp 731w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/customer-segmentation-models-needs-based-example-480x393.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 731px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>8. Firmographic segmentation<\/h3>\n<p>Firmographic segmentation is when you separate customers by company attributes. You can use firmographic segmentation to group customers by company size or structure, industry, revenue, and type of organization.<\/p>\n<p>Find this information by looking at public data sources, company websites, annual reports, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/04\/how-to-write-a-press-release\">press releases<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This type of segmentation is most helpful when your customer base is primarily companies, <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/small-business-marketing-data\/\">small businesses<\/a>, and other organizations.<\/p>\n<h3>9.
