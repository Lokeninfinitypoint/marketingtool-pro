To create a Responsive Display ad, a Discovery ad, or a Discovery carousel ad, you provide headlines, descriptions, and images, which Google then adapts to various ad placements\u2014much like a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/05\/responsive-search-ad-copy\">Responsive Search Ad<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here are five subtle ways that Discovery ads differ from Display ads in their appearance:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Text specs:<\/strong> Discovery ad headlines can have up to 40 characters whereas Display ad headlines can have up to 30 characters (like search ads). Why? Who knows! But Google\u2019s own Discovery ad best practices suggest \u201cmedium length headlines\u201d work best, so don\u2019t feel like you have to use up all those extra characters.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Image specs:<\/strong> While Display and Discovery ads both accept square (1:1) and landscape (1.91:1) images, Discovery campaigns also accept portrait (4:5) images. This is because Discovery campaigns were designed to accommodate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/11\/21\/how-to-compete-in-facebook-ads\">Meta Ads<\/a> assets. A common way for Google Ads advertisers to get started with Discovery campaigns is to take your existing ad creative from your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/13\/facebook-advertising-tips\">top-performing Facebook and Instagram ads<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Video specs:<\/strong> You have the option to add<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/13\/video-ad-tools\"> video assets<\/a> to your Display ads, and Google announced all the way back at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/24\/google-marketing-live\">Google Marketing Live 2022<\/a> that this feature is coming to Discovery, too\u2014but as of this writing, video assets are not yet compatible with Discovery ads.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Shopping feed:<\/strong> One of the most common uses of Display campaigns is running <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/17\/dynamic-remarketing-for-retail\">dynamic remarketing<\/a>; that is, connecting your Google Merchant Center feed to your Display campaign, and allowing the system to customize the ad creative based on previous user behavior on your website. Discovery campaigns recently launched a beta program that allows advertisers to connect a feed as well, though the campaign will work towards both <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/26\/prospecting-strategies-ppc-agencies\">prospecting<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/17\/retargeting-campaign-tips\">remarketing<\/a> using the feed data, not just dynamic remarketing.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/dynamic-remarketing.png\" alt=\"dynamic remarketing\" width=\"720\" height=\"259\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-70532\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/dynamic-remarketing.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/dynamic-remarketing-480x173.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><a href=\"https:\/\/faq.businesstech.fr\/en\/faq\/225-whats-the-difference-between-classic-remarketing-and-dynamic-remarketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ad format:<\/strong> In another nod to Meta, Discovery campaigns give you the option of creating a Discovery carousel ad, featuring multiple images, headlines, and links within the same ad unit.

This is analogous to the Microsoft Audience Network, LinkedIn Audience Network, or Facebook Audience Network. Some examples of where your Display ads can show are websites like ebay.com, forbes.com, or tmz.com; apps like MyFitnessPal, TextNow, or Wordle; and YouTube. Yes, YouTube is part of the Google Display Network!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/how-to-use-google-ads-search-vs-display-network.png\" alt=\"how to use google ads - search network vs display network\" width=\"617\" height=\"449\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-62316\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/how-to-use-google-ads-search-vs-display-network-980x713.png 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/how-to-use-google-ads-search-vs-display-network-480x349.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In contrast, Discovery campaigns can only show up in three places: YouTube, Gmail, and the Discover feed.

You can go as broad or as narrow as you like!<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that Google recently announced a change to how content targeting works; if you add Placements, Topics, and\/or Keywords to your Display campaign content targeting, Google Ads will treat those as \u201cOR\u201d options rather than \u201cAND.\u201d For example, if you add five Topics and five Keywords to your ad group, your Display ad can now serve on any of those five topics OR any of those five keywords.<\/p>\n<p>Note that audience targeting has always had an \u201cOR\u201d relationship. If you add multiple audiences to your ad group targeting, Google Ads will show your ads to <em>any<\/em> of those audiences. To create an \u201cAND\u201d relationship between audiences, you must create a Combined segment.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/google-ads-audience-targeting-cheat-sheet.png\" alt=\"google ads audience targeting cheat sheet\" width=\"720\" height=\"538\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-64681\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/google-ads-audience-targeting-cheat-sheet.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/google-ads-audience-targeting-cheat-sheet-480x359.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Google Discovery campaigns do not accept content targeting; only audience targeting. Your options are still quite vast: Demographics, affinity, in-market, life events, your data segments, custom segments, and combined segments.<\/p>\n<p>And of course, you will be opted into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/22\/google-ads-optimized-targeting\">optimized targeting<\/a> by default for both campaign types, which you can turn off in your audience settings if you\u2019d like.<\/p>\n<div id=\"performance\"><\/div>\n<h2>Display vs. Discovery ads: Performance<\/h2>\n<p>For those who are used to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/19\/ppc-metrics\">PPC metrics<\/a> for search and Shopping campaigns, navigating the performance of image-based formats can be a little tricky.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019re familiar with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/14\/improve-google-ads-click-through-rate\">click-through rate<\/a> (CTR) and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/cpc\">cost per click<\/a> (CPC) as key performance metrics, but are you familiar with interaction rate or cost per engagement?<\/p>\n<h4>Interactions<\/h4>\n<p>In Google Ads, a \u201cclick\u201d is a paid click <em>to your website<\/em>. When someone clicks on a search ad or a Display ad, they land on your website and you pay Google for that click.<\/p>\n<p>An \u201cinteraction,\u201d however, is <em>any paid click<\/em> in Google Ads, even if that click does <em>not<\/em> bring the user to your website. For example, if someone clicks on a Gmail ad, that \u201copens\u201d the email\u2014 it does NOT bring the user to your website. The user would have to read the email and then, if they choose, click the call-to-action button to get to your website.<\/p>\n<p>Because of this, a Gmail open is an \u201cinteraction,\u201d but not a \u201cclick.\u201d Gmail is one of the three Discovery placements, so you\u2019ll want to check your interactions, interaction rate, and cost per interaction as well as your clicks, click-through rate, and cost-per-click.<\/p>\n<h4>Engagements<\/h4>\n<p>And then there are \u201cengagements\u201d when the user completes a <em>valuable action<\/em> that is neither a click nor an interaction. For example, watching 10 seconds of your video counts as an engagement, but remember, you don\u2019t pay until someone watches at least 30 seconds of your video, or to the end of the video, whichever comes first.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, if someone forwards your Gmail ad to a friend, that\u2019s an engagement. If they \u201clike\u201d your Discovery ad, that\u2019s an engagement. While I don\u2019t generally look at the engagement, engagement rate, and cost per engagement columns, they can be helpful to check for troubleshooting purposes.<\/p>\n<h3>How can I improve the performance of my Display and Discovery campaign?<\/h3>\n<p>While Display campaigns and Discovery campaigns both have the usual performance levers\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/17\/google-ads-bid-management\">bid strategy<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/14\/google-ads-budgeting-strategies\">budget<\/a>, targeting, campaign settings, etc.\u2014the most important indicator of success is your <em>ad creative<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>This is a sentiment that will be very familiar to those who run <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/07\/facebook-vs-tiktok-ads\">Meta ads or TikTok ads<\/a>, for example, but can be trickier for Google Ads practitioners\u2014we\u2019re used to text-based formats!<\/p>\n<p>Google conducted its own quantitative research on exactly what kind of text and image assets perform best in a Discovery campaign.

Let&#8217;s explore.<\/p>\n<h4>When should I use Discovery campaigns?<\/h4>\n<p>Google Ads Discovery campaigns can only be used with conversion-based Smart Bidding strategies: Maximize Conversions (with optional target CPA) or Maximize Conversion Value (with optional<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/02\/target-roas\"> target ROAS<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Due to their \u201cbottom of funnel\u201d optimization capabilities, high-quality traffic, and high-quality audience matching, I usually recommend testing Discovery campaigns before Display campaigns. Anecdotally, I\u2019ve noticed that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/11\/07\/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead-google-ads\">cost per click tends to be higher<\/a> in Discovery vs. Display, but I\u2019ve also observed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/03\/improve-conversion-rates\">higher conversion rates<\/a> and higher lead quality, so it\u2019s worth it.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to use Discovery campaigns on an awareness objective, you can \u201ccheat the system\u201d by creating a conversion action based on page views. This will essentially turn your Maximize Conversions bid strategy into a Maximize Clicks bid strategy.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/automated-bidding-strategies-goals.png\" alt=\"best automated bidding strategies for different goals\" width=\"542\" height=\"478\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-69299\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/automated-bidding-strategies-goals.png 542w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/automated-bidding-strategies-goals-480x423.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 542px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>When should I use Display ads?<\/h4>\n<p>Google Ads Display campaigns have more broad applications, as they can be used with impression-, click- or conversion-based bid strategies.
