The audience of a slogan is key here\u2014your slogan isn\u2019t only for your target audience or your customers. It\u2019s also how you want anyone to think of your brand.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why a short, pithy statement works best.

That way, you can get a feel for what sounds good and works, plus start getting some ideas for how to capture your brand in a slogan. Here are 21 catchy adverising slogan examples that are so memorable we couldn\u2019t forget them if we tried.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Nike: Just Do It<\/h3>\n<p>This slogan is first for a reason\u2014it\u2019s iconic, and it\u2019s everywhere. Nike uses this slogan on packaging, on clothing, and throughout its <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/13\/best-advertising-campaigns\">ad campaigns<\/a>. This consistently helps with recognition. You only need to hear or see the slogan with the Nike logo a few times before they are linked in your memory.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/marketing-advertising-slogans-nike-just-do-it.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"435\" alt=\"advertising slogans: nike vintage ad\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.maurohernandez.com\/html\/nike_1.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>The origin story for this slogan? Not so nice. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/morning-mix\/wp\/2018\/09\/04\/from-lets-do-it-to-just-do-it-how-nike-adapted-gary-gilmores-last-words-before-execution\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Washington Post<\/a>, in 1988, advertising exec Dan Wieden pitched Nike this slogan, which was based on the last words of a man convicted of murder. Morbid inspiration.<\/p>\n<h3>2. L\u2019Oreal: Because You\u2019re Worth It<\/h3>\n<p>L\u2019Oreal\u2019s slogan \u201cBecause You\u2019re Worth It\u201d turns 50 this year, and its inception has a much nicer story. In <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lorealparisusa.com\/because-youre-worth-it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1971<\/a>, it was 23-year-old copywriter Ilon Specht at the advertising agency McCann who wrote the slogan for the beauty company.<\/p>\n<p>Not only was it the first advertising message to highlight self-confidence, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=j6DHRFuCEwA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">it revolutionized advertising<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/advertising-marketing-slogans-loreal.jpeg\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" alt=\"advertising and marketing slogans: l'oreal because i'm worth it\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lorealparisusa.com\/beauty-magazine\/makeup\/makeup-trends\/loreal-paris-because-youre-worth-it-anniversary.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>And the positive message L\u2019Oreal uses here is still relevant and fresh. The phrase appeals to women\u2019s self-worth with an empowering affirmation\u2014even if it encourages us to act on that empowerment by purchasing beauty products. It\u2019s a timeless advertising slogan, which might just be the best kind.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Maybelline: Maybe She\u2019s Born With It. Maybe It\u2019s Maybelline.<\/h3>\n<p>Maybelline actually changed its slogan in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mamamia.com.au\/maybellines-new-tagline\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2016<\/a> to &#8220;Make It Happen,&#8221; but ask anyone today and the original still reigns. Talk about an enduring marketing slogan.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/marketing-advertising-slogans-maybelline-90s.jpeg\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" alt=\"marketing and advertising slogans: maybelline commercial\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Nkjfw_GM6Ac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This time, though, it\u2019s the wordplay and not the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/31\/brand-personality-messaging\">brand message<\/a> that sticks. The repetition here makes this an earworm\u2014and that\u2019s before you even hear the jingle.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Lay\u2019s: Betcha Can\u2019t Eat Just One<\/h3>\n<p>I love that this slogan is a dare. It not only makes it clear that Lay\u2019s chips are deliciously addicting, but it also represents the brand as active and engaging. Plus, it set Lay\u2019s up for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/12\/marketing-ideas\">creative ad campaigns<\/a> using this slogan.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/marketing-advertising-slogans-lays.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"458\" alt=\"marketing and advertising slogan examples: lays\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.delish.com\/food\/g1549\/snack-food-history\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>5. Burger King: Have It Your Way<\/h3>\n<p>Burger King\u2019s <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/06\/cater-to-your-customers\">customer-centric<\/a> slogan similarly invites the customer in by including the &#8220;your&#8221;\u00a0pronoun.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/marketing-advertising-slogans-burger-king.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"531\" alt=\"marketing and advertising slogan examples: burger king vintage ad\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sa_steve\/4307173454\/in\/photostream\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>But Burger King also positions itself as different from its major competitors\u2014ahemn, McDonald\u2019s\u2014with this slogan by offering personalized service and customized fast food. (Check out this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KJXzkUH72cY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">old Burger King commercial<\/a>, it&#8217;s good for a laugh.)<\/p>\n<h3>6. Bounty: The Quicker Picker Upper<\/h3>\n<p>One way to nail your slogan is to add wordplay. The rhyme with \u201cquicker picker upper\u201d here is unbeatable. Once you hear it, the slogan never leaves your brain. And that\u2019s good for Bounty, especially because it also managed to pack its value (picking up messes) and differentiate itself from the competition (doing that quicker).<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/advertising-marketing-slogans-bounty-vintage.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"414\" alt=\"advertising and marketing slogans: bounty quicker picker upper\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1Z3KdcCpGKo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udcda <strong>Get the guide &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLiQContentDLHowToMakeGreatLandingPages.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_LandingPages_HowToMakeGreatLandingPagesGuide_Download\">How to Make Great Landing Pages (with Crazy High Conversions)<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>7. The New York Times: All The News That\u2019s Fit to Print<\/h3>\n<p>This iconic slogan was first used in 1897, and it still appears on the front page of the newspaper of record today.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/marketing-advertising-slogans-ny-times.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"387\" alt=\"marketing and advertising slogans: new york times fit to print\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>(Though I wouldn\u2019t recommend putting your slogan in quotes. That could lead to questions of attribution, not to mention some clunky images.)<\/p>\n<div id=\"more-creative-advertising-slogans\"><\/div>\n<h2>\u200bCreative advertising slogans that stick with you<\/h2>\n<p>The rest of these advertising slogan examples are more recent than the ones above, but are by no means less powerful. And hey, they just may be celebrating their 50 year anniversaries some day.<\/p>\n<h3>8. McDonald\u2019s: I\u2019m Lovin&#8217;\u00a0It<\/h3>\n<p>Like Lay\u2019s, this slogan is also active. But McDonald\u2019s puts the customers\u2019 experience with its food front and center here: It\u2019s the customer who is loving their hamburger or Happy Meal. Simple and appealing.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/marketing-advertising-slogans-mcdonalds.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"406\" alt=\"marketing and advertising slogan examples: mcdonalds\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>9. Taco Bell: Think Outside the Bun<\/h3>\n<p>A powerful advertising slogan makes it clear <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-make-your-business-stand-out\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how your product or offering is different,<\/a> and that\u2019s what Taco Bell does well here. While most hum-drum fast food options are drive-through hamburgers, Taco Bell offers more.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/marketing-advertising-slogans-taco-bell.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"409\" alt=\"marketing and advertising slogan examples: taco bell\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s also worth noting that Taco Bell recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ocregister.com\/2012\/02\/28\/taco-bell-scraps-think-outside-the-bun-slogan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">changed its slogan<\/a> to \u201cLive Mas.\u201d Timeless slogans are ideal, but the option to change can be a good thing. With the rise of fast casual, there are more options than hamburgers and Taco Bell, and the company responded to that by evolving its brand and its slogan.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Goldfish: The Snack That Smiles Back<\/h3>\n<p>Goldfish are wholesome, friendly, and great for kids\u2014which is mostly thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/01\/brand-strategy\">a smart\u00a0branding strategy<\/a>\u00a0and the fish shape. This slogan anthropomorphizes the barely fish-shaped crackers even more definitively and makes them engaging as well as delicious. Who could say no?<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/marketing-advertising-slogans-goldfish.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"383\" alt=\"marketing and advertising slogan examples: goldfish\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>11. Outback Steakhouse: No Rules, Just Right<\/h3>\n<p>Your slogan doesn\u2019t necessarily have to speak to your product directly. Take Outback Steakhouse\u2019s slogan, \u201cNo Rules, Just Right.\u201d This evokes the hospitality you can expect in the restaurant, and it appeals to a rebellious, rugged attitude that just can\u2019t be tamed by a Ruby Tuesday\u2019s.<\/p>\n<h3>12. State Farm: Like A Good Neighbor, State Farm Is There<\/h3>\n<p>State Farm\u2019s slogan does a great job of setting the tone for its <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/21\/build-client-relationships\">customer relationships<\/a> and making them not only positive, but appealing: This insurance company is as dependable, as accessible as your neighbor.<\/p>\n<h3>13. Toyota: Let\u2019s Go Places<\/h3>\n<p>Toyota\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Go Places\u201d is an excellent example of a slogan that communicates the company\u2019s <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\">value proposition<\/a>. The benefit of having an affordable, dependable car is that you can use it\u2014whether that\u2019s to get home to your family after a long day of work, to travel outside the city for a weekend of hiking, or to a destination you haven\u2019t decided on yet.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/marketing-advertising-slogans-toyota.jpeg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" alt=\"marketing and advertising slogan examples: toyota let's go places\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lebook.com\/lacreative\/creative\/Lets-Go-Places-Campaign-ADVERTISING-2012\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>With the structure here, Toyota emphasizes that it\u2019s a two-way relationship. With the contracted \u201cus,\u201d the company subtly lets its audience know that it\u2019s traveling together.<\/p>\n<h3>14. AirBnB: Belong Anywhere<\/h3>\n<p>According to AirBnB\u2019s brand story, the company\u00a0set out to revolutionize travel by allowing people to experience places not as tourists, but as locals. Staying in an apartment instead of a hotel lets you see different parts of a city; renting a house in the mountains instead of staying in a resort forces you to check out local grocery stores or farmer\u2019s markets.<\/p>\n<p>These nudges toward local living feed into AirBnB\u2019s slogan: \u201cBelong Anywhere.\u201d<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/marketing-advertising-slogans-airbnb-belong.jpeg\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" alt=\"marketing and advertising slogan examples: airbnb\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This simple, powerful statement captures the promise of staying in an AirBnB and, even more importantly, captivates anyone interested to give it a try.<\/p>\n<h3>15. Red Bull: Red Bull Gives You Wings<\/h3>\n<p>This slogan is a cautionary tale. Red Bull\u2019s slogan is punchy and over the top, which is fitting for an energy drink with active consumers.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/marketing-advertising-slogans-red-bull-gives-you-wings.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"358\" alt=\"marketing and advertising slogans: red bull gives you wings\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Unfortunately, this slogan also implies that the product will do the impossible and literally give you wings. The company had to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsweek.com\/red-bull-lawsuit-canada-1455780\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pay out a settlemen<\/a>t for the false claims about the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/06\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells\">marketing copy<\/a>. A good lesson to keep your slogan memorable but not fraudulent.<\/p>\n<h3>16. Capital One: What\u2019s in Your Wallet?<\/h3>\n<p>This credit card company\u2019s slogan is catchy because it\u2019s so simple: a question about what\u2019s inside your wallet. This question is a great way to grab attention. We all carry around our licenses, credit cards, useless ATM receipts, a stack of random punch cards for coffee shops that we never remember to use in the first place\u2014but maybe that\u2019s just me?<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/marketing-advertising-slogans-capital-one-wallet.jpeg\" width=\"720\" height=\"488\" alt=\"marketing slogans: capital one what's in your wallet\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>By structuring the slogan as a question, too, Capital One is starting a conversation with its audience. This invitation is a great way to position the brand as a partner in a less explicit way than State Farm\u2019s slogan, for instance.<\/p>\n<h3>17. Home Depot: How Doers Get More Done<\/h3>\n<p>Owning a home means pretty much giving up every weekend to chores. And whether it\u2019s mowing the lawn, cleaning the gutters, painting the closets, or a bigger DIY bathroom upgrade, you can always count on at least two last-minute trips to a hardware store for supplies. Home Depot knows this, and that\u2019s why it is\u00a0referenced in their slogan.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/advertising-marketing-slogans-home-depot.png\" width=\"446\" height=\"324\" alt=\"advertising and marketing slogans: home depot how doers get more done\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Using \u201cdoers\u201d here for their audience is an amazing way to capture the range of people in its audience. Doers includes the qualified contractors and builders, as well as the weekend DIYers, and that\u2019s good for business.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 Want marketing and slogan ideas for every month of the year?

Apple: Think Different<\/h3>\n<p>When I was in high school, there was an American Eagle shirt that said \u201cBe Different\u201d that so many people I knew had. So many of my classmates wanted to proclaim how different they were in the same way\u2014and I\u2019m sure at the time I asked my mom to drive me to the mall to no avail, but that\u2019s beside the point.<\/p>\n<p>The point is that a desire to be different is universal.<\/p>\n<p>Apple uses that desire with its simple, powerful slogan.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/marketing-advertising-slogans-apple.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"249\" alt=\"advertising and marketing slogans: apple think different\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>19. Pizza Hut: No One Outpizzas the Hut<\/h3>\n<p>This is an absurd slogan, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s stuck in my brain since I was reading books for stickers to get a free personal pan pizza. Does anything really call Pizza Hut \u201cthe Hut\u201d? Doesn\u2019t almost everywhere else have better pizza?<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/marketing-advertising-slogans-no-one-outpizzas-hut.png\" width=\"506\" height=\"383\" alt=\"marketing and advertising slogans: no one outpizzas the hut\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Whatever it actually means, the sentiment is clear: Pizza Hut is the best, and that\u2019s often the takeaway you want from a slogan.<\/p>\n<h3>20. Papa Johns: Better Ingredients, Better Pizza<\/h3>\n<p>The repetition here does more than help an audience remember. It suggests a relationship that compares this pizza chain to its competitors: Papa Johns uses the better ingredients, so it\u2019s Papa Johns who has the better pizza.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/advertising-marketing-slogans-better-ingredients-better-pizza.jpeg\" width=\"550\" height=\"309\" alt=\"advertising and marketing slogans: papa johns better ingredients\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>I\u2019ll be honest: I don\u2019t really need all the pieces of pepperoni on a pizza to be the same size in order to think it\u2019s delicious. But it\u2019s a nice message, and a memorable slogan.<\/p>\n<h3>21. Dunkin Donuts: American Runs on Dunkin<\/h3>\n<p>This might be my favorite slogan, and I say that with no affinity for Dunkin\u2019s coffee. (Despite living in Boston for the better part of a decade, I still just can\u2019t stomach it. But munchkins are a different story.)<\/p>\n<p>The proclamation in this slogan is bold, and it\u2019s clear. America relies on its coffee brand of choice, and it needs it to function. Plus, the internal rhyme with \u201cruns\u201d and \u201cDunkin\u201d ads a sing-song rhythm to the phrase that makes it sound all the more appealing.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/marketing-advertising-slogans-dunkin.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"201\" alt=\"advertising and marketing slogans: america runs on dunkin\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Now, to be clear, this is an exaggeration. But announcing that all of America likes your coffee and Boston Cremes isn\u2019t making a fraudulent promise\u2014it\u2019s just being confident.<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-draft-your-own-catchy-advertising-slogans\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to draft your own catchy advertising slogans<\/h2>\n<p>We just ran through a lot of unforgetting advertising and marketing slogans.

It\u2019s worth your time to find that for your business.<\/p>\n<h3>Start with your brand<\/h3>\n<p>An advertising slogan resonates because it fits with the brand. Pizza Hut\u2019s brand is playful, and its slogan is absurd. Apple\u2019s brand is aloof, and so is its command of a slogan. When you start writing, keep your brand in mind. You want the slogan to match your brand\u2019s voice and appeal to your audience, so <a href=\"https:\/\/www.trychameleon.com\/blog\/brand-alignment\">brand alignment<\/a> is key.<\/p>\n<h3>Be honest<\/h3>\n<p>You can\u2019t overpromise in your slogan. Instead, focus on your product\u2019s strength and what makes your offering different than your competition. Double down on that and skip any false promises.<\/p>\n<h3>Use emotion<\/h3>\n<p>The best slogans are memorable because the audience has an emotional response. You don\u2019t need to be so heavy-handed as using words like love or smile in your slogan like McDonald\u2019s and Goldfish, but you do want to pay attention to what <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/03\/emotional-marketing-copy\">emotional reaction you\u2019re eliciting with words<\/a> and sounds in your slogan.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/advertising-slogans-emotions.png\" width=\"595\" height=\"329\" alt=\"chart of advertising slogans and associated emotions\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.capterra.com\/create-a-catchy-slogan-for-your-small-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Keep it quippy<\/h3>\n<p>Our attention spans are short, and only getting shorter! Your slogan needs to be quick, and even better if it\u2019s quippy. Whether it\u2019s a clever reference, rhymes, or some wordplay, this will help make your slogan\u2014and your business\u2014unforgettable.<\/p>\n<h2>Start adding amazing advertising slogans to your campaigns<\/h2>\n<p>Was that alliteration heavy-handed? Yes, it was. But it stuck out, and your slogan should, too, to make sure your business is memorable for your audience. So use these iconic advertising slogans for inspiration, and follow the lessons we gleaned from them as you start drafting your own. Good luck!<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><input type=\"hidden\" id=\"hippowiz-ass-injected\" value=\"true\" \/><input type=\"hidden\" id=\"hvmessage-toextension-listener\" value=\"none\"
