Whether you&#8217;re building a chatbot for a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/17\/how-to-start-a-digital-marketing-agency\">digital marketing agency<\/a>,\u00a0a hair salon, or an <a href=\"https:\/\/rickywang.com\/dropshipping\/\">online dropshipping business<\/a>, they can be used for marketing, sales, customer support, and the list goes on. Here are the basics for building out a chatbot for your business.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>Want a ready-to-go (free!) chatbot for your site? <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/chat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">We&#8217;ve got you covered<\/a>!<\/div><\/div>\n<h3>Step 1: Decide the purpose of your chatbot<\/h3>\n<p>A large chunk of your target buyers will not sign up in the first go. They are likely not even looking to talk to you face-to-face or over a call, or book a demo. In fact, most of these visitors will leave without doing anything. This puts your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/07\/11\/landing-page-conversion-rate-guide\">average conversion rate<\/a> with forms, emails, and paid ads at something like\u00a02-3%.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than driving all attention to capturing lead profiles, use\u00a0a customized live chat to engage new visitors, and through these conversations, they\u00a0will willingly supply you with their profile information. This means that you need to determine the functions you want your bot to perform.\u00a0For instance, let&#8217;s say I am building Kiki, a chatbot for my cloud integration platform. Kiki has three major duties:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monitor each new visitor and returning users.<\/li>\n<li>Promptly ask what they are looking for.<\/li>\n<li>Help in scheduling demos or looking up a feature.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Knowing Kiki&#8217;s primary purpose, here&#8217;s how my initial conversation flow will look:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"004eb2c1-895f-4b44-b091-5c25b33dbd92\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20build20the20ideal20chat20bot20conversation20flow-1.png\" alt=\"how to build the ideal chat bot conversation flow\" width=\"800\" height=\"467\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at a practical implementation now. This is how the chatbot on <a href=\"https:\/\/mobilemonkey.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MobileMonkey<\/a> converses with a new visitor.\u00a0Here\u2019s the starting point:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a84b71d3-a7de-466c-8e36-41c0cb1d8f20\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20build20the20ideal20chat20bot20mobile20monkey_0-1.png\" alt=\"how to build the ideal chat bot mobile monkey\" width=\"450\" height=\"629\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The next step <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/05\/increase-email-signups\">asked for my email address<\/a>, which I provided. Then it gave a brief of what MobileMonkey does and asks if you\u2019d like to connect with them over SMS. You get two options\u2014<strong>Connect on SMS<\/strong> or\u00a0<strong>No Thanks<\/strong>. I tried using both to see where it leads. With the first option, it asks\u00a0for your phone number.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"0b065c73-f36c-4d3f-8711-1c862f2f5a9c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20build20the20ideal20chat20bot20mobile20monkey202-1.png\" alt=\"how to build the ideal chat bot mobile monkey 2\" width=\"450\" height=\"558\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>For the second option, it will yet again ask if it can follow up on SMS. Here, I picked No.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"130147cf-9ade-4fb7-b730-e5eca477f7ea\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20build20the20ideal20chat20bot20mobile20monkey20no-1.png\" alt=\"how to build the ideal chat bot mobile monkey no\" width=\"450\" height=\"181\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Here, the chatbot quickly wrapped up this part of the conversation but not without bringing a few useful resources to potentially keep my attention.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1a409d67-290a-4572-90ca-e2bbb1aa28b2\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20build20the20ideal20chat20bot20mobile20monkey20conversation-1.png\" alt=\"how to build the ideal chat bot mobile monkey conversation\" width=\"450\" height=\"682\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Our conclusion? The MobileMonkey chatbot fairly does its task of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/28\/lead-capture\">capturing new lead<\/a> details. They now have my name and my email address. Also based on my choices, they have already segmented me into one of their related segments. I won\u2019t be surprised to see some <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/21\/promotional-email-examples\">nurturing emails <\/a>soon in my inbox.<\/p>\n<p>In <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/08\/live-chat-rulebook\">live chats<\/a>, responses are short and crisp. If your chatbot is overloading information, it will turn off the customer. Remember, the attention span of a human is less than that of a goldfish! Also, your customers opted for a live chat because they want a *quick&#8221;* response to *quickly*\u00a0solve the matter. Any unwanted information will spoil it.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 2: Incorporate\u00a0the elements of\u00a0conversation<\/h3>\n<p>If you take a closer look at the chat\u00a0flow above, you will see that a chat conversation has seven specific elements. Not just in this conversation flow, but every chatbot conversation you\u00a0design will have these elements.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Greetings:<\/strong> This is used to start your conversation. The level of formality will depend on whether you are a returning user or a new visitor. For instance, in the case of MobileMonkey above, I was a new visitor. It is evident from the chat conversation. What happens post subscribing? Look at how conversations begin here. It doesn\u2019t need to capture any details about my profile. Very informal greetings, waiting right inside my <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/28\/facebook-messenger-marketing\">Facebook Messenger<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c0a81a8c-274e-49d2-93f4-9e37ff2c9d98\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20build20the20ideal20chat20bot20mobile20monkey20greeting-1.png\" alt=\"how to build the ideal chat bot mobile monkey greeting\" width=\"500\" height=\"567\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>2. Questions: <\/strong>To engage or to acquire information, the chatbot must ask questions to keep\u00a0the conversation going. For instance, if you are talking to the AccuWeather bot on Facebook, it will keep asking you questions for you to provide an answer. There is no in-between here.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"966bd54b-a89c-4b9b-85c1-2352311df966\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20build20ideal20chatbot20accuweather-1.png\" alt=\"how to build ideal chatbot accuweather\" width=\"800\" height=\"839\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>3. Information:<\/strong> This is over to the user. The user is supposed to enter information that is either requested or important for the conversation to proceed.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4fceaac6-39a5-4cee-90d0-beb4fd1f8f25\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20build20ideal20chatbot20accuweather20inform-1.png\" alt=\"how to build ideal chatbot accuweather inform\" width=\"800\" height=\"518\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>4. Verification:<\/strong> This is where the bot clarifies information and tests the understanding of the user.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"00e8585b-2ea8-4df9-b6f7-7c2e27800d1c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20build20ideal20chatbot20accuweather20check-1.png\" alt=\"how to build ideal chatbot accuweather check\" width=\"800\" height=\"518\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>5. Errors:<\/strong> Some conversations may lead up to a point where the chatbot is unable to find an answer or fulfil the user&#8217;s request.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6. Apologies:<\/strong> If the chatbot fails to give relevant answers, it politely acknowledges its failures and attempts to serve as a bridge to alternative solutions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>7. Suggestions:<\/strong> The chatbot offers the user with relevant actions or options to get started from there.<\/p>\n<p><strong>8. Conclusions:<\/strong> This marks a clear end to the conversation.<\/p>\n<p>Apart from this, there is also a visual element that cannot be ruled out. Using GIFs, images, emojis, and videos can be a great way to keep the engagement going. Consider understanding your social users\u2019 intent or what we call \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/20\/social-listening\">social listening<\/a>\u2019 to draft relevant automated responses.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 3: Start testing your conversation<\/h3>\n<p>Remember how your teacher would ask you to read your lessons out loud? It is said that hearing what you are reading helps you spot errors faster. The same rule applies to creating perfect\u00a0chatbot conversations. When you start testing your conversation flow, you start pointing out errors that need fixing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pro-tip<\/strong>: Try doing this with a partner who has no clue about your chatbot. This is an effective method because a neutral pair of eyes can give you better feedback. You already have a picture of what or how your chatbot will speak. Having\u00a0neutral judgment helps in such cases.<\/p>\n<p>You can use several chatbot builder tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tidio.com\/chatbots\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tidio<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/hellotars.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hello Tars<\/a> to test your conversation. I tried my hands at creating a chatbot conversation workflow on Tidio using one of their ready-made templates.<\/p>\n<p>You can build your own chatbot (with zero coding skills). You can simply copy their JavaScript code and paste it on your website to get your chat widget. As for customizations, that is seriously taken care of. Check out my version of Kiki for a B2B eCommerce platform.<\/p>\n<p>In this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/13\/chatbot-examples\">chatbot example<\/a>, the purpose of the chatbot was to help visitors to look for an item or category.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ae350edd-08f7-4099-aaaf-e00916ba3772\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20build20ideal20chatbot20pick20a20category-1.png\" alt=\"how to build ideal chatbot pick a category\" width=\"800\" height=\"431\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Pro Tip: Crafting your monologue and parts of a dialog based on the target segment <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/03\/increase-sales-online\">driving most sales<\/a>\/traffic is a great place to start optimization. For example: Having a friendly tone with new-age jargon has done well for many businesses when marketing to millennials or Gen X.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 4: Choose the right words to end your conversation<\/h3>\n<p>You may think there is no point in wasting time over deciding\u00a0what your chatbot says before the chat ends. You&#8217;re wrong! A warm goodbye message seals the deal for you. You&#8217;ll earn the trust of your user by giving out relevant solutions to their problems and being nice to them throughout.<\/p>\n<p>Why must you have an ending? Because you are doing everything in your power to make the conversation as human as possible. A real conversation with a human will always have an ending\u2014a goodbye.\u00a0So spend some time on how you want to end your conversation. Adobe often asks for feedback or says they will call back. In this instance, it is feedback, but only after a cordial ending statement\u2014&#8221;You are welcome. Hope this helps.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"142480cc-4ec6-4fb4-bdda-4545740424ed\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20build20ideal20chatbot20you20are20welcome-1.png\" alt=\"how to build ideal chatbot you are welcome\" width=\"450\" height=\"678\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Some alternatives you can try:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Glad I could help.

Don&#8217;t just leave your users hanging. Remember, it is a full cycle.<\/p>\n<p>Your conversation has come to a full cycle. Now, it\u2019s time to get started with building a real conversation. While you are at it, here are some practices you must keep in mind with your chatbot conversation.<\/p>\n<h2>Best practices to implement when building a chatbot conversation<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Give your chatbot a personality.<\/strong> Conjure up a fictional character with a name, a sketch, or a cartoon or icon that resembles your brand. Give it a personality. This is exactly what will make your chatbot and your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/12\/23\/humanize-brand\">brand more\u00a0human-like<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Integrate your chatbot with other services you use.<\/strong> For instance, if you are using LiveChat to build your chatbot and have Slack for your team collaborations, you can consider <a href=\"https:\/\/automate.io\/integration\/livechat\/slack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">integrating LiveChat and Slack<\/a> to keep lead capturing, profiling, and handling in sync.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reduce the wait time when a new user pings on your live chat.\u00a0<\/strong>In other words, be quick to respond. For example,\u00a0in Netflix, you will see a notification like \u201cYour wait time is 1 minute\u201d. However, it has never escalated to one minute. The response comes in about a few seconds\u2019 time.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Train your chatbot to read subject lines carefully.<\/strong> Sometimes people end up writing the query in the subject line itself.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Handle complicated queries as several smaller ones. <\/strong>This will ensure everything gets resolved.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Test, test, and test.<\/strong> Refine your chatbot to perfection.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Follow the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/19\/paid-social-trends\">trends<\/a>.<\/strong> Be up to date with what\u2019s happening, who\u2019s doing what, and how.

The bot doesn&#8217;t have to appear to be human\u2014embrace the fact that it&#8217;s a bot\u2014but there are ways to incorporate your brand voice into the bot to help create a coherent experience for your customers and visitors.<\/li>\n<li>Integrate the chatbot with other marketing automation platforms you currently use.<\/li>\n<li>Be sure to follow additional practices such as keeping wait\/response time to a minimum, breaking complicated queries into smaller ones, aligning with trends, and (again) test, test, test.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It is about solving problems and engaging users on a personal level. Crisp and straightforward language is what you need to connect with your users. Just say what you must say\u2014but with a little love and empathy.<\/p>\n<h3>About the author<\/h3>\n<p>Pritha is the Senior Content Marketer at<a href=\"http:\/\/automate.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u00a0Automate.io<\/a>.
