And who better to take me through it than WordStream\u2019s in-house Google Ads account manager, Kristina Simonson. Throughout the episode, we went through everything from how Google determines which ad to show, how Google determines how much you\u2019re going to spend, which metrics are the most important to track, and more. If you\u2019re just venturing into the world of advertising online, this preliminary Google Ads episode is a great one to listen to. If you haven\u2019t heard that episode yet, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/goal-talk?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_creative=\">you can listen here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>This week\u2019s topic: How to identify and foster high-potential employees<\/h2>\n<p>As a manager or a business owner, you likely have a team of individuals reporting to you. Sometimes, you\u2019re able to identify those who are highly engaged, high producing, and express the drive to do more than what their job currently entails. Those individuals can be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pmg.com\/blog\/strategies-for-managing-high-potential-employees\/\">classified as high-potential<\/a>, and require a specific type of guidance for the relationship to work for both them and your business. So how do you identify and empower your employees that may be high potential?<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/goal-talk?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_creative=\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1e5f904b-ab10-409e-938a-088247b82077\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Goal-Talk-Ep08-800SQ2028129.png\" alt=\"Goal Talk Podcast Episode 8 artwork.\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>In this next management focused episode of the Goal Talk podcast, we dive more deeply into the specifics around being an effective manager for your employees, and how you can realistically approach fostering a high potential employee to be as successful as possible.<\/p>\n<p>In this week\u2019s episode, I sit down with Lucy Lemons, WordStream\u2019s VP of People Success to discuss:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What it means to be a high potential employee.<\/li>\n<li>How to identify a high-potential employee on your team.<\/li>\n<li>Tips for employees to \u201cmanage up\u201d if they\u2019re not feeling supported.<\/li>\n<li>How managers can find a balance between challenging and supporting employees.<\/li>\n<li>How WordStream approaches high potential employees.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Throughout the episode, Lucy and I talk through all of the above topics as well as give specific examples and tools to use to be an effective manager when working with high potential individuals.<\/p>\n<p>You can find this week\u2019s episode on <a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/goal-talk-podcast\/id1497955409\">Apple Podcasts<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/7BnP53IsIOkydFl1qPKD7E\">Spotify<\/a>, as well as your favorite podcast app. Also, don\u2019t forget to watch new episodes on our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCrvBaHMLtSQ55IWAZiRQuQQ\">YouTube channel<\/a>, and follow the podcast\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/goaltalkpodcast\">Twitter<\/a> account for episode releases, ask the hosts questions and join in on the conversation.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"videos\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_video\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"247e1cc0-f637-4bba-bf2b-2ce7917b3018\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/mV2ZXOPqDDw?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>About the podcast<\/h2>\n<p>The Goal Talk podcast is all about giving small business owners and marketers the information they need to succeed.
