Campaign objectives<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/facebook-ad-objectives\">Facebook campaign objectives<\/a> are a prominent factor in pricing since they relate to the value of the desired goal and where in the funnel your users are.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Awareness or Engagement campaigns will cost less than lower-funnel campaigns like Sales that drive purchases. It\u2019s easier to get someone to engage with an ad than it is to entice them to click through, open up their wallet, and complete a purchase.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Audience size<\/h3>\n<p>Facebook ads targeting larger and broader audiences will generally cost less than for smaller audiences.<\/p>\n<p>You will typically see lower costs in prospecting, upper-funnel, cold-audience campaigns compared to retargeting, lower-funnel, warmer-audience campaigns, because the audiences of the latter tend to be more specific, smaller in size, and therefore more <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/27\/how-to-compete-in-facebook-ads\">competitive<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/facebook-ads-trends-audience-size-indicator.jpg\" alt=\"how much does facebook cost - audience size indicator\" width=\"520\" height=\"349\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-79160 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/facebook-ads-trends-audience-size-indicator.jpg 520w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/facebook-ads-trends-audience-size-indicator-480x322.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 520px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>3. Daily budget<\/h3>\n<p>If your daily budget is on the lower end, it may take longer for Facebook&#8217;s algorithm to exit the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/facebook-learning-phase\">learning phase<\/a>. For this reason, costs for new ad sets are often higher upfront while the system understands how your audience behaves with your ads and how to optimize them for the highest engagement. If your ads are well-engaged with, Facebook and Instagram will reward you with lower costs over time.<\/p>\n<h3><span>4. Bidding strategy<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>Similarly, the way you instruct Facebook to spend your ad budget affects how much your ads cost. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/31\/facebook-ads-bidding-strategies\">Facebook bidding strategies<\/a> include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><\/span><span>Highest volume (formerly lowest cost)<\/span><span><\/span><\/li>\n<li>Highest value<\/li>\n<li>Cost per result (formerly cost cap)<\/li>\n<li>ROAS goal (formerly minimum ROAS)<\/li>\n<li>Bid cap<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>5. Click-through rate<\/h3>\n<p>Click-through rate (CTR) can also play a role in your Facebook ad costs. If CTR is low, especially in a website traffic campaign, you may then see higher costs as Facebook understands that there may be some disconnect between your target audience and the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/29\/best-facebook-ads\">messaging in your ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>A healthy Facebook CTR is about 1-3%. More often than not, the higher your CTR climbs, the lower your CPCs will be.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Industry<\/h3>\n<p>As you saw in our benchmarks above, Facebook costs vary by industry, which also includes varying click-through rates. Your market and industry will play a big role in what to expect in terms of your Meta Ads costs. For instance, the chart below indicates pretty big differences between CTRs across various industries, which could indicate how more or less competitive your vertical may be.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/2025-fb-benchmarks-leads-ctr-846x1024.webp\" alt=\"2025 fb benchmarks - 2025 leads click-through rate\" width=\"846\" height=\"1024\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93930 size-large\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>7. Seasonality<\/h3>\n<p>Historically speaking, in the latter part of Q3 and Q4, costs tend to temporarily increase as the advertising landscape changes for the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/08\/holiday-marketing-tips\">holiday ecommerce season<\/a>. Competition ramps up as brands increase their budgets and gain more impression share, thus increasing costs for all advertising brands.<\/p>\n<p>Keep seasonality in mind as you budget for the year. If you aren\u2019t in ecommerce or running promotions during the end of the year, you may want to strategize on whether to keep a presence or to scale back.<\/p>\n<div id=\"lower\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to lower Facebook ad costs<\/h2>\n<p>There are a number of ways to lower your Facebook ad costs, but here are some of our favorite strategies.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Create a full-funnel strategy<\/h3>\n<p>To use your budget wisely and set yourself up to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/08\/how-to-scale-facebook-ads\">scale your Facebook ads<\/a>, choose funnel-appropriate campaign objectives. In general, Awareness and Consideration campaigns are suited for the top of the funnel; Consideration and Conversion campaigns align with the middle of the funnel, and Conversion campaigns are best for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/01\/bottom-funnel-conversions\">bottom-funnel conversions<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In short, begin with upper-funnel campaigns to reach more people in your target audience at a lower cost, and then move your way toward conversion campaigns that optimize for your purchase-driving conversion events.<\/p>\n<p>You can learn how to create a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/21\/facebook-funnel\">full-funnel Facebook advertising strategy here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Note that some brands can certainly run a Sales campaign targeting upper-funnel audiences with lower-priced products or something that may make for a good impulse buy.<\/p>\n<p>People can and do <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/13\/facebook-ecommerce-tips\">make purchases<\/a> upon first interaction with a brand on Facebook, however, most will need more touch points from a brand so you can gain their trust, showcase your benefits, and entice them to convert.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 <strong>Want more Facebook ads tips like these?<\/strong> Download our free guide to the top <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLFBFundamentals.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FacebookFundamentals_Download\">seven fundamental Facebook advertising tips<\/a>\u00a0every advertiser should know.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Broaden your audience<\/h3>\n<p>As mentioned above, audience size impacts how much Facebook ads cost. So while you want to keep your targeting narrow, you should strive to make those targeted audiences as large as possible. This has become trickier as a result of privacy measures, but we&#8217;ve got some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/11\/facebook-advertising-strategies\">recommended Facebook ad strategies<\/a> to help you out with that.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Check audience overlap<\/h3>\n<p>Facebook&#8217;s audience overlap tool can be instrumental in saving money. Let\u2019s say you have one ad targeting an audience of people interested in startups and another ad for people interested in entrepreneurship. You have different<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/07\/facebook-ad-copy-examples\"> Facebook ad copy<\/a> and creative to appeal to these different audiences. However, the overlap tool shows you that half of the startup audience overlaps with the entrepreneurship audience. Knowing this, you can use exclusions so those ads don\u2019t overlap. Otherwise, you\u2019d lose money bidding against yourself.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ad-costs-audience-overlap-tool.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"403\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18248\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ad-costs-audience-overlap-tool.png 800w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ad-costs-audience-overlap-tool-480x242.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>4. Use bid caps<\/h3>\n<p>This is the manual bidding <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/facebook-ad-tactics\">strategy in Facebook ads<\/a>, where you can set a maximum bid instead of allowing Facebook to dynamically bid based on your goals. But this should be used with caution. It\u2019s for advertisers who have a solid understanding of the conversion rate and profit margin and require regular maintenance. If you set your bid cap too low, Facebook might have a hard time spending all of your budget.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Use the Pixel AND the Facebook Conversions API<\/h3>\n<p>The goal of both of these pieces of technology is for you to track your ad performance. With visibility into what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not, you can allocate budget accordingly. You can also gain insights about the people viewing your ads, which you can use to further optimize your campaigns and maximize your budget.<\/p>\n<p>The Facebook Pixel is still a thing, but it is losing its power since it\u2019s cookie-based and cookies are crumbling. The Facebook Conversions API does not rely on cookies, but it doesn\u2019t pick up the same exact information as the pixel. So, using the two together will ensure you capture the most accurate data. You can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/06\/facebook-conversions-api\">learn how to use the Facebook Conversions API here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For more Facebook ads conversion tracking help, check out this list of reasons <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/23\/facebook-ads-not-converting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">why your Facebook ads may not be converting<\/a> properly and how you can fix them!<\/p>\n<h3>6. Run Facebook A\/B testing<\/h3>\n<p>You can also help lower your costs at the ad level by <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/11\/facebook-ab-testing\">A\/B testing<\/a> variables in your ads\u2014one at a time\u2014to better understand what is and is not working well. Test out the text, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/28\/facebook-ad-headlines\">headline<\/a>, images and\/or videos, landing pages, and more.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook is not the set-it-and-forget type of platform, so it is best to continuously test and aim for better results.
