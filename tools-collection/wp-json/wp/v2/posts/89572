Instead, let\u2019s focus on what all this means in an audit:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Account level goals: <\/strong>What is being prioritized across the account? What actions are the main focus? What are we trying to accomplish with this account default setup?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Primary versus secondary conversion actions: <\/strong>Which actions are set to primary and used as conversions as well as included in bidding? Which actions are set as secondary and are only used for layered insights? Are these set up the way they should be based on what you know about the account and their goals?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Status:<\/strong> Are any of the conversion actions, specifically primary actions, broken or have no recent conversions? Can we conclude that tracking is set up and working properly or is there something that needs to be fixed?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Campaign level goals<\/h4>\n<p>No matter what I find in the conversion goals section, I also do a spot check to see if any campaigns are using campaign-specific goals, meaning they don\u2019t follow the account default goals and instead rely on a custom setup for that campaign.<\/p>\n<p>To check this, head into the <strong>campaign settings<\/strong> and under the <strong>conversion goals s<\/strong>ection, see if it says account default or campaign specific. Depending on what you find there, you may need to go back to the conversion goals manager and make sure all conversions are tracking properly<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-conversion-goals.webp\" alt=\"google ads audit - conversion goal settings\" width=\"754\" height=\"342\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89588 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-conversion-goals.webp 754w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-conversion-goals-480x218.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 754px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Bidding strategies<\/h4>\n<p>Now that we understand what the goals are for the account and\/or campaigns, how do the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-smart-bidding\">bidding strategies<\/a> match up with those priorities?<\/p>\n<p>There are quite a few different bidding strategies within Google Ads and each has its own use case. The challenge of auditing an account is to determine if the bidding strategies being used are helping or hurting the campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>This would be far too long of a post if I went into detail on every bid strategy. I\u2019ve actually already outlined what I think are their pros and cons <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/19\/google-ads-automated-bidding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>. Here\u2019s what you should be thinking about when evaluating a bidding strategy in Google Ads:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Realistic expectations:<\/strong> The first thing I do when I look at bid strategies is to see if people have realistic ideas of what they can achieve. While we all might want to have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/23\/optimize-performance-max-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">900% ROAS on our PMax campaigns<\/a>, that\u2019s simply not always possible. Each account is different, but I try to get a realistic idea of what is possible for performance based on what\u2019s happened in the account in the past and make some assumptions. Oftentimes, people will come to us with an audit request and tell us they\u2019re not getting volume for their campaigns, only to find out they have unrealistically low target CPAs set. When Google can\u2019t find success at the levels you provide, it will throttle ad service and cut back impressions until invariably it stops serving altogether. Realistic expectations not only are good for actual expectation setting about your potential performance, but they also help you get the most from the smart bidding algorithms.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Conversion goal match:<\/strong> Does the bidding strategy line up with the stated goals? For example, if your main focus for a campaign is ROAS but you\u2019re using target impression share bidding, you may want to evaluate that choice. That doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t work, but if performance wanes, that bid strategy isn\u2019t designed to bring you back on track to where you want to be.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Conversion volume:<\/strong> Unfortunately, those with more volume will always have an easier time using the machine learning associated with automated bidding. There\u2019s simply more for the platform to learn and infer. If your conversion goal isn\u2019t getting at least 30 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-conversion-values\">conversions<\/a> in 30 days, you may want to reevaluate and come up with a hybrid conversion strategy, shift to an action a little further up the funnel, or maybe even test a manual approach.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Budget settings<\/h4>\n<p>Lastly, I check out the budget settings. With Google Ads, you can set either a daily or lifetime budget at the campaign level, or you could group campaigns together using a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Rv4_j3HJ1F0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shared budget<\/a> across all campaigns. Depending on what the account goals are, one option might be better suited than another. Here\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for when analyzing budgets:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is there enough budget to support the number of campaigns that are active in the account? Should campaigns be consolidated or leverage a shared budget?<\/li>\n<li>Is there enough budget being allocated to the individual campaigns to hit the stated goals?<\/li>\n<li>Are the budget distributions across campaigns in line with performance? I.e. Do the campaigns with better performance have more budget while the underperformers have less?<\/li>\n<li>Are there campaigns that are budget-capped that need an increase to perform better?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"target-audience-reach\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Check how you&#8217;re reaching your target audience with PMax, display, and video campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>Once I\u2019m finished with the conversion goals, budgets, and bidding, I move into the targeting of the campaigns. Who is the account targeting and how are they reaching them? For these types of campaigns, there are all sorts of<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/21\/google-ads-audience-targeting-cheat-sheet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> targeting options<\/a> we can use. Let\u2019s take a look at a few of them.<\/p>\n<h4>Individual targeting options<\/h4>\n<p>The most basic form of targeting for display and video campaigns will be using audiences or content targets. These can be either the preset audience targets like in-market or affinity audiences from Google or the advertiser\u2019s own lists like website visitors or customer uploads. With content targets, we\u2019re focusing on the placement of the ad itself rather than the person. Think of groups of websites based on the topics they cover or the content on the page itself.<\/p>\n<p>These can be found by navigating to the <strong>audiences<\/strong>,<strong> keywords<\/strong>, and<strong> content<\/strong> section in the interface, then selecting either <strong>audiences<\/strong> or <strong>content<\/strong> and reviewing the data found there.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-audience-audit.webp\" alt=\"google ads audience audit - screenshot of google ads menu\" width=\"334\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89598 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-audience-audit.webp 334w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-audience-audit-167x300.webp 167w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 334px) 100vw, 334px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As I mentioned, there are lots of different targeting types for these campaigns and there are subtypes as well. Within Audiences alone, there are six different types to choose from:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Detailed demographics<\/li>\n<li>Affinity<\/li>\n<li>In-market and life events<\/li>\n<li>Your data segments<\/li>\n<li>Combined segments<\/li>\n<li>Custom segments<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>For content targets, there are only three to choose from as you can see below.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-audit-keywords.webp\" alt=\"google ads audit - content targeting options example\" width=\"853\" height=\"403\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89585 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-audit-keywords.webp 853w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-audit-keywords-480x227.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 853px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But potentially more importantly, at the top of that image, you can see in the settings for targeting versus observation. Effectively, this tells Google whether you want to exclusively target only people in those audiences or look at that content, or if you want to simply have a new line of data broken out for them so you can observe how they perform compared to the other targeted users. Hence the name observation.<\/p>\n<p>This may come as no surprise, but there\u2019s no right or wrong group of users to target. What I\u2019m more focused on is the way they\u2019re going about it and if it\u2019s going to be effective.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the things I\u2019m looking for when evaluating individual targeting settings for audiences and content:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do the groups of users they\u2019ve created make sense? Are there logical breaks in the patterns or are they throwing everything at the wall in the same ad group and hoping something works?<\/li>\n<li>Are they using targeting options that are too broad for the audience they\u2019re trying to reach? Are they missing more specific targets that could yield better results?<\/li>\n<li>On the flip side, are they being so controlling with targeting that the audience is prohibitively small? Is there potential to expand in a targeted way and still see results?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Optimized targeting<\/h4>\n<p>As a quick expansion option for individual targeting, Google prompts advertisers to opt into <strong>optimized targeting<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>As you can see below, this setting is recommended by Google and they claim that accounts that use this see an average improvement of 50% in conversions with a comparable ROI. That\u2019s\u2026a pretty big claim. It\u2019s likely true, but I\u2019m weary of it since it\u2019s never worked in one of my accounts.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-audit-optimize-targeting.webp\" alt=\"google ads campaign audit - optimized targeting screenshot\" width=\"770\" height=\"329\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89584 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-audit-optimize-targeting.webp 770w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-audit-optimize-targeting-480x205.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 770px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>That said, I do check the performance of the expanded targeting if it\u2019s being used by viewing the audience performance table on the<strong> audiences<\/strong> tab. You can select the metrics to view and on the far right, you\u2019ll see the expansion and optimized targeting group compared to your other targets.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-audience-performance-audit.webp\" alt=\"google ads campaign audit - audiences tab report\" width=\"901\" height=\"343\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89583 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-audience-performance-audit.webp 901w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-audience-performance-audit-480x183.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 901px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Depending on what I find here, I might suggest turning optimized targeting off, but that\u2019s not always the case. In some rare instances, I\u2019ll see a very strong performing display campaign and look for ways to expand. If no new audiences or contextual targets are apparent to me, I\u2019ll suggest turning on optimized targeting for a period of time to see how it does, but that\u2019s only after I\u2019ve looked for other opportunities and it never goes unchecked.<\/p>\n<h4>Audience signals<\/h4>\n<p>The last type of targeting for this post will be the newer models Google has us use for Performance Max and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/22\/demand-gen-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Demand Gen campaigns<\/a>: audience signals.<\/p>\n<p>For audience signals, combine lots of different targeting options into one group that can be applied at a high level. This includes search themes and audience targeting, including remarketing lists, interest, and demographic targeting.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-audience-signals-1.webp\" alt=\"google ads audit - audience signals screenshot\" width=\"900\" height=\"748\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89592 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-audience-signals-1.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-audience-signals-1-480x399.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The approach for auditing these is the same. We want to make sure that all of the audience signals being used make sense and are applicable to the targeting, but these are a little less strict than the individual targeting above.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s because, as you can see below, Google says these audiences will be used as a starting point for their targeting. What they don\u2019t say is that once they have started with your lists, they\u2019ll reach beyond them to try and find new users that may hit your performance goals. This means you\u2019re not limited to only the audience signal you provide, which is why we\u2019re a little less strict when reviewing these. The campaigns will inevitably reach beyond your lists, so as long as your starting points are logical and on target, they\u2019re likely fine.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-performance-max-signals.webp\" alt=\"google ads performance max audit - audiences for pmax\" width=\"874\" height=\"252\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89575 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-performance-max-signals.webp 874w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-performance-max-signals-480x138.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 874px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here are some common red flags we see with audience signals that we try and correct:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Search themes that are very broad and have no themes to them.<\/strong> This could mean that they\u2019ve taken all non-brand terms and added them or they\u2019re using only head terms. Either way, search themes are meant to help you focus your Demand Gen or PMax campaigns on the right terms. Remember, PMax can serve on the search network too, so these can be really important.<\/li>\n<li><strong>All audience signals are in the same asset group.<\/strong> Even though you can add remarketing, interests, and demographic information into the same asset group doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you should. For that matter, it likely doesn&#8217;t make sense to even treat all remarketing audiences the same. If you have large enough lists of converters versus just website visitors, those should probably be in their own asset groups so you can better leverage Google\u2019s machine learning to find new audience patterns and capitalize on performance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udcb8\u00a0Make the most of your Google Ads campaign audits<\/strong> with our free guide to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/ways-to-save-money-in-google-ads?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_SaveMoneyinGoogleAds_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">6 easy ways to save money in Google Ads now!<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"targeting-exclusions\"><\/div>\n<h3>3.

This could be based on simply shaping the audience better (i.e. excluding customers from prospecting lists) or based on performance.<\/p>\n<p>To find the performance of these placements, you need to visit the<strong> insights and reports<\/strong> section and choose the <strong>when and where ads showed<\/strong> report.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-audit-campaigns.webp\" alt=\"google ads audit - where ads showed\" width=\"457\" height=\"586\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89577 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-audit-campaigns.webp 457w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-audit-campaigns-234x300.webp 234w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Performance Max Exclusions<\/h4>\n<p>For <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/05\/performance-max-tips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PMax campaigns<\/a>, our reviews have to be a bit different. Performance Max doesn\u2019t follow the same rules as the other targeting types. They don\u2019t allow for audience exclusions and have campaign or asset group level exclusions for content. But at the same time, there are also Brand Exclusion Lists and Account Level Negative Keywords that can apply to PMax.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on the account goals and how Performance Max is being used, we\u2019ll review if Brand Exclusion Lists are applied to the campaigns and if any Account Level Negative Keywords are in place to help curb PMax impressions.<\/p>\n<div id=\"clean-assets-creatives\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Clean up your assets and creatives<\/h3>\n<p>Once we have a good handle on the targeting, we want to understand what creatives are being used to target these folks. Given these campaign types show on networks other than Search (but remember, PMax can show on Search), there are going to be visual components that need to be reviewed.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are far too many ad formats that can be used across these campaign types for me to go too far in depth on any of these best practices, but here are some quick hits that we always review to understand what\u2019s going on and where there are gaps in coverage.<\/p>\n<h4>Ad formats<\/h4>\n<p>What ad formats are being used in the campaigns and are they leveraging all of the options they have?<\/p>\n<p><strong>For display campaigns<\/strong>, you\u2019re allowed <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/banner-ad-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">banner ads<\/a>, responsive display ads, and HTML5 ads.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>HTML5<\/strong> ads are a bit more rare, so we\u2019re happy when we see these, but they\u2019re not a necessity.<\/li>\n<li><strong>We like to have all ad groups with at least one Responsive Display Ad (RDA).<\/strong> Google gets to use its automation here, so these usually get more impressions than banner ads do.\n<ul>\n<li>Do the RDAs take advantage of all text fields?<\/li>\n<li>How many images are being tested? Are there any videos added to the mix? We like to see at least 3 different images and prefer to have a video or two in place if there are assets available for use.<\/li>\n<li>Do the images follow <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/23\/responsive-display-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Responsive Display Ad image best practices<\/a>?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Banner ads are a good addition to display campaigns, but similar to HTML5, they take more time to develop and are used less often than RDAs.\n<ul>\n<li>How many banner sizes are in use? Do they have enough to cover the highest volume of placements around the GDN?<\/li>\n<li>Are there both mobile and desktop sizes being used?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-display-and-video-audit-image-size-chart.webp\" alt=\"google display ads audit - image file sizing\" width=\"776\" height=\"585\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89576 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-display-and-video-audit-image-size-chart.webp 776w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-display-and-video-audit-image-size-chart-480x362.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 776px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>With <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/optimize-youtube-ad-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube campaigns<\/a><\/strong>, there are tons of different formats that all go with different placements and campaign objectives.

Identify performance trends<\/h3>\n<p>Once we have a handle on how the campaigns are set up and what their goals are, we now need to know if they\u2019re performing well.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How are these campaigns performing now?<\/li>\n<li>How are they performing compared to account goals?<\/li>\n<li>How are they performing compared to each other?<\/li>\n<li>How have they been trending over time? Are things getting better or worse?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Based on the answers to those questions and what you now know about the setup of the account, how would you suggest things are changed to increase performance? Do they have the proper goal tracking setup or are they missing some actions that should be counted as conversions but aren\u2019t? Does the budget breakdown support the goals they\u2019re trying to hit based on the campaign performance or are they leaving money on the table?<\/p>\n<p>But on the flip side, what are they doing right? What do you see in the account that\u2019s done really well that you want them to continue? Many times, folks have audits done on their accounts and they see only the negatives, and while it\u2019s usually our job to point out things we think could be better, it\u2019s also important to point out what\u2019s right. You don\u2019t want the account manager to take your findings, and implement them, but abandon the positive things they were doing before to now only see poor performance for a different reason. Remember, it\u2019s our job as auditors to help make the account perform better, so make sure you\u2019re telling a well-rounded picture, if possible, of your final deliverable.<\/p>\n<h2>Audit any Google Ads campaign type like a pro<\/h2>\n<p>Auditing display, video, Demand Gen, and Performance Max campaigns in Google Ads (and now <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-max-for-search\">AI Max for Search<\/a>) is certainly different from auditing search campaigns, but many of the best practices still apply. Start by understanding how the account is set up and see if there are any gaps, then go see the performance trends and suggest improvements based on how you know the account is set up. Call out the good, the bad, and the ugly, and always remember we\u2019re trying to make the account perform better, whether you\u2019re the one who eventually makes the changes or not.<\/p>\n<p>For more help auditing, tracking, and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-localiq-uses-ai-to-optimize-campaigns\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">optimizing your Google Ads<\/a> campaigns, see how <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/marketing-services?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Demo_Blog_Demo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our solutions<\/a> can help you take your strategy to the next level.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Make sure your Google Ads Performance Max, display, and video ads are in tip-top shape with this five-step auditing process.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":114,"featured_media":89596,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[101],"tags":[],"dipi_cpt_category":[],"class_list":["post-89572","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-google-ads"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v25.8 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>5 Ways to Optimize Google Ads PMax, Video, &amp;
