Staying on top of the latest and greatest Google and Facebook advertising news can be a daunting task. Plus, weeding through for the platform updates that matter most to your business can take time. All these bits of news can start to add up quickly and probably leave you feeling like this:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-facebook-ads-announcements-ecard-meme.jpg\" alt=\"google ads and facebook ads announcements - to-do list meme\" width=\"501\" height=\"360\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76152 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-facebook-ads-announcements-ecard-meme.jpg 501w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-facebook-ads-announcements-ecard-meme-480x345.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 501px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>So, if you feel a little underwater this year, I\u2019m here to help.

Launch of Google Ads Transparency Center<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>One of Google\u2019s first announcements this year was the<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/technology\/ads\/announcing-the-launch-of-the-new-ads-transparency-center\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> launch of the Transparency Center<\/a>, which was designed to help users quickly and easily understand more about the ads they see around the Google ecosystem. Privacy and transparency have been a big change over the last half a decade. Similar to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/14\/tiktok-ads-library\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TikTok Ads library<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/06\/facebook-ad-library\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook Ads library<\/a>, this tool gives users the ability to see more ads from the same advertiser\/brand as well as who the ad was published by. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Aside from being a good resource for consumers, this can be a great option for advertisers to check out all the ads their competition is running. Or to get ideas for new creatives from major brands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-announcements-ads-transparency-center.png\" alt=\"google ads announcements - google ads transparency center home page\" width=\"842\" height=\"390\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76155 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-announcements-ads-transparency-center.png 842w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-announcements-ads-transparency-center-480x222.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 842px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udcca Want more insight on competition in your industry outside of the Ads Transparency Center?

Google Ads deprecating most attribution models<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>In 2020 and 2021, Google made a very large push to get advertisers to adopt <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/30\/data-driven-attribution-default-update\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">data-driven attribution<\/a>. It was one of the key components my Google reps were pushing. Hard. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/15\/multi-touch-attribution\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">All other attribution models<\/a> were described as less than optimal. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Now, a short time later, Google has<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/13427716\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> announced they\u2019re retiring all models<\/a> except last click and data-driven. They\u2019re reasoning is that very few advertisers are using the other models anyway. Makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>In short, as of September 2023, if you have any conversion actions that are still using first click, linear, position-based, or time decay attribution, they will automatically be migrated into the Data-Driven model.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-updates-attribution-models.jpg\" alt=\"google ads updates - attribution models\" width=\"720\" height=\"520\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76154 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-updates-attribution-models.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-updates-attribution-models-480x347.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span>3. Brand restrictions for Search and Performance Max\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>Brand advertising is an important component to many companies. If nothing else, every company wants to make sure their ads are showing for their business specifically, and not someone else\u2019s who has a similar name. To help with these brand controls, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/18\/google-ads-restrictions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google announced brand restrictions for Search<\/a> and<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/13729701\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> brand lists for Performance Max<\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>For Performance Max, this tool is designed to help you avoid bidding on brand terms if you choose, so you can focus this campaign on expanding your reach to new customers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>For Search, brand lists help ads stay focused on a specific brand rather than query options that are similar or related. If you\u2019re doing either Search advertising on your brand keywords or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/01\/is-performance-max-right-for-you\">Performance Max<\/a>, I highly recommend you check these new features out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-restrictions-brand-and-sub-brands.jpg\" alt=\"google ads restrictions - brands and sub brands\" width=\"900\" height=\"255\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76063 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-restrictions-brand-and-sub-brands.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-restrictions-brand-and-sub-brands-480x136.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span>4. Automatically created assets<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>Google continues to roll out more and more automation options for advertisers. In <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/13352636\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this Google Ads announcement<\/a>, it seems as if they\u2019ve channeled their ad writing for Dynamic Search Ads and the Recommendations tab, but created a new feature that allows Google to create headlines and descriptions for your existing<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/05\/responsive-search-ad-copy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Responsive Search Ads<\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Luckily, this setting is opt-in (rather than opt-out) and allows you to turn it on at the campaign level. If you see good text suggestions from Google in other portions of your account, maybe give these a whirl and see how they pan out. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span>5. Bid for new customers only<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>In an effort to help advertisers focus on driving new business, <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/13352636\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google released<\/a> a new campaign acquisition goal. This feature is driven by smart bidding strategies and your own customer data to help find new users either by avoiding known users or by simply bidding more aggressively for new customers, thereby winning more auctions and having a larger share of voice. If your goal is to focus on new business, this is definitely a tool to check out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udcb8 Is your current bidding strategy potentially wasting your Google Ads spend?

Discovery campaigns are rolling into Demand Gen<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>It\u2019s not very often that we see a campaign type go away completely in Google Ads, but that\u2019s exactly <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/13859703\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">what\u2019s happening to Discovery campaigns<\/a>. Although it\u2019s still early and I don\u2019t personally have any clients in Demand Gen just yet, it does appear these ads will be far more powerful than Discovery. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>There are added creative formats as well as expanded reach with new audiences beyond the existing options within Discovery campaigns. In August and September of 2023, advertisers can request into the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/22\/demand-gen-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">beta for Demand Gen campaigns<\/a>, and in October all existing Discovery Ads campaigns will start to be automatically migrated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-versus-discovery-ads-chart.jpg\" alt=\"google demand gen campaigns - comparison with discovery ads chart\" width=\"900\" height=\"498\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75546 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-versus-discovery-ads-chart.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-versus-discovery-ads-chart-480x266.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/13859703?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3><span>7. Performance Max updates<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/ads-commerce\/performance-max-new-features\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads continues to show<\/a> a high investment level in its new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/23\/optimize-performance-max-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Performance Max (PMax) campaigns<\/a>. The good news for advertisers is that nearly all of the updates to PMax recently have expanded advertiser control. In the latest slew of updates, Google gave options for better video creation, the ability to run experiments to test PMax viability, page feeds, and more. If you have been running Performance Max, or if you held off due to lack of control, it might be time to check out some of these updates and take advantage of your newfound power.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>8. Developments on ad prices from Google&#8217;s antitrust trial<\/h3>\n<p><span>In order to meet its ad revenue targets, Google reluctantly announced that they &#8220;frequently&#8221; increased the cost of some search ad queries without necessarily alerting advertisers. In fact, ad costs were raised by as much as 5% and up to 10% for the average advertiser. This announcement came out during the Google trial, where the tech giant is under fire for allegedly using unfair tactics to monopolize the search engine market. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/15\/google-ads-benchmarks\">WordStream\u2019s Google Ads benchmarks<\/a> have shown that cost per click increased almost universally year over year, and many account managers have also seen a marked increase in costs&#8211;leading many to wonder if this is the real cause. <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/google-quietly-increases-ad-prices-targets-432155\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more from Search Engine Land<\/a><\/span><span>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>While that can be discouraging to hear, use this as inspiration to beat Google at its own game when you&#8217;re considering your Google Ads optimization strategy. Instead of jumping to add budget to campaigns, try to consider other ways to keep your ads competitive despite rising costs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>For example,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/03\/how-to-write-exceptional-ppc-ad-copy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> focusing on ad copy <\/a>testing to increase relevancy to searchers and drive better engagement and conversion performance. With these changes, you should see improvements in your ad scores as well as resulting revenue for your business.\u00a0<span>Although Google ultimately wants to drive revenue, it&#8217;s more important than ever for the platform to also provide quality results to searchers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><span>The biggest Facebook (Meta) news, announcements, and updates this year<\/span><\/h1>\n<p>Here are the top seven Meta advertising updates every business should be aware of going into the last part of 2023 and into 2024.<\/p>\n<h3><span>1. Meta Certified Company Program<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>Many organizations attempt to show their expertise through different routes:<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/03\/how-to-write-a-case-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> case studies<\/a>, client testimonials, etc. Meta is now taking a page out of Google\u2019s book (from years back) and has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/news\/meta-certified-company-program-launches-globally\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">launched the Certified Company Program<\/a>, where organizations can prove their knowledge of the Meta platform and be recognized for it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>These certifications are gained by meeting a threshold of individuals passing the Meta Blueprint courses. If you\u2019re looking to show off your expertise or even evaluate the expertise of your individual team members, this could be a great option for you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/meta-ads-announcement-certified-company.jpg\" alt=\"meta advertising announcement - certified company category list \" width=\"805\" height=\"449\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76158 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/meta-ads-announcement-certified-company.jpg 805w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/meta-ads-announcement-certified-company-480x268.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 805px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span>2.

Instead,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/news\/unlock-businesss-potential-with-the-new-performance-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> this post<\/a> outlines five strategies that Facebook would like for advertisers to adopt. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>They call these their \u201cactionable best practices\u201d and although they\u2019re specifically mentioned in relation to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/29\/holiday-marketing-trends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> growth during the holiday season<\/a>, I find it informative to know what the platform would prefer you do, as their guidance and offerings will likely funnel you into those types of strategies in the coming months and years.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\ud83c\udfb6 Is your account performance hitting all the high notes?

Lead generation form updates<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/local-marketing-lab\/facebook-ads\/facebook-lead-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lead generation forms<\/a> have been a staple in many accounts for quite a while now, and while they have been a very powerful tool, they got even better early in 2023. Lead Gen Forms <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=agI288i_nM4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">now offer conditional logic<\/a> in questions, meaning the questions change based on the answers someone provided to a previous question. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>This is an awesome solution for companies trying to improve lead quality and avoid sending lower-quality leads to their sales teams, causing lost time and frustration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/meta-ads-conditional-logic-lead-forms.jpg\" alt=\"meta advertising announcements - conditional logic lead form example\" width=\"796\" height=\"564\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76161 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/meta-ads-conditional-logic-lead-forms.jpg 796w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/meta-ads-conditional-logic-lead-forms-480x340.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 796px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.socialmediaexaminer.com\/how-to-capture-more-qualified-leads-with-facebook-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3><span>4. Updates and expansions for Reels<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>There are a couple of updates Facebook has made for Reels this year. First, advertisers can now reach their target audience on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/news\/helping-business-make-the-right-connections-for-growth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram via Reels<\/a>. Just another touch point throughout the Meta ecosystem. Second, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/news\/helping-business-make-the-right-connections-for-growth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AR ads are now available via Reels<\/a> as well, giving additional formats for connecting with users. Both of these continue to show Meta\u2019s investment in<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/22\/instagram-reels-ideas-for-businesses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Reels<\/a> and should be an indicator to advertisers that this is an important placement. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span>5. Introducing the AI Sandbox<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>Creatives on Facebook can be a huge factor in how your campaigns perform. It\u2019s important to make sure you have ads that are appealing to customers to get their attention. With the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/news\/introducing-ai-sandbox-and-expanding-meta-advantage-suite\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">launch of Facebook\u2019s AI Sandbox<\/a>, you can use Meta\u2019s AI to help create ads just based on text inputs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>While this might not be an immediate game changer for every account, it\u2019s important to see where Facebook is moving when it comes to ad creation (and augmentation) because it will likely only be a bigger portion of the platform moving forward.\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span>6. Tailored Campaigns are rolling out<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/facebook-ads-brand-suitability-controls\">Facebook ad platform<\/a> is very complex and gives lots of control to advertisers, but not all advertisers know how to take advantage of them. To help simplify things for those users, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/ads\/automation\/tailored-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook Ads is rolling out Tailored Campaigns,<\/a> which new campaigns into the most common settings for bidding strategies, placements, and a few other settings, but still gives control around audiences and creatives. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Overall, these are honestly some of the better partially automated campaign solutions we\u2019ve seen across the self-serve ad platforms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/meta-ads-update-tailored-campaigns.jpg\" alt=\"meta ads update - tailored campaigns home page\" width=\"870\" height=\"395\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76164 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/meta-ads-update-tailored-campaigns.jpg 870w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/meta-ads-update-tailored-campaigns-480x218.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 870px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/ads\/automation\/tailored-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3><span>7. Brand suitability and content controls<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>If you\u2019re familiar with Facebook or Instagram at all from a user perspective, you\u2019re probably aware that there can be some pretty sketchy content out there. While that might be fine for you as a person to glance right over, from a brand perspective, it could be damaging to show up next to some of that unsavory content. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>In 2023,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/news\/brand-safety-suitability-feed-control-verification\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Meta announced<\/a> content suitability controls to help better control what types of content brands can show ads next to.
