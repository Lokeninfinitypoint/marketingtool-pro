This is just a starting point for your own experimentation. There is no universal best time to post on YouTube. It depends on your business, your goals, and your audience\u2019s viewing habits.<\/p>\n<p>So how do you determine the sweet spot in your publication schedule to post on YouTube?<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we\u2019ll show you how to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use existing research to make an educated guess<\/li>\n<li>Consider audience demographics to refine your posting schedule<\/li>\n<li>Pull YouTube analytics that pinpoint the ideal time to post new videos to YouTube<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Let\u2019s get started.<\/p>\n<h2>Does it matter what time you post on YouTube?<\/h2>\n<p>The short answer is a qualified yes. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/youtube-seo\">YouTube algorithm<\/a> prioritizes relevance and viewer experience over all else. Success on YouTube relies more on the quality of your content and how you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/10\/youtube-seo-tips\">optimize your posts<\/a> than the specific time of day you publish.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/YouTube-times-example-accountant.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube posting times - screenshot of a YouTube search for accountantsl\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75069 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/YouTube-times-example-accountant.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/YouTube-times-example-accountant-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>That said, posting at the right time can help start a snowball effect of viewership.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how that works. Say you time your post perfectly so it appears when your specific audience is more likely perusing YouTube. Because of your timing, a few dozen extra people watch your video and some of them give it a like. That early engagement tells YouTube your video is worth sharing, and it expands your post\u2019s reach.<\/p>\n<p>So while other features of your content are much more important, the time and day you choose to post videos on YouTube can have a positive effect on its success.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83e\udde8 <strong>Want marketing ideas for every month of the year?<\/strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/marketing-calendar?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2025MarketingCalendar_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\">The Mega Must-Have Marketing Calendar<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Why is the best time to post on YouTube different?<\/h2>\n<p>There are a couple of things about YouTube that make it different from other social media channels. Those differences affect how you\u2019ll schedule your videos.<\/p>\n<p>First off, the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/1026923\/youtube-video-category-average-length\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> average length of a YouTube video<\/a> is over ten minutes, much longer than the brief snippets featured on platforms like TikTok.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/YouTube-times-Example-fashion-5.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube posting times - screenshot of a YouTube search for fashion\" width=\"936\" height=\"546\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75070 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/YouTube-times-Example-fashion-5.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/YouTube-times-Example-fashion-5-480x280.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Most people wait to watch longer videos when they have more free time. So while you might <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/09\/best-time-to-post-on-tiktok\">schedule TikToks<\/a> for mid-day when someone can pop in for a workday break, it\u2019s better to target your YouTube videos outside of regular work hours.<\/p>\n<p>Second, YouTube\u2019s algorithm works more like Google\u2019s Search than social media platforms (YouTube is owned by Google, after all). That means it takes a little time to index what you publish.<\/p>\n<p>So while <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/12\/01\/best-time-to-post-on-instagram\">Instagram posts<\/a> show on your feed instantly, your YouTube videos may not be seen by most people for an hour or more. It\u2019s smart to publish on YouTube two to three hours before your peak viewing time to make up for the delay.<\/p>\n<h2>What is the best time and day to post on YouTube according to research?<\/h2>\n<p>Remember when we said that people tend to watch YouTube videos outside of regular working hours? It turns out, there\u2019s research to back that up.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ll dig into a few studies, but for quick reference, here are the average best times to post on YouTube for each day of the week:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monday: 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.<\/li>\n<li>Tuesday: 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.<\/li>\n<li>Wednesday: 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.<\/li>\n<li>Thursday: 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.<\/li>\n<li>Friday: 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.<\/li>\n<li>Saturday: 9 a.m. to 11 a.m.<\/li>\n<li>Sunday: 9 a.m. to 11 a.m.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Copy-of-In-content-blog-images-936-\u00d7-600-px-5.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube posting times - Graph of daily best times to post on YouTube\" width=\"936\" height=\"304\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75071 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Copy-of-In-content-blog-images-936-\u00d7-600-px-5.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Copy-of-In-content-blog-images-936-\u00d7-600-px-5-300x97.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Copy-of-In-content-blog-images-936-\u00d7-600-px-5-768x249.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Copy-of-In-content-blog-images-936-\u00d7-600-px-5-480x156.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Remember!<\/strong> These posting times are designed to give the YouTube algorithm a couple of hours to index a video.

Your business-to-business content may perform best on a Tuesday afternoon.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why you\u2019ll need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">consider your audience <\/a>when setting up your YouTube posting schedule.<\/p>\n<h2>How to use audience demographics for the best time to post on YouTube<\/h2>\n<p>Not everyone thumbs through YouTube videos at the same time. To get a better shot at early engagement with the people you care about most, take some time to figure out when they\u2019re likely to be watching.<\/p>\n<h3>Time zone<\/h3>\n<p>Where in the world is your largest concentration of viewers?<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/15\/local-marketing-ideas\"> marketing a local service business<\/a> that supports a few nearby zip codes, you can post in your local time zone and hit the mark.<\/p>\n<p>But what happens if you\u2019re based in Los Angeles and your highest concentration of customers live in New York? You\u2019ll need to post for the eastern time zone or miss the window for your east coast clients.<\/p>\n<p>Look to see where your audience lives and adjust your YouTube posting schedule accordingly.<\/p>\n<h3>Age and occupation<\/h3>\n<p>On YouTube, it pays to publish when people have time to watch. That downtime can differ based on your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/generational-marketing-tactics\">audience\u2019s age<\/a> and job.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if your videos target young professionals, then the average best posting time of around 3 p.m. on weekdays is a good place to start. But if your videos help stay-at-home parents navigate life, you might try posting earlier in the day.<\/p>\n<p>Try and imagine what your ideal viewer\u2019s day is like, then post a couple of hours before their leisure time.<\/p>\n<h3>Type of content<\/h3>\n<p>The same person may watch different <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/12\/01\/b2b-content-marketing\">types of content<\/a> at different times throughout the day. So what you post will help determine when you should post it.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say your videos teach accountants how to tackle tricky tax codes. You\u2019ll probably get better engagement during normal business hours. But if you share health tips for novice runners, a CPA who also loves to run will likely wait until after work to watch.<\/p>\n<p>The important thing is to post so your videos are available when they\u2019ll be the most useful.<\/p>\n<h2>Using analytics to pinpoint your YouTube posting schedule<\/h2>\n<p>One of the best things about YouTube is that it tells you when people watch your videos. Once you start publishing regularly, you\u2019ll know exactly what time and day you should post.<\/p>\n<p>There are two places in your YouTube analytics report that can help. Which you choose depends on how much audience data you\u2019ve gathered.<\/p>\n<h3>Option #1: The \u201cWhen your viewers are on YouTube\u201d graph<\/h3>\n<p>The easiest way to find your ideal video posting time is to look at your \u201cWhen your viewers are on YouTube\u201d graph.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/YouTube-times-chart-viewers-when.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube posting times - screenshot of YouTube analytics graph for when viewers are on YouTube\" width=\"824\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75073 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/YouTube-times-chart-viewers-when.jpg 824w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/YouTube-times-chart-viewers-when-480x350.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 824px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The graph tells you when the people who currently view your videos are on YouTube. It\u2019s based on the last 28 days of data. The darker the purple, the higher concentration of viewers that browse YouTube at that time.<\/p>\n<p>To find your graph, go to YouTube Studio &gt; Analytics and scroll down.<\/p>\n<p>This graph only appears on your analytics dashboard when you have enough viewer data from the last 28 days to show. If you don\u2019t have it, no worries. Just use option #2.<\/p>\n<h3>Option #2: The \u201cRealtime\u201d graph<\/h3>\n<p>The Realtime graph tells you how many viewers you\u2019ve had per hour for any set timeframe over the last 48 hours. It\u2019s also available on your YouTube analytics dashboard.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/YouTube-times-chart-hourly-viewers.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube posting times - Realtime graph from YouTube analytics\" width=\"686\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75074 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/YouTube-times-chart-hourly-viewers.jpg 686w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/YouTube-times-chart-hourly-viewers-480x419.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 686px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This graph takes a little more work to use, but it&#8217;s always available (even if you don\u2019t have much recent data).<\/p>\n<p>What you\u2019ll do is keep a spreadsheet of the hourly data for a month. Then look for patterns among each day and time of the week.<\/p>\n<p>The great thing about this method is you can come back and re-do it anytime there\u2019s a change to your content.

By posting at the right time, you can get early engagement which signals YouTube to share your video more widely. But if the topic or content aren\u2019t interesting to your audience, you\u2019ll just tell YouTube not to share it faster.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the best time to post YouTube Shorts?<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-make-youtube-shorts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube Shorts<\/a> are short-form (up to 60 seconds) videos on the YouTube platform. Even though Shorts are like TikToks, people still see them while rummaging through their YouTube feed. That means Shorts, like their long-form siblings, are most popular after regular work hours. You should post Shorts at the same times and days as your longer videos.<\/p>\n<h3>How often should I post on YouTube?<\/h3>\n<p>Consistency is key on YouTube, so ideally you should aim to post every week. If possible, posting once per day on YouTube will help you gain more followers quickly.<\/p>\n<h2>Posting videos at the best time on YouTube<\/h2>\n<p>In the ultra-competitive world of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/03\/video-marketing-ideas\">video marketing<\/a>, every little boost helps.
