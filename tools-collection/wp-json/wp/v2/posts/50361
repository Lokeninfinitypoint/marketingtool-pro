This tool has <strong>always been\u00a0helpful<\/strong> for advertisers who want to accurately track their conversions, <strong>but now it&#8217;s essential <\/strong>for Facebook advertisers who want to future-proof their strategy in a privacy-first world.<\/p>\n<p>Which is why I\u2019ve written this post. We\u2019re going to cover:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What the Facebook Conversions API is and how it works.<\/li>\n<li>Its similarities and differences to the Facebook Pixel.<\/li>\n<li>Seven reasons to use Facebook CAPI (along with the pixel!)<\/li>\n<li>How to set up Facebook CAPI for your account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So if you want to future-proof your Facebook advertising strategy, I invite you to read on.<\/p>\n<h2>What is the Facebook Conversions API?<\/h2>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/2041148702652965#:~:text=Conversions%20API%20is%20a%20Facebook,of%20your%20Facebook%20ad%20campaigns.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201c<\/em><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\"><em>Conversions API is a Facebook Business Tool that lets you share key web and offline events, or customer actions, directly from your server to Facebook\u2019s.\u201d<\/em> <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">But what does that even <em>mean<\/em>?<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/facebook-conversions-api-what-does-that-mean-meme.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"299\" alt=\"facebook conversions api: what does that even mean\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Translation:<\/h3>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what each term in the above definition means.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>API: <\/strong>This\u00a0stands for application programming interface. It\u2019s a connection between two applications that lets them talk to one another. In this case, it\u2019s your website and Facebook.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Web and offline events: <\/strong>These are\u00a0actions taken on your website (viewed a page, filled out a form, etc.) or offline (such as called you) by people who have interacted with your Facebook Ads.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your server: <\/strong>For the sake of this article, \u201cyour server\u201d refers to the machine that houses your website and all the data connected with it. Large\u00a0businesses sometimes have their own servers, while small businesses usually pay to have their website hosted on someone else\u2019s server (like GoDaddy\u2019s or Bluehost\u2019s).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Facebook\u2019s server: <\/strong>Facebook has thousands of its own servers, and Ads Manager is hosted on one of them. For the sake of this article, \u201cFacebook\u2019s server\u201d is the machine that houses Ads Manager data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So basically, the Conversions API connects your website data (housed on your server) to Facebook\u00a0Ads Manager (housed on Facebook\u2019s server) so you can see how Facebook users interacting with your ads are behaving.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-facebook-conversions-api-works-1.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"361\" alt=\"how the facebook conversions api works\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">But isn\u2019t that what the Facebook Pixel does? Read on, my friend.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Facebook Conversions API vs Facebook Pixel<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">Yes, the Facebook Pixel serves the same purpose, but in a\u00a0different way and with different results.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/11\/facebook-conversion-tracking\">Facebook Pixel<\/a> is a piece of code that goes on your website, which then sends a cookie to Facebook\u2019s server (Ads Manager) whenever someone who interacted with your Facebook Ads takes an action on your site. Since cookies are stored in the user\u2019s browser, it is a browser-dependent conversion tracking method (hence the term <strong>browser-side conversion tracking<\/strong> (aka client-side).<\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">The Conversions API, on the other hand, is a form of <strong>server-side conversion tracking<\/strong>. So the same user behavior data is collected but stored on your server (rather than in the browser), and the API connects the server to Facebook\u2019s.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/facebook-conversions-api-vs-facebook-pixel.png\" width=\"678\" height=\"432\" alt=\"diagram of facebook conversions api and facebook pixel\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">So in short and as illustrated above,<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">With the conversions API, <strong>your website collects the data<\/strong>, the data gets stored on your server, and<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>the<strong> <\/strong>data gets <strong>sent to Facebook via API<\/strong>.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">With the pixel, <strong>Facebook collects the data<\/strong> (using cookies), the data gets stored on the user\u2019s browser, and the\u00a0data\u00a0gets<strong> sent to Facebook via pixel.<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What events can Facebook CAPI track?<\/h2>\n<p>Conversions API can track all the same <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.facebook.com\/docs\/facebook-pixel\/reference#standard-events\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">standard events<\/a> the Facebook Pixel tracks, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add payment info<\/li>\n<li>Add to cart<\/li>\n<li>Add to wishlist<\/li>\n<li>Customize product<\/li>\n<li>Complete registration<\/li>\n<li>Contact (phone, SMS, email, chat)<\/li>\n<li>Donate<\/li>\n<li>Find location searches for your store in a website or app<\/li>\n<li>Initiate checkout<\/li>\n<li>Lead<\/li>\n<li>Page view<\/li>\n<li>Purchase<\/li>\n<li>Schedule: books appointment<\/li>\n<li>Search: sight search<\/li>\n<li>Start Trial<\/li>\n<li>Submit Application<\/li>\n<li>Subscribe<\/li>\n<li>View Content<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But again, with the API, these are server-side events while with the pixel, they are client-side (or browser-side) events.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of events, you may be interested in these <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/20\/facebook-aggregated-event-measurement\">three tips to deal with\u00a0Facebook Aggregated Event Measurement.<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Why use Facebook CAPI?<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you understand how Facebook CAPI works, you can better understand the advantages of the tool.<\/p>\n<h3>1. CAPI solves for VPNs &amp; ad blockers<\/h3>\n<p>Originally, the Facebook Pixel provided us with all the information we needed to<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/01\/facebook-audiences\"> build powerful audiences<\/a>\u00a0for our ads. Then, VPNs, ad blockers, and other privacy software began causing\u00a0some discrepancies in the data. This is where the Facebook Conversions API came in.<\/p>\n<h3>2. CAPI is iOS14-friendly<\/h3>\n<p>But with iOS 14, we&#8217;re not just dealing with discrepancies in the data, but gaps. Gaps that <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/13\/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-world\">negatively impact Facebook ad targeting<\/a>. This is because\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/20\/ios-14-update-facebook-ads\">iOS 14 limits what data advertisers can collect <\/a>through client-side (pixel) tracking, and allows users to turn tracking off entirely (through ATT).<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/facebook-conversions-api-app-tracking-transparency.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"290\" alt=\"facebook conversions API- iOS 14 app tracking transparency example\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>CAPI sends user data directly from your server (not the user\u2019s device) to Facebook, instead of relying on the cookie and browser data the Facebook Pixel collects.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, you\u2019re collecting and sending the data, not Facebook.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Related<\/strong>: <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/11\/facebook-advertising-strategies\">6 Facebook Ad Strategies to Try if You&#8217;re Hurting After the iOS14 Update<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>3. CAPI captures important lower-funnel activity<\/h3>\n<p>The Facebook Conversions API\u00a0allows you to send more than just website behavior to Facebook. Not all server-side events happen and\/or are recorded <a href=\"https:\/\/segment.com\/blog\/facebook-conversions-api-segment\/\">directly on your site<\/a>. They may happen on your app, free tool, third-party payment tool, support hub, or offline (like through phone calls). If you record this data in your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/09\/crm-for-small-business\">CRM<\/a>, you can send additional data to Facebook through CAPI.<\/p>\n<p>And events in payment and shopping cart tools are often<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/01\/bottom-funnel-conversions\"> lower-funnel<\/a>, making them particularly important to track.<\/p>\n<h3>4. CAPI will be necessary when cookies are gone<\/h3>\n<p>But most importantly, when third-party cookies are gone, Conversions API will be our only source for conversion tracking and ad performance data.<\/p>\n<h2>Why not <em>only<\/em> use the Facebook Conversions API?<\/h2>\n<p>Given all of the above, that\u2019s the question!\u00a0It has its drawbacks.<\/p>\n<h3>The Facebook Pixel still has advantages<\/h3>\n<p>Even though you can track all standard events, the Pixel has the advantage in that it matches your website visitors to individual users on the platform. This enables you to see more information about people who have interacted with your ads, including demographic and psychographic information, and other data that other third-party cookies are collecting on their browser.<\/p>\n<h3>Server-side events may have Low Event Match Quality<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/revealbot.com\/blog\/facebook-conversions-api\/\">Revealbot<\/a> helps us to understand that Conversions API uses data keys to send the information. But it can only collect reliable data keys (name, email, phone number, location) if the user fills out a form on your site or is logged in. Without that action, it is left to use less reliable data keys (browser type and IP address).<\/p>\n<p>You may notice this for particular events in the Event Matching tool in Ads Manager. Because it won\u2019t be able to collect that information on website visitors who aren\u2019t signed in to your website or who don\u2019t fill out a form<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/facebook-conversions-api-drawbacks-event-matching.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"339\" alt=\"event matching example as drawback for facebook conversions API\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/revealbot.com\/blog\/facebook-conversions-api\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Why you need to use Facebook Conversions API <em>and<\/em>\u00a0Facebook Pixel<\/h2>\n<p>You should be using these two conversion tracking methods together, and here&#8217;s why.<\/p>\n<h3>5.

Some of the advantages of this option include full control in how you set up Conversions API as well as some potential savings in regards to upkeep.<\/p>\n<h3>Partner integration<\/h3>\n<p>If your website uses one of Facebook\u2019s partner platforms you will be able to set up the Conversions API that way as well.
