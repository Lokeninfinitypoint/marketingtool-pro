Instagram is owned by Meta, and its ads are placed on the same platform, which includes Facebook. By default, all campaigns will target both Facebook and Instagram together, so segmenting them out takes a little additional setup (read here if you\u2019re interested in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/13\/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-world\">Facebook ad targeting options<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>During campaign creation, the platform targeting settings will live in the Placement section of the ad set builder.

When you create a new custom audience, you\u2019re grouping users based on actions they\u2019ve taken in the past. This is similar to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/12\/04\/adwords-remarketing-best-practices-guide\">remarketing<\/a> since you\u2019ll be serving ads to people who have engaged with your brand already.<\/p>\n<p>Website is the first option under sources. It lets you create a list of users who have visited your site and taken certain actions there.<\/p>\n<p>There are many different actions to choose from depending on your chosen source. Since this is a post about Instagram targeting, let\u2019s choose the Instagram account option to use as our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/target-audience-examples\">example<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-audience-source.webp\" alt=\"Instagram ad targeting Ads Manager screen with custom audience options.\" width=\"754\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86851 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-audience-source.webp 754w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-audience-source-480x382.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 754px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>With Instagram, you can create audiences of users who have engaged with your profile, seen certain posts as ads, and a few other options. These custom audiences help you create lists of users to re-engage with and can narrow your audience to a very small group of people if you so wish.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-actions.webp\" alt=\"Instagram ad targeting Ads Manager screen highlighting custom audience selection.\" width=\"574\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86852 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-actions.webp 574w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-actions-480x502.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 574px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Lookalike audiences<\/h3>\n<p>The second type of audience is called a lookalike audience, and it\u2019s designed to be a true prospecting targeting type, meaning it\u2019s intended to generate an audience of new users and not target anyone you could put in a custom audience.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, the first thing you select when creating a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/facebook-lookalike-audiences\">lookalike audience<\/a> is a custom audience source. The Meta Ads platform will analyze the source audience you provide, then put together a group of users that look and behave like those users on Facebook and Instagram. This is your lookalike audience.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-lookalike.webp\" alt=\"Instagram ad targeting Ads Manager screen for choosing a lookalike audience.\" width=\"700\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86853 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-lookalike.webp 700w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-lookalike-480x411.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve added your source audience, choose the country in which you will use the list. Lastly, you can determine the size of your Lookalike audience by choosing a percentage of the country\u2019s population that you chose before. For the United States, about 280M people are on the Meta Ads platform, so a 1% model gives us about 2.8M users to target in the lookalike audience.<\/p>\n<p>This type of targeting has been Meta\u2019s bread and butter for a long time and has historically performed very well for them. It\u2019s also a personal favorite of mine as it leverages advertiser-provided lists and Meta\u2019s machine learning to find new customers.<\/p>\n<p>After creating your custom or lookalike audience, you can return to it by selecting it from the custom audience drop-down menu in the ad set settings.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-custom-1.webp\" alt=\"Instagram ad targeting Ads Manager screen with custom audience search bar.\" width=\"806\" height=\"304\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86854 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-custom-1.webp 806w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-custom-1-480x181.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 806px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1<strong>Take the guesswork out of your audience targeting<\/strong> with this free, complete <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteTargetAudience.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_TargetAudineceGuide_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">guide to finding your target audience<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"manual-instagram-ad-targeting\"><\/div>\n<h2>Manual Instagram ad targeting<\/h2>\n<p>As we move further down the page, we come to the targeting options that we can still choose manually but that aren\u2019t audiences.

(We\u2019ll come back to Interests in a minute.)<\/p>\n<p>Behaviors are slightly different because the options will change based on your existing audience. Nearly all accounts I\u2019ve looked at have different lists available, but this is where you\u2019ll target users based on how Meta knows they act. This could include when their anniversary is coming up, whether they\u2019ve started a business recently, or if they\u2019re what Meta calls \u201cEngaged Shoppers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One of my favorite behavior targeting options is travel. You can target users based on who commutes to work, who travels frequently, and how recently they got home from a trip. It&#8217;s a little wild but pretty cool if you\u2019re in that space.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-travel.webp\" alt=\"Instagram ad targeting Ads Manager screen with travel audience options.\" width=\"854\" height=\"453\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86861 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-travel.webp 854w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-travel-480x255.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 854px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Interests<\/h4>\n<p>Now, let\u2019s pop back up to interest targeting. These are all topics that Meta users have shown an interest in based on the posts they\u2019ve engaged with on Facebook or Instagram, as well as sites they\u2019ve visited that are part of the Meta Ads Network.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-interests.webp\" alt=\"Instagram ad targeting Ads Manager screen with interests options.\" width=\"852\" height=\"457\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86862 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-interests.webp 852w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-interests-480x257.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 852px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you open the dropdown, you can find many options to target here. They can be tough to sort through because there are so many, and some are pretty broad.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, I\u2019d suggest you use the search functionality in the bar at the top.<\/p>\n<p>If I look for photography manually, I click through the arts and music section, then the hobbies and activities section. But if I search for it, it comes up with several variations.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-photography.webp\" alt=\"Instagram ad targeting Ads Manager screen showing photography sub-groups.\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86863 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-photography.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-photography-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here, I can target people based on their interest in photography and choose a specific subtype of photography, whether for weddings, travel, or just digital photography in general.

It\u2019s the newest option for targeting, called Advantage+ audience, and there are two ways you can use it.<\/p>\n<h3>Fully automated<\/h3>\n<p>The first option is likely Meta\u2019s preferred option, but it\u2019s certainly not mine by default. With Advantage+ audience, you can simply create a campaign and ad set, add no additional targeting, and turn your ads on to let Meta handle all the targeting automatically.<\/p>\n<p>The trick to this performing well is your goal and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/11\/facebook-conversion-tracking\">conversion tracking<\/a>. The first portion of the ad set builder will focus on conversion settings. Make sure your conversion event and conversion event location settings are correct, and ideally, you have a decent amount of performance volume coming through. This is likely in the 30-50 conversions per week range. If you have that, you have a much better chance of seeing decent performance with the Advantage+ audience without any guidance.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/instagram-ad-targeting-conversion.webp\" alt=\"Instagram ad targeting Ads Manager screen with conversion event choices.\" width=\"643\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86864 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/instagram-ad-targeting-conversion.webp 643w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/instagram-ad-targeting-conversion-480x448.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 643px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Advertiser guided<\/h3>\n<p>I prefer the advertiser-assisted approach.<\/p>\n<p>When you opt into Advantage+ audience, you\u2019ll see an option to add an audience suggestion. Choose it, and you\u2019ll be directed to use the exact same builder you were for all of the manual and audience targets we\u2019ve already talked about. But rather than using these as the only audience you\u2019ll reach on Instagram, Meta uses it as a starting point before searching more widely for similar audiences.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/instagram-ad-targeting-advantage-audience-1.webp\" alt=\"Instagram ad targeting Ads Manager screen with Advantage audience guided option.\" width=\"855\" height=\"393\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86865 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/instagram-ad-targeting-advantage-audience-1.webp 855w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/instagram-ad-targeting-advantage-audience-1-480x221.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 855px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In my experience, Advantage+ audience with advertiser guidance performs pretty well and can be a great way to make sure you have your hand in the direction of your advertising. It also lets Meta\u2019s intelligent machine learning find new users you might not have thought of before.<\/p>\n<h2>Pick the Instagram Ad Targeting that suits you best<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s no right or wrong way to reach your audience on Instagram. You can be fully hands-on with the audience and manual targets or completely hands-off and use the fully automated Advantage+ audience. Like many advertisers, you could be somewhere in the middle and provide some guidance to Meta\u2019s algorithms.<\/p>\n<p>Which you choose and how you manage it will determine how well your ads perform on Instagram.
