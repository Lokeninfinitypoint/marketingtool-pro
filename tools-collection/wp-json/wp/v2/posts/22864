It pushes you to be your best. Think Coca-Cola vs. Pepsi, Visa vs. MasterCard, Xbox vs. PlayStation, or Apple vs. Microsoft.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, part of the fun of rivalry is stealing customers from your rivals. You can do that with the help of advertising!<\/p>\n<p>Today you&#8217;ll learn five brilliant competitive advertising strategies you can use to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/01\/facebook-competitive-advertising\">get in front of your competitors&#8217; customers<\/a> and (with a little work) turn them into YOUR customers instead. *Evil laughter*<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/competitive-ads-dr-evil-laugh.gif\" alt=\"competitive advertising tips\" width=\"500\" height=\"236\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>1. Target Facebook Users Whose Interests Include Your Competitors<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"\/facebook-advertising\">Facebook Ads<\/a> doesn\u2019t offer keyword targeting for your ads and you can\u2019t specifically target people who have liked your competitors\u2019 pages. However, Facebook offers something called interest-based targeting.<\/p>\n<p>On Facebook, interests range from extremely broad (e.g., business or entrepreneurship) to very specific. In this case, <strong>your competitor\u2019s name is the specific interest you want to target<\/strong>, because Facebook allows you to choose to target people based on, among other things, brands and products they like.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-interest-targeting-competitive-ads.jpg\" alt=\"competitive facebook advertising\" width=\"606\" height=\"169\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Type in your competitor\u2019s website URL. Or, if that doesn\u2019t work, you can type in your competitor\u2019s brand name or try a few keyword combinations to figure out the\u00a0best option for reaching their target audience \u2013 which is now your target audience!<\/p>\n<p>Here are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/26\/target-competitors-paid-social\">three more ways to target your competitors&#8217; audiences using paid social.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333; font-size: 26px;\">2. Disrupt Your Competitors&#8217; Videos with YouTube Ads<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Recently I was on YouTube searching for an AT&amp;T ad. Before I could watch the ad I was looking for, I had to sit through another ad \u2013 I know, that\u2019s modern life. But the genius part was that <strong>this ad wasn\u2019t for AT&amp;T, but for its\u00a0competitor, Sprint<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>In this ad, Sprint explained why it is a better provider than AT&amp;T and highlighted an offer to switch carriers, before I could even see the ad for the brand I had searched for.<\/p>\n<p>To execute this competitive advertising strategy for your own campaigns, create the most watchable TrueView ad you can, adding in how much you&#8217;re willing to spend.<\/p>\n<p>There are many targeting options to choose from (e.g., demographics, interests, keywords, remarketing). But today we\u2019re feeling competitive!<\/p>\n<p><strong>You want to target your video ads so that whenever someone searches for the YouTube videos of your competitor that they&#8217;ll see your ad first.<\/strong> If you play it right, they might not even watch your competitor\u2019s video!<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/vYyUb_MI7to?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>For best results, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/12\/memorable-youtube-ads\">make sure your video ad is memorable<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Use Your Competitors&#8217; Emails Against Them with Gmail Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Another brilliantly sneaky <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/26\/competitive-ads\">competitive advertising<\/a> tactic you should start using now is targeting people who have recently shown interest in the things your competition sells.<\/p>\n<p>With Gmail Ads (those ads that appear at the top of the Promotions tab of users\u2019 personal email accounts), <strong>you can do keyword targeting on your competitors\u2019 brand terms<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>As you read this, people who are in the market for your competitor&#8217;s products are getting emails from your competitors \u2013 and those emails mention your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/04\/google-competitive-ad-policy\">competitors\u2019 brand terms<\/a>. For example, if you were competing with <em>Sephora, <\/em><em>you <\/em>could target its\u00a0brand name as part of a Gmail ad campaign so that every time a Sephora newsletter arrives in someone\u2019s Gmail inbox, your brand ends up in its inbox as well. Obviously, your email should tell Sephora subscribers all about your great competing site and product and why they should check your out.<\/p>\n<p>So if you want to try to steal some sales, target the trademarks of your competitors. Make sure you use an <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/31\/email-subject-lines\">email subject line<\/a> that will have users clicking your Gmail Ads in droves. Use only the best-performing subject lines, the ones with the highest open rates \u2013 your unicorns. As an added bonus, because these people are already in the market for a competing solution, it\u2019s likely that more people will click on your ads, which reduces your costs.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/gmail-ads-templates.gif\" alt=\"gmail ad formats\" width=\"950\" height=\"901\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Check out more of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/01\/gmail-ads\">my best Gmail Ads hacks here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Reach Your Competitors\u2019 Audiences through the Google Display Network<\/h2>\n<p>Google has some great display ad technology. But if you want to beat up on your competition, you need to use Google\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/adwords.blogspot.com\/2014\/10\/introducing-custom-affinity-audiences.html\"><\/a> <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/19\/google-custom-audiences\">custom audiences<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/custom-affinity-audience-competitive-ads.png\" alt=\"competitive advertising strategies\" width=\"725\" height=\"519\" \/><\/div>\n<p>To make this work brilliantly, and avoid wasting your ad budget, you\u2019ll want to <strong>target the home page of your competitor<\/strong>. Google Ads (formerly known as Google AdWords)\u00a0will then figure out the brand trademarks and the behavior of the people who visit and are interested in that domain name (or search for content on related topics).<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s use <em>MailChimp<\/em> as an example: <em>MailChimp<\/em> is a publication that\u2019s geared toward businesses doing email marketing. So if I\u2019m running a similar business geared toward email marketers, <em>MailChimp<\/em> visitors would form the basis of our \u201cideal customer\u201d we want to reach with our own <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/12\/02\/creative-display-ad-ideas\">display ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This will start the process of getting the right people familiar with your brand and the products or service you provide. And hopefully, with the right message, you\u2019ll start stealing business away from your competitors and experiencing breakout growth.<\/p>\n<p>For more on this strategy, head to these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/20\/target-competitor-audiences-without-search-ads\">ways to target competitor audiences on Google without search ads.<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>5. Download &amp; Target Your Competitors&#8217; Twitter Followers<\/h2>\n<p>There are tools that allow you to download a list of every Twitter follower for any account, such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.birdsonganalytics.com\/\">BirdSong Analytics<\/a>. You can use these to download a list of all your competitor\u2019s Twitter followers. Costs generally start around $35 and go up the more followers the account has.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have your report, <strong>you can use those Twitter handles to create a list that you\u2019ll then upload to Twitter Ads<\/strong>. Make sure to select the option to &#8220;add tailored audiences.&#8221; Uploading the list will take about 3 hours to process.<\/p>\n<p>You can then create ads to get your business in front of the Twitter users who are already following your competitors and are likely in the market to buy or switch to a similar product or service. Genius, right?<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-create-facebook-ads-color-consistency.png\" alt=\"How to create Facebook ads color consistency\" width=\"540\" height=\"270\" \/><\/div>\n<p>After setting your budget comes the real fun.
