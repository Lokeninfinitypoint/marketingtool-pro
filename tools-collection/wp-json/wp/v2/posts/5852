PPC is a highly effective channel for websites and companies doing <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/01\/lead-generation-ideas\">online lead generation<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Lead generation (often referred to as \u201clead gen\u201d) is a requirement for businesses that can\u2019t or won\u2019t do business with just anyone. There\u2019s usually a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/25\/lead-qualification\">prequalification<\/a> and information-exchange period that takes place so the company and consumer can make decisions based on information.<\/p>\n<p>Lead-gen business characteristics might include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trial periods<\/li>\n<li>Approval and denial processes<\/li>\n<li>Long <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/26\/sales-cycle\">sales cycles<\/a>\u00a0because of the complex nature of the product or service<\/li>\n<li>Price quotes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For example, financial services (credit cards and mortgages), all types of insurance, and business-to-business software survive with lead generation or <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/28\/lead-capture\">lead capture<\/a>. In fact, anyone who\u2019s reading this guide is, or at some point has been, a lead for a company. As a lead you were categorized with a label, like \u201chot lead,\u201d and were then marketed to on a regular basis until an event occurred: you may have signed up, were denied, decided to do nothing, or just went to the bottom of their lead pile to be marketed to later.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>goal of lead gen is to get prospects into the lead-tracking system<\/strong> (commonly depicted as a funnel \u2013 see below) to begin a contact period in which the company learns more about your needs and qualifications, and you learn more about the company\u2019s products and services.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>ultimate goal is for a sales person to close the deal, so the company gains a new customer<\/strong>. It starts with obtaining basic information, like a name and email address, then progresses to getting more detailed information about the prospect.<\/p>\n<h2>Why PPC Is Great for Lead Gen<\/h2>\n<p>If you consider your typical <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/07\/marketing-funnel\">lead funnel<\/a>, it won\u2019t take long to realize you need to keep filling the funnel full of leads.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-lead-gen-funnel-1.jpg\" alt=\"Get More Leads with PPC\" width=\"474\" height=\"300\" \/><\/div>\n<p>At first leads go into the top of the funnel, then work their way down to an eventual conversion. The challenge is getting the initial leads to feed the top of the funnel. Let\u2019s look at the ways this may be accomplished and why PPC is an excellent source of leads:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Blogging:<\/strong> This can be a good source of leads, but you need to a) constantly publish new content, b) hope your blog posts get shared a lot, and c) have a lot of blog subscribers. This takes time.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Email:<\/strong> You can repeatedly email your existing subscribers, or you can rent or buy a list of email addresses and hope you\u2019re targeting great new leads for your business.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Social media:<\/strong> This can get you <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/05\/16\/buying-twitter-followers-pros-and-cons\">new followers<\/a> and fans and expose you to new prospects. However, it doesn\u2019t mean those followers are in your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/18\/beginners-guide-to-target-markets\">target market<\/a> or need your product or service.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Organic search:<\/strong> Organic ranking is the top of the heap. Approximately 85 percent of search clicks come from page one organic listings, and the clicks are free! The only problem is <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/10\/15\/why-seo-is-harder-for-small-businesses\">you\u2019re competing with thousands of others for those positions<\/a>, and you\u2019ve got to do a ton of on- and off-page SEO work and wait months, maybe years, to get to page one.<\/li>\n<li><strong>PPC:<\/strong> You can instantly appear on page one and be in front of people who are searching for your solution to their problem. More people are aware of you and what you have to offer than before. Bingo!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Yes, PPC is a channel you pay for by the click. Do keep in mind, though, that <strong>no marketing channel is free<\/strong>. Someone has to manage social media, write the blogs, work with the SEO agency (not free), and publish the emails\u2014and those people don\u2019t do it for free.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Benefits of PPC for Lead Generation:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attract visitors who are looking for what you offer<\/li>\n<li>Achieve immediate <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/11\/14\/how-to-rank-for-a-keyword\">keyword rankings<\/a> and traffic<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/08\/29\/ppc-budget-guide\">Bid on various stages of the funnel<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Control the message for each funnel stage<\/li>\n<li>See what people are searching for and craft your message to their needs<\/li>\n<li>Know more about your leads and their behavior<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/07\/30\/ppc-guide-for-beginners-1\">Track ROI<\/a> down to the penny<\/li>\n<li>Grow your database of leads and market to them with other methods<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>How Lead Gen Compares to E-Commerce<\/h2>\n<p>Back to our initial statement about how e-commerce and lead generation both use PPC marketing. The most glaring difference is the qualification process: in e-commerce, there is none. As long as you have a credit card you\u2019re in the target market.<\/p>\n<h3>Lead gen vs. e-commerce ad copy<\/h3>\n<p>Starting with the ad copy itself, you\u2019ll notice the messages and calls-to-action vary between e-commerce and lead-gen companies:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/lead-gen-vs-e-commerce-ctas-1.png\" alt=\"Lead Gen vs. E-Commerce\" width=\"643\" height=\"194\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Notice how e-commerce is about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/28\/hyperbolic-discounting\">immediate gratification<\/a> (and sales!), while lead gen is a bit more discriminating. It\u2019s rarely the case where you become an immediate customer in lead gen because you have to go through a process first.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some real-world examples of how the ad copy, CTA, and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/09\/10\/landing-page-builder\">landing page experiences<\/a> compare. For lead gen, the keyword is \u201ccar insurance.\u201d<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-lead-generation-ads-ctas-1.png\" alt=\"lead generation ppc ads\" width=\"790\" height=\"516\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Now look at the e-commerce copy and CTAs used for \u201casics running shoes\u201d:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/e-commerce-ppc-ad-examples-1.png\" alt=\"e-commerce ppc\" width=\"763\" height=\"518\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/08\/15\/ad-copywriting-tips\">ad copy<\/a> and CTAs are somewhat subtle in their differences. The landing pages, however, are where a distinct difference between e-commerce and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/28\/lead-generation-for-contractors\">lead gen<\/a> is clear.<\/p>\n<h3>Lead gen vs. e-commerce PPC landing pages<\/h3>\n<p>Here are some examples of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/24\/landing-pages-for-lead-generation\">lead-gen landing pages for PPC<\/a>:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-lead-gen-landing-page-example-1.png\" alt=\"get leads with ppc\" width=\"430\" height=\"310\" \/><\/div>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-lead-gen-landing-page-example-2-1.png\" alt=\"PPC lead gen landing page\" width=\"417\" height=\"370\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The landing pages are limited and with few distractions.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a clear pattern of headline, benefits, and multiple calls-to-action: \u201cStart,\u201d \u201cGet an online quote,\u201d \u201cCall,\u201d etc.<\/p>\n<p>Your choices are limited: either make a call or provide them with your zip code.<\/p>\n<p>Visitors need to tell the companies more so the companies can start to qualify and route the leads through the funnel.<\/p>\n<p>With e-commerce, it\u2019s a different landing-page experience. Visitors are free to shop the stores and make purchases.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-e-commerce-landing-page-example-1.png\" alt=\"E-Commerce Landing Page\" width=\"464\" height=\"245\" \/><\/div>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-e-commerce-landing-page-example-2-1.png\" alt=\"PPC for E-Commerce Sales\" width=\"463\" height=\"279\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Both landing pages are relevant to the search query <em>and<\/em> provide additional pages to look at.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s urgency associated with the \u201cfree ground shipping\u201d offer \u2013 it\u2019s a limited time offer so visitors are motivated to purchase soon.<\/p>\n<p>The theme of both landing pages is to <strong>shop now<\/strong>. They\u2019re encouraging visitors to make purchases now.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Optimize Your Campaigns to Get More Leads Through PPC<\/h2>\n<p>Optimizing lead-gen campaigns with Google Ads\u00a0requires the same principles you incorporate with e-commerce: tightly themed ad groups, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/09\/25\/a-b-testing\">testing ad copy and offers<\/a>, and a variety of keywords. The major differences are the types of calls-to-action and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/great-landing-pages\">landing pages<\/a>, as evidenced by the previous examples.<\/p>\n<p>The goal is to keep <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/24\/facebook-free-leads\">topping off the funnel with qualified leads<\/a>, and you do this by collecting information from your visitors. It\u2019s a numbers game because not every click you get is going to convert, therefore you need to cast a wide net and increase your chances of getting qualified leads with PPC.<\/p>\n<h3>Actionable tips for improving your lead-gen performance:<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Entice visitors with offers. <\/strong>Offer something (e.g., a free white paper or guide) in exchange for the visitor\u2019s email, name, and more. At the very least, give them the opportunity to sign up for your blog or follow you on social media. Though the latter outcomes are not ideal, you at least have not wasted the click by getting nothing for it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Use focused landing pages. <\/strong>Repeat the benefits and why the person should give you their information. Ask for just the right amount of pertinent information instead of making the transaction appear laborious by asking for <em>too<\/em> much information. Use primary and secondary CTAs. Test landing page length and fields. In short, make it as frictionless as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Example of a PPC landing page that was reached via PPC:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pr-web-ppc-landing-page-for-lead-generation-1.png\" alt=\"how to get more leads\" width=\"400\" height=\"349\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Things to notice:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Very few fields to fill in = increased response<\/li>\n<li>Simple bullet point list of benefits<\/li>\n<li>Testimonial and short client list<\/li>\n<li>Free offer in exchange for information<\/li>\n<li>Trust and credibility proof<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Try dynamic number insertion (DNI). <\/strong>DNI allows you to dynamically change the phone number that appears in your ads and on landing pages. This ensures your call representatives know <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/12\/10\/three-types-of-search-queries\">what type of keyword<\/a> triggered the call. You\u2019re then better able to route calls to the right reps in your organization. Two of the better known providers are <a href=\"http:\/\/public.ifbyphone.com\/\">ifbyphone<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.callrail.com\/\">Call Rail<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Invest in a solid CRM. <\/strong>Tracking your leads and staying in touch with them can become overwhelming\u2014fast. A CRM (customer relationship management) program allows you to record who contacted you, what they were interested in, and what happened. You can then classify the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/12\/how-to-generate-leads\">leads you generated<\/a> and engage with them via email or a phone call. There are tons of CRM companies out there, but some of the more popular ones are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.infusionsoft.com\/\">Infusionsoft<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zoho.com\/\">Zoho<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/\">Salesforce<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Focus on a \u201cnew\u201d KPI. <\/strong>In PPC we\u2019re usually talking about metrics like cost-per-click and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/07\/11\/landing-page-conversion-rate-guide\">conversion rate<\/a>. In lead gen, though, one of the major key performance indicators is cost-per-lead (CPL). It\u2019s simple to calculate: [Overall cost of PPC campaign \/ number of leads = CPL]. In short, it will reveal how much you\u2019re paying for your leads and will drive your decision-making process.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Want to get more leads through PPC?
