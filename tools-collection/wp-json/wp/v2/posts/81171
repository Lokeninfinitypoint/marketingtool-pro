Here are some of the most popular ways I&#8217;ve seen giveaways used in marketing:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Boost brand awareness:<\/strong> When people don&#8217;t know or trust your brand yet, a giveaway will help you break the ice.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Support a product launch: <\/strong>Giveaways capture attention fast, which is exactly what you need for a new product.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Introduce a new location: <\/strong>A little free gift will build rapport quickly with new neighbors.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Grow your social media and email following: <\/strong>It\u2019s crazy how well tag-a-friend giveaways multiply social networks.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Clear out seasonal merch: <\/strong>Turn a sunk cost into a wildly effective marketing strategy.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Capture UGC: <\/strong>Make sharing <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/user-generated-content\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">user-generated content<\/a> a sweepstakes entry, and watch the awesome customer images pour in.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Get customer referrals: <\/strong>Incentivize customers to become your best salespeople.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Recover abandoned cart sales: <\/strong>Put all those \u201calmost-won\u201d sales over the finish line with free shipping or by throwing in a gift card or trial size.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 Free guide &gt;&gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download\">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website (FAST!)<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"how-do-you-make-a-successful-giveaway\"><\/div>\n<h2>How do you make a successful giveaway?<\/h2>\n<p>The type and scope of giveaway you manage depends on what you have available, who you&#8217;re trying to reach, and what you hope to get out of it. Follow these steps so your giveaway makes a huge splash.<\/p>\n<h3>Set a goal<\/h3>\n<p>The goal of your giveaway is the first piece of the puzzle. Everything else snaps in around it.<\/p>\n<p>Say you want to blow up your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-promote-your-instagram\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram follower count<\/a>. The platform, set of rules, and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/types-of-sales-leads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">promotional plan<\/a> supporting your giveaway should all align to make that happen.<\/p>\n<h3>Choose the prize<\/h3>\n<p>This is trickier than some people realize. Ideally, you want a prize aligned with your brand and right-sized for your goals.<\/p>\n<p>A brand-aligned giveaway helps you focus on attracting ideal potential customers. If you sell baby monitors, giving away running shoes will attract lots of people who don&#8217;t need your products.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-pick-prize.webp\" alt=\"Giveaway ideas - giveaway on YouTube\" width=\"919\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81174 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-pick-prize.webp 919w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-pick-prize-480x313.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 919px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Choose a gift that matches the size and goal of your giveaway.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Likewise, a huge prize for a simple entry method (like tagging a friend on Instagram) is going to bog you down with so many entrants outside of your core audience. Pick a prize just large enough to make it worth the effort to get it.<\/p>\n<h3>Pick your platform<\/h3>\n<p>Here, I\u2019m talking about in-person, social media, email marketing, etc. Where can you find the people you want to reach? Which option makes it easy to achieve your specific goal?<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re drumming up <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/10\/brand-awareness\">brand awareness<\/a> for a new dentist&#8217;s office, handing out travel toothcare kits at a health fair is perfect. However, an email campaign would be better if you\u2019re looking for new patient referrals.<\/p>\n<h3>Schedule appropriately<\/h3>\n<p>Timing matters a lot in giveaways for several reasons. Seasons, competition levels, and your own internal needs all factor in.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a brand awareness giveaway that would triple your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/17\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok\">TikTok follower count<\/a> in June might get drowned out by holiday marketers in December.<\/p>\n<h3>Create the rules<\/h3>\n<p>There are two questions to answer here:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>What do people have to do to get the giveaway?<\/li>\n<li>What laws and platform rules do you need to follow?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>To set the rules of entry, match the ask&#8217;s difficulty to the prize&#8217;s value. The better the prize, the more you can ask. It\u2019s fair to ask someone to buy one shirt to get another similar shirt for free. Or to register their email address for a chance to win a weekend trip. But if your giveaway is an inexpensive branded pen, you won\u2019t get many people registering (those are great handouts at conferences, though).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-rules.webp\" alt=\"Giveaway ideas - Giveaway on Instagram showing the rules.\" width=\"918\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81177 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-rules.webp 918w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-rules-480x314.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 918px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Make sure you\u2019ve listed all giveaway rules clearly.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Laws and platform rules can vary. <a href=\"https:\/\/help.instagram.com\/179379842258600\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram<\/a> has its own rules, for example. In general, you want to clearly and fairly describe the prize, give a minimum age to participate, list the rules, and give the odds of winning if it pertains to your type of giveaway.<\/p>\n<h3>Hype it up<\/h3>\n<p>Before and during the big day(s), use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/april-content-ideas\">social media posts<\/a> and popups on your website to get more attention. Email your subscribers and offer your loyalty members early or extra entries. Look for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/26\/influencer-marketing\">influencers<\/a> or related businesses to partner with. If it\u2019s a really big deal, consider spending on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/paid-search\">paid search ads<\/a> or boosted social media posts.<\/p>\n<h3>Follow up<\/h3>\n<p>After your giveaway is over, there\u2019s plenty of attention and excitement to be had. Announce the winner (if it was a contest) and tag them in the social media posts so their network can see them. Let people who didn\u2019t participate or win know what they missed, and tell them to stay tuned for future events.<\/p>\n<p>You could end up gathering <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/05\/increase-email-signups#:~:text=Run%20a%20contest%2C%20giveaway%2C%20or%20sweepstakes%20and%20capture%20email%20sign,sign%2Dup%20form%20page%20placement\">more email addresses<\/a> with the promise of a future giveaway than the original giveaway itself.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd47Are you an all-star advertiser?

Sweepstakes<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019re probably pretty familiar with this one. You give up your email address or some other information, and you\u2019re entered to win a prize. Unlike a gift-with-purchase, your free gift isn\u2019t guaranteed, which adds a little anticipation to the game.<\/p>\n<p>Sweepstakes are useful for all types of brand awareness and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/12\/how-to-generate-leads\"> lead-generation campaigns<\/a>. They\u2019re less often used to generate direct sales since requiring a purchase to enter can be legally tricky.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Customer loyalty giveaway<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/09\/customer-retention-strategies\">Customer retention<\/a> is a critical <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite7StepstoGrowthStrategy.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_GrowthStrategy_Download\">business growth strategy<\/a>. This giveaway aims to keep your best customers happy and returning for a long time.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-loyalty-188x300.webp\" alt=\"Giveaway ideas -Under Armor giveaway.\" width=\"188\" height=\"300\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81178 size-medium\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-loyalty-188x300.webp 188w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-loyalty.webp 376w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 188px) 100vw, 188px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Use exclusive giveaways for your loyalty members to keep them active longer.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The actual giveaway can take on many forms. The important part is to talk up the exclusivity of it. Only your best customers get the gift, discount, or entry to win. That\u2019ll help cement the feeling of community, which strengthens brand loyalty.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Holiday-themed giveaway<\/h3>\n<p>Holiday-themed giveaways come in many variations. Black Friday doorbuster deals are a very popular one, but you can get pretty creative. For example, you could offer a self-care giveaway for singles as part of your Valentine\u2019s Day marketing.<\/p>\n<h3>4. The year\u2019s supply giveaway<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s some psychology behind our desire for abundance, even for everyday products. Think of having a pantry full of mac and cheese or all the laundry detergent you could use for a year. It\u2019s more exciting than it should be.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s the motivation behind giving a year\u2019s supply of a product. The bonus is that you can make this highly relevant to what you sell, attracting future customers.<\/p>\n<h3>5. BOGO<\/h3>\n<p>Buy one, get one free deals are among the most popular giveaways for both the giver and the receiver.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-bogo.webp\" alt=\"Giveaway ideas - Cosmetics BOGO giveaway.\" width=\"365\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81179 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-bogo.webp 365w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-bogo-183x300.webp 183w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Use BOGO deals for a big boost in sales and awareness.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Your customers get double the product for the same price, and you make a sale every time someone takes advantage of your offer.<\/p>\n<p>Giveaways like this can also be great loss-leaders\u2014products that don\u2019t generate much profit on their own but drive lots of new customers to your store to buy additional items.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Free upgrade<\/h3>\n<p>This is a nice option if your product or service has pricing tiers and you want to attract more customers to the higher tier.<\/p>\n<p>Say you sell software with entry, pro, and executive plan options. Run a promo where anyone who buys the entry plan gets the pro version for the first month. Some of those users will get hooked on the expanded capability and upgrade at the end of the giveaway period.<\/p>\n<p>You can use this for physical products, too. Offer the premium product at the standard price for a limited time. Then <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/16\/get-more-google-reviews\">gather as many reviews<\/a> of the higher-end version and use that social proof to sell it after the promo is over.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Free product with purchase<\/h3>\n<p>I love these types of giveaways, especially for two specific purposes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have seasonal or excessive stock you need to turn<\/li>\n<li>You\u2019re introducing a new product<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Make the free product as relevant to the purchased one as possible. Socks with a pair of shoes is a perfect example. You could also throw in something that often causes friction when forgotten, like batteries with a battery-powered toy.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Product bundle giveaway<\/h3>\n<p>Grow your add-on sales by bundling several complementary products and running a sales promotion giveaway to demonstrate\u00a0how they all work together.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-bundle.webp\" alt=\"Giveaway ideas - Bundle giveaway on Instagram.\" width=\"382\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81180 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-bundle.webp 382w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-bundle-191x300.webp 191w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Bundling products for a giveaway is a great way to promote complimentary products.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>9. Surprise discount or coupon code<\/h3>\n<p>Here\u2019s the gist. A customer opens a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/21\/promotional-email-examples\">promotional email<\/a> with their secret code. They click through to a sales page and enter it to learn they\u2019ve been given a 20% discount. That little bit of intrigue and anticipation makes a much bigger impression than simply getting 20%.<\/p>\n<p>This giveaway works best when you can give away something valuable\u2014you might disappoint people if they go through the motions for 5% off.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Branded swag giveaway<\/h3>\n<p>This is a standard and useful tactic for in-person events. Hand out pens, t-shirts, ball caps, or fidget spinners (remember those?) to get people to your booth or table.<\/p>\n<p>A slight modification here is to buy fewer, more expensive items and only give them away to people who talk with your team. That shifts the focus from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/05\/brand-awareness-campaigns\">brand awareness<\/a> to a lead generation campaign.<\/p>\n<h3>11. Refer-a-friend giveaway<\/h3>\n<p>There is no better salesperson for your business than happy customers. Use a little gift to give your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/14\/referral-program-ideas\">customer referral program<\/a> a big shot in the arm.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-refer-friend.webp\" alt=\"Giveaway ideas - Customer referral giveaway post.\" width=\"386\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81181 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-refer-friend.webp 386w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-refer-friend-193x300.webp 193w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Use giveaways to get more customer referrals.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>You\u2019re asking people to discuss your business with their friends, and the leads you get will be very high-value, so make sure the gift is a good one.<\/p>\n<h3>12. Influencer giveaway<\/h3>\n<p>If you don\u2019t already have a big audience, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/21\/social-media-influencers\">partner with an influencer<\/a> to get more eyes on your giveaways.<\/p>\n<p>Pick an influencer with a smaller, niche, engaged audience. So find a holistic health professional with a few thousand dedicated followers over Selina Gomez for your essential oils giveaway. That\u2019ll deliver higher quality traffic which leads to more future sales.<\/p>\n<h3>13. Buy a gift, get a gift<\/h3>\n<p>This is such a great variation of the holiday giveaway or buy one, get one promo. When someone orders a present, give them something for themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Gift cards work well here, so the buyer can choose what they want. But you can also create a cool version where both people get the same gift, especially if your product is great for friends\u2014like bracelets.<\/p>\n<h3>14. Appreciation giveaway<\/h3>\n<p>Use this type of giveaway for milestones like business anniversaries or getting your first 100K followers on TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>You can make this about the individual, too. For example, you could send an extra gift or discount to people one year after their first purchase.<\/p>\n<h3>15. Reengagement giveaway<\/h3>\n<p>Now, for those customers or prospects who haven\u2019t made a purchase or opened an email in a while, a re-engagement giveaway is just the trick.<\/p>\n<p>Start by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/13\/targeted-email-marketing-strategies\">segmenting your email list<\/a> to pull out subscribers who haven\u2019t done what you want them to do (click a link or re-order a product) for a set period. Send them an email with a concise, compelling <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/31\/email-subject-lines\">subject line<\/a> announcing the giveaway.<\/p>\n<p>If reordering is the goal, an extra discount or BOGO offer is a good giveaway to use here.<\/p>\n<div id=\"giveaway-ideas-for-small-businesses\"><\/div>\n<h2>Giveaway ideas for small businesses<\/h2>\n<p>Every penny counts for small and growing businesses. These giveaway ideas don\u2019t require a lot of money or time to manage but can still net a really nice return.<\/p>\n<h3>16. Co-sponsored giveaway<\/h3>\n<p>Co-sponsored giveaways are events managed and promoted by two or more businesses. I purposely put them at the top of this list because they\u2019re such a smart way to share the load of running a giveaway while multiplying its effect.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-cosponsered.webp\" alt=\"Giveaway ideas - Cosponsored giveaway post on Instagram. \" width=\"382\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81182 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-cosponsered.webp 382w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-cosponsered-191x300.webp 191w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Giveaways work great as co-promotional events.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>With multiple businesses involved, you\u2019ll be able to afford a larger prize or gift. But even better, your brand will get exposure to the existing networks those other businesses have built.<\/p>\n<p>Co-sponsored giveaways are a good <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/01\/09\/social-media-marketing-strategies\">social media marketing strategy<\/a>, but they can also be effective in person or even via email.<\/p>\n<h3>17. Tag us in your post giveaways<\/h3>\n<p>This giveaway is a UGC-gathering powerhouse. Ask followers to tag you in their social media posts using either your handle or a branded <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/29\/instagram-hashtags\">hashtag<\/a> in exchange for entry into a sweepstakes, then share the content on your account.<\/p>\n<p>These events are easy to run. Just make sure you explicitly mention that tagging a post is consent for you to reshare the image. And don\u2019t forget to highlight the winners so everyone knows the contest was legit and to get an extra splash of attention for your brand.<\/p>\n<h3>18. Tag-a-friend giveaways<\/h3>\n<p>If you scroll Instagram or TikTok for about five minutes, you\u2019re almost guaranteed to stumble on one of these contests. That\u2019s simply because they\u2019re so good at exponentially growing your social network.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-tag-a-friend.webp\" alt=\"Giveaway ideas - tag a friend giveaway on Instagram.\" width=\"337\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81183 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-tag-a-friend.webp 337w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-tag-a-friend-169x300.webp 169w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Use tag-a-friend giveaways to grow your social media following quickly.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Try to keep the instructions simple. If you ask someone to follow three accounts, like two different posts, and share the post to their network, they might keep scrolling (unless you\u2019re offering a monster prize).<\/p>\n<p>Combine this with a co-sponsored giveaway for an extra boost in online presence.<\/p>\n<h3>19. Giveaway for feedback<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/online-review-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Online reviews<\/a> do a lot of heavy lifting for your business. Buyers trust reviews, and Google uses them as a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/12\/27\/eleven-seo-tips-for-local-search-optimization\">local search<\/a> ranking factor so you show up in more searches.<\/p>\n<p>You can use giveaways to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/16\/get-more-google-reviews\">get more reviews<\/a> in a hurry. Just make giving a review a requirement for entering the giveaway.<\/p>\n<p>Caution is warranted here. You don\u2019t want to come off as buying reviews. And some platforms, like Yelp, don\u2019t allow this tactic. Plus, you need to start with an excellent product and service, or you\u2019ll just get more bad reviews.<\/p>\n<h3>20. Free information giveaway<\/h3>\n<p>This one is nice for small businesses because it leverages your valuable expertise instead of a costly product.<\/p>\n<p>To launch this type of giveaway, create an ebook, template, or some other form of content that your target audience would love to have. For example, if you\u2019re a chiropractor, you could create a PDF showing 10 daily habits for a healthy back. Then use a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/22\/popup-examples\">popup<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/15\/lead-magnet-ideas\">lead magnat<\/a>, which asks visitors to enter their email address in exchange for the guide.<\/p>\n<p>Not sure what to create? List out the five questions your customers most frequently ask and start there.<\/p>\n<h3>21. Free trial<\/h3>\n<p>An old sales trick says that if you can put a product in a prospect\u2019s hands, your chance of making the sale will increase dramatically.<\/p>\n<p>A free trial giveaway does just that. Let people who register on your website try your product without cost. They\u2019ll gladly pay to keep using it when they fall in love.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll see this strategy used for software sales a lot. But you can also send a sample size of a consumable product. Make it a gift with the purchase of another popular item to get it in more hands.<\/p>\n<h3>22. Free quote<\/h3>\n<p>This might be the most underrated giveaway on the list. Especially if your competitors regularly charge to price out a job.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-free-quote.webp\" alt=\"Giveaway ideas - free quote promotion on Instagram.\" width=\"366\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81184 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-free-quote.webp 366w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-free-quote-183x300.webp 183w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Don\u2019t sleep on the value of a free quote.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Besides attracting new potential customers, you\u2019ll also create a cost barrier that makes it more likely people choose to work for you. Once they have your quote, they\u2019ll be less likely to pay another business for theirs.<\/p>\n<div id=\"cool-giveaway-ideas\"><\/div>\n<h2>Cool giveaway ideas<\/h2>\n<p>Here are several fun giveaway ideas your customers and followers will love (and you\u2019ll love to run).<\/p>\n<h3>23. Quiz\/trivia<\/h3>\n<p>Ask your customers to answer a question about your business or industry. Tie it to your unique selling proposition so as people search for the answer, they learn what makes you different.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example. Say your long history and wide range of services set you apart. Ask people to reply to a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-run-a-facebook-giveaway-or-contest\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook<\/a> post with the year your company was founded and the number of services you offer. Then, pick one winner out of the replies and give them a nice giveaway.<\/p>\n<h3>24. Choose your own gift<\/h3>\n<p>I used to love it when my mom handed me a little cash and told me to pick out one toy I could take home. I had a blast prowling the isles for my special treat.<\/p>\n<p>Give your audience that same thrill by letting them pick their prize from a list of options.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-choose.webp\" alt=\"Giveaway ideas - Choose your own give giveaway on Instagram.\" width=\"405\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81185 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-choose.webp 405w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-choose-203x300.webp 203w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Let customers pick their prize for an extra exciting giveaway.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Ideally, the prize list will be a curated selection of things you sell. But it could also be from a list of your favorite seasonal products or any other themed group of items.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333; font-size: 22px;\">25. Scavenger hunt<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>This one is a lot of fun. Create a list of little details from your website pages (or on multiple pages if it\u2019s a co-sponsored event). People who register get questions to answer, each requiring them to visit different pages. Then pick a winner from all of the completed entries.<\/p>\n<p>These are best done over a short time period to limit answer sharing. So, make sure to create a lot of hype before the event so you have as many people playing as possible.<\/p>\n<h3>26. Photo or video contest<\/h3>\n<p>Here\u2019s a twist on a UGC giveaway. Instead of simply collecting tagged images, offer a prize for the best one(s)!<\/p>\n<p>By making it a contest, you\u2019ll encourage people to send in their absolute best pics and videos. Plus, you\u2019ll get a double dose of engagement when everyone checks back in to see who won.<\/p>\n<h3>27. Nominate a hero<\/h3>\n<p>People love to work with businesses that give back. This giveaway lets your audience spotlight their local heroes while you get to give back to people making a difference.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-hero.webp\" alt=\"Giveaway ideas - Nominate a hero giveaway.\" width=\"397\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81187 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-hero.webp 397w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-hero-199x300.webp 199w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The hero nomination giveaway requires more work, but it pays off in many ways.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>To run a giveaway like this, ask your followers to nominate someone they believe is a true hero and explain why. Then pick one (or more) to receive the prize and promote the event. If possible, get a video of the hero accepting their prize. You could also create a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/great-landing-pages\">landing page<\/a> listing all the nominated heroes.<\/p>\n<div id=\"unique-giveaway-ideas\"><\/div>\n<h2>Unique giveaway ideas<\/h2>\n<p>One of the defining characteristics of a great giveaway is that it stands out against all the other messages and ads people are exposed to. These interesting and unique giveaway ideas grab attention, even in a crowded space.<\/p>\n<h3>28. Gamified giveaway<\/h3>\n<p>A gamified giveaway adds gameplay elements to your offer. If you\u2019ve ever spun a wheel to get a freebie or discount, you\u2019ve seen a gamified giveaway.<\/p>\n<p>Spinning the wheel is one of many ways to add engagement-boosting gameplay to your giveaways.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-microsoft.webp\" alt=\"Giveaway ideas - Scratch to win giveaway from Microsoft.\" width=\"610\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81188 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-microsoft.webp 610w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-microsoft-480x472.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 610px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Digital \u201cscratch-off\u201d tickets add a fun element to a standard sweepstakes giveaway.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Try creating digital scratch-off tickets that give customers points for making a purchase that they can spend on future products. Anything that ups the ante by asking people to play in order to win instead of simply getting a freebie is worth consideration.<\/p>\n<h3>29. Caption this photo<\/h3>\n<p>A photo caption giveaway is great for a quick engagement boost. Post a picture on your social media platform of choice and ask your followers to write a caption for it. You pick the most creative caption and send a prize to the winner.<\/p>\n<p>The game is fun, so you can expect decent participation, even with minimal prizes. Just closely moderate the replies so you don\u2019t accidentally post a caption that isn\u2019t safe for work.<\/p>\n<h3>30. Brand ambassadorship giveaway<\/h3>\n<p>Instead of just partnering with a brand ambassador, create a contest where people can win a chance to become one.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-influencer.webp\" alt=\"Giveaway ideas - rules for the BARK Ranger ambassador giveaway.\" width=\"616\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81195 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-influencer.webp 616w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/giveaway-ideas-wordstream-influencer-480x468.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 616px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Who wouldn\u2019t want to be a B.A.R.K Ranger?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Make this as big or as small as you want. You can give away a little gift to everyone who completes a task to become an ambassador. Or sponsor a huge contest where the winner spends a year using what you sell and gets paid (in products or cash) to share their experience with the world.<\/p>\n<h3>31. Do a good deed giveaway<\/h3>\n<p>This is a play on the pay-it-forward theme. Ask your followers to do something kind for a stranger (or maybe volunteer for a non-profit), document what they\u2019ve done, and submit it for a chance to win a gift for themselves. Double the impact by offering a second gift people can give to a loved one.<\/p>\n<p>This type of giveaway drums up lots of good feelings while also doing something positive for the world.<\/p>\n<h2>The best giveaway idea is up to you<\/h2>\n<p>There is no one perfect <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/giveaway-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">giveaway idea<\/a>. What works best will be the one that matches your brand, achieves your goals, and you actually enjoy running.<\/p>\n<p>Remember to be extremely clear on the rules and follow through on your promise. Missed expectations can turn a great giveaway into a public relations hassle.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a recap of the best giveaway ideas:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sweepstakes<\/li>\n<li>Customer loyalty
