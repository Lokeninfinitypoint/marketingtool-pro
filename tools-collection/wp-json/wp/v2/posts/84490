Several small, independent websites and institutional organizations lost half or more of their organic traffic overnight.<\/p>\n<p>Since the September shakeup, I\u2019ve seen the best marketers use a two-pronged strategy. First, they diversified their traffic sources and found new channels for non-paid website visits\u2014a plan I believe is a long time coming.<\/p>\n<p>Second, they trialed ways to work within the HCU\u2019s new (and murky) rules to get their traffic back on track. That\u2019s an essential step because, as much as Google frustrates me, it\u2019s still the best source of evergreen, non-paid traffic by a big margin.<\/p>\n<p>A group of marketers have already told us <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-marketing-pros-drive-traffic\">how they diversify their traffic sources<\/a>. So, I asked several experienced SEOs and content marketers what tactics they\u2019ve used to get content to rank since September.<\/p>\n<p>They came back with six ideas that helped regain search page spots and recover organic traffic in the new Google world order. What I love best about this list is that every option is accessible to most marketers.

Publish, review, iterate, and repeat<\/h2>\n<ol><\/ol>\n<p>In the before times, what worked for one post on a blog often worked for every post. Once you found the formula that pushed your content to the top five of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/serp\">search engine results page<\/a>, you could apply that treatment to every post and expect most of them to perform well.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/sydney-myers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sydney Myers<\/a>, Content Marketing Manager at <a href=\"http:\/\/jobscan.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jobscan<\/a>, says repeatability is gone. \u201cI&#8217;ve accepted that rankings are unpredictable and sometimes even volatile,\u201d she said. \u201cWe could spend a month trying to create the perfect page and think it&#8217;s great, but we don&#8217;t really know how Google will rank it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Instead of trying to publish the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/09\/how-to-write-a-blog-post\">perfect post<\/a> upfront, she takes a ship-it-and-iterate approach. \u201cI&#8217;ve put more emphasis on weekly performance checks and tweaks. Once a page is published, we check on it every week to see how it&#8217;s performing,\u201d she explains. \u201cIf it doesn&#8217;t do as well as we hoped, we make adjustments.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>How it works<\/h3>\n<p>Sydney\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/2024-seo-strategies\">SEO strategy<\/a> is executed similarly to how most software is delivered. You produce the best version possible by a set deadline, look for bugs in real time, and update it until it does what you want it to do.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe writers create the best page they can with the time they&#8217;re given\u2014anywhere from a couple of days to one week,\u201d Sydney explained. \u201cWe meet each week to review recently published content. If it&#8217;s performing as expected, we move on. If it&#8217;s not, we look at what&#8217;s ranking above it and see what tweaks we can make to improve the page.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sydney said they repeat the process until they\u2019re happy. \u201cWe might make adjustments to a page for a month before it gets up to where we need.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The menu of items Sydney\u2019s team tries on each post will be familiar to most SEO-focused content creators. \u201cThese tweaks might be adding a new section to a blog post, rearranging the content on a page, or adding images,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes it&#8217;s things as small as changing the <a href=\"https:\/\/gannett-my.sharepoint.com\/:w:\/r\/personal\/ahoward_gannett_com\/Documents\/Aug%206th.docx?d=w74a63ac6878b4a64842c5ced46f1c3dd&amp;csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=0E8t0z\">title<\/a>, rewording headings, or updating the meta description.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>The results<\/h3>\n<p>The brilliance of this approach is that you\u2019re letting the algorithm tell you what it takes to get each post to rank. \u201cWe just keep trying things to see what Google responds to. Rather than trying to predict this as we&#8217;re writing the article, we let Google tell us what works and what doesn&#8217;t,\u201d Sydney told me.<\/p>\n<p>A recent example illustrates how powerful this could be. \u201cWe had a product page that we really felt could rank number one for the target keyword,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was top five, but we felt it could have been better. We reviewed that page every week for months, making tweaks to images, titles, internal links, and more. Finally, we got it to rank #1. It was a big win for us.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>The takeaway<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/06\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google\">Bumping your pages up the SERP<\/a>, even a few spots, can make your monthly reporting much more pleasant.<a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/google-ctr-stats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Backlinko recently showed<\/a> that the top spot got more than double the click-through compared to the #2 and #3 positions.<\/p>\n<p>You may not be able to use this tactic on everything you publish. But it\u2019ll be a game changer for your most valuable content\u2014the stuff that drives tons of qualified traffic or converts like crazy.

Prune decaying content<\/h2>\n<p>There are billions of websites in the world. Google doesn\u2019t have the capacity to constantly review\u2014or crawl\u2014every page of every site (that limitation is called a \u201ccrawl budget\u201d). <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/samy-ben-sadok-senior-seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Samy Ben Sadok<\/a>, Brand Ambassador &amp; Product Advisor for <a href=\"https:\/\/sitechecker.pro\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sitechecker<\/a>, said it\u2019s important to remember that limitation while tending your blog.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cInstead of focusing on new content only, prune your old content,\u201d Samy said. \u201cSearch engines like Google hate wasting their crawl budget on irrelevant content. You want to offer only your best content so it\u2019s sure to get indexed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Samy described content pruning as \u201cremoving or updating your lowest-performing content.\u201d The idea is similar to pruning a garden. You remove the dying branches to divert resources to the healthy ones.<\/p>\n<h3>How it works<\/h3>\n<p>The first step is to find the pages that need pruning. Samy said he considers four types of content for the process:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Previous performers:<\/strong> Pages that have previously performed well but are now under-performing.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Near winners:<\/strong> Pages ranking for keywords in positions 6-10 and 11-20 that haven\u2019t been updated in a while (quick wins!).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Decaying content:<\/strong> Pages that have been dropping in clicks consistently.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Poor performers:<\/strong> Pages with zero or close to zero clicks (don\u2019t include fresh content you\u2019ve recently published).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The previous performers and near winners are candidates for updates. Here are Samy\u2019s favorite ways to add value while updating one of those posts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add expert quotes, specific examples, and data.<\/li>\n<li>Front-load key information at the top of the article.<\/li>\n<li>Re-align the content with the search intent.<\/li>\n<li>Remove any fluff (especially AI fluff, if any).<\/li>\n<li>Make the content more engaging.<\/li>\n<li>Add high-quality (but lightweight) images and videos.<\/li>\n<li>Update the meta by adding target keywords.<\/li>\n<li>Link to high-authority sites in the niche.<\/li>\n<li>Improve internal linking with your other pieces.<\/li>\n<li>Identify real-life FAQs on Reddit and answer them in your content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Samy added that you might also be able to update decaying content if it&#8217;s missing some of the above. Or you could merge it with another post.<\/p>\n<p>But for poor performers and decaying content that can\u2019t be brought back to speed, he says it\u2019s time to cut your losses and remove them from your blog.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut before removing, be sure to cross-reference those pages with a tool like Ahrefs or Semrush for any rankings or backlinks,\u201d he said. Then, \u201cadd a permanent redirect to a topically similar page. If no similar pages are available but you want to retain authority, redirect to your blog for your articles and to the homepage for any other pages.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That way, you don\u2019t lose the search equity those pages have accrued, and people won\u2019t land on a dead page if they click an old link.<\/p>\n<h3>The results<\/h3>\n<p>Removing content can have as much impact as publishing new posts. \u201cA client had an eight-year-old ecommerce site that was never pruned,\u201d Samy recalled. \u201cThere were 424 articles, and 60% of them weren\u2019t bringing any clicks. I deleted around 200 articles, merged 14 together, and used the opportunity to update articles we kept to improve E-E-A-T signals.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This year-over-year comparison shows that clicks jumped by 22% and impressions climbed by 20%, all without publishing any new content.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/SEO-tactics-wordstream-pruning.webp\" alt=\"SEO tactics - Screenshot from Google Search Console.\" width=\"824\" height=\"358\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84492 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/SEO-tactics-wordstream-pruning.webp 824w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/SEO-tactics-wordstream-pruning-480x209.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 824px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>The takeaway<\/h3>\n<p>This is such a clever way to claw back lost organic traffic.

Gather high-quality backlinks<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve known that backlinks influence ranking for years.

His experience shows a direct correlation between getting high-quality links and a bump in page ranks. He shared a few cool techniques he uses to get those influential backlinks.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>How it works<\/h3>\n<p>Sam\u2019s approach includes three sources for backlinks that Google will love:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Leverage partners:<\/strong> \u201cReach out to partners who go after the same ICP [ideal customer profile] but aren&#8217;t direct competitors. Offer to create a solid article for their site in return for a link back to a focus page and keyword you want to rank for.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Leverage past media:<\/strong> \u201cHas your exec team been featured in press, PR, articles, etc., in the past? Ask [those outlets] to add a link to one of your focus pages or amend the current link to a higher-value page (if relevant).\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Guest podcast: <\/strong>\u201cUse a site called <a href=\"https:\/\/chartable.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chartable<\/a> to find niche, relevant shows. Then, pitch the hosts to be a guest. I recommend sending a short message or video on LinkedIn for your pitch.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These are all great, but I really like the second one. It\u2019s such a low-lift way to get extra mileage from your business&#8217;s already-existing exposure. Try a quick Google search for the high-profile people in your organization, and voila! Ready-made backlink opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>As for podcast links, Sam shared a bonus tip if you, or people on your team, have been featured on several shows. \u201cGo to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.listennotes.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Listen Notes website<\/a>. Search for your name. Then reach out to the hosts to see if any of them have relevant articles from those appearances you can get a link back from,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<h3>Results<\/h3>\n<p>Sam said he\u2019s used the podcast guest strategy to help rank #1 for \u201cb2b seo agency\u201d and \u201cb2b saas seo agency\u201d within three months on a fresh domain. You&#8217;re doing something right if you can beat <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/local-seo-in-2024\">SEO<\/a> agencies for high-value <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/popular-keywords\/seo-keywords\">SEO keywords<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h3>Takeaway<\/h3>\n<p>Backlinks are a boon and a bane for most SEOs. We know we need them, and we think paying for them isn\u2019t great, but it can be a full-time job to get free ones. Plus, we now have corroborating evidence that low-quality links may push us back down the search engine results pages (SERPs).<\/p>\n<p>Sam\u2019s tactics make it easier to get backlinks that Google will rate highly, and that could generate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/11\/29\/referral-traffic\">referral traffic<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"link-important-pages-strategically\"><\/div>\n<h2>4.

In shorthand, getting more clicks on a page will help you rank higher on Google.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/saif-zia-b882b37b\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Saif Zia<\/a>, Search Engine Optimization Team Lead,\u00a0hacks Navboost with a strategic form of contextual interlinking between his highest-performing and most important pages.<\/p>\n<h3>How it works<\/h3>\n<p>With Navboost, clicks act sort of like votes, and it doesn\u2019t matter where those clicks come from (as long as visitors don\u2019t jump off the page immediately). Saif boosts his most important pages by linking to them from his highest-performing content.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI start by gathering data from GSC [<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/16\/how-to-use-google-search-console\">Google Search Console<\/a>] about top-performing pages, extracting them, and utilizing them internally by linking to the home page and relevant pages,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/SEO-tactics-wordstream-strategic-linking.webp\" alt=\"SEO tactics - Screenshot from Google Search Console.\" width=\"799\" height=\"290\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84494 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/SEO-tactics-wordstream-strategic-linking.webp 799w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/SEO-tactics-wordstream-strategic-linking-480x174.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 799px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Here\u2019s what a blog post performance chart looks like on Google Search Console.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The idea is pretty simple. If you have a handful of very popular blog posts, you can funnel some of that traffic to the most important pages on your site with<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/04\/internal-linking\"> internal links<\/a>. Google notes the jump in engagement, and your high-converting pages climb up the SERPs.<\/p>\n<p>Saif emphasized the need for the links to make sense. They should only be added when the target and root pages have a similar context (the \u201ccontextual\u201d part). Your<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/anchor-text\"> anchor text<\/a> also needs to describe the content it\u2019s linking to. Otherwise, people won\u2019t stick around on the linked page very long. That\u2019ll<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/seo-issues\"> hurt your SEO<\/a> since Google also considers low-quality clicks negatively in its ranking regimen.<\/p>\n<p>Saif also said it\u2019s important to clear clutter and generate more link clicks through external channels. \u201cI remove all the irrelevant content from my websites. And whatever I publish on my website, I make sure to post it on social media with a summary.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>The results<\/h3>\n<p>Before his strategic interlinking project, about 10% of Saif\u2019s published pages ranked. Now, that number is around 50%. That\u2019s a massive bump in search visibility that he said helped him increase overall traffic by 15%.<\/p>\n<h3>The takeaway<\/h3>\n<p>What I love about Saif\u2019s strategy is that it\u2019s so easy to do. Most of us can find our highest trafficked posts, and we know which pages would have the biggest effect on leads and conversions if they could just rank a little higher. Then it\u2019s just a matter of dropping contextual links in. You can create a target and root page list, then drop in a dozen links a day when your brain is too tired to write.<\/p>\n<div id=\"prioritize-authority-over-keyword-density\"><\/div>\n<h2>5. Prioritize authority over keyword density<\/h2>\n<p>You can roughly describe Google\u2019s algorithmic evolution in two eras. In the early days, it sought out the most relevant content\u2014often relying on exact keyword matching to do it. In the second era, Google added filters to find the highest-quality content among the relevant results (which the recent Helpful Content Updates are tasked with doing).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/farah-ahmed-0b11691b6\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Farah Ahmed<\/a>, Content Marketing Strategist for <a href=\"http:\/\/zilliondesigns.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ZillionDesigns<\/a>, told me they\u2019ve made a big strategy shift to meet the changing priorities of Google\u2019s algorithm. \u201cOne of the biggest changes we have made in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/05\/seo-strategy\">SEO tactics<\/a> since the core update is to focus less on keyword density and more on authoritative content.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Authority is one of Google\u2019s core quality tenets, as described by its fun little <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/14\/google-e-e-a-t\">E-E-A-T<\/a> acronym (the \u201cA\u201d stands for authority). It\u2019s a really good place to start upping your blog\u2019s quality in the eyes of Google.<\/p>\n<h3>How it works<\/h3>\n<p>Farah\u2019s strategy is to build <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/topical-authority\">topical authority<\/a> on the blog and increase the authority of each post they publish.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe run a thorough <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/10\/content-audit\">content audit<\/a> to understand the gaps in the existing system,\u201d She explained. \u201cThen, we use tools like Semrush and Ahrefs to identify a handful of keywords around a subject or topic that needs to be covered.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/SEO-tactics-wordstream-content-audit-1.webp\" alt=\"SEO tactics - WordStream content audit.\" width=\"808\" height=\"276\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84496 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/SEO-tactics-wordstream-content-audit-1.webp 808w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/SEO-tactics-wordstream-content-audit-1-480x164.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 808px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>By way of example, here\u2019s a screenshot from a <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/10\/content-audit\"><em>content audit template<\/em><\/a><em> we created.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If you want to get in the weeds of finding topical gaps in your content, this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/01\/competitor-keyword-analysis\">guide to competitor keyword analysis<\/a> will help.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe identify a few high-volume and less difficult keywords and integrate them into H2s and H3s only,\u201d Farah continued. \u201cThe focus is on creating valuable content that can be linked back from other authoritative websites and generate more traffic.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Notice that the goal isn\u2019t to create one piece of content around one <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">keyword<\/a>. It\u2019s to think subject-first and publish several pieces that cover different aspects of that subject. Then, interlink them so it\u2019s easier for Google to see their connection.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 Our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a> will help you find the relevant search terms you need.<\/p>\n<h3>The results<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cSo far, we have seen great results with almost 30% to 40% of the website traffic being generated from our blog,\u201d Farah said.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s why that\u2019s significant. ZillionDesigns is a crowdsourcing graphic design platform, so its website gets a lot of direct traffic from users starting that process. For any marketing channel to nearly equal its direct traffic (especially without paid ads) is a huge win.<\/p>\n<h3>The takeaway<\/h3>\n<p>Farah\u2019s example reinforces the need to think bigger than one blog post at a time. Google considers the entire website, not just a single post when it weighs authority (see the section about domain authority in<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-algorithm-documents-leak\"> this article<\/a>). Make it easier for web crawlers to know that you\u2019re not a one-hit topical wonder, and you\u2019ll start driving search traffic as Farah does.<\/p>\n<div id=\"restore-visibility-and-improve-ux\"><\/div>\n<h2>6. Restore visibility and improve UX<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/alehbarysevich\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Aleh Barysevich<\/a> is the founder of the companies behind SEO PowerSuite (professional SEO software) and Awario (a social media monitoring app). When I asked him what\u2019s helped his organic traffic post-HCU, he said that,\u00a0first and foremost, he makes sure Google has indexed his content.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne effective SEO tactic we&#8217;ve used after the recent Google updates involves addressing content visibility issues,\u201d Aleh said. \u201cFirst, check if Googe is indexing your content. Then, ensure all the text is being indexed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He also said they got a surprising boost by beefing up their posts\u2019 UX a bit. \u201cAnother helpful hack we applied was using numbered lists across blog posts.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>How it works<\/h3>\n<p>Aleh said the easiest way to see if a piece of content is indexed is to search for a sentence from it on Google. You can also plug the URL into Google Search Console.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/SEO-tactics-wordstream-GSC-crawl.webp\" alt=\"SEO tactics - GSC screenshot of page indexing\" width=\"797\" height=\"288\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84497 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/SEO-tactics-wordstream-GSC-crawl.webp 797w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/SEO-tactics-wordstream-GSC-crawl-480x173.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 797px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If some blog posts aren\u2019t indexed or getting the visibility they should, it may be their length. \u201cWe&#8217;ve found that some pages with over 10K words have been hit, and reducing the content size helped restore their visibility,\u201d Aleh added.<\/p>\n<p>As for the UX tweak, that\u2019s an easy one, too. Aleh said they added numbered lists that function like a table of contents, like from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.link-assistant.com\/news\/top-search-engines.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this blog post<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/SEO-tactics-wordstream-jumplinks.webp\" alt=\"SEO tactics - Screenshot from a numbered list.\" width=\"318\" height=\"570\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84498 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/SEO-tactics-wordstream-jumplinks.webp 318w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/SEO-tactics-wordstream-jumplinks-167x300.webp 167w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.link-assistant.com\/news\/top-search-engines.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The list uses<a href=\"https:\/\/university-communications.ncsu.edu\/documentation\/reference-article\/jump-links\/#:~:text=Jump%20links%2C%20or%20anchor%20links,specific%20part%20of%20the%20page.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> jump links<\/a> to guide readers to different parts of a long article and gives search crawlers clear information about the post&#8217;s content.<\/p>\n<p>We use jump links in most of our blog posts as well. It\u2019s important to use descriptive anchor text (it\u2019s usually the same as the H2s or H3s). We also use the full H2 or H3 text in the ID attribute (the bit of HTML code that connects the jump link to the section it\u2019s jumping to).<\/p>\n<h3>The result<\/h3>\n<p>Aleh said they could get more posts indexed and on the hunt for SERP placement by shortening long posts that weren&#8217;t indexed.<\/p>\n<p>As for the UX improvement, Aleh said, \u201cAdding such lists helped our content appear in new featured snippets in Google, resulting in a 25% increase in organic impressions and clicks.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d take a 25% traffic bump for an easy update any day.<\/p>\n<h3>The takeaway<\/h3>\n<p>Both of Aleh\u2019s tactics make a lot of sense. If Google hasn\u2019t indexed your content, how can you expect to rank and get traffic? Since SEO experts have called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amsive.com\/insights\/seo\/googles-helpful-content-update-ranking-system-what-happened-and-what-changed-in-2024\/#:~:text=The%20update%20%E2%80%9Cinvolves%20changes%20to,incorporated%20into%20Google%27s%20core%20ranking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">user experience<\/a> a key focus of recent Google updates, it\u2019s unsurprising that jump links\u2014which make content easier to skim\u2014would help. I\u2019d jump on these two tactics right away.<\/p>\n<h2>Making the most of Google\u2019s mayhem<\/h2>\n<p>Don&#8217;t lose heart if you lost traffic after Google\u2019s helpful content update. You\u2019re not alone, and there is hope for recovery (plus, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/seo-evolution-in-2024\">SEO continues to evolve<\/a>. In addition to these six examples, I\u2019ve seen several successful experiments documented on X and LinkedIn.<\/p>\n<p>How do you move forward? Start by testing the easiest tactics first and avoiding the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/outdated-seo-tactics\">out-of-date SEO tactics<\/a>. Add jump links and strategic internal links to a bunch of high-value posts. Prune decaying content and try iterating on a few underperforming new posts weekly until they rank.<\/p>\n<p>And stay tuned here.
