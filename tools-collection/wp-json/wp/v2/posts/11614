Most businesses know that this requires optimizing their website and Google Ads, but what most don\u2019t know is that there is a third entity that also needs optimizing: their Google business listing. Officially known as your Business Profile, this powerful listing is a dynamic snapshot of your business that highlights your best features and enables potential customers to quickly find, learn about, and engage with you\u2014all from the SERP. The best part? It\u2019s completely free.<\/span><em><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">And yet, despite the <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/google-now-handles-2-999-trillion-searches-per-year-250247\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">167 billion<\/a> searches performed on Google each month, a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/research\/google-my-business-insights-study\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> BrightLocal<\/a> study showed that the typical Business Profile only averages 1,260 views during that same period (that\u2019s 0.00000075%!). Even worse, only 59 actions are taken from those 1,260 views. That\u2019s less than 5%.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The problem is not the Google Business platform; it\u2019s that not nearly enough businesses take full advantage of its impressive features.

Create a Google Business account<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">First and foremost, it\u2019s important to note here that a Google Business Profile\u00a0is a separate entity from a Google My Business account. The latter is used to gain access to and optimize the former. Which means that in order to make the optimizations laid out in this guide, you need to have a Google My Business account and then tell Google to connect it with your Google Business Profile. To create an account, head to Google.com\/business and sign in with the regular Google\/Gmail account you use for your business (as opposed to your personal Gmail, if you have one).<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-my-business-optimization-sign-up.png\" alt=\"google my business optimization account signup page\" width=\"800\" height=\"458\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">2. Complete every section<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The completeness of your Google Business Profile not only helps Google to rank you higher in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/12\/13\/local-search-marketing\">local search results<\/a>, but it also increases the number of actions customers take when they find your profile. There\u2019s a lot of information to provide, so here are some guidelines for prioritizing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">These aspects of your profile should be completed right away:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Name<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Address<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Phone<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Website<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Hours<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">These sections take a bit more time and thought:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Category and Attributes\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Products and services<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">From the business<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Questions and answers (Owner-generated queries)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">These sections are ongoing:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Posts<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Reviews<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Questions and answers (Consumer-generated)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-my-business-optimization-account-sections.png\" alt=\"all sections in google my business account dashboard for google my business optimization\" width=\"777\" height=\"407\" \/><\/div>\n<div>\n<p>\ud83c\udf89 <strong>Need help articulating what makes your business special?<\/strong> Get the guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLValuePropositionGuide.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_ValuePropositionGuide_Download\">How to Create a Unique Value Proposition From the Ground Up<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">3. Be meticulous with contact information <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Here are the steps for optimizing the contact information in your Google Business Profile:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Make sure your business name is identical to the one you use on your store signage.<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> In other words, exactly as it appears in the real world. Adding location name (unless it\u2019s in your brand name) or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">keywords<\/a> is considered spam by Google and you could be penalized. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Make sure that both your business name and address exactly match your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/listings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">other listings<\/a> across the web. <\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">This means using \u201cst\u201d vs \u201cstreet\u201d or \u201cco\u201d vs \u201ccompany\u201d consistently. Google\u2019s algorithm takes these inconsistencies into account when assessing your credibility.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Indicate both your regular and holiday hours.<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> This encourages customers to visit you, and also avoids the potential of a negative review left by someone who took the trip out to your store only to find it was closed. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">4. Write your \u201cfrom the business\u201d description<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The first thing to note is that the brief description that appears just below your business name in your Business Profile is not actually in your control. This is the editorial summary that Google writes to ensure consistency across the platform.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-my-business-optimization-editorial-description.png\" alt=\"google my business optimization editorial description in listing\" width=\"508\" height=\"840\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">This description is not in your control.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Bummer, I know. But the good news is that Google does a pretty good job at coming up with descriptions.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-my-business-optimization-editorial-description-buckalews.png\" alt=\"google my business optimization editorial description for buckalews\" width=\"600\" height=\"729\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The description you do have control over is the \u201cfrom the business\u201d section in your Google My Business account dashboard. This section appears lower in your profile, often under the reviews section.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google20my20business20optimization20from20the20business20susan_mathason.jpg\" alt=\"google my business optimization from the business susan mathason\" width=\"622\" height=\"1068\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">To optimize the \u201cfrom the business\u201d section of your Google Business Profile:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Use all 750 characters, with key information in the first 250 characters.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Repurpose content from your &#8220;About Us&#8221; page or <a href=\"www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/12\/07\/company-mission-statements\">mission statement<\/a>.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Use keywords your audience uses to find businesses like yours.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Don\u2019t repeat any information already visible in the other sections of your profile. Use this space to talk about what sets you apart from competitors and what customers like most about your business.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Don\u2019t include links or HTML.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">5. Choose a category<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Choosing a category is a must for optimizing your Google Business Profile. Here\u2019s why:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Get found in discovery searches<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">. A whopping <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/research\/google-my-business-insights-study\/\">84%<\/a> of Business\u00a0Profile views on Google originate from discovery searches (meaning the consumer searched for a product, service, or categorical term and that business\u2019s profile appeared), versus only 16% coming from direct searches (the consumer typed in the business name or address). This is especially true for businesses whose name doesn\u2019t indicate their service (e.g., Fresh Express or Amelia\u2019s Catering). <\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Highlight category-specific features<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">. Once you choose a category, Google makes available to you category-specific features that make your profile more attractive and effective. For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/14\/restaurant-marketing\">restaurants<\/a> can include a menu or reservation button; hotel profiles\u00a0will pull in star ratings; hair salons can confirm that they have experience with thin or curly hair.\u00a0These details can help consumers choose you over competitors.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-my-business-optimization-category-profile.png\" alt=\"google my business optimization category at top of listing\" width=\"600\" height=\"498\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">Your category appears in the top portion of your Google Business Profile.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Google offers a set number of categories, so it\u2019s important to choose the correct ones. Here\u2019s how to optimize your Google Business Profile\u00a0using categories:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Be specific.<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> If you\u2019re a nail salon, choose \u201cNail Salon\u201d and not just \u201cSalon.\u201d If you\u2019re a restaurant, choose \u201cEgyptian Restaurant,\u201d \u201cAmerican Restaurant,\u201d etc., rather than simply \u201cRestaurant.\u201d A drop-down list of categories will appear once you start typing, but you can also see a full list of GMB categories <a href=\"https:\/\/pixelcutlabs.com\/blog\/google-my-business-categories\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a> to ensure you find the most specific one for your business (there are over 3,000 categories so it\u2019s worth the look).<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Choose secondary categories.<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> Many businesses fall into multiple categories. Set your primary category to your chief offering (for example, \u201c<a>Grocery Store<\/a>\u201d) and then choose additional categories that apply, such as \u201cGrocery Delivery Service\u201d or \u201cGourmet Grocery Store.\u201d <\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Don\u2019t overdo it.<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> You want Google to connect you with consumers who need your service, so choose only categories that match your offering. For example, if you\u2019re an appliance repair business, select \u201cAppliance Repair\u201d only, not \u201cAppliance Parts Supplier.\u201d Technically you do supply service parts, but this is not a standalone offering of your business. (Pro tip: Don\u2019t confuse categories with products or attributes, which are separate sections.)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-my-business-optimization-explore-categories.png\" alt=\"google my business optimization explore categories section of listing\" width=\"600\" height=\"1172\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Also, keep in mind that Google might ask you to verify your business if you edit your category list or add multiple. This is just to ensure accuracy across their platform.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">6. Select applicable attributes<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As we just mentioned, once you choose a category, Google will give you a list of attributes you can check off to further describe your business. Attributes are special features that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/04\/nurture-marketing\">potential customers <\/a>seek out, like \u201cgift shop on-site\u201d or \u201cfree wi-fi.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google20my20business20optimization20attributes20nicks20pizza.png\" alt=\"google my business optimization attributes nicks pizza\" width=\"600\" height=\"328\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Attributes are not specific to the Google My Business platform (review sites like Yelp have them, too). But Google\u2019s attributes get really granular, like \u201cgood for working on laptop&#8221; or \u201cpopular for travelers\u201d. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.websites360.com\/blog\/google-my-business-attributes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Check out this attribute list<\/a> to see what I mean. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">7. Add photos<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Uploading photos to your Business Profile through your Google My Business account dashboard is important for three reasons:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Ensure quality.<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> Anyone can add photos to your Business Profile, which means you\u2019ll get a range of quality. By adding your own great photos, you can ensure your profile\u00a0looks its best.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Be active. <\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">Adding photos regularly signals to Google that you are active with your profile\u00a0and it is up-to-date, which positively impacts your ranking.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Get images in results.<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> Google is advancing in image recognition and starting to include photos in local results.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Increase engagement. <\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">According to <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/business\/answer\/6335804?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google<\/a>, customers are 42% more likely to request driving directions to a business if its Business Profile\u00a0has photos, and 35% more likely to click through to its website. Furthermore, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/research\/google-my-business-insights-study\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BrightLocal study<\/a> showed that businesses with more than 100 photos get 520% more calls, 2,717% more direction requests, and 1,065% more website clicks than the average business.

You can also see for yourself the impact of reviews on ranking.

Posts are created in your Google My Business dashboard and show up on the \u201cUpdates\u201d section toward the bottom of your Business Profile. However, they might become more prominent based on the search query.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-my-business-optimization-posts.png\" alt=\"google my business optimization posts in profile\" width=\"800\" height=\"546\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Here\u2019s how posts help you to optimize your Google Business Profile:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Posts increase the number of actions taken by consumers who find your profile. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Posting regularly sends positive ranking signals to Google in the same way that adding photos does. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Consumers have higher intent on search engines versus other posting platforms (i.e., Facebook and Instagram, where they are leisurely scrolling), so they are more likely to engage with your Google posts.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Consumers can follow your Business Profile and get notified of new posts and updates.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-my-business-optimization-posts-in-maps.png\" alt=\"google my business optimization posts appear in maps\" width=\"800\" height=\"580\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">Your Google My Business posts will even appear on Maps\u2014it&#8217;s free <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/21\/local-business-advertising\">advertising for your local business<\/a>!<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Here are your tips for optimizing your Google Business Profile\u00a0with posts:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Post regularly. Not just to send signals to Google, but also because certain post types expire every seven days.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Use event and offer posts for marketing campaigns that have a timeline. You can choose a date range and the posts will stay live for the duration of that timeline. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Include links and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/20\/call-to-action-buttons\">CTAs <\/a>in every post.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">As of writing this post, there is currently a COVID-19 post type, which we&#8217;d encourage you to use to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/21\/client-communication-during-covid-19\">effectively communicate with your audience during the pandemic<\/a>.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">10. Ask and answer questions<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Have you noticed on Amazon that in addition to the product description and customer reviews, there is a section for questions and answers? Google offers the same feature in Google Business Profiles. <\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-my-business-optimization-question-and-answer-section.png\" alt=\"google my business optimization question and answer section\" width=\"451\" height=\"841\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">Image courtesy of <\/span><\/em><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/google-my-business-qa-what-you-may-be-missing-299177\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>searchengineland.com<\/em><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Answers to these questions may be the impetus for a customer deciding to choose your business. However, this section is particularly important to optimize because not only can anyone ask a question on a business\u2019s Google profile but also <strong>anyone can answer<\/strong>. This can lead to inaccurate information on your profile, or even worse, something like the Q&amp;A on this\u00a0pizza restaurant\u2019s profile:<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google20my20business20optimization20bad20q26a20section.png\" alt=\"google my business optimization bad q&amp;a section\" width=\"500\" height=\"160\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">You can&#8217;t <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sterlingsky.ca\/turn-off-q-a-google-my-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">turn off the Q&amp;A feature of your Business Profile<\/a>, but there are ways to optimize it:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Set up alerts<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> so you can stay on top of questions and answers posted to your profile. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google20my20business20optimization20enable20Q26A20alerts.png\" alt=\"google my business optimization enable Q&amp;A alerts\" width=\"800\" height=\"334\" \/><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Seed your own Q&amp;A section.<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> Make a list of the most frequently asked questions your business gets. Then ask, answer, and upvote your answer on your own profile. This does not go against Google\u2019s terms and conditions. In fact, Google encourages it.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Keep keywords in mind.<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> Questions and answers that contain keywords can help improve your Business Profile&#8217;s ranking for that keyword. So keep your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blogs\/ws\/2010\/04\/14\/keyword-optimization\">keyword strategy<\/a> in mind when seeding your Q&amp;A section, but use them loosely and organically, and do not keyword stuff.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">By monitoring and seeding your Q&amp;A section, you can ensure accurate information, highlight your best features, and reduce common barriers to entry. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><strong>Note<\/strong>: Google has temporarily suppressed the Q&amp;A section of most Business Profiles\u00a0right now <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/23\/covid-19-business-trends\">in response to COVID-19<\/a>, so you may not see this option for yours\u00a0for a while.

Add products and services<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Adding products and services is especially helpful if your offerings are not made clear in your business name. Populating this section also adds content to your profile that can help it to rank for even more relevant searches.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">When adding products and services, include the name, description, and price (if applicable). The full description will show up once a searcher clicks on the product. Also, Google may link to your products from your category section.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-my-business-optimization-services-in-listing.png\" alt=\"google my business optimization products in listing\" width=\"800\" height=\"491\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">12.

Maintain your Business Profile with a solid Google My Business strategy<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As you can see, a Google Business Profile is not a one-and-done marketing task.

We can\u2019t ever know every specific ranking factor, but we do know their ultimate goal: to connect searchers to the best business for their needs through detailed, trusted information.
