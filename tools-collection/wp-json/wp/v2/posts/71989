Allow me to be the first to congratulate you. Writing may be one of the biggest boondoggles on the planet. It\u2019s fun, can be cathartic, and when done well\/correctly, it can pay some serious dividends for you, and for your business.<\/p>\n<p>How do I know? I\u2019ve <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/author\/gordon-donnelly\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">penned a few blog posts<\/a> in my day. Some of them get tens of thousands of reads each month (humblebrag). I say this not to toot my own horn, but to tell you that I am uniquely situated to give advice on how long your blog post should be.<\/p>\n<p>Want the quick answer? Like most things, <strong><em>it depends<\/em><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/it-depends-teresa-table-flip-meme.jpg\" alt=\"my face when I ask how long a blog post should be and someone says it depends - teresa housewives table flip meme\" width=\"617\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-71994\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/it-depends-teresa-table-flip-meme.jpg 617w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/it-depends-teresa-table-flip-meme-480x467.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 617px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I know. I hate that answer too. But it\u2019s true. Get a solid grasp on your use case, and combine it with the rules I\u2019m about to talk about, and I promise that by the end of this post, you\u2019ll have a pretty damn good idea how long your blog post should be.<\/p>\n<p>And because we&#8217;re is all about helping business owners succeed through smart digital marketing, we are going to frame this discussion through precisely that lens: the marketer or business owner who is leveraging blogging as part of a broader content marketing strategy to drive traffic, scale leads, and grow revenue.<\/p>\n<p>But hey, even if that\u2019s not you: I have a feeling you\u2019ll get some value out of this post anyway.<\/p>\n<h2>How long should a blog post be? What the data says<\/h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve spent some time combing through search results looking for the answer to this question, you&#8217;ve probably seen that the results are mixed. Here are some answers from the top results:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>1,500-2,000 words<\/li>\n<li>3,000+ words<\/li>\n<li>2,100-2,400 words<\/li>\n<li>300-600 words<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Basically, the <em>internet<\/em> says a good blog post is anywhere from 300-3,000+ words long. That&#8217;s not exactly a helpful range.<\/p>\n<p>To get a more data-supported range, we looked at our top 10 posts from the last year and from the last three years. We found <strong>our best-performing blog posts average 2,700-3,000 words<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a little more direct of an answer, but it doesn&#8217;t take into account many factors that should influence your blog post length. That&#8217;s where these rules come in&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>3 rules to determine how long <em>your<\/em> blog post should be<\/h2>\n<p>Here are my top three hard-and-fast rules to live by if you want to write a blog post that gives your business the shine and visibility it deserves.<\/p>\n<h3>Rule #1: When in doubt, make it long<\/h3>\n<p>You heard it here first: length is not everything. And we\u2019re going to talk precisely about <em>why <\/em>length is not everything in the sections to come. But as a general rule to live by, deep, long-form content is the content that readers like.<\/p>\n<p>Why? Because <em>generally speaking<\/em>, length equates to value. And\u2013highlight this next point as furiously as you can\u2013the thing search engines care about the absolute most is <strong>how much value, on average, readers are getting out of your blog post<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>So if, like marketing guru Seth Godin, you already have millions of readers subscribed to your short-form newsletter, or if you\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/09\/how-to-write-a-blog-post\">writing a blog post<\/a> with a goal of repurposing it on LinkedIn, by all means, keep it short and sweet.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/how-long-should-blog-post-be-seth-godin-example.jpg\" alt=\"example of short content from seth godin\" width=\"904\" height=\"594\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-71990\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/how-long-should-blog-post-be-seth-godin-example.jpg 904w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/how-long-should-blog-post-be-seth-godin-example-480x315.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 904px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But if you\u2019re writing a blog post with the intent of rocketing to the top of Google\u2019s search results, and driving thousands of free eyeballs to your website? Then you need to talk at length, and go deep, on your subject.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not talking about being wordy for the sake of writing a long blog post. I\u2019m talking about giving useful examples, giving a thorough explanation of concepts, and attacking your topic in a way that will leave readers thinking: <em>Damn, that was comprehensive AF<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve already written a bunch of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/23\/cornerstone-content-guide\">long-form content<\/a> for your website, I know what you\u2019re probably thinking: <em>Man, I haven\u2019t really written <strong>at length <\/strong>on enough of these topics. <\/em>That\u2019s okay. Because you already have the scaffolding of a great blog post. All you have to do is beef it up.<\/p>\n<p>If the person I\u2019m describing is you, here\u2019s a quick pro tip: any SEO software worth its weight in gold (think: Ahrefs, SEMrush, Moz) is going to have an audit tool that surfaces <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/what-is-thin-content-how-to-fix-it\/270583\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">thin content<\/a> for you. Thin content is just that: there are not enough words on the page to meet the requirements for true topical expertise.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/word-count-in-ahrefs.jpg\" alt=\"report in ahrefs that shows thin content--may need to be longer for an effective blog post\" width=\"936\" height=\"390\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-71991\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/word-count-in-ahrefs.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/word-count-in-ahrefs-480x200.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can use reports like these to discern where it\u2019s necessary to write more. Or, you can simply audit your existing content manually and give yourself an honest assessment: how often am I truly going deep on the topics my readers or customers care about?<\/p>\n<p><span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style=\"font-size:16px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;\"><div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\ud83d\udcd8 Free guide &gt;&gt; <\/span><a data-sheets-formula-bar-text-link=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download\" class=\"waffle-rich-text-link\" data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style=\"font-size:16px;color:#1155cc;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:underline;font-family:''Arial'';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;\" href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download\">25 Ways to Get More Traffic to Your Website<\/a><span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style=\"font-size:16px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;\"><\/div><\/div><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Rule #2: Above all, deliver value<\/h3>\n<p>This easily could have been our first rule, because it\u2019s probably the most important. But I think it\u2019s useful to talk about value through the lens of length, because length is really critical as a component of SEO-driven <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/12\/28\/content-marketing-advice\">content marketing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But guess what? As I said in the first section: <em>length is not everything. <\/em>And where length fails, you\u2019ll almost always find that it\u2019s because the piece did not deliver enough value.<\/p>\n<p>Let me explain: Google and Microsoft have hundreds of factors they look at every day when determining the order in which they rank content. We call these things <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/09\/google-ranking-factors\">ranking signals (or factors)<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/search-engine-optimization-seo-google-ranking-factors.png\" alt=\"search engine optimization - google ranking factors\" width=\"720\" height=\"659\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63399\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/search-engine-optimization-seo-google-ranking-factors.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/search-engine-optimization-seo-google-ranking-factors-480x439.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>See that big red slice of the pie? That\u2019s page engagement. When Google is assessing how valuable or not valuable your blog is to a user, it\u2019s primarily looking at how effective your blog is at getting the reader to engage.<\/p>\n<p>The critical metric to look at here? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/25\/dwell-time-seo\">Dwell time<\/a>. You can think about how long a user spends on your page, on average, as one of the strongest indicators of whether your blog post has delivered value.<\/p>\n<p>Dwell time is not going to show up in your Google Analytics reports. However, <strong>Average Session Duration<\/strong> is, and it is a great metric for keeping tabs on how long your readers are spending on your blog posts. Or, if you\u2019re using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/23\/google-analytics-4-vs-universal-analytics\">Google Analytics 4<\/a>, which we all will be soon, you can use <strong>Average Engagement Time<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Other engagement metrics, like <strong>Engaged Sessions<\/strong> (the number of sessions that lasted longer than 10 seconds, or had a conversion event, or had 2 or more screen or page views), and <strong>Engagement Rate <\/strong>(number of Engaged Sessions divided by total sessions) are also really strong proxies for traffic quality and are readily available to you in GA4.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/engaged-sessions-engagement-rate.jpg\" alt=\"GA4 report that shows engaged sessions and engagement rate to help determine how long a blog post should be\" width=\"883\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-71992 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/engaged-sessions-engagement-rate.jpg 883w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/engaged-sessions-engagement-rate-480x326.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 883px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>How do you increase dwell time? Well, it stands to reason that the higher your word count, the longer the reader <em>should <\/em>stay on the page. But what if your lengthy blog post isn\u2019t saying much of anything at all? Then you\u2019re going to have a difficult time outranking your competitor. Even if they wrote 500 words and you wrote 1,500.<\/p>\n<p>Consider how big of an impact images, videos, infographics, and other visual examples can make on how long you, personally, spend reading a blog post. Deep concepts will always increase dwell time, because they force readers to evaluate what you\u2019re writing about, and how to apply it to themselves. It\u2019s not all just window dressing.<\/p>\n<p>But if you can combine deep concepts with compelling visuals that lend context to the text and enhance the value your reader is getting out of the post? Then you\u2019re really cooking with gas.<\/p>\n<h3>Rule #3: Do your research<\/h3>\n<p>Man, it\u2019s quite possible that not one of these rules is more important than another! Because you can\u2019t really live by the first two rules without taking rule #3 into account.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s go back to what I said in the introduction about context<em>. <\/em>About knowing your situation, your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/niche-markets\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">niche<\/a>, your competition, and above all, what you\u2019re trying to accomplish with your blog post.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/directiveconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/2020_State_of_Search_Marketing_Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">78%<\/a> of marketers identify keyword research as a high-impact practice for driving new traffic.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/google-ranking-factors-impact-of-keyword-research-on-traffic.png\" alt=\"google ranking factors - impact of keyword research on driving new traffic\" width=\"720\" height=\"438\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63676\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/google-ranking-factors-impact-of-keyword-research-on-traffic.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/google-ranking-factors-impact-of-keyword-research-on-traffic-480x292.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But the purpose behind keyword research goes beyond simply optimizing your H1s and H2s. If you want to know exactly how long to make your blog post, <strong>look no further than the keyword you\u2019re trying to rank for<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at an example. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a roofing company. You\u2019ve been running search ads targeting prospects who are looking for roofing services, but you want to start driving organic traffic from people who are more in the \u201cconsideration\u201d phase of the buying process.<\/p>\n<p>You use your favorite <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords\">keyword research tool<\/a>, and find that the keyword \u201chow to install metal roofing over shingles\u201d has some nice search volume. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-intent\">intent<\/a> is exactly what you\u2019re looking for: this person is probably considering the DIY route, but with some education, which your blog post will provide, you can convince them that metal roofing is a job best left to professionals (i.e. you).<\/p>\n<p>How long should your blog post be? Well, you can simply enter the query into Google, copy and paste the text from the top three ranking blog posts into a <a href=\"https:\/\/wordcounter.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">word counter<\/a>, average them out, and write a post that exceeds that number. Or\u00a0you can use your favorite SEO tool (I\u2019m a fan of Ahrefs) to get all this information at a glance.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/how-long-should-blog-post-be-word-count.jpg\" alt=\"report in ahrefs that shows word count for posts ranking in serps\" width=\"936\" height=\"518\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-71993\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/how-long-should-blog-post-be-word-count.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/how-long-should-blog-post-be-word-count-480x266.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As you can see, the top-ranking post for this query has a whopping 4,205 words. That\u2019s a beast of a post. But even if you want to rank in the top 10, you\u2019re probably looking at a minimum of 1,500 words based on the other posts in this SERP (Search Engine Results Page).<\/p>\n<p>This birds-eye view of the SERP is incredibly useful when determining blog post length, and not just because you\u2019re getting word count totals. You might be saying, <em>Wait a minute, the post in the 7th position only has 1,357 words. How is it outranking the post in the 9th position, which has 3,555 words?\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Well, the post in the 7th position has a higher <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/12\/domain-authority\">Domain Authority<\/a>, and more backlinks, which, you guessed it, are two more really critical ranking factors.<\/p>\n<p>Do you have a fairly new website or business, or are you still growing your topical authority? Don\u2019t despair: check out the post in the 6th position. It has the lowest Domain Authority in the bunch, the lowest word count, and a pretty slender <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2010\/04\/01\/build-amazing-backlinks\">backlink profile<\/a>, and yet it\u2019s still doing pretty well here. How is that possible?<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s the magic of rule #2 at work. If you can deliver a blog post that <strong>truly delights and informs your readers<\/strong>, you give yourself an amazing chance to rank and drive traffic, regardless of all the other factors in play.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\ud83d\udd0e Quality blog content is just one way to get seen on search engines.
