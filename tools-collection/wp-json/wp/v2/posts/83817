There are two components of any piece of content that you may be thinking of as an \u201cSEO headline.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The first is your page header, or H1. The page header, typically, appears physically at the top of your web page. In this post <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/meta-description\">on meta descriptions<\/a>, for instance, the H1 is \u201cThe importance of Meta Descriptions for SEO\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/example-of-on-page-h1.webp\" alt=\"example of on page h1 from wordstream website\" width=\"854\" height=\"383\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83863\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/example-of-on-page-h1.webp 854w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/example-of-on-page-h1-480x215.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 854px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>H1 refers to the actual HTML that is marking up and can be seen on the page. Most of the time, when you create a page or blog post, your CMS (Content Management System) will, by default, set your meta title to be the same as your H1. This can be fine in some situations, but not all. To understand why, we need to understand the difference between an H1 and a meta title.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc40 <strong>Looking for ways to drive people to your site?<\/strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download\">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"meta-title-vs-h1\"><\/div>\n<h2>What\u2019s the difference between a meta title and an H1?<\/h2>\n<p>While your H1 appears physically on the page, your <em>meta title <\/em>is the element that actually appears in the search results.

But as you can see, Shopify then gives the content creator the ability to edit the meta title to make it meaningfully distinct from the H1.<\/p>\n<p>Both the H1 and meta title are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/seo-ranking-factors-2025\">ranking factors<\/a>, in that they allow Google to understand what your content is about, how relevant it is to a given search query, and where to rank it in the search results. However, given the distinct purpose each serves, there are some key differences you should keep in mind when writing each.<\/p>\n<h3>Why your meta title and H1 might be different<\/h3>\n<p>Here are some key differences to keep in mind when thinking about how your meta title might differ from your H1:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Length. <\/strong>As we\u2019ll discuss below, Google truncates all meta titles in the search results after 60 characters. That means that your title has to be clear, concise, and not exceed that limit, or else you risk losing key aspects of it. Your H1, on the other hand, can be as long as you want, technically speaking. Once the reader is on your web page, a little added description in the headline can add important context that you may have had to leave out in your meta title.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Tone. <\/strong>Your meta title often needs to stand out meaningfully from the other listings in the search results in order to generate a click from the user. That means that it might contain tone\u2013thing like urgency, positive or negative sentiment, and even alarmism\u2013that aren\u2019t quite as necessary once someone hits the page.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Structure. <\/strong>It may be necessary to remove or reorder certain words and phrases that are relevant to your content, but don\u2019t do a ton of work in the search results.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div id=\"importance-of-meta-title-or-seo-headline\"><\/div>\n<h2>The importance of your meta title or SEO headline<\/h2>\n<p>Now that we understand the key differences between a page header and a meta title, and before we walk through seven strategies to writing effective meta title, we need to hammer home the importance of your meta title, or SEO headline.<\/p>\n<p>Your meta title acts as the gateway to your content. It is the first and most prominent thing a reader sees when deciding whether or not to navigate to your site. As such, each word has to be selected very carefully, and with the user in mind.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve mentioned the fact that truly compelling and relevant headlines can increase your rankings. That\u2019s not just anecdotal\u2013it\u2019s data-backed. According to one <a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/google-ctr-stats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Backlinko study<\/a>, the top-ranking result on a Google SERP has an average click-through rate (CTR) of about 27.6%. The link in position two has a CTR of 15.8%.<\/p>\n<p>That means that one slightly more relevant or catchy title can gain you another 10-12 sessions per 100 users that see your listing. If 4% of your organic sessions convert to sales, well\u2013you can do the math, and you can start to see how important that lift in the search results is.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/seo-headline-examples-on-google.webp\" alt=\"seo headline examples of google\" width=\"891\" height=\"564\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83867\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/seo-headline-examples-on-google.webp 891w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/seo-headline-examples-on-google-480x304.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 891px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Consider the above search result, for the keyword \u201chow to write a great headline.\u201d All three of these headlines are powerful, and for different reasons.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The first is the most relevant to the query.<\/li>\n<li>The second contains the highest number (73), indicating that it contains the most information.<\/li>\n<li>And the third contains a brand name that signifies prestige and credibility.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This ends up having a flywheel effect. These listings get higher click-through rates than their competitors because they rank higher. But they also rank higher because their high-click through rate, by virtue of their appealing titles, signal to Google that their listings provide the most helpful content for the user.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\ude80 <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/first-page-of-google?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_10WaysFirstPageGoogle_Download\">10 Tangible &amp; Free Ways to Get on the First Page of Google<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-write-seo-headline\"><\/div>\n<h2>7 keys to writing SEO headlines that rank and drive traffic<\/h2>\n<p>Now that we\u2019ve discussed the importance of writing effective SEO headlines, and the benefits you can enjoy by doing so, let\u2019s walk through 7 keys to doing exactly that.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Target a keyword<\/h3>\n<p>Your meta title and H1 both <em>need<\/em> to target a keyword. That keyword should be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords\">informed by keyword research<\/a>, highly relevant to the search query, and, if possible, have strong search volume and low competition.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/wordstream-free-keyword-tool-homepage.webp\" alt=\"wordstream free keyword tool\" width=\"854\" height=\"424\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83868\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/wordstream-free-keyword-tool-homepage.webp 854w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/wordstream-free-keyword-tool-homepage-480x238.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 854px, 100vw\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>You can use a tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">WordStream\u2019s Free Keyword Tool<\/a> to find relevant keywords.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This is where character count and structure come in. If your target keyword comes <em>after <\/em>the first 60 characters in your H1, you can and should move it to the beginning of your meta title. Generally speaking, your target keyword should always appear at or near the beginning of your meta title.<\/p>\n<p>Because you only have 60 characters to work with, you want to make sure that keyword doesn\u2019t get omitted. If it does, both your user and the search engine will struggle to understand what your content is about.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Stick to character count best practices<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019ve mentioned ideal character count a couple times, and we need to hammer it home here. If you want to double check whether your title is at risk of truncation in the search results, <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/learn\/seo\/title-tag\">Moz has a great preview tool<\/a> that you can use to see how it\u2019s going to look to the casual searcher.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/seo-headline-use-character-count.webp\" alt=\"seo headline best practices - use character count preview\" width=\"836\" height=\"359\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83869\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/seo-headline-use-character-count.webp 836w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/seo-headline-use-character-count-480x206.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 836px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is of course important in ensuring your target keyword doesn\u2019t get removed, but doubly so if you\u2019re including secondary keywords, calls-to-action, your brand name, or a vital piece of contextual information that your readers should know. You never want to exceed that 60 character limit.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Have a call-to-action<\/h3>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re promoting a product page, your homepage, or a blog, a call-to-action is a great way to encourage clicks-through from the search results.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/09\/call-to-action\">Calls-to-action<\/a> are more typically seen at the end of meta descriptions, but you can double their effectiveness by including them in your headline. Titles like \u201cCheck Out These X\u201d or \u201cFind Out Why Y\u201d can be incredibly seductive for users, especially when the majority of listings aren\u2019t going to contain calls-to-action in their titles.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udcda\u00a0<strong>Free guide download<\/strong>\u00a0&gt;&gt;\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download\">The 36 Best Call to Action Phrases Ever (&amp; Why They Work)<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>4. Leverage your brand whenever possible<\/h3>\n<p>Whether your domain has been around for 10 years or 1 year, your brand has authority. Your homepage, product pages, and core page (i.e. your \u201ccore pages\u201d) should all contain your brand name <em>after <\/em>the relevant keyword and a dash.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/seo-headline-brand-in-meta-example.webp\" alt=\"example of using brand in seo headline\" width=\"853\" height=\"385\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83870\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/seo-headline-brand-in-meta-example.webp 853w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/seo-headline-brand-in-meta-example-480x217.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 853px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This signals to users familiar with your brand not only that you stand by your content, but that this is a page or a piece of content produced by a brand they can trust.<\/p>\n<p>When writing a meta title for a blog post, case study, or other piece of long-form content, you may not have enough space to include your brand name. But you will find instances in which your SEO headline contains, say, only 45 characters. When this happens, don\u2019t be afraid to add your brand name for that extra piece of credibility.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Be bold and stick out from the pack<\/h3>\n<p>As mentioned above, your user may browse up to 20-30 organic listings before they click on the one they want. It certainly helps if you\u2019re ranked at the top of the pack. But even if you\u2019re at the bottom of page one or the top of page two, a <strong>bold <\/strong>headline can go a long way in increasing your click-through rate.<\/p>\n<p>Using powerful descriptors like \u201cabsolute\u201d (i.e. the absolute best), \u201cessential,\u201d and \u201ccrush\u201d (i.e. crush the competition) show users that your listing contains powerful content that will in turn empower them.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/seo-headline-tip-bold-language-example.webp\" alt=\"example of seo headline with bold language\" width=\"855\" height=\"416\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83871\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/seo-headline-tip-bold-language-example.webp 855w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/seo-headline-tip-bold-language-example-480x234.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 855px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re writing a blog post, try being incendiary with a title like \u201cHere\u2019s Why Everything You Know About X Is Wrong,\u201d or conveying extreme urgency with a title like \u201cY Statistics You Need to Know Right Now\u201d in order to stick out in a bland search results page.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Use numbers and lists to convey clarity of purpose<\/h3>\n<p>Numbers and lists tell users exactly what they\u2019ll be getting if they click on your listing. If you\u2019re outlining the top 5 coffee makers in the market, make sure your title contains \u201ctop 5 coffee makers.\u201d If the bottom of your blog post contains 3 free templates, make sure your title contains the number 3 explicitly.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/seo-headline-example-with-numbers.webp\" alt=\"example of seo headline with number\" width=\"841\" height=\"379\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83872\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/seo-headline-example-with-numbers.webp 841w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/seo-headline-example-with-numbers-480x216.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 841px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If possible, use higher numbers. Readers love having a lot of options to choose from, even if the amount of content within each option needs to be somewhat limited due to length constraints.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Test frequently!<\/h3>\n<p>Testing is always a must when it comes to copywriting, and it\u2019s no different for SEO headlines. There\u2019s nothing quite as satisfying as adding in some powerful descriptors, a particularly positive or negative sentiment, or a higher number to your meta title, then logging into Search Console a week later to see that your click-through rate has increased by 20%, or your ranking has increased by 3 spots.<\/p>\n<p>This also signals to Google that you\u2019re keeping your content fresh. As such, you should <em>always <\/em>be tinkering with your headlines to see what works and what doesn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<h2>Write better SEO headlines, get more traffic<\/h2>\n<p>There you have it!
