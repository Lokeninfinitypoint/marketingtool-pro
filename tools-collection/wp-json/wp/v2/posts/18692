It\u2019s going to look like this:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f822722f-5076-4ab8-a85a-e34430676c89\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/high-click-through-rate-high-conversion-rate-high-value-keyword-filter-adwords.png\" alt=\"creating adwords filter for high ctr high conversion rate keywords\" width=\"640\" height=\"298\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Why are you filtering based on these parameters? Let\u2019s break it down.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>CTR greater than account average <\/strong>is one of the two most important fields to include in your filter. To determine your account\u2019s average CTR, simply check out the dark grey row at the top of your view. This figure will probably be a bit low, but it will also allow you to filter out a ton of riffraff.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Conversion rate greater than account average <\/strong>will help you separate the keywords that are already killing it from the ones that need work. Terms with high CTR and low Conversion Rate are money pits. Once you\u2019ve uncovered your top-performers, invert this field and use a variation on the same filter to find your most costly pain points.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cost \/ conversion less than your target CPA &#8211; <\/strong>This is tied to the Conversion Rate parameter and isn\u2019t explicitly necessary with a smaller account. If you\u2019re bidding on hundreds of keywords, though (and you have a target CPA in mind for your conversion goal), this can help the cream rise to the top.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Impressions <\/strong>is necessary to filter out blips. If a keyword has a 100% CTR and Conversion Rate but has only seen two impressions, it\u2019s <em>probably<\/em> statistically insignificant. For smaller accounts, you can use 100 impressions as a threshold; if you\u2019re working with a more robust account, chooses a number that makes sense in context.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve got your filter\u2019s parameters established, name it \u201c<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/27\/most-expensive-keywords\">High Value Keywords<\/a>\u201d and, please, please, <em>please<\/em> save it. This will allow you to continuously stay on top of your account\u2019s most valuable terms without any hassle.<\/p>\n<p>Now, instead of having to pick through your entire account, you\u2019re working with a truncated, qualified data set. From there, you can begin to uncover new keywords that are like your top-performers, unlocking new opportunities for success. You can <em>also<\/em> give yourself a jumping-off point for optimization: High-CTR, low-conversion-rate keywords.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p>\u2734\ufe0f Use our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a> to find high-value keywords for your account!<\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h2>What to do with high-CTR, low-CVR keywords<\/h2>\n<p>If a keyword is being clicked on but doesn\u2019t yet generate sales, leads, branding gains, etc. then a high click-through rate for that term is bad for business. The reasoning for this is clear:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You&#8217;re paying for every click.<\/li>\n<li>A lot of clicks generate a lot of ad spend.<\/li>\n<li>Ad spend used on low-converting keywords is <em>wasted spend<\/em> with little to no actual business value.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These terms are basically stealing from your high-performing keywords, utilizing your limited budget for their own fruitless endeavors. Fortunately, there are a handful of actions you can take to reverse or eliminate their negative impact entirely.<\/p>\n<h3>Landing page optimization<\/h3>\n<p>The best starting place for determining which will have the greatest impact on improving conversion rate is a keyword\u2019s <a href=\"\/quality-score\">Quality Score Status<\/a>.

And while landing page changes can be a pain, they\u2019re relatively straightforward.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing to check out when you\u2019re looking to optimize your landing page is the headline. A strong headline that\u2019s relevant to your keyword and ad text and compels visitors to become prospects (it also improves Quality Score!). You can also use Google<a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/speed\/pagespeed\/insights\/\"> PageSpeed<\/a> tool to see if your problem is related to load time (a landing page that takes more than three seconds to render is, for all intents and purposes, useless).<\/p>\n<p>From there, clean, attractive design that looks trustworthy and professional and is consistent with your brand can help you turn an oft-clicked keyword into an AdWords account MVP. And if that doesn\u2019t feel like enough to woo clickers, hit \u2018em with a discount:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"268c46d7-68f7-4f87-bfba-b7538ebac824\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/landing-page-offer-cro-high-ctr-keywords.png\" alt=\"high cro landing page offer\" width=\"600\" height=\"311\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Target and bid RLSA<\/h3>\n<p>Part of your problem with high CTR, low Conversion Rate keywords could be that your prospects simply aren\u2019t in a place that makes sense for them to convert. Guess what? That doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t click on your keywords anyway. This is where target and Bid RLSA comes into play.<\/p>\n<p>Typically, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/08\/rlsa\">RLSA is used to adjust bids<\/a> on the Search Network through the power of layered remarketing. This occurs when advertisers use the \u201cBid Only\u201d function. RLSA also has an option called \u201cTarget and Bid\u201d that allows you to only serve ads to searchers who are members of specific remarketing lists.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"892d5be7-bcf3-472c-86bb-1a0e10331531\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/target-and-bid-rlsa-high-ctr-low-cvr-keywords.png\" alt=\"target and bid RLSA for high ctr low cvr keywords\" width=\"750\" height=\"437\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>How does this help? Great question!<\/p>\n<p>If you have a keyword with a high CTR and a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/08\/rlsa\">low Conversion Rate<\/a>, limiting the audience who sees your ads to only those folks who have already visited your site. This cuts down on unfamiliar searchers who aren\u2019t yet ready to act and limits your exposure to prospects who are both familiar with your brand and ready to act.<\/p>\n<h3>Pause it<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s okay to be a quitter. In some instances, no matter what you do, a keyword just isn\u2019t going to bring success. If you\u2019ve exhausted your optimization options, pause a keyword and return to it later. Focus your efforts on areas in which you <em>can<\/em> incite positive change instead.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c1edd2be-47f9-49a5-85a1-34e01ac649b8\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/not-for-me-heart.jpg\" alt=\"not for me heart\" width=\"250\" height=\"201\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>How to finding more high-CTR keywords<\/h2>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve identified your high-CTR, high-conversion-rate (MVP) keywords and optimized the ones that needed some work, it\u2019s time to discover net-new opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>The best place to start is the search query report.<\/p>\n<p>Download your list of MVP keywords and open your date range to a custom period that encompasses the entire year.
