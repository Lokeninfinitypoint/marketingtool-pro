When you set your daily average budget, you&#8217;re not setting exactly how much Google will spend on that campaign each day. You&#8217;re giving Google a rough idea of what you&#8217;d like your daily spend to average out to at the end of the month\u2014meaning Google could exceed or fall short of that amount on any given day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Originally, Google could spend up to 20% more than your daily average budget in this manner\u2014until October 2017 when it announced it could spend <span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/05\/adwords-daily-budget-changes\">100%, or double your budget<\/a>\u2014if it means more clicks or conversions.<\/span><span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>This is helpful in getting the most out of your budget, but advertisers have had limited insight into these fluctuations.
