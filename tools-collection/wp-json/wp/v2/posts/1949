Some marketers mistakenly believe that being in a niche industry is a disadvantage, but it\u2019s all about how you look at it.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/niche-marketing-simpsons1-1.jpg\" alt=\"Niche marketing Homer Simpson magazine holder's magazine\" width=\"655\" height=\"653\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Being a glass-half-full kind of guy, I thought I\u2019d offer some smart, proven niche marketing tips to poor, beleaguered marketers working in very specialized industries. Follow these seven smart strategies to get the most out of your niche marketing campaigns.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Know Your Target Niche Market Inside Out<\/h2>\n<p>Just because your product or service only appeals to a narrow range of people doesn\u2019t mean you can be lazy when it comes to researching your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/18\/beginners-guide-to-target-markets\">target market<\/a>. In fact, running a business offering a product with limited or niche appeal can make it even more difficult to figure out who your ideal customer actually is.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/niche-marketing-dilbert-1.gif\" alt=\"Niche marketing Dilbert target marketing comic strip\" width=\"640\" height=\"200\" \/><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/28\/behavioral-segmentation\">Segmentation<\/a> is crucial to defining a smaller target market for a niche business. It\u2019s not enough to know the basics \u2013 age range, income, marital status \u2013 without a deeper understanding of more granular attributes your target markets might have. The smaller your market, the better you have to know your customers.<\/p>\n<h3>Niche Marketing Example: Vermont Wooden Toys<\/h3>\n<p>One company that really knows its target market is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vermontwoodentoys.com\/\">Vermont Wooden Toys<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/niche-marketing-vermont-wooden-toys-1.jpg\" alt=\"Niche Marketing Vermont Wooden Toys\" width=\"474\" height=\"332\" \/><\/div>\n<p><em>Ron Voake, proprietor of Vermont Wooden Toys. Image via NBC News<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Vermont Wooden Toys, based in the verdant countryside of the Green Mountain State, doesn\u2019t have a flashy website. Most of their orders are taken over the phone. The only online payment offered is PayPal. The best part? Their customers don\u2019t care about any of that in the slightest.<\/p>\n<p>Craftsmanship, dedication, and a fondness for days gone by are what Vermont Wooden Toys\u2019 customers expect, and that\u2019s exactly what they get. Each piece is handcrafted by proprietor Ron Voake, who knows that his customers aren\u2019t looking for bells and whistles \u2013 they want authentic, handmade toys made with love.<\/p>\n<p>Voake\u2019s business attracts a diverse clientele \u2013 predominantly parents, perhaps obviously \u2013 but he also knows that the type of person who buys from him values time, skill, and craft. As such, they\u2019re willing to pay for quality products.<\/p>\n<p>Many of Voake\u2019s customers also value their children\u2019s safety in the highest regard \u2013 so much so that, following a major product recall of children\u2019s toys in 2007 over lead paint fears, customers began flocking to Vermont Wooden Toys in droves. The surge in interest even caught the eye of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2007\/12\/23\/us\/23toys.html?_r=2&amp;th=&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;emc=th&amp;adxnnlx=1198433086-YwyHceipEObWbtjrawZm6Q&amp;\">The New York Times<\/a> and NBC News, providing Voake and his company with the kind of publicity and free marketing money can\u2019t buy.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p>\ud83d\udcd8 Free guide:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite30BestWaysToPromote.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Marketing_The30BestWaysToPromoteYourBusiness_Download\"><strong>The 30 Best Ways to Promote Your Business (With or Without Money!)<\/strong><\/a><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h2>2. Solve Your Customers\u2019 Problems<\/h2>\n<p>In addition to knowing everything there is to know about your niche market, it\u2019s also vital to know how your product or service will fulfill a need not currently being met by another company in your industry. What makes your business so special? What\u2019s your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/07\/unique-selling-proposition\">unique selling proposition<\/a>? How are you taking care of your customers?<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/niche-marketing-solving-customer-problems-1.jpg\" alt=\"Niche marketing solving customer problems\" width=\"670\" height=\"447\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Small, crowded markets are just as competitive \u2013 if not more so \u2013 than their larger counterparts. For this reason, it\u2019s essential that you genuinely think of the customer first, and make this commitment to excellence a cornerstone of your niche marketing strategy.<\/p>\n<h3>Niche Marketing Example: Pansy Maiden<\/h3>\n<p>Few small businesses I know of operating in the niche marketing space know how to take care of their customers quite like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pansymaiden.com\/\">Pansy Maiden<\/a>, a handmade bag and accessory business based right here in Boston.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/niche-marketing-pansy-maiden-1.png\" alt=\"Niche marketing Pansy Maiden bags\" width=\"798\" height=\"585\" \/><\/div>\n<p>All of Pansy Maiden\u2019s products are vegan (PETA-approved, no less), meaning that they appeal to a highly specific type of customer (see point 1). However, while Pansy Maiden certainly know their target market, it\u2019s their consistently excellent approach to customer service and putting the customer first that sets them apart.<\/p>\n<p>Pansy Maiden maintains an active social media presence, and they frequently thank and interact with their customers on a personal level, further strengthening their perception in the eyes of both existing and potential customers.<\/p>\n<p>Pansy Maiden also go to great lengths to accommodate special requests, such as timely orders for special occasions. Overall, doing business with Pansy Maiden is a genuine pleasure, and one that has enabled the business to expand its loyal customer base in just a few short years.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Rethink How You Spread the Word About Your Business\u2026<\/h2>\n<p>Niche marketing isn\u2019t like \u201cregular\u201d marketing, only smaller \u2013 it requires an entirely new approach to how you spread the word about what you\u2019re offering. It\u2019s crucial that you <strong>assess the strengths of any marketing channel in relation to your business<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/niche-marketing-spread-the-word-1.jpg\" alt=\"Niche marketing spreading the word\" width=\"720\" height=\"375\" \/><\/div>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/24\/social-media-advertising\">social media advertising<\/a> has proven increasingly lucrative for small businesses operating in niche markets. However, the granularity of the targeting options offered by Twitter, Facebook and the like may not necessarily be cost-effective for <em>your<\/em> business, as social media platforms know exactly how valuable these targeting options can be. If this is the case, paid search might be a more viable solution. Whatever your situation, you need to scrutinize the potential return on investment of any niche marketing strategy to ensure that you\u2019re reaching your target market in a cost-effective way.<\/p>\n<h3>Niche Marketing Example: Powell\u2019s Books<\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to mastery of social media, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.powells.com\/\">Powell\u2019s Books<\/a> in Portland, Oregon, knows a thing or two about self-promotion.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/niche-marketing-powells-books-1.png\" alt=\"Niche marketing Powell's Books twitter page\" width=\"466\" height=\"327\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You could be forgiven for thinking that a bookseller isn\u2019t a niche business, but you\u2019d be wrong. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/18\/how-to-promote-a-book\">Selling books<\/a> requires an extraordinary breadth of knowledge and a great deal of strategy, both of which Powell\u2019s has in spades \u2013 it\u2019s not known as \u201cthe legendary independent bookstore\u201d for nothing.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to actively supporting local authors, Powell\u2019s also contributes to online discussions about books and literature in general, uses hashtags to great effect through giveaways and other promotions, and even highlights the work of other independent bookstores across the country. Powell\u2019s <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/19\/social-media-marketing-plan\">social media marketing plan<\/a>, combined with its remarkable commitment to books and its customers, have earned it a cult following across the U.S., and for good reason.<\/p>\n<h2>4. \u2026And Invest in PPC Advertising<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re offering a niche, boutique product to a small market, paid search is virtually essential.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe you\u2019re already sold on the concept of PPC. If not, stop and think about it for a second. Somewhere, out there, someone wants what you\u2019re selling \u2013 yes, even <em>that<\/em>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/niche-marketing-cat-hanger-1.jpg\" alt=\"Niche marketing cat hanger\" width=\"499\" height=\"368\" \/><\/div>\n<p>PPC is perfect for niche marketing campaigns. Include long-tail queries as well as high commercial intent keywords, optimize your campaigns for mobile (and be sure to make use of the appropriate ad extensions), and get your message in front of the right people.<\/p>\n<h3>Niche Marketing Example: Lefty\u2019s San Francisco<\/h3>\n<p>Even though one-in-ten people are left-handed, products for the southpaw in your life could still be considered a niche market. Many small businesses claim that PPC doesn\u2019t work for them, or that they can\u2019t compete with the big retailers, but in many cases, that simply isn\u2019t true. Case in point, San Francisco-based left-handed retail specialist <a href=\"http:\/\/www.leftyslefthanded.com\/\">Lefty\u2019s<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/niche-marketing-leftys-store-1.jpg\" alt=\"Niche marketing Lefty's Left-Handed Store San Francisco\" width=\"640\" height=\"478\" \/><\/div>\n<p><em>Lefty\u2019s San Francisco. Image by <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.reesedixon.com\/\"><em>Reese Dixon<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In addition to ranking strongly on organic search terms, Lefty\u2019s is leaving nothing to chance, and also invests in PPC advertising for search terms that southpaws are likely to be using, including this example below:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/niche-marketing-left-handed-scissors-1.png\" alt=\"Niche marketing left-handed scissors SERP\" width=\"1046\" height=\"761\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Lefty\u2019s is a great example of a business that is covering all its bases. This small store on San Francisco\u2019s Fisherman\u2019s Wharf proves that PPC can be highly valuable for small businesses, especially those catering to niche markets.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Keep Tabs on Your Niche Marketing Competitors<\/h2>\n<p>For businesses in niche markets, it\u2019s vital to know what your competitors are up to. Fortunately, you don\u2019t need to resort to corporate espionage to get the dirt on what\u2019s working for other companies in your niche. In fact, you don\u2019t even need to leave your office.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/niche-marketing-competitive-intelligence-1.jpg\" alt=\"Niche marketing competitive intelligence\" width=\"636\" height=\"358\" \/><\/div>\n<p><em>Image via Lifehacker<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Numerous software tools \u2013 including WordStream Advisor \u2013 offer competitive intelligence that can yield remarkable insights into what niche marketing strategies your competition is using, and which are working.

After trying to manage their PPC campaign themselves, they decided to enter a competition that WordStream ran last year. Little did they know how much this would change their business.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/niche-marketing-get-outfitted-1.png\" alt=\"Niche marketing GetOutfitted homepage\" width=\"572\" height=\"441\" \/><\/div>\n<p>After running the AdWords Performance Grader on their <a href=\"http:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLHackingAdwords.html?camplink=InContentCTA\">AdWords <\/a>account, GetOutfitted\u2019s VP of Marketing, Kristi Anderson, discovered how her PPC campaigns stacked up against similar businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Kristi learned the importance of negative keywords, how to manage her daily budget more effectively, and several other valuable lessons that helped GetOutfitted more than double their Quality Score, achieve a CTR 24 times higher than it was before running the Grader, and improve the positioning of their ads, among other improvements.<\/p>\n<p>To see how WordStream\u2019s AdWords Performance Grader helped GetOutfitted, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/18\/getoutfitted-case-study\">read the full case study here<\/a>.

Be Open to New Opportunities<\/h2>\n<p>Just because you\u2019re in a niche market doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t think about expansion or ways to improve what you\u2019re offering. It\u2019s crucial that you do what you do well, but don\u2019t discount the possibilities of opening up your product line or serving new target markets.<\/p>\n<p>However, while it\u2019s a good idea to consider expansion, it\u2019s just as important to think about whether doing so is viable. Can you afford to take a chance on a new product line? What about test marketing an existing product or service to a new demographic? Experimentation can lead to valuable new opportunities, but only do so if you can afford to conduct a thorough evaluation of your new ideas without compromising the quality of your existing products and the standard of your service.<\/p>\n<h3>Niche Marketing Example: Long Made Co.<\/h3>\n<p>Husband-and-wife team Jamie and Carissa Long are the proprietors of <a href=\"http:\/\/longmadeco.com\/\">Long Made Co.<\/a>, a boutique home lighting business based in Houston, Texas.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/niche-marketing-long-made-co-1.png\" alt=\"Niche marketing Long Made Co.\" width=\"633\" height=\"582\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The Longs have been making custom lighting solutions together since launching their company in 2012. Having grown their business through popular online marketplace Etsy, the Longs are now looking to move beyond the lighting vertical to include home furnishings and d\u00e9cor.<\/p>\n<p>However, they are still gauging the market for such products, and are continuing to pour everything they have into running their business the way they have \u2013 with a dedication to craftsmanship, and a commitment to providing quality customer service.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Listen to Your Customers \u2013 REALLY Listen<\/h2>\n<p>You might think that nobody knows your business better than you, but you\u2019re wrong \u2013 your customers do.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/niche-marketing-listening-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Niche marketing listen to your customers\" width=\"800\" height=\"338\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Even the best-laid niche marketing plan is doomed to fail unless you\u2019re committed to genuinely listening to your customers. Don\u2019t worry about having to ask them what they think \u2013 they\u2019ll tell you.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not using social media as a niche marketer, start. Right now. Social media is simply unbeatable for instantaneous feedback on your product or service <em>and<\/em> how well you\u2019re doing at keeping your customers happy. If a customer has a problem, do everything in your power to solve it as quickly as possible. It\u2019s hard to understate how important this is \u2013 just because your operation may be small or you\u2019re marketing a niche product doesn\u2019t mean you can slack off when it comes to taking care of your customer base.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, monitoring online mentions of your business is time-consuming. However, it\u2019s a hell of a lot less work than mitigating the damage of a negative review, fighting a tide of critical tweets, or trying to convince new customers that you really <em>do<\/em> care when your previous actions say otherwise. Word of mouth marketing is incredibly powerful \u2013 when things are going well. In niche marketing, you need to listen carefully to what people are saying, and act immediately to rectify your mistakes.<\/p>\n<h3>Niche Marketing Example: Wistia<\/h3>\n<p>As one of the most awesome companies out there, video hosting firm Wistia rarely have to go groveling for forgiveness on social media. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that Wistia isn\u2019t constantly listening to its customers and providing them with what they really want.<\/p>\n<p>In this example, Wistia recently expanded the number of videos that members with a free account could host on the service from three to fifty. The response on social media was immediate and overwhelmingly positive \u2013 and Wistia was quick to act on the goodwill.<\/p>\n<blockquote lang=\"en\"><p>.<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/philcampbell\">@philcampbell<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/csavage\">@csavage<\/a> Love back at ya from Cambridge! <a href=\"http:\/\/t.co\/ZHfmStqdH0\">pic.twitter.com\/ZHfmStqdH0<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 WISTIA (@wistia) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/wistia\/status\/524638550026108928\">October 21, 2014<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Since launching their free plan just two years ago, Wistia has expanded its user base from 3,000 to more than 110,000. This kind of success simply isn\u2019t possible unless you listen to your customers, provide them with an excellent product, and remain committed to their success and not just your own. Wistia knows that customer happiness is everything \u2013 even customers who aren\u2019t paying subscribers. This kind of responsiveness not only generates a lot of positive buzz, it also helps businesses with small (or nonexistent) budgets grow, a win-win for everybody.<\/p>\n<h3>\u2018Niche\u2019 Rhymes with \u2018Quiche\u2019<\/h3>\n<p>So, there you have it \u2013 seven tips for nailing niche marketing.
