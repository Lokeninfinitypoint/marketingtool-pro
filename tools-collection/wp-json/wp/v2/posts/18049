If you\u2019re looking for simplicity and elegance, it doesn\u2019t get much better than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/imovie\/\">Apple iMovie<\/a>. iMovie\u2019s ten high-fidelity filters are some of the classiest in the video editing game; and if you\u2019re shooting on your iPhone, or have been editing a project on your iPad, you can use AirDrop to wirelessly and seamlessly transfer your project over to your Mac.<\/p>\n<p>One of iMovie\u2019s most coveted features is its green-screen, or \u201cchroma-key\u201d tool, which allows you to place your characters in exotic locations\u2014Hawaii, say\u2014at a moment\u2019s notice. Want to overlay the scene with \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow\u201d? iMovie ties directly in with iTunes and GarageBand, so you can easily implement custom tracks and sounds.

While the process isn\u2019t perfect, and you\u2019ll likely have to do some tinkering to get your blog content looking just the way you want it, the rest of the video creation process is a cinch. Merely refine some copy that teases your blog post; drag and drop some gifs, screengrabs, or video clips; add some music; and your engaging social video will be ripe for Facebook and Twitter.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Standout Features: <\/strong>Blog-to-social-promo creation; drag-and-drop interface<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pricing: <\/strong>Create as many 720p videos as you want with the free version.

If you\u2019re going to spend money learning how to edit videos, however, you might want to steer clear. Nero just doesn\u2019t have the speed and functionality of some of the other products listed here, and if its <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\">value proposition<\/a> is its price, $50 is still not all that cheap.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Standout Features: <\/strong>Low pricing<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pricing: <\/strong>One-time payment of $39.95<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>5.

Most of the products on this list come equipped with motion tracking, but VideoStudio still boasts one of the best motion tracking systems around.<\/p>\n<p>One of the knocks on VideoStudio is its speed, which lags notably behind some of the faster systems on this list, like CyberLink PowerDirector and Pinnacle Studio. Still: for a one-time payment of $99.99? You can do much worse.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Standout Features: <\/strong>Motion tracking<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pricing: <\/strong>One-time payment of $99.99<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>6.

Filmora is Wondershare\u2019s standard, simple, high-quality video editing offering; but Wondershare also offers FilmoraGo (for mobile editing) and Filmora Scrn (for screen recording and editing). The design is intuitive and easy to use, and comes replete with filters, overlays, motion elements, transitions, and a small selection of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/14\/royalty-free-background-music\/\">royalty-free music<\/a>.

Title tools are trending in video software, and while Filmora\u2019s doesn\u2019t have the functionality of say, an Apple Final Cut Pro X, which can superimpose 3D titles over your videos and rotate them on three axes, it nonetheless has some snazzy titling features for the money you\u2019re spending.<\/p>\n<p>Another Filmora feature beginners to video editing will find attractive is \u201cEasy Mode,\u201d which allows you to create fun, polished edits by merely dragging and dropping clips, choosing a theme, and selecting music (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/18\/music-in-ads\">how to use music in your marketing here<\/a>).<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Standout features: <\/strong>Title tool; mobile and screen editing; \u201cEasy Mode\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pricing:<\/strong> Starts at $68.98 for a lifetime license<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>7.

Head to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cyberlink.com\/learning\/video\/product\">product page<\/a>, run through the tutorials, and you\u2019ll be alright. There is within the interface, however, an embarrassment of options and effects.

The 8Mn+ iStock catalogue also helps to spice up your creations.<\/p>\n<p>Uniquely, InVideo has no watermark on its videos, even if you&#8217;re on the Free plan.

And $79.99 is not egregious, but we\u2019re here to say that at that price, you\u2019re mostly paying for the name. In the time since Premiere Elements\u2019 inception, too many other products have surpassed it in speed and capability for us to place it among the cream of the crop. That\u2019s to take nothing away from Premiere Elements\u2019 usability, though\u2014specifically for beginners.<\/p>\n<p>The Guided Edits feature makes Adobe Premiere a particularly attractive option for beginners, as it allows them to take on both quick edits and advanced projects with substantial assistance from the software.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/video-editing-software-premiere-elements-1.jpg\" alt=\"Best Video Editing Software For Beginners Adobe 2\" width=\"630\" height=\"406\" \/><\/div>\n<p><em>If you\u2019re not entirely sure what you\u2019re doing, don\u2019t sleep on Guided Edits!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>So while Premiere Elements lags behind the competition in terms of speed, 3D editing, multi-cam, and some other advanced features, it\u2019s still a great choice for the beginner looking for a comprehensive suite of effects, and some guidance on how to implement them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Standout Features: <\/strong>Guided Edits; simple interface<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pricing: <\/strong>One-time payment of $79.99<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>10.
