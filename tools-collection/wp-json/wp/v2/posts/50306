An Experiment Reveals!"},"content":{"rendered":"<div>\n<p>Because display ads tend to have low conversion rates, many advertisers (or their clients) are quick to question their effectiveness and profitability.<\/p>\n<p>The truth is, display ads can have a strong positive impact on your conversion rates\u2014but oftentimes indirectly, making it hard to track or measure.<\/p>\n<p>One metric designed to help us out with that is view-through conversions. Even still, many question the validity of this metric. Can we trust it? In this post, we\u2019re going to cover<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What view-through conversions are.<\/li>\n<li>An interesting experiment conducted to test their validity.<\/li>\n<li>Tips on how to track and use this metric.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1>What is a view-through conversion?<\/h1>\n<p>To understand this <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.teamedia.co\/a-z-to-ppc-marketing-metrics-for-b2b-saas-tech-companies\/\">PPC metric<\/a>, it\u2019s best to first define a direct conversion (or click-through conversion). If a user sees your ad, clicks on it, and follows through with obtaining the offer, this is called a direct conversion.<\/p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/view-through-conversion\">view-through conversion<\/a>, on the other hand, happens when a user sees your ad, does NOT click on it, but then later returns to your site (whether by organic search or direct) and completes any sort of conversion action then.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/view-through-conversion-vs-direct-conversion-1.png\" width=\"714\" height=\"332\" alt=\"view-through conversion vs direct conversion\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2010\/03\/25\/view-through-conversion-tracking\">view-through conversion<\/a> is only counted if it occurs within a certain number of days after a user sees your ad. This is called the conversion window, lookback window, or attribution window, and you can set it to be anywhere from one to 30 days.<\/p>\n<p>However, the more time that elapses between an impression and a conversion, the less certain it becomes that it was that one ad\u2019s impression that influenced the conversion. After all, a person will encounter a lot of material in the 30 days after seeing an ad that could also play a role in whether they return to your site and convert.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, shorter lookback windows are best for the most realistic and accurate data.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/view-through-conversions-conversion-window.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"358\" alt=\"view-through conversion window setting in google ads\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>View-through conversions are important in understanding the true value of your display ads.<\/p>\n<h2>But can we trust view-through conversions? (experiment)<\/h2>\n<p>This question is by no means a new one, but when it came up for the folks over at PPC agency <a href=\"https:\/\/aimers.io\/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Aimers<\/a> (formerly Teamedia), they took a unique approach in answering it.<\/p>\n<p>When one of their clients saw that the Display remarketing campaign wasn\u2019t generating many conversions, they requested to stop it and reallocate resources to more profitable ad types.<\/p>\n<p>However, the client was only looking at direct conversions, and almost 50% of the campaign\u2019s total conversions were view-throughs.<\/p>\n<p>Even still, the client didn\u2019t think that view-throughs should be counted while calculating the total campaign\u2019s CPA; and without counting view-throughs, the campaign wasn\u2019t meeting the target KPI.<\/p>\n<h3>The question<\/h3>\n<p>View-through conversions are a measure of how often seeing an ad influences a person to later return to your site and convert. <strong>But how do you know that a user is actually seeing the ad?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, Google Ads tells us that an impression is considered a \u201cview\u201d when at least <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/6270625\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">50%<\/a> of the ad is onscreen for at least one second. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a user has seen the ad.<\/p>\n<p>How can we trust that these aren\u2019t just fake or made-up numbers Google uses so we\u2019ll keep running our Display ads?<\/p>\n<h3>The experiment<\/h3>\n<p>So, the folks at Aimers set up an experiment to see whether view-through conversions were accurately measuring the influence of their client\u2019s Display campaign on future website conversions.<\/p>\n<p>After letting the original campaign run for 30 days, they paused it and then launched a clone of it, but this time with a completely blank banner ad. That\u2019s right, blank white space, no headline, no description, no nothing.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/view-through-conversions-blank-ad.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"295\" alt=\"blank display ad setup for view-through conversion experiment\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>And surprisingly enough, Google approved and served it!<\/p>\n<p>So this way, if Google recorded any view-through conversions from this ad, Aimers would know that this metric is not trustworthy.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, since view-throughs say that seeing your ad influenced a user to go to your site later\u2014any view-throughs from this invisible ad would be bogus since there was nothing to see.<\/p>\n<h3>The results<\/h3>\n<p>The original Display campaign (with the regular banner ad) generated 2,418,973 impressions and nine view-through conversions.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/view-through-conversion-experiment-original.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"333\" alt=\"view-through conversion experiment original campaign results\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The test campaign (with the invisible ad) generated 315,677 impressions and zero view-through conversions.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/view-through-conversions-experiment-test-campaign-results.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"333\" alt=\"view-through conversion experiment test campaign results\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Aimers also checked the time lag report in Google Ads to verify that for the past 90 days, all view-through conversions happened within one day after seeing the ad (which was the setting they chose).<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/view-through-conversions-time-lag-report.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"252\" alt=\"view-through conversion experiment time lag report\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>So:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Regular ad: <\/strong>2,418,973 impressions, nine view-through conversions.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Invisible ad: <\/strong>315,677 impressions, zero view-through conversions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Conclusions<\/h3>\n<p>A few caveats:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>This was, of course, a small experiment done for one campaign on one account.<\/li>\n<li>View-through conversions will never be as certain a metric as click-through conversions, since there is no way to concretely measure a view (let alone any resulting subconscious behaviors) versus a click.<\/li>\n<li>It\u2019s possible that the absence of view-through conversions in the test campaign was simply due to the lower volume of impressions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Regardless, we like Aimers&#8217; creativity of thinking here! And for the sake of this campaign, they could use these results to suggest to their client that view-through conversions can be trusted as an accurate indicator that the display remarketing ad in question was indeed influencing website conversions.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, their client was thinking that the remarketing audiences they were targeting would return to their site and convert anyway, without the display ads. Aimers used view-through conversions to show them otherwise, and then ran the blank banner ad test to show them that view-throughs could be trusted.<\/p>\n<h1>How to get more value from your view-through conversion data<\/h1>\n<p>So if this experiment boosts your confidence in view-throughs (or even introduces you to them!), we have some tips on how to use your view-through conversion data.<\/p>\n<h3>Gauge brand awareness<\/h3>\n<p>There are many different ways to measure <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/10\/brand-awareness\">brand awareness<\/a>, such as through branded search volume, social media mentions, and more. But if you see your view-through conversion rate increasing without having made any changes to the copy and creative of your Display ads, this could be a sign that your brand awareness is getting stronger.<\/p>\n<h3>Measure memorability<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/retargeter.com\/blog\/how-view-through-conversions-got-a-bad-rap\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This post<\/a> provides some insightful tips on using view-through conversions. The first is that eye-catching ads may produce direct conversions, but memorable ads can lead to those indirect view-through conversions. So you can use this metric to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/09\/25\/a-b-testing\">run A\/B tests <\/a>and identify which ads are more \u201csticky\u201d than others.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/view-through-conversions-rhyming.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"93\" alt=\"example of rhyming in a display ad\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Rhyming is a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/01\/psychology-copywriting-tips-examples\">psychological copywriting tactic<\/a> that can make your ads more memorable. <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/lineardesign.com\/blog\/display-ad-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>(Image source)<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Get a feel for your audience\u2019s shopping habits<\/h3>\n<p>The second insight from the article cited above is that view-through conversions can help you understand your audience\u2019s shopping habits. You can get a feel for which of your products or services your audience buys spur of the moment (click-through conversions), versus which ones take more time for a decision (view-through conversions).<\/p>\n<h3>Optimize placements<\/h3>\n<p>View-through conversions help us to identify if some<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/07\/google-display-network-placements\"> display or video placements <\/a>are more powerful than others. For example, let\u2019s say you have the same display ad running on two different pages, each one with the same click-through conversion rate. They\u2019re performing equally, right? Not necessarily. If one placement is showing more view-through conversions than the other, you\u2019ve just identified\u00a0 placement optimization opportunities.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/view-through-conversions-display-ad-placements.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"280\" alt=\"google display ad placement options\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginewatch.com\/2019\/07\/30\/ways-to-target-ads-without-keywords\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>How do you track view-through conversions?<\/h2>\n<p>So all we have left is, how exactly do you track view-through conversions so you can make the above optimizations?<\/p>\n<p>As long as you have conversion tracking set up, you can see view-through conversion data in two different ways.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Google Ads analytics<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On Google Ads, you can modify your columns so that it appears in the \u201cCampaigns\u201d view.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/view-through-conversions-modify-columns.png\" width=\"650\" height=\"472\" alt=\"modifying columns to see view-through conversions\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This is the tool Aimers used to measure view-throughs in their experiment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Google Analytics<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In Google Analytics, view-through conversion data is available through the GDN impression reporting feature.<\/p>\n<p>Go to Conversions &gt; Multi-Channel Funnels<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/view-through-conversions-mcf.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"118\" alt=\"view-through conversions in google analytics through MCF\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If you want detailed reports and deep analyses on view-through conversions, you would need additional conversion tracking software. However, either of the two methods above should suffice in being able to optimize your campaigns according to this metric.<\/p>\n<h2>A creative approach to view-through validity<\/h2>\n<p>For many <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2011\/09\/20\/ppc-metrics-ultimate-guide\">PPC metrics<\/a>, different advertisers have different viewpoints on them, depending on their experiences as well as the industry, account setup, and overall marketing strategy of the business being advertised.<\/p>\n<p>And by their nature, view through-conversions have always been on the more fuzzy side of things.<\/p>\n<p>But Aimers&#8217; approach\u2014using view-throughs to demonstrate the value of a Display campaign, and then running a blank campaign to demonstrate the value of view-throughs\u2014was a great one in determining the validity of this metric to their campaign.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/zinaida-pchelintseva\/?originalSubdomain=by\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zinaida Pchelintseva<\/a> and her team at Aimers\u2014a performance marketing agency specializing in paid acquisition for SaaS businesses.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>View-through conversions have always been a controversial PPC metric in Google Ads.
