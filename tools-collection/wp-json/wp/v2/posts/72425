For instance, AI can automate the creation of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/12\/27\/email-marketing-ios15\">personalized email campaigns<\/a>, draft engaging social media posts, or even write full blog articles. Additionally, it can analyze vast amounts of data to predict consumer behavior, helping marketers craft more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/03\/best-marketing-strategies\">effective marketing strategies<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>One significant real-world application of generative AI in digital marketing is the partnership between Google and Wendy&#8217;s to use <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/technology\/ai\/bard-google-ai-search-updates\/\">Bard<\/a>, Google&#8217;s AI chat, to improve drive-thru operations.

After all, human emotions, creativity, and intuition cannot be entirely replicated by AI.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/marketinginsidergroup.com\/strategy\/human-touch-in-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an article from the Marketing Insider Group<\/a>, <strong>there are several key reasons why the human touch is critical in marketing:<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>1. Builds trust<\/h3>\n<p>Genuine human interactions create a sense of trust and reliability. While AI can provide facts and figures, it&#8217;s the human touch that can convey authenticity and passion, which are essential for building brand trust.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Creates an emotional connection<\/h3>\n<p>Humans are emotional beings, and it is this ability to feel and evoke emotions that adds an indispensable element to marketing. AI, as advanced as it might be, still lacks the ability to genuinely feel emotions and respond accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;&lt;div class=&#039;et-box et-shadow&#039;&gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;div class=&#039;et-box-content&#039;&gt;Free guide &gt;&gt; The 120 Best Words &amp; Phrases for Marketing with Emotion \ud83d\ude0c&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:1389185,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;10&quot;:2,&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;16&quot;:12,&quot;19&quot;:0,&quot;21&quot;:0,&quot;23&quot;:1}\" data-sheets-textstyleruns=\"{&quot;1&quot;:0}\uee10{&quot;1&quot;:21,&quot;2&quot;:{&quot;2&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:1136076},&quot;9&quot;:1}}\uee10{&quot;1&quot;:76}\" data-sheets-hyperlinkruns=\"{&quot;1&quot;:21,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite120WordsforMarketingWithEmotion.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_120WordsPhrases_Download&quot;}\uee10{&quot;1&quot;:76}\"><div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>Free guide &gt;&gt; <a class=\"in-cell-link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite120WordsforMarketingWithEmotion.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_120WordsPhrases_Download\" rel=\"noopener\">The 120 Best Words &amp; Phrases for Marketing with Emotion<\/a> \ud83d\ude0c<\/div><\/div><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>3. Helps to understand context<\/h3>\n<p>While AI is getting better at understanding context, it still struggles in complex situations or when dealing with subtle nuances. Human marketers can understand context better, enabling them to create content and messaging that truly resonates.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Ethical considerations<\/h3>\n<p>There are numerous ethical considerations in marketing, from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/11\/22\/customer-data-privacy\">data privacy<\/a> to truthful advertising. Human oversight is necessary to ensure that AI-driven marketing adheres to ethical standards and regulations.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/generative-ai-human-oversight-why.jpg\" alt=\"graphic showing why you need human oversight with ai\" width=\"936\" height=\"467\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72427\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/generative-ai-human-oversight-why.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/generative-ai-human-oversight-why-480x239.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>The key takeaway<\/h3>\n<p>While AI has a crucial role to play in digital marketing, it should be viewed as a tool to augment human creativity, intuition, and experience, not as a replacement for these uniquely human attributes. By combining the scalability and efficiency of AI with the creativity and empathy of human marketers, businesses can create powerful marketing strategies that resonate on a deeply human level.<\/p>\n<h2>Best practices for using generative AI in digital marketing (with a human touch)<\/h2>\n<p>To fully harness the power of generative AI while maintaining a human touch, marketers should adopt several key practices. These include training the AI on high-quality data, reviewing and refining AI-generated content, and regularly updating the AI model based on changing consumer behaviors and market trends. The ultimate goal should be a symbiotic relationship where AI and human expertise complement each other.<\/p>\n<p>The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) has recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.iab.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/IAB_AI_Cases_and_Best_Practices_2021-03.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">published a report<\/a> that provides insights into the best practices for effectively integrating AI and human expertise in digital marketing. In the report, they elaborate on the following key points:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Use high-quality data<\/h3>\n<p>Quality data is the backbone of effective AI. This means ensuring that the data used to train the AI is not only extensive but also accurate, relevant, and free from bias. It is the marketer&#8217;s responsibility to procure, manage, and maintain this data.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/customer-data-sources.jpg\" alt=\"types of customer data collection sources and what they mean\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72435\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/customer-data-sources.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/customer-data-sources-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Zero and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/12\/first-party-data\">first-party data<\/a> are your best bets for accurate customer data.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\ud83d\udea8 Want to learn how to use AI the right way for your marketing?\nFree download &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteAIinMarketingGuide.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_AIMarketing_Download\">Emergency Guide to AI in Marketing<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<h3>2. Continually review and refine<\/h3>\n<p>AI is not a set-it-and-forget-it tool. Marketers should be continuously reviewing and refining AI outputs. This includes checking the content for accuracy, relevance, and appropriateness, and making adjustments as needed.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Update AI models regularly<\/h3>\n<p>The digital marketing landscape is dynamic, with consumer behavior and market trends changing regularly. Therefore, AI models should be updated frequently to reflect these changes and to ensure the AI remains effective.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Consider the ethical implications<\/h3>\n<p>Marketers should always consider the ethical implications of AI use, such as data privacy and transparency. This involves being clear with consumers about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/03\/30\/cookie-consent-banner-examples\">how their data is being used<\/a> and ensuring that all AI-driven marketing practices comply with relevant laws and regulations.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/cookie-consent-banner-example-moovly.jpg\" alt=\"cookie banner example from moovly that shows how data is being used\" width=\"731\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72428\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/cookie-consent-banner-example-moovly.jpg 731w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/cookie-consent-banner-example-moovly-480x394.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 731px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Cookie banners can communicate how data is being used.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>5. Collaborate<\/h3>\n<p>The ultimate goal should be to foster a collaborative relationship between AI and human marketers. This means recognizing the strengths and limitations of both and leveraging them in a way that maximizes the benefits. AI can handle data analysis and (some) content generation, while humans can provide creative insight, emotional intelligence, and ethical oversight.<\/p>\n<p>By following these best practices, marketers can effectively integrate AI into their digital marketing strategies while still maintaining a crucial human touch. It&#8217;s not about choosing AI over humans or vice versa, but about finding the right balance to deliver the best results.<\/p>\n<p><span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;&lt;div class=&#039;et-box et-shadow&#039;&gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;div class=&#039;et-box-content&#039;&gt;\u2734\ufe0f Free guide\\nDownload now &gt;&gt; PPC 101: The Beginner&#039;s Guide to PPC\\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:1049089,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;23&quot;:1}\" data-sheets-textstyleruns=\"{&quot;1&quot;:0}\uee10{&quot;1&quot;:36,&quot;2&quot;:{&quot;2&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:1136076},&quot;9&quot;:1}}\uee10{&quot;1&quot;:72}\" data-sheets-hyperlinkruns=\"{&quot;1&quot;:36,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLPPC101.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_PPC101_Download&quot;}\uee10{&quot;1&quot;:72}\"><div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\u2734\ufe0f Free guide\nDownload now &gt;&gt; <a class=\"in-cell-link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLPPC101.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_PPC101_Download\" rel=\"noopener\">PPC 101: The Beginner&#8217;s Guide to PPC<\/a><\/div><\/div><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Generative AI + human expertise = potential for marketing greatness<\/h2>\n<p>The future of digital marketing is set to be significantly influenced by generative AI.
