As you can imagine, the reliability of these recommendations varies by account and recommendation\u2014while Google&#8217;s data and machine learning can be effective, at the end of the day, a human will know the ins and outs of any given account and ultimately what&#8217;s best for it\u2014which is why the best practice is to take them with a grain of salt.<\/p>\n<h3>What are auto-apply recommendations?<\/h3>\n<p>There are basically three ways to manage Google&#8217;s recommendations:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Manually, in bulk:<\/strong> You can click \u201cApply all\u201d to apply all recommendations for a particular category.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/google-ads-apply-all-recommendations.png\" alt=\"example of a google ads recommendation card\" width=\"427\" height=\"203\" class=\"wp-image-69488 aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Manually, individually:<\/strong> If you click \u201cView all recommendations\u201d for a particular category, you can view each individual recommendation and choose whether to apply it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/google-ads-individual-recommendations.png\" alt=\"google ads recommendations - manual review window\" width=\"582\" height=\"412\" class=\" wp-image-69487 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/google-ads-individual-recommendations.png 582w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/google-ads-individual-recommendations-480x340.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 582px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Automatically:<\/strong> This means that Google will automatically implement the suggestion.

It looks like this in the Recommendations page:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/google-ads-remove-redundant-keywords-suggestion.png\" alt=\"google ads remove redundant keywords recommendation card\" width=\"432\" height=\"280\" class=\"wp-image-69489 aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>The clarification: What is changing with the remove redundant keywords recommendation?<\/h2>\n<p>On January 4, Google emailed advertisers enrolled in auto-apply for RRK, saying that the behavior of this recommendation will change on January 19.<\/p>\n<p>The email says:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Currently, the \u2018Remove redundant keywords\u2019 recommendation suggests redundant keywords within the same ad groups, destination, bidding strategy, and match type. Starting January 19, the recommendation can include keywords across different match types<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>What this means is, \u201credundant keywords\u201d used to just refer to keywords that are equivalent to higher-performing keywords with the same match type, but now it also refers to keywords that have broader match types. In other words, Google will remove a \u201credundant\u201d phrase or exact match keyword if it has a broad match version in the same ad group.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/google-email-remove-redundant-keywords-rec.png\" alt=\"google ads email about the remove redundant keywords recommendation change\" width=\"400\" height=\"621\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69493 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/google-email-remove-redundant-keywords-rec.png 400w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/google-email-remove-redundant-keywords-rec-193x300.png 193w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/googles-remove-redundant-keywords-recommendations-have-changed-390939\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a>. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/google-email-remove-redundant-keywords-rec-full.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">View full-size<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>The example Google gives is this:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>If your ad group has the phrase match keyword \u201cwomen\u2019s hats\u201d and broad match keyword ladies hats, we will recommend that you remove the phrase match keyword since the broad match keyword ladies hats covers all searches from \u201cwomen\u2019s hats.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And the reason Google gives is this:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Removing these redundant keywords and consolidating your keywords across match types will help you manage your account more easily, doesn\u2019t negatively impact your performance, and still allows your ads to appear on the same searches.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>How does this impact your account?<\/h3>\n<p>For those of you enrolled or previously enrolled in auto-apply for the RRK recommendation (and even for those of you who aren&#8217;t), you probably have more questions about this. Here are some more clarifications based on Google Ads Liaison Ginny Marvin&#8217;s FAQ Twitter thread, which you can view <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/adsliaison\/status\/1611096219677298688\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any ad groups with ads that use keyword insertion have been excluded from the suggestions.<\/li>\n<li>This does not make you eligible to appear for more searches, since you already have the broad match keywords in your account.<\/li>\n<li>If you opt out before January 19, it will not change ad groups where you previously applied this recommendation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Q. If you applied a \u201cremove redundant keywords\u201d rec manually, will this update impact you? <br \/>A. This doesn\u2019t affect past recommendations, whether applied automatically or manually. Starting Jan 19, you may see recs to remove redundant keywords covered by your broad match keywords<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; AdsLiaison (@adsliaison) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/adsliaison\/status\/1611096228405694467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 5, 2023<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Click on the Tweet above to view all six FAQs.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>That last bullet is key. What it means is, if you removed redundant keywords from ad groups in the past (according to the old definition, whether automatically or manually) and Google finds additional redundant keywords after January 19 according to the new definition, Google will not automatically remove those keywords from those ad groups\u2014<strong>unless you are opted into auto-apply. <\/strong>You will get a fresh recommendation with the option to apply or ignore.<\/p>\n<h2>The consensus: Why are advertisers upset?<\/h2>\n<p>While this update technically only impacts advertisers enrolled in auto-apply for RRK, there are broader implications here that you should be aware of.\u00a0 In his <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/reassess-google-ads-recommendations-391025\">Search Engine Land article<\/a>, Cypress North Director of Marketing Greg Finn speaks on behalf of many advertisers in the PPC community who are frustrated by this move, for three main reasons:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, because instead of adding it as a new recommendation, Google is changing an existing recommendation and essentially defaulting users to be opted into it unless they opt out. As Greg puts it, &#8220;How can advertisers trust a single recommendation from Google if what you agree to today can be something completely different tomorrow?&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Second, because Google says this change &#8220;doesn&#8217;t negatively impact your performance,&#8221; but advertisers still very much rely on phrase and exact match to keep their ads relevant and our costs low. So this continued <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/06\/broad-match-smart-bidding\">push for broad match<\/a> and trend toward a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/13\/future-of-keyword-match-types\">potentially match type-less future<\/a> is increasingly seen as a money grab on Google&#8217;s part.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/google-marketing-live-broad-match-smart-bidding.png\" alt=\"google marketing live - broad match + smart bidding\" width=\"481\" height=\"285\" class=\"wp-image-61636 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/google-marketing-live-broad-match-smart-bidding.png 481w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/google-marketing-live-broad-match-smart-bidding-480x284.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 481px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Third, because there are many small businesses and beginner advertisers out there who can be taken advantage of by these recommendations. Without the contextual knowledge\u2014namely, how to handle recommendations, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/27\/google-ads-match-type-update-2021-explained\">how match types have been evolving<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/04\/google-ads-automation\">Google&#8217;s whole shift toward automation<\/a>, and the fact that Optimization Score isn&#8217;t everything\u2014one can easily opt into something that will actually cause them to lose money (to Google&#8217;s benefit).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>The course of action: What should you do?<\/h2>\n<p>As I mentioned in the intro, the key takeaway is the same: be careful with Google&#8217;s recommendations and even more careful with auto-applying them. What does that look like?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Opt out of auto-apply for this recommendation.<\/strong> Circling back to our TLDR section, if you are currently enrolled in auto-apply for this specific recommendation and don&#8217;t want Google to automatically remove redundant keywords according to this new definition on January 19 (or are unsure), then you should opt out of auto-apply for this recommendation now.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Take recommendations with a grain of salt. <\/strong>Not all recommendations are bad, and some of them can help you learn about new features. It&#8217;s just that not all of them take into account the specifics of your account, and some of them do appear to be more in Google&#8217;s favor rather than the advertiser&#8217;s best interest. So avoid any extreme measures here\u2014ignoring them all or applying them all\u2014and take the time to manually review them and apply them as you see fit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Continue to be careful with auto-apply recommendations.<\/strong> While recommendations may appear to be a beginner-friendly feature, auto-apply is better for more experienced advertisers who have an understanding of the inner workings of their account and know what they can automate. And even still, most experts, while they may be receptive to some recommendations, aren&#8217;t too keen on auto-applying them. Beginners are better off sticking with manual work as this will ultimately save you time and money in the long run. If you can&#8217;t do the manual work, there are plenty of agencies that can help you out!
