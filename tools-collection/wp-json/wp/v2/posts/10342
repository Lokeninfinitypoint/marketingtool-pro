Don&#8217;t sleep on LinkedIn<\/h3>\n<p>LinkedIn is a major social media site that is often under-utilized. Don\u2019t just add network connections and sign out; enter into dialogue with the connections you make, share your blog posts and offers, join and contribute to forums, and share others\u2019 quality content.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/free-low-budget-marketing-ideas-linkedin-post-comment.png\" alt=\"free and low budget marketing ideas comment on linkedin post\" width=\"800\" height=\"956\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><br \/>\nBy enabling other professionals to grow and educating your potential customers, you can build your brand and earn trust and respect in your industry.

Form industry partnerships<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Team up with a business related to your industry (but not a direct competitor) for a joint project. This can be done locally and offline through some kind of special event, or online (which could still be locally) with a webinar or promotional giveaway. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>Partnering with another business means twice as much notice and exposure to a whole new audience related to your niche.<\/p>\n<p>Industry partnerships are a great marketing tactic because they allow small business owners access to marketing know-how, technology, and customer bases that they could not have achieved on their own. You need to put careful thought and effort in if you want to form <a href=\"https:\/\/thrivehive.com\/how-to-form-profitable-business-partnerships\/\">a profitable partnership<\/a>. Clarify expectations, engage with and vet different businesses, assess how you can work together, and have several conversations before making things official.<\/p>\n<h3>15. Post helpful videos<\/h3>\n<p>Video is a highly popular medium for consumers, and while it can cost you a lot to get a professional video produced and uploaded to YouTube, you don\u2019t have to hire a professional. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/11\/at-home-diy-video\">DIY video marketing is easy<\/a> with today\u2019s personal devices and social media apps like Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/free-low-budget-marketing-ideas-video.png\" alt=\"free and low budget marketing ideas youtube video\" width=\"800\" height=\"528\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><br \/>\nVideos are especially great for demonstrating how to complete a task, like folding a fitted sheet or installing a garbage disposal.

To strike that vital connection with your audience, you can create:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Instructional videos and how-tos<\/li>\n<li>Product demos<\/li>\n<li>Behind-the-scenes coverage of what it&#8217;s like to work at your business<\/li>\n<li>Interviews with your staff or industry experts<\/li>\n<li>Slideshows with images and captions<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Add a branding message or personal message, whichever is appropriate. Be transparent. Finish with a strong call to action (e.g. Call us to set up an appointment! or Place your birthday cake order today!), and then distribute the video on your website, YouTube and other <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/29\/video-hosting-platforms\">video hosting sites<\/a>, social media channels, and even in emails.<\/p>\n<h3>16. Turn employees into brand ambassadors<\/h3>\n<p>For many small businesses, word of mouth is one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/18\/best-marketing-strategies\">best marketing strategies<\/a> to boost sales. Research shows that customers are more likely to buy a product or service if they get to know about it from strangers; so imagine the effect of friend or family referrals.<\/p>\n<p>By treating your employees well and encouraging them to become brand ambassadors, you can tap into the incredible potential of their networks. Your employees have genuine interest in your business, so why not leverage their voices and social networks to reach out to a larger audience?<\/p>\n<p>Think about hosting an exclusive discount sale like a \u201cfriends and family\u201d promotion every now and then. Learn how to <a href=\"https:\/\/thrivehive.com\/how-to-use-facebook-for-business\">use Facebook for your business<\/a>\u2014create an event, invite employees, and ask your employees to share it with their personal and professional contacts. Encourage them to share the status and tag people to increase the reach of your event.<\/p>\n<h3>17. Recycle your old content<\/h3>\n<p>Make the most of the work you&#8217;ve already done. If you have a content hit, repurpose it for other channels! Turn a successful webinar into a video tutorial. Transform a group of related blog posts or other content from your site into an ebook that you can promote through site popups or your email marketing program.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/how-to-promote-your-business-repurposed-content.png\" alt=\"how to promote your business - repurposed content\" width=\"720\" height=\"495\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-60021\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/how-to-promote-your-business-repurposed-content.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/how-to-promote-your-business-repurposed-content-480x330.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nNever be afraid to mash-up and re-promote your old content \u2013 chances are there will be a ton of people who never even saw your old stuff, so it\u2019ll be a fresh, 100% new content piece for a large segment of your audience.<\/p>\n<div id=\"practically-free-marketing-ideas\">\n<p><a class=\"subhead-anchor\" rel=\"#practically-free-marketing-ideas\"><svg width=\"19\" height=\"19\" viewbox=\"0 0 14 14\"><g fill=\"none\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\"><path d=\"M0 0h14v14H0z\"><\/path><path d=\"M7.45 9.887l-1.62 1.621c-.92.92-2.418.92-3.338 0a2.364 2.364 0 0 1 0-3.339l1.62-1.62-1.273-1.272-1.62 1.62a4.161 4.161 0 1 0 5.885 5.884l1.62-1.62L7.45 9.886zM5.527 5.135L7.17 3.492c.92-.92 2.418-.92 3.339 0 .92.92.92 2.418 0 3.339L8.866 8.473l1.272 1.273 1.644-1.643A4.161 4.161 0 1 0 5.897 2.22L4.254 3.863l1.272 1.272zm-.66 3.998a.749.749 0 0 1 0-1.06l2.208-2.206a.749.749 0 1 1 1.06 1.06L5.928 9.133a.75.75 0 0 1-1.061 0z\"><\/path><\/g><\/svg><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Practically free marketing ideas<\/h2>\n<\/div>\n<p>These strategies don\u2019t require a big <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/09\/14\/adwords-budget-guide\">advertising budget<\/a>, but you will likely need to put some resources into them\u2014such as by subscribing to a platform or purchasing tickets to events.<\/p>\n<h3>18. Host classes and events<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/21\/facebook-ads-for-events\">Plan an event<\/a> or class to host, then print out flyers and post them on community bulletin boards (libraries, coffee shops, local colleges and adult ed centers). While most community bulletin boards won\u2019t let you post business advertisements, they\u2019re often more than happy to post a flyer promoting an educational event or class.<\/p>\n<p>If you can\u2019t host an event, attend any local events that you can find that might benefit your business. You never know where you will find your next customer or business partner!<\/p>\n<h3>19. Run informative webinars<\/h3>\n<p>If reaching a potential audience in person doesn\u2019t sound like your idea of a good marketing idea, you can always host a webinar. Webinars are a free way to promote your business by providing helpful information to potential interested customers.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/free-low-budget-marketing-ideas-webinar.png\" alt=\"free and low budget marketing ideas webinar\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/18\/best-webinar-platforms\">Webinar platforms<\/a> such as Webex and GoToMeeting allow you to broadcast your webinar with just a few button clicks. Make sure to promote your webinar on social media or through an email newsletter one to two weeks before the event and include reminders to registrants so that they don\u2019t miss it.<\/p>\n<h3>20. Attend industry\/networking events<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Attending trade shows and industry conferences is a smart way <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-market-your-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">to market your small business<\/a>. These events bring together business minds from all industries who want to find new marketing strategies to grow their business. It\u2019s also a way to network with like-minded people and develop new B2B contacts. In addition, these events have exclusive seminars designed to sharpen your skills in sales, social media, advertising and other contemporary ways of promoting your small business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>21. Host a social media contest or giveaway<\/h3>\n<p>Running a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/11\/instagram-giveaways\">social media contest or giveaway<\/a> is a smart and effective marketing strategy requiring minimal resources. You may need to cough up some dough for a prize, or offer a product service at no charge, but the number of participants and new potential leads you get will be well worth the price. Really tight on budget? You don\u2019t technically need a super expensive prize to get participants. Even a couple high-end water bottles or fancy backpacks might be enough of a draw for some users.<\/p>\n<p>There are a number of <a href=\"https:\/\/thrivehive.com\/giveaway-contest-ideas-for-instagram-and-facebook\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">different social media contest types<\/a> out there, but the main idea is to require registrants to like, follow, or tag your business, or tag someone else on your post, to get your name out there and introduce potential clients to your services.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/free-low-budget-marketing-ideas-giveaway.png\" alt=\"free and low budget marketing ideas contest giveaway\" width=\"800\" height=\"462\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>22. Do an in-store business card drawing<\/h3>\n<p>Put a fishbowl at your place of business with a sign inviting visitors to drop their business cards in for a chance to win something from you. For example, a restaurant might offer a free (socially distanced, if applicable) lunch for the whole office.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of the month you\u2019ve collected a ton of business cards, and while you can only have one winner, there\u2019s no reason those other business cards have to go to waste. Use the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/11\/email-list-building\">email addresses<\/a> provided to let users know that while they haven\u2019t won this time, they are more than welcome to join your mailing list, which will notify them of future giveaways and special offers.<\/p>\n<h3>23. Set up a customer referral program<\/h3>\n<p>Offer existing customers a free product, free month of service, or some other reward for referring new customers. Remember, word-of-mouth is powerful stuff, and customers referred by other customers are so friends telling friends about your business is incredibly valuable. Here are some ideas for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/06\/referral-marketing\">getting more referrals<\/a> from your existing customers and clients.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/referral-marketing-critical-pass-ad.jpg\" alt=\"Critical Pass referral program offer\" width=\"782\" height=\"527\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Some more referral marketing <a href=\"https:\/\/review42.com\/referral-marketing-statistics\/#:~:text=Customers%20referred%20by%20a%20friend%20are%20four%20times%20more%20likely,37%25%20higher%20customer%20retention%20rate.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stats<\/a> in case you\u2019re not convinced of the value of this low-budget marketing tactic:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>74% of consumers consider word of mouth the primary factor behind their purchasing decisions.<\/li>\n<li>Customers referred by a friend are four times more likely to buy.<\/li>\n<li>77% of consumers are more likely to buy a new product if their friends or family recommend it.<\/li>\n<li>According to referral marketing statistics, referred customers have a 37% higher customer retention rate.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>24. Join in on local events or contests<\/h3>\n<p>If the town or city in which you are located hosts annual celebrations, weekly farmers markets, or other contests, make it a point to attend these events to get to know your local audience. This is the best form of market research. If applicable, set up a table or booth at the event, become a sponsor, or donate a product or service of yours as a raffle or contest prize. It&#8217;s a low-cost way to raise awareness of your business.<\/p>\n<h3>25. Get some awesome business cards<\/h3>\n<p>Get yourself some snazzy business cards, then give them to every person you lay eyes on. Every handshake should come with a business card. The more people who find out about your business, the better \u2013 even if it\u2019s just a quick glance at a business card.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/free-low-budget-marketing-ideas-creative-business-cards.png\" alt=\"free and low budget marketing ideas creative business cards\" width=\"600\" height=\"319\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>26. Put magnets on the company car<\/h3>\n<p>Stick a magnetic sign on your company car and voila, you have a brand awareness campaign on wheels, spreading the world all over town (just be sure to obey traffic laws). Bumper stickers and window decals also work for this method, and they are generally not expensive to get made.<\/p>\n<h3>27. Run a Facebook campaign<\/h3>\n<p>If you only have a tiny advertising budget, it might still be enough to run some Facebook ads! The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/28\/facebook-advertising-benchmarks\">cost per click for Facebook advertising<\/a> can be very low.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-advertising-tips-benchmarks-2.png\" alt=\"Facebook Ad Tips Benchmarks\" width=\"800\" height=\"692\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Here are some resources to help you get started with your first Facebook ad campaign, depending on what type of business you&#8217;re running:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/25\/facebook-ecommerce\">Facebook Ecommerce: The Complete Beginner&#8217;s Guide<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/27\/facebook-ads-for-entrepreneurs\">Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Facebook Ads for Entrepreneurs<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/25\/b2b-facebook-advertising\">Beginner&#8217;s Guide to B2B Facebook Advertising<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Free and low-budget small business marketing ideas [summary]<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Here are all 27 free and low-budget ideas <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite30BestWaysToPromote.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Marketing_The30BestWaysToPromoteYourBusiness_Download\">promote your business<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Google My Business optimization<\/li>\n<li>Social media posting and engaging<\/li>\n<li>Social media tagging<\/li>\n<li>Hashtags<\/li>\n<li>Local SEO<\/li>\n<li>Email marketing<\/li>\n<li>Infographics<\/li>\n<li>Free ad promo credits<\/li>\n<li>Business awards<\/li>\n<li>Guerilla marketing<\/li>\n<li>Content marketing<\/li>\n<li>Blogging<\/li>\n<li>Industry partnerships<\/li>\n<li>Video marketing<\/li>\n<li>Brand ambassadors<\/li>\n<li>LinkedIn marketing<\/li>\n<li>Classes and events<\/li>\n<li>Webinars<\/li>\n<li>Industry networking events<\/li>\n<li>Social media contests\/giveaways<\/li>\n<li>In-store business card drawings<\/li>\n<li>Customer referral programs<\/li>\n<li>Local events or contests<\/li>\n<li>Awesome business cards<\/li>\n<li>Car magnets for the company car<\/li>\n<li>Content recycling<\/li>\n<li>Facebook ads<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Any favorite low-budget marketing tactics we missed?
