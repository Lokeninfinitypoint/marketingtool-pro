Instead\u2014as is often the case with Wikipedia\u2014links to the site tend to pop up in the organic search results (making it an important albeit underutilized part of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/11\/seo-tests\">any site\u2019s SEO strategy<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>This is particularly true when a search is framed as a question, which, thanks to the proliferation of voice search, is becoming more common. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.quora.com\/How-many-people-use-Quora-7\/answer\/Adam-DAngelo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Per Quora<\/a>, the site currently has over 200 million unique monthly visitors and recently expanded to support Spanish and French.<\/p>\n<p>While this is all well and good (everyone can stand to benefit from a resource this rich), it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you should move a portion of your advertising budget over to what is, for all intents and purposes, a very fancy message board, right?<\/p>\n<p>Hold that thought.<\/p>\n<h3>Why advertise on Quora?<\/h3>\n<p>Quora is unique in that it offers advertisers the ability to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/08\/brand-affinity-marketing\">build credibility<\/a> in the eyes of a prospect during the hella important research phase.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f12bb0f3-4d16-4776-874f-63537a6dfbc4\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/quora-ads-mobile-desktop-1.png\" alt=\"quora ads mobile vs desktop\" width=\"700\" height=\"373\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>While an <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/03\/most-valuable-keywords-high-ctr\">informational keyword in Google Ads<\/a>\u00a0(formerly known as Google AdWords) might give you the power to serve a relevant ad to a searcher, there\u2019s only value to be had if you can incite a click with your copy. Quora, on the other hand, gives you the ability to couch your ad copy between insightful nuggets of information that relate\u2014directly or tangentially\u2014to your product or service. While on a SERP your ad is positioned atop links to relevant websites, Quora ads are dispersed betwixt <em>actual information, <\/em>like so:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5bbbf0ac-51fb-4446-97c7-bec6812e7ddf\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/quora-ads-in-the-wild.png\" alt=\"quora ad in the wild between relevant answers\" width=\"600\" height=\"711\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>If a prospect is searching for information about your company, product, competitors, or industry, Quora presents you with a unique opportunity to slide between insightful responses (bonus brand equity points if <em>your team contributed \u2018em<\/em>) with a contextually relevant ad closely resembling what you\u2019d see over on AdWords.<\/p>\n<p>In the example above, which depicts the results for \u201cWhat is the best <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/31\/how-to-advertise-on-facebook\">Facebook campaign strategy<\/a> I can use for an online clothing store,\u201d there\u2019s an ad for General Assembly\u2019s part-time digital marketing course. The nontraditional educator is attempting to use Quora ads to teach a man to fish, so to speak. I dig it.<\/p>\n<p>Quora says Quora offers advertisers\u2026<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A large, engaged audience<\/li>\n<li>Quality content<\/li>\n<li>High user intent<\/li>\n<li>Measurability<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The GA example I just touched on supports the first few claims. Someone looking to bolster the performance of their Facebook ads is clearly engaged. The ad itself is sandwiched between insightful responses the likely served to educate the searcher. User intent is clear.<\/p>\n<p>While I whole-heartedly agree with the first three points, I\u2019m ready and willing to quibble with the \u201cmeasurability\u201d bit. This isn\u2019t for lack of effort but, rather, newness. Facebook, a comparatively old ad platform, is only <em>just<\/em> affording advertisers functional, actionable measurability (provided they <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/11\/facebook-conversion-tracking\">implement the Facebook Pixel<\/a>). If Quora continues to innovate on this front (and offer more robust targeting, because we could always use more robust targeting) its ad platform will quickly become a staple for online marketers.<\/p>\n<p>With that, let\u2019s jump into setting up your very first Quora ad.<\/p>\n<h2>How do Quora Ads Work?<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019ve dipped your toes into the <a href=\"\/learn\">PPC waters<\/a> at some point, the process of creating, managing, and optimizing a Quora ads account will feel familiar to you.<\/p>\n<p>So, without further ado\u2026<\/p>\n<h3>Creating a Quora Account<\/h3>\n<p>Visit the \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.quora.com\/business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Advertising on Quora<\/a>\u201d page and click the big, blue start now button:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"cfe3a44f-3538-4f26-aeef-60709d875559\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/quora-ads-start-now-button.png\" alt=\"quora ads start now button\" width=\"691\" height=\"273\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>From there, you\u2019ll be instructed to create an account name and enter your business and contact information. Standard procedure. Once everything looks kosher, click \u201ccreate account.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Installing the Quora pixel<\/h3>\n<p>Without the ability to measure success\u2014or lack thereof\u2014online advertising is frivolous. You may as well buy ad space on the placemats at a truck stop on 95.<\/p>\n<p>As such, it\u2019s imperative that you install the Quora Pixel on your website. This will allow you to do two things: track conversion events and build remarketing audiences.<\/p>\n<p>While I\u2019m not going to go into too much detail about the latter (structurally, remarketing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/27\/quora-ads-audience\">audiences in Quora<\/a> are built based on whether a given URL has been visited by a prospect), conversion tracking is <em>key<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>To place the Quora pixel on your website, press \u201cQuora Pixel\u201d in the nav bar.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"11715ebd-fa3a-4076-aa5b-e7a6da1bbe97\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-install-quora-pixel.png\" alt=\"how to install quora pixel\" width=\"700\" height=\"50\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>From there, click \u201cSetup the Pixel.\u201d It\u2019s a funny little grey button on the righthand side of the screen. This will cause an overlay, which outlines pixel installation, to appear. All you need to do here is copy the Javascript in the overlay and paste it between the &lt;head&gt;&lt;\/head&gt; tags of every page of your site (or at least the ones you\u2019re sending traffic to).<\/p>\n<p>If the existence of greater than\/less than symbols outside of freshman algebra makes you queasy, send the Javascript for your Quora pixel over to your web developer. It shouldn\u2019t take them more than a few seconds to implement it on your site.<\/p>\n<h3>Creating a Quora Ads Campaign<\/h3>\n<p>As is the case with <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/30\/facebook-ads-account-structure\">Facebook ad account structure<\/a>, the campaign level is a shell that holds ad groups. It\u2019s the place where objectives, budgeting, and ad scheduling are controlled. Ad sets, on the other hand, are where the magic happens.<\/p>\n<p>When you click \u201c+Create Campaign,\u201d you\u2019ll be brought to a screen that looks like this:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7e3089ef-7590-4bdc-89bc-c5004159ba67\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/quora-ads-create-campaign.png\" alt=\"quora ads campaign creation\" width=\"750\" height=\"623\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Unfortunately(!) Quora is yet to implement my helpful commentary. Be sure you select \u201cConversions\u201d as your objective. If you\u2019d rather establish a lifetime budget and an ad schedule (a la Facebook) than set a daily max in perpetuity, do so, click continue, and we\u2019re on to the ad set level.<\/p>\n<h3>Ad Set: Targeting &amp; Bidding<\/h3>\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, the ad set level is the most important unit of your Quora ads campaign. It\u2019s where you control who sees your ads. Without investing some serious time into honing your targeting (keywords, locations, and negatives), you\u2019re going to undermine the platform\u2019s inherent, intent-centric value.<\/p>\n<p>The first stage in ad set creation is (shocker) coming up with a name. Ensure that you use common nomenclature throughout so that you know what\u2019s going on in a given ad set without having to rifle through its innards (by this I simply mean that naming an ad set \u201cALLEN ROXXX\u201d is silly when you could call it \u201cUS-Content DL-Startups\u201d or something).<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"68eb3a98-2770-4efc-ac92-1472b7aabdbd\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/quora-ads-name-your-ad-set.png\" alt=\"naming an ad set in quora\" width=\"573\" height=\"183\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve named your ad set, scroll down to the \u201cPrimary Targeting\u201d section. Quora offers two levels of targeting, primary and secondary. The former allows you to select between two options:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Topic Targeting <\/strong>&#8211; In which topics function like keywords, allowing you to select the sorts of questions among whose answers your ads are served.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Audience Targeting <\/strong>&#8211; In which the Quora pixel allows you to select segments of site visitors and target prospects when they inevitably return to Quora.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4d76ae55-c7f5-4153-9114-17c6cb2eabf6\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/topic-targeting-vs-audience-targeting-quora-ads.png\" alt=\"topic targeting vs audience targeting quora ads\" width=\"667\" height=\"152\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Since this is your first rodeo, you\u2019re going to want to stick with Topic Targeting. Ensure that the box as highlighted (as it is above) and move on down to the actual topic selection interface.<\/p>\n<p>Quora actually recommends you enter <a href=\"\/keywords\">keywords from a Google Ads campaign<\/a> in order to receive suggestions for comparable Quora topics (<em>love<\/em> synergy).<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f224ee47-7f98-43cb-b6b6-102c0e9c1911\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/quora-ads-find-targeting-topics.png\" alt=\"quora ads find more targeting topics\" width=\"615\" height=\"420\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Just dump your keywords into this box and press continue; this will generate a list of prospective Quora topics that you can advertise on.<\/p>\n<p>Confused? How \u2018bout an example?<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say I enter \u201c<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/16\/facebook-business-page\">Facebook business page<\/a>\u201d into the box and hit continue. Quora generates the following list of suggested topics:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"05eeac4f-3ad4-48f0-958e-18a2c59195b1\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/suggested-topics-negation-quora-ads.png\" alt=\"negating suggested topics in quora ads\" width=\"312\" height=\"366\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>From here, I can sort through the list, selecting or unselecting. If we (WordStream) wanted to convey specific, independent messages regarding Facebook and Google Ads, I\u2019d eliminate \u201cGoogle Ads\u201d from this list of topics, uncheck any other riffraff, and import the refined list of topics into my ad set. Now we can move onto secondary targeting.<\/p>\n<p>The secondary targeting section of the ad set creation interface allows you, the advertiser, to adjust the scope of your efforts. Here, you can control for location (the geographic regions in which users can see your ads) and platforms (desktop or mobile). But that most interesting component of Quora\u2019s second tier of targeting is its <em>exclusion<\/em> function.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"e20858c0-ad95-41a4-9e2a-e6f75a56151a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/exclude-location-quora-ads.png\" alt=\"excluding locations in quora ads\" width=\"671\" height=\"465\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Exclusions in Quora function like <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/04\/negative-keyword-list\">negative keywords<\/a> on the Google Search Network.

This means that you only pay when someone clicks on your ad.<\/p>\n<p>But, outside of conversions, how do you know if your ads are resonating with your audience?<\/p>\n<p>Why, with Quora\u2019s built-in reporting features, of course!<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"53ad7c07-48d2-4522-a408-53c745bc65d8\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/quora-ads-measuring-results.png\" alt=\"measuring results quora ads\" width=\"700\" height=\"451\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Though rudimentary\u2014currently, you can only view impressions, clicks, CTR, CPC, conversion rate, and spend\u2014Quora can give you a pretty good idea as to the relative success of your efforts at both the campaign and ad set levels.<\/p>\n<h2>So, Do Quora Ads Work? [Case Study]<\/h2>\n<p>In August, we decided to try Quora ads out for 30 days.<\/p>\n<p>During that time, we drove 1,135 clicks on 230,604 impressions (these are, like, Display-comparable figures at best). Of those clicks, 23 downloaded a piece of content and another 20 ran the <a href=\"\/google-adwords\">AdWords Performance Grader<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This indicates that our top and mid-funnel campaigns seemed to perform similarly (though through the implementation of Audience Targeting, we could probably offer something <em>more valuable<\/em> to attain better results moving forward, thanks to an even greater understanding of user intent).<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"8f6b2ef9-db94-4ae2-843b-76fcddbc2cc5\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/whats-the-deal-with-quora-ads1.jpg\" alt=\"whats the deal with quora ads?\" width=\"240\" height=\"260\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>From a CPA perspective, qualified leads on Quora were about 17% more expensive than Google Ads, but 31% cheaper than we saw on Taboola and 19% cheaper than we saw on Capterra. We\u2019ve discontinued our experiments on both other platforms because the ROI simply wasn\u2019t there; Quora, on the other hand, is still alive and kicking.<\/p>\n<p>I reached out to Aaron Doherty, WordStream\u2019s Director of Lead Acquisition, who shared the following insights: \u201cI like Quora a lot. It\u2019s a new source of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/26\/intent-marketing\">intent<\/a>. While Google Ads\u00a0is still the best source of high-intent leads, Quora is in the same ballpark. The fact that the content is user-generated, with answers occurring in real time makes it an exciting place for marketers. While we haven\u2019t quite tapped into Quora\u2019s full potential, I\u2019m excited to continue advertising on the network in 2018 and beyond.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When I followed up to see if he had any negative experiences with Quora, Aaron had a single response: \u201cThe UI sucks. It\u2019s worse than Twitter circa 2014.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts<\/h2>\n<p>While our results to date haven&#8217;t been perfect, they have been promising.<\/p>\n<p>Quora offers a ton of potential as a complementary ad network.

If you\u2019re still in the process of building out your Google Ads, Facebook, and Bing accounts, wait a few quarters.<\/p>\n<p>Who knows: by that time, Quora ads might have a killer new UI and enough targeting options to take your online advertising to the next level.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What&#8217;s the deal with Quora ads?
