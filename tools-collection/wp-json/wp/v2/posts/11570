If you&#8217;re one such business owner, something you might not realize is that creating a Business Profile does not give you management over it, and you need those management and editing capabilities if you want your Business Profile to work for you as an effective\u00a0SEO and lead generation tool.<\/p>\n<p>So how do you gain management over your Google Business Profile? The answer is that, in addition to creating a free Business Profile, you must also separately create a free Google My Business account for that profile.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/what20is20google20my20business20account20with20profile20copy202.png\" alt=\"what is google my business account with profile\" width=\"800\" height=\"575\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>You need a separate Google My Business account to manage your Business Profile.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">A Google My Business account is the only means by which you can claim ownership of your Business Profile, attain management rights to it, and unlock additional free features to increase your visibility on Google.

So to explain what Google Business Profile is and how it works, let\u2019s first make sure we\u2019re clear on what a Business Profile is.<\/p>\n<p>Your <strong>Business Profile<\/strong> is Google\u2019s term for your Google business listing. Business Profiles appear in Google Maps and in the local results of Google Search.<\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Business Profiles on Google Search look like this:<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/what20is20google20my20business20business20profiles20in20search20results20web20copy_1.png\" alt=\"what is google my business business profiles in search results web \" width=\"800\" height=\"937\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Business Profiles on Google Maps look like this:<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/what20is20google20my20business20business20profile20in20maps20fresh20n20clean20dry20cleaning-4.png\" alt=\"what is google my business business profile in maps fresh n clean dry cleaning\" width=\"800\" height=\"552\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">And Business Profiles on mobile look like this:<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/what20is20google20my20business20business20profile20mobile20fox20cleaners20.png\" alt=\"what is google my business business profile in maps fresh n clean dry cleaning\" width=\"733\" height=\"539\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Creating a Business Profile is the same thing as adding a place to Google Maps\u2014which is something that anyone (including a random stranger or an automated listing generator) can do. All that Google requires is the business name, location, and category. Once Google confirms it is not a duplicate, they will create the Business Profile for that location. The Business Profile is then open to consumers to leave reviews, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sterlingsky.ca\/remove-images\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">add photos,<\/a> ask questions, and even answer questions. The Business Profile may also get populated with information that Google pulls in from across the web.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">What this means is, a Business Profile can exist on its own, apart from a Google My Business account. And <strong>whether you created your own Business Profile or not, you don\u2019t have the ability to manage the information it displays or the reviews it collects.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">That is where Google My Business comes in. By creating a Google My Business account, you can access, customize, manage, and enhance your Business Profile on Google, all still for free, which we\u2019ll get into next.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udce3<strong>Want to keep the free leads flowing?<\/strong> Download <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/free-leads?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_howtogetfreeleads_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\">14 Fast &amp; Easy Ways to Get Free Leads (+Examples You Can Copy)<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">How to use Google My Business for local marketing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">So we\u2019ve established that Google My Business is not your Business Profile, but rather a tool by which you enhance your Business Profile to boost its visibility and effectiveness. Let\u2019s cover the four core ways you can use this Google My Business to make your profile on Google listing a better<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/02\/local-business-marketing-tips\"> local marketing tool.<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">1. Engage with consumers <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">There are a lot of ways consumers can interact with your Business Profile, and you use your Google My Business account to engage back with them. You can respond to reviews, answer questions, enable direct messaging, and set up associated alerts. You can even use Google My Business to publish posts to your Business Profile, much like you would with Facebook and other <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/19\/social-media-for-small-business\">social media platforms<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/howto20use20google20my20business20gmb20dashboard-blurred.png\" alt=\"howto use google my business gmb dashboard-blurred\" width=\"800\" height=\"394\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span lang=\"EN\"><em>Your Google My Business dashboard is where you can respond to reviews, publish posts, and answer questions asked on your Business Profile.<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">2. Highlight your business<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">A Business Profile alone contains limited information about your business. But through your Google My Business account dashboard, you can provide hours, a link to your website, products and pricing, attributes, and other details that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/07\/unique-selling-proposition\">make your business unique<\/a>.

In the analytics tab of the platform, you can see the queries customers are using to find your Business Profile, whether they found you on Google Maps or Google Search, a breakdown of actions taken on your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/listings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">listing<\/a>, and how your photos are performing compared to other profiles in your category. Note also that there are ways to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.localfalcon.com\/blog\/how-to-track-clicks-from-a-google-my-business-gmb-listing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">track clicks from a Business Profile via UTM parameters and Google Analytics.<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20use20Google20My20Business20insights.png\" alt=\"how to use Google My Business- insights.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"324\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">4. Perform local SEO<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Just as Google has algorithms for ranking its ads and websites, it also has one for ranking Business Profiles. Through your Google My Business dashboard, you can incorporate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">keywords<\/a> into your Business Profile and perform other optimizations to help it rank in local results, which we\u2019re going to cover next.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20use20google20my20business20three20pack20local20rank20geek20squad.png\" alt=\"how to use google my business three pack local rank geek squad\" width=\"800\" height=\"795\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">Google My Business can help you optimize your Business Profile to show up in the coveted 3-Pack.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">How to use Google My Business for SEO<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Google Business Profiles are dynamic. Not only do they change form based on platform, but Google will also prioritize sections of your profile according to the term that was searched as well as the type of information most important to consumers in your category. Even better, Google will embolden keywords in the content of your profile that it thinks are relevant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">But there needs to be information to prioritize and keywords to embolden in your profile in the first place. Just as you (or your agency) would use a content management system like WordPress to optimize your website for search engines, Google My Business is used to optimize your profile and<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/22\/free-marketing-during-covid-19\"> expand your reach<\/a>. How do you use Google My Business for local SEO? Well, since optimizing for Google is essentially optimizing for searchers, it all comes down to the same three things: targeting, quality of information, and trust.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Target your information<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">To use Google My Business for SEO, make sure to incorporate relevant keywords into your Business Profile so you can tell Google what you\u2019re trying to rank for. Use them in your \u201cfrom the business\u201d description, your responses to reviews, your answers to questions, and in the posts you publish. Make sure to incorporate them naturally just as you would with any other<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/13\/smb-seo-strategies-covid-19\"> SEO strategy<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20use20Google20My20Business20for20SEO20county20line20chiro_0.png\" alt=\"how to use Google My Business for SEO county line chiro\" width=\"800\" height=\"395\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Include keywords in your description, editable through your Google My Business dashboard.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Maintain quality of information<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The completeness and accuracy of your Business Profile impacts its rank, so make sure to provide the requested information in every section of your Google My Business dashboard.
