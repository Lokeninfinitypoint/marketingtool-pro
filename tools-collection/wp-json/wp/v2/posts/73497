At first, reaching back out to users who have already engaged with you at a premium price might feel counterintuitive. However, there are some best practices you can follow to make sure you\u2019re making the most of your money. Today, I&#8217;m going to share my secrets to a cost-effective, successful LinkedIn retargeting strategy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>9 crucial LinkedIn retargeting tips<\/h2>\n<p>Follow these key LinkedIn retargeting best practices for maximized results:<\/p>\n<h3><span>1. Use audiences from <em>all<\/em> available sources<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>The first priority when creating a<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-remarketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> remarketing strategy<\/a> is to ensure you\u2019re including as many people as possible. Although a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/02\/linkedin-website-demographics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">website visitor audience<\/a> is a common target, it doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. Just because someone hasn\u2019t engaged with your website doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t familiar with your brand. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>In the LinkedIn Ads platform, you can create audiences from a number of different sources, and each one has a role to play. Here\u2019s the list of options you\u2019re presented with when you click to create a new audience on LinkedIn:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-audience-options.jpg\" alt=\"linkedin remarketing - screenshot of audience option list\" width=\"229\" height=\"636\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73537 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-audience-options.jpg 229w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-audience-options-108x300.jpg 108w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>There&#8217;s quite a bit more than just website retargeting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The first group is where you can upload customer information you have already, whether it\u2019s a contact list, company list, or data from offline events. Each of these lets you reach users you\u2019re already aware of after matching to them on LinkedIn, whether they\u2019ve been to your site recently or not. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>In the \u201cRetarget by\u201d section, the majority of options have nothing to do with your website. Instead, they focus on how a user engaged with your brand on LinkedIn. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Did they engage with your company page, an event you sponsored, did they open and\/or submit a lead gen form? What about creatives? Did they click on a single image ad or did they view one of your video ads for a certain amount of time? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>These are important touchpoints for you to consider when you\u2019re trying to find brand-aware users to include in your lists. If you\u2019re not including these users in your LinkedIn retargeting strategy, you\u2019re missing out on a potentially powerful audience to target.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p>Do you want to remarket to website visitors on LinkedIn, but your audience size is still too small?

Audience size impacts your advertising costs<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>Aside from simply missing a wide group of users to engage with, there\u2019s another reason you should want to include more users in your retargeting strategies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>On the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/05\/linkedin-advertising\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn Ads platform<\/a>, the larger your audience size, the lower the cost of reaching those users.\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Here\u2019s a quick example of two audiences we could use that target people in the PPC space:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-example-audience.jpg\" alt=\"linkedin remarketing - example remarketing audience targeting screenshot\" width=\"804\" height=\"497\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73536 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-example-audience.jpg 804w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-example-audience-480x297.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 804px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>This first audience is just two job titles across the US: Digital Marketing Manager and Digital Marketing Specialist. The audience size is 160,000 and the expected <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/linkedin-ads-cost\">cost per click<\/a> range is between $1.26 and $1.88.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>However, you&#8217;ll notice below that when I expand the list to include people with member groups in line with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/learn\/ppc101\">PPC<\/a>, the visual changes a bit:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-audience-size-and-reach-example.jpg\" alt=\"linkedin remarketing - audience targeting size example\" width=\"850\" height=\"519\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73540 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-audience-size-and-reach-example.jpg 850w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-audience-size-and-reach-example-480x293.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 850px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>While I was only able to expand the target audience to 180,000, you can see that the estimated cost-per-click range did come down slightly to $1.15 to $1.72. While this might not seem like a big shift, every little bit adds up when you\u2019re running <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/05\/linkedin-advertising\">LinkedIn ad campaigns<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The flip side of this coin is that although you\u2019re keeping costs down, you could be diluting your audience if you expand too far. You don&#8217;t want to simply add users without considering their value to your campaigns. If that&#8217;s the case, you stick with the slightly higher costs and more specific audience to ensure your campaigns are achieving your goals. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span>3. Keep exclusion audiences updated (including lead gen ads)<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>Similar to my point above, if you\u2019re adding users to your audience just to make them larger, but not targeting the right people, then you\u2019re likely not achieving your campaign goals. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Excluding the right people from your campaigns can be just as impactful as targeting the right ones. Each of the audience types shown above can be used for targeting in campaigns, but they can also be used for exclusion as well. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Depending on the goal of your LinkedIn retargeting campaign, make sure you\u2019re using all of the list types above to exclude users who have already taken those actions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>One of my favorites here is the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/07\/linkedin-lead-generation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> LinkedIn lead gen<\/a> form exclusion. As you can see below, you can make a list of users who opened and submitted a lead form in your LinkedIn Ads campaigns. This is clearly a lead, so if your retargeting campaign is designed to generate the same type of lead, you should likely be excluding all lead gen form submitters from your campaign.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-lead-gen-audience.jpg\" alt=\"linkedin remarketing - create a lead gen form audience screenshot\" width=\"778\" height=\"460\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73539 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-lead-gen-audience.jpg 778w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-lead-gen-audience-480x284.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 778px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span>4. Use multiple ad formats (including text ads)<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>When retargeting users with LinkedIn ads, you have to remember that those folks have already engaged with your brand in one way or another. However, it\u2019s almost impossible to have a succinct picture of every single <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/19\/customer-journey-map-templates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">user\u2019s journey<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-ad-format.jpg\" alt=\"linkedin remarketing - screenshot of linkedin remarketing ad format options\" width=\"802\" height=\"341\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73538 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-ad-format.jpg 802w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-ad-format-480x204.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 802px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>Using multiple ad formats allows you to continue to reach your LinkedIn retargeting audience in new and unique ways, even if the content of the ad itself isn\u2019t drastically different. (We\u2019ll get to that in a minute.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Each ad format has its own specifications and requires different things, so if you\u2019re interested in getting a better rundown of those, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AmZeWF36gg0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">watch this video<\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>That said, one ad format has always been my favorite for retargeting and I use it every time I retarget on LinkedIn: Text Ads<\/span><span>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>While Text Ads might not be the most visually appealing format on LinkedIn, they can be great tools for retargeting ads. Unlike In-Feed Ads, Text Ads show up on the right-hand side of the LinkedIn interface.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-text-ads.jpg\" alt=\"linkedin remarketing - text ad example\" width=\"983\" height=\"479\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73545 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-text-ads.jpg 983w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-text-ads-980x478.jpg 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-text-ads-480x234.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 983px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>They\u2019re smaller, require a very different image type (typically just a logo or single point of focus shot) since it\u2019s so small, and the text is limited. Also, most users don\u2019t see them because they don\u2019t show up on all screens in the interface. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>So, to set your expectations, text ads typically have high impression counts, low clicks, and pretty terrible <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/expected-ctr\">click-through rates<\/a>. <\/span><span>While that sounds bad, Text Ads also (in my experience) tend to have much lower CPCs than any In-Feed format. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/03\/improve-conversion-rates\">Conversion rates<\/a> may be a little lower as well, but the overall cost per acquisition is typically much lower than with other formats. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>So while text ads might only drive smaller amounts of incremental conversions, they\u2019re also typically cheaper, which is never going to disappoint me. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span>5. Mix up calls to action until you find what works best<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>Just like with ad formats, it\u2019s important to change up the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/13\/call-to-action-examples\">call to action<\/a> you\u2019re using until you find the sweet spot for your different audiences. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Using the same call to action as your original campaign typically isn\u2019t a good idea. If the user didn\u2019t take action on it the first time, what makes you think they will the second time? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Additionally, LinkedIn retargeting is a bit of a different beast than other channels. Typically, very low funnel actions such as purchase or demo requests don\u2019t work too well here. On this channel, we need to target the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/15\/lead-magnet-ideas\">middle of the funnel<\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-funnel-graphic.jpg\" alt=\"linkedin remarketing - linkedin ads funnel graphic\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73547 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-funnel-graphic.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-funnel-graphic-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>Why the middle and not the top? <\/span><span>For a couple of reasons. <\/span><span>First, these users are already familiar with you to some degree, so a high-level brand awareness impression isn\u2019t really necessary. Second, paying LinkedIn\u2019s high prices for those brand awareness messages simply doesn\u2019t make sense. If you want to generate a bigger audience with those messages, use them either on another platform or targeting net new users on LinkedIn. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span>6. Control your rotation settings for your goals<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>Did you know that LinkedIn has a rotation setting for your ad creatives? <\/span><span>If you don&#8217;t, no worries. A lot of people aren\u2019t aware of it because it\u2019s a little hidden in the interface. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>In each campaign, on the ads setup tab in the editor, you\u2019ll find this gear icon at the top of the page.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-rotation-settings.jpg\" alt=\"linkedin remarketing - ad rotation settings\" width=\"972\" height=\"195\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73541 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-rotation-settings.jpg 972w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-rotation-settings-480x96.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 972px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>When you click on it, you\u2019ll be given the option to either optimize ads or rotate evenly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-ad-rotation-options.jpg\" alt=\"linkedin remarketing - ad rotation menu screenshot\" width=\"521\" height=\"650\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73544 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-ad-rotation-options.jpg 521w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-ad-rotation-options-480x599.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 521px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>Personally, I like to rotate ads evenly so I get to decide which <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-metrics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">metrics<\/a> are most important to me. If you use optimize, your ads will rotate in the beginning but will start to favor certain ads over time based on their performance. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Optimize might not sound bad, but my suggestion is for you to test what works best in your accounts. Despite being called \u201coptimize\u201d and trying to prioritize the ads with \u201cbest performance,\u201d the optimize setting doesn\u2019t always return the best results in my experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span>7. Always include five ads for full coverage<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>On the same tab in the interface, you\u2019ll see a message that tells you to <\/span>&#8220;create five ads to improve performance.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-linkedin-ads-recommendation.jpg\" alt=\"linkedin remarketing - linkedin ads recommendation screenshot\" width=\"900\" height=\"145\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73543 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-linkedin-ads-recommendation.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-linkedin-ads-recommendation-480x77.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>It suggests you should create five ads in your campaign so as to get a higher LinkedIn Ads performance. I agree with that on its own merits, but also because, at least for sponsored content ads, five is a magic number when it comes to ad impression counts. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>For sponsored content, if you have five ads in your campaign, you can show all five to each user in your audience over a 48-hour period. If you only have three to four ads, you\u2019ll only get three to four impressions for that same 48-hour period. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Other formats have differing impression counts for their respective frequency caps, but I used sponsored content as it seems to be the most popular.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If you\u2019re interested in using all the other formats and want a rundown on the number of creatives to use, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/linkedin-ads-frequency-caps-how-measure-show-aj-wilcox\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this episode of the LinkedIn Ads Show with AJ Wilcox<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span>8. Monitor reach and frequency to avoid ad fatigue<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>Even with frequency caps and proper audience sizes, it is still possible to wear out your welcome with certain audience members when practicing LinkedIn retargeting. <\/span><span>Two metrics that can help with that are Reach and Frequency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-reach-frequency-columns.jpg\" alt=\"linkedin remarketing - reach and frequency metrics\" width=\"787\" height=\"307\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73548 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-reach-frequency-columns.jpg 787w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-reach-frequency-columns-480x187.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 787px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>Reach is the number of unique users your ads were shown to during a given time frame. Frequency is the average number of times each user saw those ads during that same time period. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>You can find these numbers by adding their columns individually or by using the preset Delivery columns option. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Your mileage may vary on how far you can push these stats for your audience. I suggest checking on them whenever you\u2019re not seeing a good performance or if your creatives have been running for a while. It might be time to change up ad formats, messaging, the call to action, or some combination thereof. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span>9. Use manual bidding (and bid through the floor)<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>My last suggestion for your LinkedIn retargeting campaigns is focused on trying to make your clicks as inexpensive as possible. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>In each campaign type, you can choose manual <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/linkedin-ads-bidding\">bidding<\/a> as an option instead of max delivery or another strategy that\u2019s the default. <\/span><span>This allows you to choose what you want to bid in the auction for an ad impression.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-manual-bidding-example.jpg\" alt=\"lihnkedin remarketing - bidding options screenshot\" width=\"839\" height=\"332\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73549 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-manual-bidding-example.jpg 839w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/linkedin-remarketing-manual-bidding-example-480x190.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 839px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>I typically always start with a very low number, knowing that I will miss out on a few impressions, but also knowing that I will get the lowest average cost per click possible for my target audience. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Over time, if performance is strong, I can get more volume by increasing my bid and winning more auctions.
