For example, we recently saw two major Google algorithm updates roll out in October 2023 and March 2024, both focused on addressing low-quality or spam content. These updates can impact rankings over the course of the following few weeks or months, and many businesses have had to pivot their SEO strategy accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>To understand exactly how these updates have been affecting various sites, we talked to six experts to get their take on what they\u2019ve noticed so far and how businesses should pivot during these tumultuous times on the SERP.<\/p>\n<h3>Table of contents<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#google-core-algorithm-updates\">How the latest Google core algorithm updates are impacting businesses<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#how-to-prepare-for-google-algorithm-updates\">How to prepare for future Google core algorithm updates<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#google-algorithm-updates-tips\">What these expert takes on Google core updates have in common<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"google-core-algorithm-updates\"><\/div>\n<h2>How the latest Google core algorithm updates are impacting businesses<\/h2>\n<p>Here is the verdict on the latest major Google core algorithm updates\u2014according to our expert sources!<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc40 Looking for more SEO tips and insights?

Previously high-ranking content may have lost value<\/h3>\n<p>Taking a deeper dive into the updates, it\u2019s apparent that some content you may have not previously considered to be spam could now fall into this category inadvertently.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/search\/google-search-update-march-2024\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the March update announcement<\/a>, spam is categorized into three categories: scaled content abuse, expired domain abuse, and site reputation abuse. These types of abuse have become increasingly common in the SEO world over the past two years,\u201d said Goran Mirkovic, Chief Marketing Officer at <a href=\"https:\/\/freemius.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Freemius<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cScaled content abuse primarily targets the surge of mass-produced AI-generated content. Google&#8217;s policy explicitly states that it rewards high-quality content, regardless of how it is produced. The problem lies in the misapplication of AI, resulting in generic and low-quality content which is now overflowing the internet in every category,\u201d said Goran.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMeanwhile, expired domain abuse aims to end the misuse of expired <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/12\/domain-authority\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">domain authority<\/a> to host irrelevant and low-quality content. Google will penalize domains that are irrelevant when comparing their old content to their new content.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, site reputation abuse is Google&#8217;s attempt to combat \u2018parasite SEO,\u2019 which involves using high-authority websites to rank for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/12\/keyword-difficulty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">competitive keywords<\/a>. You may have noticed many big publishing sites hosting pages with titles like \u2018X best products\u2019 in an attempt to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/search-visibility\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gain visibility<\/a>,\u201d said Goran.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/google-algorithm-update-announcement.jpg\" alt=\"google core algorithm updates - announcement screenshot\" width=\"900\" height=\"459\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81736 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/google-algorithm-update-announcement.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/google-algorithm-update-announcement-480x245.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now, you might be thinking at this point that your business doesn\u2019t have content that falls under any of these three spam categories. However, other types of common website pages could still see a hit from these updates.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI&#8217;ve seen some sites begin to struggle with original content that they&#8217;ve copied and minimally altered,\u201d said Mark Irvine, Vice President of Search at <a href=\"https:\/\/searchlabdigital.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SearchLab<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor instance\u2014a client previously wrote a decent page about his services, no issues there. But the client then copied that content and published that same page for over 100 towns that he serviced\u2014only changing the city name for each page. That may have gotten him some small incremental SEO bumps when he first did it, but now we&#8217;re increasingly seeing even the original page get less and less traffic to it,\u201d said Mark.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/google-algorithm-update-multilocation-business.jpg\" alt=\"google algorithm updates - example of multilocation sites\" width=\"746\" height=\"486\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81741 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/google-algorithm-update-multilocation-business.jpg 746w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/google-algorithm-update-multilocation-business-480x313.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 746px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>In <\/em><em>this example<\/em><em>, individual site pages for each service location could potentially lose SEO value. <\/em><\/p>\n<h3>2. AI-generated content is seeing the biggest hit<\/h3>\n<p>Aside from unoriginal, expired, or disreputable content, varying AI-generated content is the primary reason we\u2019re seeing these updates from Google. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/05\/generative-ai-in-digital-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Generative AI<\/a> can be great for content ideation, brainstorming, and more. However, there are some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/28\/ai-for-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">serious risks involved with using AI<\/a> to scale your content and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/05\/seo-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO strategy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe biggest challenge I&#8217;ve seen is with clients who previously benefitted earlier in 2023 with an overabundance of easy (and often unoriginal) content. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/25\/ai-content-generators\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI-generated content<\/a> was a very fast and painless way to speed up filling out blog or site pages. In moderation, with the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/ai-prompt-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">correct AI prompts<\/a>, AI content can still be helpful,\u201d said Mark.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut the current large language models (LLMs) that drive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-copywriting-tools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">popular AI tools<\/a> borrow from the content and language that&#8217;s already published across the web. It&#8217;s difficult for AI content to contribute a unique or creative perspective that&#8217;s different from other pages across the web. These new updates penalize a lot of content that&#8217;s not very different from original sources,&#8221; said Mark.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the problem doesn\u2019t lie in AI-generated content itself. It seems Google is looking to strike a balance between the most efficient search results while maintaining that \u201chuman touch.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGoogle&#8217;s core updates always aim to improve the results being served to users. The latest updates are no different. As the internet is flooded with AI-generated content Google&#8217;s task has grown more difficult,\u201d said Milen Vasilev, Director of <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/search-engine-optimization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Digital Presence Implementation at LocaliQ<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey are aiming to keep their results more relevant through more granular weeding and accounting for more unique, quality content in which the \u2018human touch\u2019 shows.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udea8 Get a handle on how to use AI for marketing the right way with our free emergency guide to <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteAIinMarketingGuide.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_AIMarketing_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI in marketing<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h3>3. Competition has increased for some industries<\/h3>\n<p>How you approach your SEO content is going to depend on your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/niche-markets\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">niche market<\/a>. It&#8217;s more important than ever to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-make-your-business-stand-out\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">make your business stand out<\/a> within your specific industry.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGoogle isn&#8217;t just targeting AI-generated content. I&#8217;ve unfortunately seen several clients lose a lot of their organic traffic after previously partnering with a respected SEO agency that specializes in one particular vertical (agencies that just do SEO for lawyers, car dealerships, HVAC, etc.).<\/p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s updates strongly prefer original, unique content. Some agencies fall into the trap of writing a great piece of relevant content for one client but reusing it dozens or hundreds of times for their different clients,\u201d said Mark.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA good oil change page on a car dealership\u2019s site can bring a lot of great SEO value to your first client&#8217;s site\u2014but that same page reused a thousand times over begins to get ignored by Google, particularly after these updates.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d encourage clients to check the originality of their key site content. Open some of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/14\/website-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most popular website pages<\/a>, copy the first sentence, and paste it in quotation marks into the Google search bar. If Google returns hundreds of pages with the same wording, there&#8217;s no way that it&#8217;s going to prefer your page over any others.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/google-algorithm-update-similar-content.jpg\" alt=\"google algorithm updates - example of similar types of content on serp\" width=\"666\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81739 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/google-algorithm-update-similar-content.jpg 666w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/google-algorithm-update-similar-content-480x432.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 666px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/salemautobodyco.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>This auto repair shop website<\/em><\/a><em> has similar content to other adjacent businesses. <\/em><\/p>\n<h3>4. Some sites are seeing a decrease in traffic&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>One of the most noticeable impacts of the October 2023 and March 2024 core updates is the dip in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/14\/increase-traffic-to-my-website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">website traffic<\/a> some businesses have been experiencing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe&#8217;ve seen some dips in organic traffic and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/06\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keyword rankings<\/a>, more so with clients who&#8217;ve previously used AI to produce content at scale (with little human editing),\u201d said Allie Decker, co-founder at <a href=\"https:\/\/beomniscient.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Omniscient Digital<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBy the end of March, most of our clients had rebounded, and those pages that are still recovering have indicated where we need to optimize and update content.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/google-algorithm-update-traffic-chart.jpg\" alt=\"google algorithm updates - traffic drop chart screenshot\" width=\"785\" height=\"446\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81743 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/google-algorithm-update-traffic-chart.jpg 785w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/google-algorithm-update-traffic-chart-480x273.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 785px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/thread\/263667593\/sudden-drop-in-search-ranking-and-traffic-after-google-march-2024-core-update-need-help?hl=en#:~:text=But%2C%20after%20the%20Google%20Core,to%20potentially%20rectify%20the%20situation.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>An example<\/em><\/a><em> of a website traffic drop that aligns with the start of the March 2024 update. <\/em><\/p>\n<h3>5. &#8230;and others have only seen traffic fluctuations<\/h3>\n<p>On the other hand, other websites have only seen fluctuations in traffic and keyword rankings.

However, I expect to see some fluctuations in search results and a noticeable decrease in the visibility of what Google now considers \u2018unhelpful\u2019 content.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 Get more website traffic fast with our free guide to <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">proven strategies for driving more traffic to your website<\/a>\u2014no matter what updates roll out!<\/p>\n<h3>6. October 2023 and March 2024 updates are more complex than others<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019ve been struggling to get a handle on the recent Google core algorithm updates, it\u2019s not just you. Business owners, marketers, and experts have all agreed that changes to the SERP have become more unpredictable.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe organic landscape as a whole has changed substantially since the more rapid onset of core algorithm updates started in October of 2023,\u201d said Alex Chefalo, Senior Strategist at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.829studios.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">829 Studios<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis update is more complex than previous ones because it involves changes to multiple core systems, whereas previous updates focused on updating single systems. The main purpose of this update is to combat what Google identifies as \u2018spam\u2019 in the search engine results pages (SERPs),\u201d said Goran.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Specific industries may have been impacted more than others<\/h3>\n<p>Updates from Google over the past few months have impacted rankings across the board, but it\u2019s been found that some industries may be feeling the heat more than others.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe saw the <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/help\/helpful-content-faq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">helpful content update<\/a> roll out in September through October 2023\u2014this focused on the quality user-centric content and, on the flip, side weeding out AI-generated content,\u201d said Milen.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe also saw more core updates in October through November 2023 that shook up rankings a bit. In early March 2024, Google rolled out a core and a spam update. We saw the highest volatility in ranking in food and drink, beauty and fitness, and shopping industries (according to Semrush data). Home and garden sites also saw a lot of ranking shifts.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re in these industries, this doesn\u2019t mean you have to throw in your SEO towel altogether. However, it\u2019s important to know whether your business\u2019s vertical has a higher risk of impact from Google\u2019s updates. That way, you can better prepare and maintain a keen eye over your site\u2019s performance.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/google-algorithm-updates-home-and-garden.jpg\" alt=\"google algorithm updates - home and garden industry serp screenshot\" width=\"635\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81738 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/google-algorithm-updates-home-and-garden.jpg 635w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/google-algorithm-updates-home-and-garden-480x454.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 635px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>An example of how search results for the home and garden industry could vary. <\/em><\/p>\n<h3>8. The updates are impacting PPC, too<\/h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s not forget what shares the SERP with organic results: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/21\/how-to-run-google-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads<\/a>. While the core algorithm updates apply to organic search rankings, the same <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/2024-seo-trends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO trends<\/a> emerging from these updates have trickled into PPC. When one part of the SERP changes, every part of the SERP changes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the biggest things I watch for when a core algorithm rolls out is upticks in keyword variant matching,\u201d said Navah Hopkins, Brand Evangelist at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.optmyzr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Optmyzr<\/a>. \u201cWhile this is anecdotal, I tend to see a rise in close variant search terms with algorithm updates. Since Google Ads <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/03\/broad-match-type\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">broad match<\/a> behavior and organic search share a lot of the same technology, it makes sense they would impact each other.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy biggest advice is to keep an eagle eye on those search terms, as well as any rules you might have for negatives,\u201d said Navah.<\/p>\n<p>If you<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/11\/increase-online-store-sales\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> sell products<\/a> via organic search or Google Ads, consider trying <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/18\/google-merchant-center\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Merchant Center<\/a> (GMC) to secure more SERP placements.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cStarting with the SERPs, Google has been dedicating an increasing amount of space to rich results. If you are in the ecommerce space, making sure that you set up Google Merchant Center and add the relevant schema to your product pages should be a major priority,\u201d said Alex.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNot only does <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/22\/free-google-shopping-listings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GMC offer free listings<\/a> but they are constantly beta testing new ways to use these rich results. For example, I was looking at running shoes for a client. The SERP was an interactive rich result that allowed me to swipe left and right on styles I liked.<\/p>\n<p>While the end goal is clearly to get you into paid Shopping ads, taking advantage of the free GMC listings can be a great way to gain more value for your own business or (if you\u2019re an agency) your clients\u2019 business.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udcca Find out how your industry\u2019s PPC metrics may have also recently shifted with our latest <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteGoogleAdsBenchmarks2023.html?cid=Web_WS_incontent_guide_2023benchmarks_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incontent_links\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search ad benchmarks<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-prepare-for-google-algorithm-updates\"><\/div>\n<h2>How can you prepare for future Google core algorithm updates?<\/h2>\n<p>While changes coming from Google can sometimes feel unpredictable, one thing you can always count on is more to come. So, how can you be ready for the next major Google core algorithm update? Here are a few expert tips to help you prepare.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Continue to prioritize E-E-A-T&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>The four themes of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/14\/google-e-e-a-t\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">E-E-A-T (experience, expertise, authority, trust)<\/a> are the foundational pillars of any strong SEO strategy. While focusing on E-E-A-T may feel like a given, it\u2019s important to remember how sticking to the fundamentals during tumultuous times on the SERP can pay off.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe best way to prepare for future updates is simple: create high-quality, human-written content infused with fresh data, first-hand experience, and other E-E-A-T factors,\u201d said Allie. \u201cOptimize for the user\u2014think from first principles and build programs to serve your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/target-market-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">target market<\/a> (your current or potential customers).<\/p>\n<p>Know what your audience cares about, understand how they utilize and interact with search, and create content to meet them where they are. This is not only effective in the short-term\u2014Google appreciates topical consistency and fresh, quality content\u2014but it also builds long-term resilience in the form of an organic growth program. As a bonus, you won\u2019t have to panic every time there is an algorithm update,&#8221; said Allie.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;TL;DR: be patient and don&#8217;t try to &#8220;hack&#8221; the system. It never serves you well!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The hardest part of digital marketing is patience, but with dedication to E-E-A-T, your long-term SEO goals can still pay off.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe best bet is to start evaluating the quality of your content by ensuring it\u2019s optimized for EEAT,\u201d said Goran. \u201cIf you leaned on AI these last two years to get a lot of SEO stuff out, it\u2019s time to think about how to <a href=\"https:\/\/megawattcontent.com\/content-creation-with-ai\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">elevate the quality of that content<\/a>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/google-algorithm-updates-eeat-infographic.jpg\" alt=\"google algorithm updates - eeat for seo chart\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81740 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/google-algorithm-updates-eeat-infographic.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/google-algorithm-updates-eeat-infographic-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>2. Emphasize your site\u2019s UX and navigation<\/h3>\n<p>Beyond the basics of E-E-A-T, businesses should pay extra attention to how the user interacts with content.
