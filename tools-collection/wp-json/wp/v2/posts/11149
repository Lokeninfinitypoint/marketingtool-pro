Advertisers have neverending trends to capitalize on for the highest reach like TikTok\u2019s daily and dynamic trends, popular music, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/01\/how-to-go-live-on-tiktok\">TikTok Live<\/a>, hashtag challenges, trending dances, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/11\/how-to-stitch-on-tiktok\">Stitches<\/a>, and even <span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fanbytes.co.uk\/what-everyone-should-know-about-tiktok-duets\/#:~:text=TikTok%20Duets%20basically%20allow%20users,then%20can%20be%20shared%20publicly.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">duets<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">7. You can showcase products authentically on TikTok<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Something unique about advertising on TikTok is that it is authenticity-driven. In comparison to Instagram, where users tend to show off their best selves, TikTok encourages users to be their authentic selves, allowing people to broadcast their style, daily lives, talents, pets, stories, and creations while having the opportunity of going viral. Participating in TikTok\u2019s authenticity, rather than mimicking it, will drive your brand to success. Your business has the ability to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/10\/brand-awareness\">increase awareness <\/a>and showcase your products and services to users who have never heard of you before; and with the right messaging, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/30\/social-media-engagement\">increase engagement<\/a> too.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">8.\u00a0You can implement more effective video marketing on TikTok<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Now you might be saying, can\u2019t I just do <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/28\/facebook-video-marketing\">video marketing\u00a0on Facebook<\/a> on Instagram? Well, the answer is yes, but because TikTok\u2019s medium is solely video, advertisers have the ability to connect with users through the use of sound. With Facebook and Instagram, advertisers are usually limited to static images or short videos, and the average user is less likely to turn on sound when viewing an ad on these platforms. I&#8217;d encourage brands to use popular songs or sounds that are trending on TikTok so the ad feels native to the viewer. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">9.\u00a0TikTok is a great way to stay ahead of the social media marketing curve<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The reality is that TikTok is only going to grow more from here. With new updates to its site, TikTok has taken over <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/19\/social-media-for-small-business\">traditional forms of social media<\/a> and created a new wave of creativity among people of all ages looking to have fun, entertain, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/17\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok\">get more likes<\/a>, and connect with others.
