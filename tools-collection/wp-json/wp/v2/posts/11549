When properly optimized, it showcases your best features and makes it easy for consumers to discover, learn about, and contact your business. But in order to properly optimize your Business Profile, you need access to it, and in order to access it, you need to verify with Google that you are the rightful owner. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">While it seems as though it should be as simple as \u201cstep one create, step two claim, and step three verify,\u201d the process is neither that simple nor that linear\u2014which, if you\u2019re reading this post, you have already figured out. That\u2019s because it requires three different Google accounts and two different Google platforms, all of which have very similar names. Talk about a brain bender.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20create20and20verify20your20google20my20business20account20account20vs20listing.png\" alt=\"how to create and verify your google my business account account vs listing\" width=\"800\" height=\"461\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">So, in this post, I\u2019m going to first iron out for you exactly what&#8217;s what in Google, and then give you a clear-cut roadmap to creating a Google My Business account and using it to claim and verify your Business Profile on Google.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">Why create a Google My Business account?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Whether you&#8217;re a local mainstay or are just <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/12\/06\/small-business-ideas\">starting a business<\/a>, your Google Business Profile makes it easy for consumers to discover, learn about, and contact your business online.These are the core benefits of a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/08\/what-is-google-my-business\">Google My Business account<\/a>, and if that&#8217;s not enough to convince you, consider the disadvantages of <strong>not<\/strong> having one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">You risk losing customers.<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> Without a Google My Business account, you don\u2019t have control over the information displayed in your Business Profile, and according to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/research\/local-citations-trust-report\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BrightLocal study<\/a>, 68% of consumers would stop using a local business after finding incorrect information online.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">You risk a poor reputation<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">. Without a Google My Business account, you cannot respond to your Google reviews, which is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sterlingsky.ca\/turn-off-google-my-business-reviews\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mandatory section of your Business Profile<\/a>. And with reviews being both a Google ranking factor and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.meetsoci.com\/blog\/key-insights-from-soci-summit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">number one influence<\/a> on consumer buying, being able to manage them is a must.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">You lose out to competitors<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">. An empty or bare-bones Business Profile is akin to having an unkept storefront. If you don\u2019t take care of your business, how can consumers trust that you\u2019ll take care of them? They\u2019ll be much more likely to click on and engage with a Business Profile in the search results that has lots of attractive information and looks lively.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p><strong>\ud83d\udccd Are your listings optimized for local search?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Find out with our<strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/free-business-listings-grader\/?cid=Web_WS_InContentTextLink_Freemium_Listings&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Free Business Listings Grader<\/a>!<\/strong><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">You lose SERP real estate.<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> Google ranks Business Profiles according to their quality, and a Business Profile alone is not enough. A Google Business Profile managed through a Google Business account, however, can be <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/03\/google-my-business-optimization\">optimized to rank above competitors <\/a>for relevant keyword searches.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20create20a20google20my20business20account20why20you20need20one.jpg\" alt=\"how to create a google my business account why you need one\" width=\"800\" height=\"766\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">Which listing would you choose?

It involves two different Google platforms and three different Google accounts, all of which have similar names, and some of which you likely already have. So to get you off on clear footing, let\u2019s first iron out the terminology.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Google Account: <\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">This is the free account you create with Google so you can have access to Google Docs, Google Drive, Google Photos, Gmail, and more. Many call it their &#8220;Gmail account,&#8221; but Gmail is just one of the features; you can actually use any email to set up a Google Account. In this post, I\u2019ll use the term \u201cstandard Google Account\u201c to refer to this account type, just to avoid confusion. Most business owners already have two standard Google accounts\u2014one they use for their personal life and one they use for their business. <\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20create20and20verify20your20google20my20business20account20what20is20google20account.png\" alt=\"how to create and verify your google my business account what is google account\" width=\"1480\" height=\"988\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Business Profile:<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> This is your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/listings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free business listing<\/a> on Google that appears on Google Maps, the local results of Google Search, and the right-hand Knowledge Panel of Google Search.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/what20is20google20my20business20business20profile20in20maps20fresh20n20clean20dry20cleaning-3.png\" alt=\"what is google my business business profile in maps fresh n clean dry cleaning\" width=\"800\" height=\"552\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">An example of a Business Profile on Maps.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Google My Business account:<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> This is the free account you create that gives you a dashboard to manage and enhance your Business Profile.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20create20and20verify20google20my20business20account20google20my20business20dashboard_0-2.png\" alt=\"how to create and verify google my business account google my business dashboard\" width=\"800\" height=\"419\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">Your Google My Business dashboard.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">How to verify your business on Google<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Now that you have the proper terminology laid out, let\u2019s put the pieces together to form a full picture of the process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The <strong>goal<\/strong> is to gain full access to your <em>Business Profile<\/em> on Google. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The <strong>means<\/strong> by which you do this is your <em>Google My Business account<\/em>, which you sign up for using a <em>standard Google Account.<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The <strong>steps<\/strong> to complete the process are as follows:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Make sure you have a standard Google Account for your business.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Make sure you have a Business Profile.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Create a Google My Business account.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Request to claim your Business Profile.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Verify ownership of your business.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Now, with the groundwork laid out, you are armed and ready to successfully claim and verify your business on Google. The steps outlined below are written linearly, and in some cases, you\u2019ll need to skip down a step. But I\u2019d still encourage you to read them all carefully to avoid hitting roadblocks or creating duplicate accounts.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Step #1: Make sure you have a Google Account for your business<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This is the standard Google Account we described in the terminology section above. <strong>If you already have one (make sure it\u2019s not your personal-use Google Account), skip down to Step #2<\/strong>. If you don\u2019t have a Google Account for your business, follow the steps below.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">1. Go to <a href=\"https:\/\/accounts.google.com\/signin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">accounts.google.com\/signin<\/a>.<br \/>\n2. Click \u201cCreate account.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20create20and20verify20your20google20my20business20account20create20google20account_1.png\" alt=\"how to create and verify your google my business account create google account\" width=\"800\" height=\"589\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">3. You\u2019ll see a drop-down with two options. Choose \u201cTo manage my business.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20create20and20verify20google20my20business20account20manage20a20business_0.png\" alt=\"how to create and verify google my business account manage a business\" width=\"669\" height=\"468\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">4, Supply the necessary information.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Step #2: Make sure you have a Business Profile<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Your Business Profile is the official term for your Google business listing. As mentioned above, Google Business Profiles are separate from Google My Business accounts. A Business Profile can exist on its own, without Google My Business account. The problem with this is that the business owner has no control over the information in that Business Profile until they claim it, and this is done through Google My Business. Bottom line:\u00a0You&#8217;ll want to make sure you have a Business Profile to claim once you&#8217;ve set up your Google My Business account.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><strong>If you know you\u2019ve already created a Business Profile, skip down to Step #4.<\/strong> If you haven\u2019t created one or are unsure, follow the steps below. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Note: Even if you didn\u2019t create it, <strong>there\u2019s a good chance your Business Profile already exists. <\/strong>This is because a Business Profile is simply a place on Google Maps, which any person or computer can add. So to check and see if you need to create a Business Profile, follow these steps:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">1. <span lang=\"EN\">Go to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.Google.com\/maps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google.com\/maps<\/a>.<br \/>\n2. Search your business name.<br \/>\n3. <span lang=\"EN\">If your business name populates in the drop-down <strong>with an address next to it,<\/strong> this means your Business Profile already exists. Great! You can move on to Step #4.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20create20and20verify20google20my20business20account20check20maps20for20google20business20profile_0.png\" alt=\"how to create and verify google my business account check maps for google business profile\" width=\"600\" height=\"311\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If your business name <strong>does not <\/strong>populate with an address, select it and you\u2019ll see something like this:<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20create20and20verify20google20my20business20account20add20missing20place20the20token20shop_1-2.png\" alt=\"how to create and verify google my business account add missing place the token shop\" width=\"600\" height=\"383\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">4. Select \u201cAdd a missing place,\u201d and you\u2019ll see a screen like this:<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20create20and20verify20google20my20business20account20add20missing20place20form.png\" alt=\"how to create and verify google my business account add missing place form\" width=\"800\" height=\"476\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">5. Provide the requested information. Notice that you\u2019ll have the option to claim the business within that same window. Since you don&#8217;t have a Google My Business account yet, you&#8217;ll need to move on to Step #3. If you already have a Google My Business account, you can follow the prompts and you&#8217;ll end up at Step #5\u2014look at you go!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Step #3: Sign up for a Google My Business account<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The means by which you claim your Business Profile on Google is through a Google My Business account. Provided you have a standard Google account (see Step #1), here\u2019s how to sign up for a Google My Business account.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">1. Make sure you are logged into the standard Google Account for your business (and not the standard Google Account for your personal life).<br \/>\n2. Go to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">google.com\/business<\/a>.<br \/>\n3. Select \u201cManage now.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20create20and20verify20a20google20my20business20account20google.com3Abusiness.png\" alt=\"how to create and verify a google my business account google.com\/business\" width=\"797\" height=\"368\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">4. Provide the basic information Google asks for, including.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Business name\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/08\/business-name-ideas\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/08\/business-name-ideas\">(creative business name ideas here!)<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Address<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Website<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Phone number<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Delivery area (if applicable)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Category<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Once you connect this account with your Business Profile (the final step of this post), additional fields will open up in your dashboard so you can provide even more information about your business. This information is the key to optimizing your business for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/08\/seo-during-covid-19\">local SEO<\/a> and attracting more customers through your free listing.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Step #4: Request to claim your Business Profile<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This is where we start putting the pieces together. Unfortunately, creating a Google My Business account (from Step #3) does not automatically connect it to your Business Profile (from Step #2). You need to tell Google to connect them, and you do this by verifying ownership of your business. To do this, start by locating your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/02\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps\">Business Profile on Google Maps <\/a>or Google Search and requesting to claim it. You can do this one of two ways:<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Claim request method #1:<\/span><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">1. <span lang=\"EN\">Go to google.com and search for your business name and location. If your Business Profile appears on the right-hand side, find the \u201cOwn this business?\u201d option and select it.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20create20and20verify20your20google20my20business20account20own20this20business20arnos20cleaners.png\" alt=\"how to create and verify your google my business account own this business arnos cleaners\" width=\"800\" height=\"442\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">2. From there you\u2019ll be taken to a screen that says \u201cManage this business so you can reply to reviews,<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/09\/edit-update-google-business-listing\"> update info<\/a>, and more.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20create20and20verify20your20google20my20business20account20own20this20business20arnos20cleaners20manage20this20business.png\" alt=\"how to create and verify your google my business account own this business arnos cleaners manage this business\" width=\"800\" height=\"453\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>3. <span lang=\"EN\">Click \u201cManage now,\u201d and follow the prompts to claim your business. Once again, make sure you\u2019re logged in with the standard Google Account used for your business, and not for your personal life, referred to in Step #1.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Claim request method #2: Google Maps<\/span><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">1. Go to <a href=\"https:\/\/google.com\/maps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google.com\/maps<\/a>.<br \/>\n2. Type in your business name.<br \/>\n3. Click on your Business Profile, which will expand.<br \/>\n4. You\u2019ll then see an option to \u201cClaim this business.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20create20and20verify20your20google20my20business20account20own20this20business20arnos20cleaners20claim20through20maps-2.png\" alt=\"how to create and verify your google my business account own this business arnos cleaners claim through maps\" width=\"800\" height=\"458\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Clicking on \u201cClaim this business\u201d will then overlay the same screen you saw in the first method, but this time right over the map. <\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20create20and20verify20your20google20my20business20account20manage20this20business20google20maps.png\" alt=\"how to create and verify your google my business account manage this business google maps\" width=\"800\" height=\"431\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">4. Click \u201cManage now\u201d and follow the prompts. Again, make sure you\u2019re logged in with the Google Account you created for your business referred to in Step #1.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Step #6: Verify ownership of your business<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This is the home stretch! If you need to grab a Gatorade or some orange slices, I\u2019ll be right here when you get back. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">When you click on \u201cManage now&#8221; as instructed in Step #5, you\u2019ll be asked to provide information to prove you are the rightful owner of the business. Depending on the type of business you have, if you created the Business Profile and you\u2019re logged into your Google My Business account, you might get validated on the spot. If you aren\u2019t the one who created the Business Profile, Google will send you a verification code that you\u2019ll enter into your Google Business dashboard. Depending on the circumstances of your account\/security requirements of your industry, you may be given your verification code via regular mail, email, or text.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20create20and20verify20your20google20my20business20account20verification20pin20code.png\" alt=\"how to create and verify your google my business account verification pin code\" width=\"600\" height=\"438\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Once you receive the code and enter it into the box, you will have full ownership of your Business Profile on Google!
