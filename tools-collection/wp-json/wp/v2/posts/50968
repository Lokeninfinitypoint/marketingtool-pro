And with all the changes to more automation from Google, we haven\u2019t heard much on this metric (and what you can manually do to control it) for a while. But does that mean it no longer matters?<\/p>\n<p>I ventured out into the PPC community to answer this question (I have my own opinion, of course) and was pretty surprised by my findings. So read on to find out whether Google Quality Score still matters in 2025! But first, a brief refresher.<\/p>\n<h3>Table of contents<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#what\">What is Quality Score?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#how\">How does Quality Score work?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#one\">Perspective #1: Google Ads Quality Score does not matter<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#two\">Perspective #2: Google Ads Quality Score does still matter<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#improve\">How to improve your Google Ads Quality Score<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#update\">Is Quality Score going away?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#conclusion\">Is Quality Score still relevant?<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"what\"><\/div>\n<h2>What is Google Ads Quality Score?<\/h2>\n<p>Before we get into our predictions of Quality Score, let\u2019s first refresh on<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/10\/01\/quality-score-case-study\"> what even goes into a good Quality Score<\/a>. There are three components to Quality Score\u2014which is <strong>only assigned at the keyword level of standard search campaigns<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ad relevance:<\/strong> how closely your ad matches the search query. So, Google will be looking for your keywords in your ad copy. This is usually considered the easiest \u201cfirst step\u201d to improving your Quality Score because you can control your copy.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Expected click-through rate (ECTR): <\/strong>Google\u2019s determination of how likely your ad will be clicked on based on things like the query\u2019s intent matching to your ad and your historical CTR data. I would consider this the toughest part of Quality Score to improve on since it\u2019s up to Google\u2019s prediction of your likelihood of pulling in a click, so there\u2019s not much you can do to control this.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Landing page experience: <\/strong>how user-friendly and relevant your landing page is to the searcher. Google will be grading you on portions like page speed load, keywords on the page, relevance, and more. Depending on your resources, this could be considered easy to improve as well since you can hop in your own site to make tweaks to the copy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google takes those three factors and compiles them into a score of 1 through 10 (1 being the worst and 10 being the best). Since Google runs a tight ship, I usually see any scores 7 and above being absolutely amazing, 4-6 as decent, and anything below a 4 having room for improvement.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/google-ads-quality-score-as-auction-formula.jpg\" alt=\"google ads quality score - google ads auction formula graphic\" width=\"935\" height=\"355\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76215 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/google-ads-quality-score-as-auction-formula.jpg 935w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/google-ads-quality-score-as-auction-formula-480x182.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 935px, 100vw\" \/><\/div>\n<div id=\"how\"><\/div>\n<h2>How does Quality Score work?<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/quality-score\">Quality Score<\/a> impacts your performance because it helps Google determine your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/10\/24\/adwords-ad-rank-algorithm\">ad rank<\/a>. <strong>Your ad rank is your Max CPC bid x Quality score<\/strong>.

Two perspectives<\/h2>\n<p>There are two schools of thought when it comes to Quality Score, and we&#8217;re going to walk through them both in detail here.<\/p>\n<h3>Perspective #1: Google Ads Quality Score <em>does not<\/em> matter<\/h3>\n<p>Okay, I\u2019ll admit, as a<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing\/5-questions-to-ask-your-marketing-partner\/\"> PPC Consultant<\/a> I like to play devil\u2019s advocate as I\u2019m personally anti-Quality Score. There are a few reasons why:<\/p>\n<h4>1. It\u2019s not actionable<\/h4>\n<p>It\u2019s difficult to control and improve on because it\u2019s based on Google\u2019s algorithmic judgment. And Google doesn\u2019t give us much clarification on what specifically in our ads or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/06\/04\/quality-score-landing-pages-faq\">landing page<\/a> is causing a low score.<\/p>\n<h4>2. It\u2019s only applicable to search<\/h4>\n<p>Quality Score is <strong>only applicable to standard search campaigns<\/strong>. Why should search keywords be the only account component that gets held to this KPI? And with all of Google\u2019s development over the years, search campaigns are only small fish in a big sea of other <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/29\/google-ads-creative-studio\">media-heavy campaign<\/a> types like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/23\/optimize-performance-max-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Performance Max<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/18\/google-display-network-tips\">display<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/video-marketing-strategy\/\">video<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To me, this indicates that there are information gaps in what makes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/09\/google-ranking-factors\">Google\u2019s algorithm<\/a> tick when it comes to judging your other campaign types.<\/p>\n<h4>3. It isn\u2019t always correlated with performance<\/h4>\n<p>I\u2019ve seen folks get bent out of shape over a low Quality Score when their account is otherwise in great shape and hitting their goals. If you\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/22\/conversion-rate-optimizations\">pulling in the conversions<\/a> that you want at the cost you want, who cares if you have a low Quality Score? The last thing you want is to lose that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/24\/ppc-performance\">stellar performance<\/a> by changing something in order to appease your Quality Score column.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few examples from real accounts that back my points:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Missing data<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll see in the screenshot below that these keywords all have similar performance metrics. However, Quality Score data is often missing on some keywords, so to identify the differences between a six or a seven you\u2019re left splitting hairs.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/does-quality-score-matter-2021-quality-score-missing-data-example.png\" alt=\"example of missing quality score data in google ads reporting\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"720\" height=\"223\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Inconsistent scores<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In these next three keywords, they\u2019re all very similar to each other and go to the same landing page, yet only one gets the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/23\/google-ads-disapprovals\">\u201clow quality score\u201d status flag<\/a>, while the others all have widely different scores.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/does-quality-score-matter-2021-quality-score-inconsistent-account-data.png\" alt=\"inconsistent quality score account data in google ads\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"720\" height=\"304\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Score-performance mismatch<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/03\/most-valuable-keywords-high-ctr\">highest converting keywords<\/a> in this account, yet the score is only average.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/does-quality-score-matter-2021-quality-score-and-account-performance.png\" alt=\"google ads quality score average but performance high\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"720\" height=\"111\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h4>4. I\u2019m not the only anti-Quality Scorer<\/h4>\n<p>Aaron Babaa, Google Ads Manager at Above All PPC, also doesn\u2019t want to waste another minute staring at an arguably arbitrary metric. In his article <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/quality-score-dead-aaron-babaa\/\">Quality Score Is Dead!<\/a> he makes two points:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bot-driven scores are imperfect<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Aaron writes, \u201cRelevancy and landing page experience are bot-driven. That is, we are completely relying on Google&#8217;s bots to determine if our ads are relevant and if we deliver a satisfactory landing page experience. This system is imperfect. We know this because we have looked at plenty of ads that have low quality scores, but performed and vice versa.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>More score-performance mismatches<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Like me, Aaron has also seen stellar campaigns with low Quality Scores:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOptimizing for Quality Score often proves to be a wild goose chase. We&#8217;ve seen accounts with crazy-high CTRs, incredibly relevant ads, and beautiful, keyword-optimized landing pages&#8230; but terrible Quality Scores. We&#8217;ve even seen accounts where <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2010\/09\/07\/monitoring-search-results-for-brand-keywords\">branded keywords<\/a> (a keyword that is the name of the company and nothing more), show a Quality Score of 3.<\/p>\n<p>The system is clearly flawed.\u201d<br \/>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p class=\"color-pc-blue\"><strong><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Want to get the full picture on how to improve your Google Ads?

When I asked <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/mark-irvine-42\">Mark Irvine<\/a>\u00a0(PPC expert and Director of Paid Media at <a href=\"https:\/\/searchlabdigital.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SearchLab<\/a>) about his take on the matter, he had strong pro-Quality Score feelings. In fact, he started out by saying:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIs Quality Score dead? No, not at all.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Here are his reasons for thinking that Quality Score still matters:<\/p>\n<h4>1. Its impact remains unchanged<\/h4>\n<p>Mark starts off by pointing out that Quality Score is the same as it&#8217;s always been.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt&#8217;s still an equal factor in ad rank and ad rank still matters if you want to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/19\/get-on-first-page-google\">show up at the top of the SERP<\/a> (or at all). If you&#8217;ve got a poor Quality Score compared to your competition, that&#8217;ll hurt you as it did before. If you&#8217;ve got a great Quality Score, you&#8217;ll be better off! The math of that all still holds as it did in 2013 when it was WordStream&#8217;s anthem.\u201d<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/does-quality-score-matter-2021-quality-score-and-ad-rank.png\" alt=\"google ads ad rank formula\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"512\" height=\"51\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h4>2. Keyword intent has been redefined<\/h4>\n<p>Mark goes on to say that while Quality Score hasn\u2019t changed since 2013, everything else has:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt used to be that (in 90 characters of ad text) it was really easy to write a <strong><em>bad<\/em><\/strong>,<strong><em> irrelevant, low-quality<\/em><\/strong> ad. Quality Score was a very simple metric to evaluate how &#8220;good&#8221; that ad was, and a really useful guidepost to make sure that advertisers were thinking of how their ads matched the searcher&#8217;s intent.<\/p>\n<p>But since 2013, Google has tripled the size of its ads and added in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/06\/03\/adwords-ad-extensions-cheat-sheet\">customizable ad extensions<\/a>, new formats, and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/11\/responsive-search-ads-new-default-google-ads\">\u00a0responsive ads<\/a> to help testing at scale.<\/p>\n<p>No longer is the question &#8220;Does this ad match the search intent across <em>one keyword signal?\u201d<\/em> but rather &#8220;Does this ad match<em> this particular searcher&#8217;s intent<\/em> across <em>thousands of signals<\/em>, including keyword, device, operating system, time of day, demographic, [and more]?\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>3. The bar for \u201cquality\u201d has been raised<\/h4>\n<p>Building on his previous point, Mark says, &#8220;There used to be lots of advertisers writing bad ads, so it wasn&#8217;t difficult to write an ad with a good or great Quality Score to beat them all. Now, Google&#8217;s made it a lot easier for advertisers to write good (or at least not bad) ads.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s great for searchers and novice advertisers, but it raises the bar for everyone on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/21\/adwords-ads\">writing a truly great ad<\/a> with a significantly higher Quality Score. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/ppc-guide\/quality-score\/#close\">Quality Score still matters<\/a>, it just isn&#8217;t the silver bullet it used to be.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div id=\"improve\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to improve Quality Score<\/h2>\n<p>One thing we can agree on about Quality Score is the ways to improve it<\/p>\n<p>Mark\u2019s last point is in line with one of mine above regarding Google\u2019s lack of specificity as to what exactly you need to do to improve your Quality Score.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cQuality Score is still important and the tactics you take to improve it will continue to yield incremental results. But advertisers today are more interested in <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-strategies-that-complement-ppc\/\">PPC strategy<\/a> than they are in tactics, and that&#8217;s an exciting thing to see. Improving your Quality Score might still improve your PPC results by 10%, but improving your PPC strategy might 10x them.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em><strong>Improving your Quality Score might still improve your PPC results by 10%, but improving your PPC strategy might 10x them.<\/strong><\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>WordStream by LocaliQ Associate Director of Managed Services Holly Niemiec sums up this concept nicely:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve always viewed Quality Score as more of a &#8216;check engine light&#8217; for campaigns. Meaning yes, it can impact a campaign&#8217;s performance but isn&#8217;t the end all be all. Keywords with low Quality Scores can still perform well, and sometimes even better than higher Quality Score keywords. And competitor keywords will always have a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/19\/whats-a-good-quality-score\"> low Quality Score but can still convert well<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I think that making sure your ad copy and keywords are relevant and that you have a landing page that loads quickly is important, and if you have all of those things then that is more important than over-fixating on raising your Quality Score from a 5 to a 7.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div id=\"update\"><\/div>\n<h2>Is Google Quality Score going away?<\/h2>\n<p>Just to reiterate: no! As I mentioned in the intro and as Mark reinforces in his argument, the existence and math for Quality Score is still very much there and the same as it\u2019s ever been.<\/p>\n<p>I wrote this post not in response to any information Google has released (in fact, Google\u2019s lack of any news on this metric over the past 10 years makes me wonder&#8230;but I digress)\u2014but because clearly, I&#8217;m not the only one who has been wondering where Quality Score stands with Google and where it will stand in the future.<\/p>\n<div id=\"conclusion\"><\/div>\n<h2>So is Google Ads Quality Score still relevant?<\/h2>\n<p>So, you got two sides to the story today, and now it\u2019s totally your call whether you choose to focus on Quality Score or not. If you\u2019re struggling to get your ads to show up on the SERP,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/adwords-quality-score\">improving your Quality Score <\/a>can help.
