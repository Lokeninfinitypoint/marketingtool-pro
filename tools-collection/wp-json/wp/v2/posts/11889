As there are a number of factors that influence whether a reader takes action, there exists a plethora of copywriting formulas to help you cover all your bases. So which one should you use?<\/p>\n<p>Different formulas work for different goals, content types, and writing styles. To help you choose the best one for you, I\u2019ve gone straight to the experts. Read on to get the five copywriting formulas they use, why they work, and examples of each.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-facebook-ads-simple-language1.png\" width=\"492\" height=\"479\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Simple, effective copywriting from our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/29\/best-facebook-ads\">ad copy <\/a>blog post.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>What makes a good copywriting formula?<\/h2>\n<p>According to freelance copywriter <a href=\"https:\/\/articles.ibpa-online.org\/article\/a-new-copywriting-formula-the-4-cs\/\">Bob Bly<\/a>, the best copywriting formulas have a few things in common: They are easy to remember and to master, they can help new and experienced copywriters alike to quickly produce effective copy, and they also have successful track records\u2014in some cases, decades-long successful track records.<\/p>\n<p>So here\u2019s a look at some of the most common copywriting formulas out there\u2014and why you should consider them. (Just remember, anyone can use a formula\u2014it&#8217;s all in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/20\/copywriting-techniques\">technique<\/a>!)<\/p>\n<h2>Copywriting formula #1: The 4Cs<\/h2>\n<p>According to the 4Cs formula, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/22\/marketing-copy\">compelling copywriting<\/a>\u00a0has four characteristics: clear, concise, compelling, and credible. Let\u2019s break that down.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Clear:<\/strong> Your copy must be understood by everyone. As Bly puts it, you can make your writing clearer by using small words,\u00a0short sentences, headers, and bullet points, but\u00a0true clarity starts with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/17\/online-audiences\">understanding your audience<\/a> and your goals.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Concise:<\/strong> This is conveying information in the fewest possible words.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Compelling:<\/strong> Copy must also be interesting enough for your audience to actually read. The key? Focusing on the reader and their needs, problems, and desires.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Credible:<\/strong> Finally, your copy should be credible. Publish whitepapers, thought leadership articles, and customer testimonials. These content types can still communicate key brand messages while also surmounting reader skepticism.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/copywriting20formulas20credibility.png\" alt=\"copywriting formulas credibility\" width=\"600\" height=\"428\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Wealthsimple, an investment firm, uses credible copywriting to earn reader trust.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Copywriting formula #2: Problem, agitate, solution (PAS)<\/h2>\n<p>According to Maciej Duszynski, content writer at resume advice sites Zety and ResumeLab, this is an \u201cold school\u201d copywriting formula in which the writer <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/27\/design-thinking\">introduces a problem the reader experiences<\/a>, uses emotional language to hammer the issue home, and then offers a solution.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen used correctly, the problem, agitate, solution copywriting formula results in the reader\u2019s full attention,\u201d said Michael Tomaszewski, another writer at Zety.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey&#8217;ll be dying to find out what the solution is, and when you finally offer it\u2014and throw in a clear, concise, compelling and credible call to action\u2014 you&#8217;ll have generated great-quality leads, I guarantee,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, Benjamin Houy, founder of and self-study French course French Together, said PAS is his favorite copywriting formula because it\u2019s easy for even novice copywriters to use and \u201chas the ability to quickly turn <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/28\/pain-points\">prospects&#8217; problems<\/a> into powerful copy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe idea is to focus on a key problem prospects face, mention it with vivid examples, talk about it some more and finally offer a solution.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The following French Together newsletter email uses this copywriting formula and has helped generate hundreds of thousands of dollars in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/15\/ppc-agency-pricing\">revenue<\/a> for the French course:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/copywriting20formulas20PAS_1.png\" alt=\"copywriting formulas PAS\" width=\"300\" height=\"535\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>One point worth noting: Corina Leslie, PR manager for email validation company ZeroBounce, said that while she uses the PAS formula in emails and social media and it continues to yield results, she nevertheless suspects \u201cit\u2019s become a bit too popular among marketers, so people are less likely to react to it.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p>\u2734\ufe0f For help &#8220;agitating&#8221; with your ad copy, download our free guide:<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite120WordsforMarketingWithEmotion.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_120WordsPhrases_Download\">120 Words &amp; Phrases for Marketing With Emotion<\/a><\/strong><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h2>Copywriting formula #3: Before-after bridge<\/h2>\n<p>As an alternative, Leslie suggested the before-after bridge formula, which starts on a positive, aspirational note rather than the negative one in PAS.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt invites the reader to picture paradise\u2014and how to get there with your help,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use before-after bridge, Leslie said you have to know the audience\u2019s needs and wants and describe this in the first line. Then, you use examples to illustrate how other consumers have reached this ideal state\u2014and how the reader can get there, too.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBack up your claim by listing tangible benefits,\u201d she added. \u201cFinally, end with a powerful, irresistible call to action.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>(Speaking of which&#8230;have you downloaded our free guide? <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download\">The 36 Best Call to Action Phrases Ever<\/a>)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The following email, which uses the before-after bridge formula, is what Leslie described as their \u201cbest-performing email ever\u201d:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/copywriting20formulas20bridge20after20bridge.png\" alt=\"copywriting formulas bridge after bridge\" width=\"500\" height=\"419\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Shelby Rogers, content marketing manager at web experience platform Solodev, agreed before-after bridge works because it establishes a connection between the writer and reader, which, in turn, becomes a foot in the door for the rest of the copy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAfter making that connection, you show a solution \u2026 of what would be appealing to readers. Spend the bridge showing how your solution gets them from Point A to Point B,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve done your customer research before writing content, your Before section will grab your audience\u2019s attention with a relevant pain point.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Rogers said Solodev also uses before-after bridge in its CMS comparison guide e-books because one of the most consistent complaints they hear from prospects and new customers is that the CMS landscape is cluttered and confusing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe then offered a solution\u2014an easier way to comparison shop\u2014and used the ending to show a bridge to those comparisons,\u201d said Rogers. \u201cWe parallel the formula in our landing pages for the e-book downloads as well, and we\u2019ve found success with it. Our comparison guides remain the highest-downloaded e-book offerings on our website.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Copywriting formula #4: Attention, interest, desire, action (AIDA)<\/h2>\n<p>Bly said that <a href=\"https:\/\/articles.ibpa-online.org\/article\/a-new-copywriting-formula-the-4-cs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AIDA<\/a>\u2014Attention, Interest, Desire, and Action\u2014is one of the oldest copywriting formulas. Like the formulas above, it calls on the writer to: get the reader\u2019s <strong>attention<\/strong> with <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/13\/persuasive-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">persuasive writing<\/a>; attract the reader\u2019s <strong>interest<\/strong> in the related product or service; make that reader <strong>desire<\/strong> the product or service; and, in the end, call on the reader to take <strong>action<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Bly called it one of his favorite formulas and said he has used it for decades.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/03\/copywriting-examples\">good example of this copywriting<\/a> formula, look no further than tech giant Apple, which uses AIDA throughout its website to encourage consumers to join\u2014and expand their presence in\u2014its product ecosystem.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/copywriting20formulas20AIDA.png\" alt=\"copywriting formulas AIDA\" width=\"600\" height=\"278\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>Copywriting formula #5: Storytelling<\/h2>\n<p>While perhaps a less formal formula per se, Lou Hoffman, CEO of PR firm The Hoffman Agency, said his vote is for the anecdote because it\u2019s a tool employed by journalists in their stories, like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/02\/26\/business\/robots-retail-jobs.html).\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this one<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Billy Bross, consultant to digital agency Linchpin Media, also suggested what he called \u201cstories by default\u201d as a potential alternative to formulas.\u00a0He uses \u201cheavily story-based\u201d emails to his list five times weekly.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMany people pay lip service to the power of stories in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/03\/copywriting-examples\">copywriting<\/a>, but few actually\u00a0use them. It&#8217;s more an afterthought, \u2018Oh, I&#8217;ll just sprinkle in a story later,\u2019\u201d said Bross. \u201cI thought to myself, \u2018If stories work so well, why not use them by default? And then only remove them if there&#8217;s a good reason to.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>SEO Blogger Rob Powell of the Rob Powell Biz Blog also advocated for storytelling\u2014provided those stories include character, conflict, and resolution.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been telling each other stories for hundreds of thousands of years. It\u2019s part of our evolution. And that\u2019s why storytelling is so effective as a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/14\/ppc-ad-copywriting\">copywriting technique<\/a>,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the copy that you use on a landing page, the character could be your customer. The conflict would be the problem that she faces. And the resolution would be your product.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But Powell added that storytelling can also be about the company or the person selling the product.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn this scenario, the character is you, the conflict is the years of struggle and frustration that you went through. And the resolution is the aha moment when it all clicked for you&#8230;This is a formula that you see on many sales and about pages. It\u2019s a very effective way of positioning yourself as the solution to your customer\u2019s problems.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Powell mentioned that you can see this strategy in use from brands like Toms Shoes. Founder <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toms.com\/blakes-bio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Blake Mycoskie<\/a>\u2019s bio says, \u201cWhile traveling in Argentina in 2006, Blake witnessed the hardships faced by children growing up without shoes. His solution to the problem was simple, yet revolutionary: to create a for-profit business that was sustainable and not reliant on donations. Blake&#8217;s vision soon turned into the simple business idea that provided the powerful foundation for Toms.\u201d<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/copywriting20formulas20toms20story_1.png\" alt=\"copywriting formulas toms story\" width=\"500\" height=\"569\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Alice Corner, content writer at online infographic maker Venngage, said to take this a step further by embracing snark to sell your product in stories.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor example, when I&#8217;m sharing an article I&#8217;ve written on social, I would say something like, \u2018Women in tech don&#8217;t usually occupy leadership positions. But at Venngage, they do,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cObviously this doesn&#8217;t work for every business, but if the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/31\/brand-voice\">tone is right for the brand<\/a> it can be super effective.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Lean on these copywriting formulas when you need them<\/h2>\n<p>Copywriters might not always need formulas, but it\u2019s always good to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/17\/digital-marketing-skills\">expand your repertoire<\/a>. These formulas may be especially useful for new writers looking to enhance or even validate their style.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith experience, you&#8217;ll notice that your copy flows in a natural way and is in line with some (or most) actual formulas simply because you focus it on the readers&#8217; benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not to say that formulas, acronyms and other kinds of tricks are useless.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>These copywriting formulas are also helpful to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/15\/copywriting-tips\">get started copywriting <\/a>quickly.
