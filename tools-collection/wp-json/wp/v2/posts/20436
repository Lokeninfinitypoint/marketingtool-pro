Not so much.<\/p>\n<p>One thing leads to another (as they usually do) and he winds up in jail. Apparently, though, prison is an excellent <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/04\/productivity-for-content-marketers\">productivity hack<\/a> (no free Wi-Fi).<\/p>\n<p>While there, Gary decided to make the most of his incarceration by writing to his son.

But in reality they\u2019re so much more.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/copyhackers.com\/2015\/10\/copywriting-formula\/\">Ultimate Guide to No-Pain Copywriting<\/a> by the always excellent <a href=\"https:\/\/copyhackers.com\/\">CopyHackers<\/a> is a perfect example.<\/p>\n<p>Sure.

But it also introduces the hook from the get-go. \u201cRookies\u201d. \u201cWrite from Scratch\u201d. Formulas. The entire introduction is a lesson unto itself.<\/p>\n<p>The hook is: zen. The promise of a simpler, easier life.<\/p>\n<p>And then the meat goes through almost every single formula, including <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/22\/vintage-ads\">old-school class<\/a> ones, for almost every circumstance imaginable.<\/p>\n<p>Take testimonials for instance.<\/p>\n<p>People are installing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.technologyreview.com\/s\/544716\/the-fast-rise-of-ad-blockers\/\">ad blockers<\/a> faster than you can blink.

They\u2019re the living, breathing version of your buyer persona. People want to learn how those people ran up against challenges just like they face on a daily basis. And they want to know how they were able to overcome those challenges to reassure the money\u2019s a good investment, the time it takes is minimal, or the stress endured is worthwhile.<\/p>\n<p>About halfway down you\u2019ll find the TEASE testimonial formula, with an example from some handsome young man from 2013.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2c01fd12-59d1-49f4-8de9-de8bdaefe28b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/tease-testimonial-formula.png\" alt=\"tease formula for testimonials\" width=\"848\" height=\"812\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>And, of course, there\u2019s also more ad-specific formulas so you can see how <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/16\/copywriting-formulas\">a formula like PAS<\/a> can serve as a framework for your Google Ads or Facebook ad copy.<\/p>\n<h2>4. KlientBoost: The Landing Page Copywriting Blueprint<\/h2>\n<p>Ad copy is only as good as its landing page at the end of the day. Which means even if you come up with a great 10-word hook, you gotta stretch that out a bit for the page itself.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/klientboost.com\/cro\/copywriting-for-landing-page\/\">The Landing Page Copywriting Blueprint<\/a> from KlientBoost can help. There\u2019s a gifographic for starters (yay, no reading!). But more importantly it unveils the subtle nuances of copywriting for online ad campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>For example, what has the largest bearing on your campaign conversions?<\/p>\n<p>Simple: The <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/17\/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate\">offer<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The reason is because different offers (with different hooks for different levels of commitment) will appeal to different groups of people.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why pushing your salesy Facebook campaign to ice cold traffic fails miserably. You gotta <em>warm<\/em> those peeps up first with infographics, interest them with eBooks, and build trust with case studies before going in for the kill.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"9fddce56-43e1-47d2-ac34-69016c7fbc6b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/offer-lead-temperature-match.png\" alt=\"free writing tips\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>These considerations also dictate other things. For example, long or short landing page?<\/p>\n<p>Shorter is better for interested parties who just want the facts, while longer is preferable for brand new visitors.<\/p>\n<p>Point is: You can\u2019t copy-and-paste a copywriting formula and use it at random (no matter how good or timeless it might be). You have to exercise some judgment, consider the circumstances and context. Then you write.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Jon Morrow: His Posts.

All good and helpful. But ConversionXL takes it one step further, presenting a framework or process for actually sitting down (or standing up \u2013 sitting is the new smoking apparently) and writing copy.<\/p>\n<p>It kicks off by walking you through how to perform basic research on the customer, product, and competition. This prep work, truthfully, is where the gold lies.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s like that old <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/sales\/appliance-sales-lessons\">repairman<\/a> story. Takes them about five minutes to perform a task and bill a couple hundred bucks. The customer is appalled at the total.

Conversational. And he uses modern day examples as a frame of reference to help make intangible concepts concrete for readers.<\/p>\n<h2>11.

The idea of writing 2,000 words in a single sitting probably sounds like torture to most.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, Rachel retells her experience in upping that word count to over 10,000 in a single day.<\/p>\n<p>Why is this important? And what on Earth does this have to do with ad campaigns?<\/p>\n<p>Writing is everything.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/12\/01\/b2b-content-marketing\">top-of-funnel content<\/a> to bring in new search visitors. The eBook for your Facebook lead gen campaign. The long-form landing page that gets them to convert. The 10-part drip email campaign that nurtures and upsells.<\/p>\n<p>You wanna cut it in today\u2019s marketing world? You\u2019re going to have to do some writing.<\/p>\n<p>Penning that five-word headline and eight-word description for your ad campaign isn\u2019t the end of work for the day.
