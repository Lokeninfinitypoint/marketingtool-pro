Looking at data in aggregate can be misleading. Since running this study, we\u2019ve tested sentiment in some of our own ads, and were pretty surprised by the results.<\/p>\n<p>Today, we\u2019re going to dive into exactly what \u201csentiment\u201d can look like in <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/14\/evolved-text-ads\">AdWords creative<\/a>\u2014text or display\u2014and look at two examples of positive-vs-negative ad creative tests from WordStream\u2019s very own account (along with the results).<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ll share insights into what worked and what didn\u2019t during our sentiment-focused split testing, offering tips you can use to inform your own heart-tugging creative along the way.<\/p>\n<p>But first\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>What does sentiment look like in AdWords?<\/h2>\n<p>\u201cSentiment\u201d as I\u2019m using it here refers to an attempt to play on emotional triggers through ad creative.<\/p>\n<p>Most text ads you see atop the SERP live in \u201cneutral\u201d territory. When I search for Bluetooth headphones, I\u2019m served the following ad:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/neutral-sentiment-adwords-creative-search-network.png\" alt=\"neutral sentiment adwords search ad creative\" width=\"583\" height=\"105\" \/><\/div>\n<p>To the point? Sure. Loaded with pertinent information that may very well drive my decision to purchase? You betcha. Sentimental? Hell no.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that being devoid of sentiment or emotion doesn\u2019t make it a <em>bad<\/em> ad. Remember, half of all top-performing ads have neutral sentiment.<\/p>\n<p>Other searches, however, yield ads that <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/04\/nurture-marketing\">address a prospect\u2019s pain points<\/a> <em>and<\/em> a smattering of sentiment. Take this SERP for \u201cnetwork security software,\u201d for instance (brand-specific copy has been blurred):<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/negative-sentiment-adwords-creative-serp.png\" alt=\"negative sentiment in adwords search ads on the serp\" width=\"583\" height=\"458\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The ads in positions 1,3, and 4 make solid use of the search query and speak to the benefits of their individual solutions. There is nothing wrong with this approach. At. All.<\/p>\n<p>But take a look at the ad in position 2. Notice anything different (outside of the big red squares, I mean)?<\/p>\n<p>The language in the second headline represents what I\u2019d call a ZAG. Where the other text ads are a bit, well, bland, the ad in position 2 uses colloquial language (\u201cthis SUCKS mom, I don\u2019t wanna clean my room!\u201d) to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/11\/09\/emotional-ads\">make an emotion appeal<\/a>. It uses negative sentiment to say \u201cwe get it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>On the Display Network and in <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/01\/gmail-ads\">Gmail ads<\/a>, it can be much easier to convey sentiment because you can use image creative to do some of the heavy lifting. Case in point\u2026<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-display-creative-negative-sentiment-1.png\" alt=\"adwords display ad creative with negative sentiment 47% more effective\" width=\"394\" height=\"326\" \/><\/div>\n<p>^most definitely an example of positive sentiment, right? I jest.<\/p>\n<p>This advertiser saw a <strong>47% increase in CTR when implementing creative that leveraged negative sentiment\u00a0<\/strong>versus previous ads with positive imagery<strong>.<\/strong> (This proves that while only 2% of top-performing <em>text<\/em> ads in our study were emotionally negative, there will certainly be instances in which that isn\u2019t the case.)<\/p>\n<p>In the ad copy analysis I referenced at the beginning of this post, we used the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/cjhutto\/vaderSentiment\">Vader sentiment analysis tool<\/a>\u00a0in concert with Python\u2019s NLTK library to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) evident in our data set.\u00a0You don\u2019t need a fancy laser sword to implement sentiment in your own ads. You just need a bit of intuition.<\/p>\n<p>Consider your vertical,<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/01\/killer-underused-adwords-features\"> target demographic<\/a>, and the way your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/01\/facebook-competitive-advertising\">competitors talk about themselve<\/a>s. Use that information to formulate potential positive and negative ad creative, and begin testing. If this is your first go-around, you\u2019ll want to make sure that you conduct this sort of A\/B testing in a measured fashion.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAllen, <em>what does that mean<\/em>?!\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite120WordsforMarketingWithEmotion.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_120WordsPhrases_Download\">The 120 Best Words &amp; Phrases for Marketing with Emotion<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>A\/B testing for dummies<\/h2>\n<p>Because <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/20\/how-to-use-google-adwords\">AdWords is a fickle beast<\/a>, historical performance plays a massive role in present and future performance. As such, simply pausing your existing creative and replacing it with a brand new positive ad and an equally new negative ad will result in a bad time.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, test one sentiment-based variant against your existing ad copy for <strong>at least two weeks. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When I say \u201ctest against,\u201d I don\u2019t mean \u201cmaintain your existing ad rotation, insert new ad copy, and check on your account in a fortnight.\u201d You\u2019re a smart advertiser; if you\u2019ve found high-performing ad creative and aren\u2019t currently split-testing, you\u2019ve probably got your ad rotation set to \u201cOptimize for conversions.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This is not inherently bad, it just means that, by testing brand new POSITIVE ad copy against your top performing, probably neutral ad, you\u2019re hamstringing the former. You told Google to optimize for conversions and, historically, the ad that converts is the one that already existed. Google, such a good listener!<\/p>\n<p>Instead, before you push a sentiment-centric creative test live, be sure to adjust your ad rotation (which lives in the setting tab at the campaign level) to \u201crotate evenly,\u201d as shown below:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/optimize-adwords-ad-rotation-rotate-evenly-sentiment-analysis-1.png\" alt=\"optimizing adwords ad rotation for sentiment analysis\" width=\"600\" height=\"315\" \/><\/div>\n<p>From here, all you need to do is mark your ad variants with \u201cPositive\u201d and \u201cNegative\u201d labels; this will make reviewing data in the Dimensions tab possible, allowing you to view performance in aggregate (more advanced users can leverage the Experiments <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/23\/google-marketing-next\">feature in AdWords<\/a> to run complex A\/B tests, but for most, simply ensuring even ad rotation and using labels is more than enough).<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-custom-labels-ad-level-sentiment-testing.png\" alt=\"adwords custom labels for sentiment analysis\" width=\"221\" height=\"58\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Now you know:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What sentiment is<\/li>\n<li>How it can impact ad performance<\/li>\n<li>How to rotate ad copy like a savvy veteran<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I\u2019d say you\u2019re ready to dig into some examples!<\/p>\n<h2>Example #1: Testing Sentiment in Search Ad Creative<\/h2>\n<p>At WordStream we have a pretty valuable tool called the <a href=\"\/google-adwords\">AdWords Performance Grader<\/a>. You may have heard of it. In fact, a lot of people have.<\/p>\n<p>This results in some significant search volume for the keyword \u201cAdWords performance grader.\u201d Why is this particularly valuable? Well, aside from it being the moniker of a tool we own (ostensibly making it a branded term), it also conveys some great search intent.<\/p>\n<p>Think about it.<\/p>\n<p>Why would someone search for an AdWords performance grader? Probably because they think their AdWords account could perform more efficiently, right? This is a scenario that begs for ad copy that speaks to sentiment.<\/p>\n<p>For the longest time, we implemented negative ad creative, like so:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/negative-sentiment-adwords-search-ad-outperforming-positive-sentiment-1.png\" alt=\"negative sentiment adwords search ad outperforming positive sentiment ad\" width=\"524\" height=\"70\" \/><\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s not as though the ad calls prospects dolts by any means, but there\u2019s an unsubtle implication that the searcher has been doing something wrong: they\u2019ve been \u201cwasting money in AdWords.\u201d Once our data said that top performing ads tended to lean more towards positivity, though, we thought it high time to test our top performer against something more uplifting.<\/p>\n<p>(Note that, since the ad conveying negative sentiment was the incumbent, we didn\u2019t test it against a neutral ad.)<\/p>\n<p>Between July 7 and July 31, we ran the \u201cStop Wasting Money in AdWords\u201d ad against this beauty:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/positive-sentiment-adowrds-search-ad-split-testing-wordstream-account.png\" alt=\"adwords positive sentiment ad creative search ad underperforming\" width=\"527\" height=\"71\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As you can see, this variant exudes positivity from every syllable. Instead of telling prospects to stop <em>wasting<\/em>, they are encouraged to <em>get the most out of<\/em>. These phrases are ostensibly conveying the same idea framed with differing sentiments.<\/p>\n<p>Which do you think performed better during that three(ish) week period?<\/p>\n<p><strong>The negative ad had a Conversion Rate 18.8% higher than the positive ad<\/strong>. This is a pretty ridiculous difference, but it\u2019s nothing compared to what we saw in terms of click through rate:<strong> the negative ad\u2019s CTR was 67.29% better than the positive ad\u2019s CTR<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>What does this tell us?<\/p>\n<p>Well, when it comes to their ad spend, people just aren\u2019t into positivity.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p><strong>\u2734\ufe0f\u00a0 Want even more ad copywriting tips?

Concept, color, and copy can all have significant impact on performance. Adding a healthy dose of sentiment to the mix can make thigs reallllly interesting.<\/p>\n<p>To discover the potential impact of positive and negative sentiment in image ad creative, we decided to run two comparable creative concepts using Gmail ads \u2013 on the positive side, a smiling swine being filled with coinage; on the negative side, a broken boar whose cash innards are fluttering into the ether. We ran this test in two exclusive audiences during the entire month of June.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the creative, for reference:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/testing-ad-creative-sentiemnt-display-network-gmail-ads1.png\" alt=\"testing display ad creative adwords sentiment analysis\" width=\"700\" height=\"445\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As you can see, the copy here is quite close to what we used in the text ad sentiment test. The results, however, could not have been more disparate. The positive ad drove an astounding <strong>50% more conversions than the negative ad.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>What does this tell us? Well, that people generally dislike dead cartoon pigs! Duh.<\/p>\n<p>On a more serious note, these results speak to the fact that image creative can play a pivotal role in establishing sentiment and, thus, driving results.<\/p>\n<p>(Note: We realize that there are a lot of differences between the two ads; sometimes changing the button copy alone is enough to alter the results of a test. If you want to be absolutely sure that you know what\u2019s driving the improvement in performance between tests, only change one variable at a time.)<\/p>\n<h2>The Upshot<\/h2>\n<p>As you can see from these tests, when it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite120WordsforMarketingWithEmotion.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_120WordsPhrases_Download\">marketing with emotion<\/a> there\u2019s no hard and fast rule that says positive sentiment always works better in text ads or negative sentiment always works better in display. It depends on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/29\/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks\">your industry,<\/a> your target audience, the offer in question and countless other variables. So you should always test rather than assume.<\/p>\n<p>The key takeaway is that changing the sentiment in your ads, whether it\u2019s from positive to negative or vice versa, or from neutral to a more pronounced emotion, can make a big difference in your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/24\/adwords-ctr-secrets\">CTR and conversion rates<\/a>.
