We turn to Google for so many things, from health concerns to hose patches to houses for sale.\u00a0 This, of course, gives businesses an abundance of opportunities to get in front of their target audience.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/keyword-intent-funnel-example.png\" alt=\"keyword intent funnel\" width=\"575\" height=\"473\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-63347\" \/>But just as diverse as your search history is the intent behind the keywords your potential customers are searching online. Commercial intent keywords are the most valuable to your business, but they are not one-size-fits all. In this article, we\u2019re going to look at what commercial intent keywords are and how to use them to make the most of your marketing budget.<\/p>\n<h3>Table of contents<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#what\">What are commercial intent keywords?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#why\">Why is keyword intent important?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#examples\">Examples of commercial intent keywords<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#vs\">Keyword volume vs intent<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#how\">How to find them for your business specifically\u00a0<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What are commercial intent keywords?<\/h2>\n<p>Commerical intent keywords are those typed into search engines by consumers looking to buy or educate themselves in order to buy. Put another way, they are basically invitations from prospective customers to tempt them with your wares. They tell you, loud and clear, that they have money in their hands (or burning holes in their pockets), and they want what you\u2019re selling.<\/p>\n<p>For context, there are four <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/12\/10\/three-types-of-search-queries\">types of search queries<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/04\/keyword-intent-four-types.png\" alt=\"the four types of keyword intent\" width=\"720\" height=\"441\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-61610\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/04\/keyword-intent-four-types.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/04\/keyword-intent-four-types-480x294.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Informational:<\/strong> answer questions or learn something<\/li>\n<li><strong>Navigational: <\/strong>locate a specific website<\/li>\n<li><strong>Transactional:<\/strong> buy something<\/li>\n<li><strong>Commercial:<\/strong> explore\/investigate in order to buy<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Commercial and transactional keywords often overlap, and if you think of keywords as signals from prospective customers, these are the most promising.<br \/>\n<a><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>The importance of keyword intent<\/h2>\n<p>Keywords come in all shapes in sizes. While they all have one thing in common\u2014that they&#8217;re entered into search engines by consumers\u2014they differ widely in what the user is trying to achieve when they search it. This is what we mean by keyword intent. For example, someone searching &#8220;do i need a lawyer?&#8221; has different intent than someone searching &#8220;workers compensation lawyer san diego.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As such, how you choose to get in front of your target audience for any given keyword needs to align with the intent of that keyword. For the former, you might target that keyword with an organic blog post or checklist. Your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/01\/content-marketing-funnel\">content marketing funnel<\/a> enables you to get in front of the customer early, make a good impression, and build trust. Maybe later on, they&#8217;ll come back when they need you.<\/p>\n<p>For the latter, this person is more likely to be a hot lead, and this is a perfect use-case for PPC, because you can be sure your targeted ad is right at the top of the search results, and you\u2019re willing to pay to make sure you get the lead.<\/p>\n<p>So if you&#8217;re looking to succeed with your<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/26\/intent-marketing\"> intent marketing<\/a>, what kinds of keywords can be considered to have high commercial intent?<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p><strong>\ud83d\udd25 Which keywords are burning your budget? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Get a free account audit with our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a> to find out!\n<a><\/a><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h2>Examples of commercial intent keywords<\/h2>\n<p>Although there are many commercial intent keywords, some are \u201cstronger\u201d than others.<\/p>\n<p>Firstly, there are two main categories of keywords with high commercial intent: \u201cbuy now\u201d keywords and \u201cproduct\u201d keywords. Let\u2019s take a look at what this means and how they differ.<\/p>\n<h3>Investigative commercial intent keywords<\/h3>\n<p>These are the words and phrases a person will use when they&#8217;re solution- or brand-aware and are looking to learn more about their options. Keyword modifiers for these types of searches include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Affordable<\/li>\n<li>Best<\/li>\n<li>Cheapest<\/li>\n<li>Comparison<\/li>\n<li>Review<\/li>\n<li>Top<\/li>\n<li>Vs<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/commercial-intent-search-example-crm.png\" alt=\"SERP for a commercial intent keyword search - &quot;best CRM for small business&quot;\" width=\"720\" height=\"425\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63268\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/commercial-intent-search-example-crm.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/commercial-intent-search-example-crm-480x283.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Buy now commercial intent keywords<\/h3>\n<p>These are technically transactional intent keywords, but like I said earlier, transactional and commercial can overlap. This category of keywords signals that the prospect, as the name implies, is ready to buy something or engage right now. They\u2019ve made up their mind to buy, and they\u2019re looking for an attractive offer that meets their expectations.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBuy now\u201d keywords include terms like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buy<\/li>\n<li>Order<\/li>\n<li>Discount(s)<\/li>\n<li>Deal(s)<\/li>\n<li>Coupon(s)<\/li>\n<li>Free shipping<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&#8220;Buy&#8221; and &#8220;order&#8221; are the strongest, as this is a prospect\u2019s pure declaration of intent to part ways with their cash in exchange for whatever you\u2019re selling. The others are also strong buying signals, but also indicate that the prospect wants or expects you to differentiate yourself from your competition in the form of incentives.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/commercial-intent-keyword-example-buy.png\" alt=\"commercial intent search example for &quot;buy potting soil&quot;\" width=\"720\" height=\"383\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63266\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/commercial-intent-keyword-example-buy.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/commercial-intent-keyword-example-buy-480x255.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Local commercial intent keywords<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that some keywords have both commercial and local intent, like<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open now<\/li>\n<li>Near me<\/li>\n<li>[Product\/service name] + location<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/local-commercial-intent-keyword-example.png\" alt=\"local commercial intent keyword example\" width=\"720\" height=\"522\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63334\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/local-commercial-intent-keyword-example.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/local-commercial-intent-keyword-example-480x348.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>These keywords can apply to keyword bidding in Google ads, but other ways to capitalize on these queries are through <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/local-marketing-lab\/seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">local SEO<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/11\/google-local-services-ads-tips\">Google Local Services Ads<\/a>.

Although these keywords typically convert highly, prospects may be slightly more hesitant to purchase immediately than those using \u201cbuy now\u201d keywords.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cProduct\u201d keywords include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Branded searches (Dell laptop)<\/li>\n<li>Specific products (iPhone 5c)<\/li>\n<li>Product categories (insect repellant, beach accessories)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Commercial intent keywords for services include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rent<\/li>\n<li>Hourly rate<\/li>\n<li>Consultation<\/li>\n<li>Free trial<\/li>\n<li>Service, agency, company, firm (tax prep services, advertising company)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/commercial-intent-keyword-example-service.png\" alt=\"SERP for a commercial intent search for &quot;advertising services&quot;\" width=\"720\" height=\"410\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63269\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/commercial-intent-keyword-example-service.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/commercial-intent-keyword-example-service-480x273.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Some of these keywords will be more valuable than others, depending on the nature of your business. For example, product-specific keywords and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/03\/19\/why-bid-on-branded-terms-ppc\">branded keywords<\/a> are savagely competitive, but convert very well. Although \u201ccomparison\u201d and \u201creview\u201d keywords may not seem as strong as some of the others, these keywords can still convert highly as the intent to purchase is still there \u2013 the prospect might just make you work harder for the conversion.<\/p>\n<h4>Lead vs product searches<\/h4>\n<p>When creating a list of product keywords, it\u2019s important to note the distinction between lead and product searches. For example, in the lawyer example below, the prospect isn\u2019t looking to hire a lawyer right away. This means that although the prospect is considered a hot lead, the potential customer probably still needs to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/24\/call-tracking-software\">call the business<\/a> to discuss their situation further.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/commercial-intent-keyword-search-lawyer.png\" alt=\"commercial intent keyword example - search for &quot;criminal justice lawyer&quot;\" width=\"720\" height=\"544\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63267\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/commercial-intent-keyword-search-lawyer.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/commercial-intent-keyword-search-lawyer-480x363.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For these reasons, \u201cbest\u201d might be considered the strongest product keyword for a service-based business like a workman\u2019s comp attorney (as well as \u201cfree consultation\u201d). Product searches, on the other hand, can be completed entirely online and focus solely on a specific product, so product keywords such as \u201caffordable\u201d and \u201ccheapest\u201d are likely to be the most effective (and highly competitive).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/consultation-SERP.png\" alt=\"SERP for a consultation keyword search\" width=\"720\" height=\"518\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63337\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/consultation-SERP.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/consultation-SERP-480x345.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\n<a><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Why are commercial intent keywords more valuable than high-volume keywords?<\/h2>\n<p>Some businesses spend thousands of dollars to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/17\/website-visibility\"> maximize their visibility<\/a>. This is all well and good, and high traffic is always a good thing, but if the vast majority of your visitors aren\u2019t buying what you\u2019re selling, it might be time to reconsider your approach.<\/p>\n<p>Unless you\u2019re one of those ad-supported <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/15\/clickbait\">clickbait<\/a> sites like BuzzFeed, high-traffic keywords aren&#8217;t worth much unless they\u2019re driving conversions. This isn&#8217;t to say you shouldn&#8217;t go after big keywords with less commercial intent, but it makes more sense to target these keywords with organic content that is higher up in the purchasing funnel.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/keyword-volume-vs-intent.png\" alt=\"keyword volume vs intent\" width=\"720\" height=\"455\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63345\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/keyword-volume-vs-intent.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/keyword-volume-vs-intent-480x303.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, high commercial intent keywords are best suited to paid search campaigns for a few reasons:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Paid search ads get you placement at the very top of the page<\/li>\n<li>You can make tweaks and adjustments to optimize for cost per click, cost per lead, cost per conversion and other metrics<\/li>\n<li>Ad types like <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/14\/google-shopping-ads\">Shopping Ads<\/a> are highly attractive to searchers with commercial intent and tend to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/06\/05\/product-listing-ads-stealing-conversions\">get the clicks from people who are ready to buy<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Note that while you can&#8217;t target keywords with shopping ads, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/25\/google-shopping-ads-priority-bidding-structure\">structure your campaigns out using the priority feature<\/a> so that Google will adjust your bids based on intent.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-shopping-priority-bidding-structure.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"715\" height=\"497\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-50683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-shopping-priority-bidding-structure.png 715w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-shopping-priority-bidding-structure-480x334.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 715px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a><\/a><a><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>How to find high commercial intent keywords<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to keywords with strong commercial intent, one size definitely doesn\u2019t fit all, so how do you go about identifying these keywords in the first place? There are several ways you can begin to identify high commercial intent keywords, regardless of what kind of business you run or your desired conversion outcomes. Let\u2019s take a look at a couple of them.<\/p>\n<h3>1. WordStream&#8217;s Free Keyword Tool<\/h3>\n<p>To kick off your keyword research, you can use <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">WordStream&#8217;s Free Keyword Tool<\/a><\/strong>. Simply enter a seed keyword into the search box and include your industry and location (optional).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/free-keyword-tool-search-example.png\" alt=\"wordstream free keyword tool search example\" width=\"720\" height=\"398\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63271\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/free-keyword-tool-search-example.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/free-keyword-tool-search-example-480x265.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Then you&#8217;ll get results with monthly search volume, top-of-page bid, and competition.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/free-keyword-tool-results-example.png\" alt=\"wordstream free keyword tool results example\" width=\"720\" height=\"514\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63270\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/free-keyword-tool-results-example.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/free-keyword-tool-results-example-480x343.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>2. Google Ads Keyword Planner<\/h3>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the Google Ads Keyword Planner is one of the best ways to identify commercial intent keywords. Access it from the \u201cTools and Settings\u201d tab then select \u201cDiscover new keywords.&#8221;<br \/>\nNow, enter your product or service in the search field. For this example, I used \u201cbuy iPhone,\u201d a fiercely competitive product-specific keyword. After a moment, you\u2019ll be presented with a graph of search volume trends (notice the spike in September when Apple holds its annual event).<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/google-ads-keyword-planner-results-iphone.png\" alt=\"google keyword planner results for iphone\" width=\"720\" height=\"433\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63339\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/google-ads-keyword-planner-results-iphone.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/google-ads-keyword-planner-results-iphone-480x289.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/div>\n<p>But if you scroll down, you&#8217;ll see keyword ideas where you can identify the high commercial intent keywords you\u2019re interested in.<\/p>\n<p>In the following figure, notice how \u201cbuy iphone\u201d\u00a0 and &#8220;cheap iphones&#8221; have the highest suggested bids, by far?

If you don\u2019t see any, it might be time to start adding some of these keywords in your Google Ads account.<\/p>\n<p>Even if your top-performers are doing well, how much better could your conversion rate be if you targeted high commercial intent keywords as well?
