It allows you to measure the results of some on page action (like, say, a form fill in a light box or a product added to a shopping cart) by wrapping that action in code; upon completion, a conversion is recorded without bringing your prospect to a new page.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s super versatile and, in some cases, necessary for account success.<\/p>\n<p>In this post I\u2019m going to walk you through the complete process of setting up custom event tracking for your Google Ads\u00a0account, from establishing and importing Google Analytics goals to creating your custom event code and, finally, implementing it on your site.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Ready to find out where your Google Ads budget is going to waste? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AdWordsGrader_AWGrader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get a free account audit with our Google Ads Performance Grader today!<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Custom Event Tracking: What Is It and Why Does It Matter?<\/h2>\n<p>Event tracking is a way to record certain user interactions on your website. Depending on your business, some of these actions could be worth optimizing for in Google Ads. Some examples of events that can be tracked are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Button clicks (the most common, and the once we will be discussing today)<\/li>\n<li>Downloads<\/li>\n<li>Log-ins<\/li>\n<li>Adding an item to a shopping cart<\/li>\n<li>Social sharing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Setting up a custom event to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/13\/tracking-conversions-in-adwords\">track conversions<\/a> is not as easy as setting up a Goal using a destination URL (the way most lead gen conversions are recorded) but it isn\u2019t as scary as it sounds.<\/p>\n<p>If you use a lightbox or any other type of dynamic on-page pop-up as the host for a form fill, you\u2019ve certainly asked yourself how to track form fills that are not pushed through to a \u201cThank You\u201d page. Here is an example of a lightbox form fill pop-up that does not push through to a \u201cThank You\u201d Page when filled out:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"248fb5f3-885a-49ca-a0d5-cf395911ee12\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/light-box-form-fill-custom-conversion.png\" alt=\"example of a light box form fill with no landing page\" width=\"800\" height=\"502\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Screenshot courtesy of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.everyusb.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EveryUSB<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Now, some would argue that they do not have a need to create a goal on form fills because they can track leads in their CRM.<\/p>\n<p>While it<em> is<\/em> important to pull this data into your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/12\/12\/agency-tools\">CRM to collect leads<\/a>, I would argue that it is equally (maybe even more) important to be able to track these leads as conversions in your Analytics &amp; Google Ads\u00a0accounts. This is what will allow you to make those essential data backed decisions in your Google Ads\u00a0account. So basically I\u2019m saying\u2026<\/p>\n<p><strong>Please don\u2019t <em>not<\/em> implement custom events. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re capturing value (whether that\u2019s new leads or purchases) without the use of \u201cThank You\u201d pages, custom events are the only way to record vital data that represents performance and, as a result, the success of your business. Once you\u2019ve set up a custom event goal in Analytics and added its code to your site (more on that in a minute), you will be able to track this information in Google Ads. This provides direction as to which areas of your account are successful already and which ones are falling short. Since you\u2019re spending money on advertising, this is, you know, pretty important.<\/p>\n<p>With that\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>Building and Implementing Your Custom Event Tracking Code<\/h2>\n<p>There are a few options when it comes to creating custom event tracking templates but <a href=\"https:\/\/raventools.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Raven Tools<\/a> is my favorite (and it\u2019s free $$). Head on over to their free <a href=\"https:\/\/raventools.com\/marketing-reports\/google-analytics\/event-tracking\/general-event\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GA Event Tracking Code<\/a> page to get started.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t be intimidated by the custom form fields: you could literally type in anything you wanted to and it would work. I would recommend inputting text that can help you identify the specific goal you\u2019re creating. This will help avoid any confusion in the future if you happen to build out multiple events.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d5fd88a4-3793-4786-828d-4c86494d5edd\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/event-tracking-code-builder-custom-event.png\" alt=\"event tracking code builder for custom events\" width=\"800\" height=\"394\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Only the first two fields, \u201cGeneral Category\u201d and \u201cGeneral Action,\u201d are required for you to be able to move on to the next step.<\/p>\n<p>In my example (above) I used \u201cForm Fill\u201d as the General Category because\u2026you guessed it\u2026 I\u2019m tracking a form fill as the conversion. Feel free to use anything you think would help identify the goal. In the past I have used; \u201cSubmit,\u201d \u201cLead Capture,\u201d \u201cForm Submission,\u201d Etc.<\/p>\n<p>In the \u201cGeneral Action\u201d field, I used \u201cClick\u201d because this is the action being taken to trigger the conversion.<\/p>\n<p>The 3rd section, \u201cGeneral Label,\u201d is optional and not needed to move on to the next step. It is helpful however if you have multiple landing pages and you want to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/15\/google-analytics-tips\">track individual goals in Google Analytics <\/a>\u00a0for each landing page. It can also be helpful if you offer more than one service\/product and want to segment goals out accordingly. In my example I just wrote \u201cLanding Page XYZ.\u201d Try using something that will help you identify the landing page where the goal is taking place.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3c1e5afa-84ea-480b-a364-2d4dab097743\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/identify-landing-pages-custom-event-tracking.jpg\" alt=\"identify landing page-free events to create custom conversion tracking for\" width=\"660\" height=\"315\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The \u201cGeneral Value\u201d field is one that I rarely use but can come in handy in certain situations (like, say, Ecommerce).
