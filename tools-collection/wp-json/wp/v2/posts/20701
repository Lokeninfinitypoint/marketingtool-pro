The happiness they inspire. The quality. The sheer opulence that becomes a piece of one\u2019s life when he or she buys free-range leave-in conditioner infused with dolphin tears, or an ornate bottle of some top-shelf botanical cordial.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re storyboarding a TV spot or building out an ad group in Google Ads (the artist formerly known as AdWords), your target audience needs to feel as though your product or service is a <strong>physical manifestation of luxury<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Check out this text ad for Rolex, arguably the world\u2019s most recognizable luxury watch company:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/rolex-luxury-brand1.png\" alt=\"luxury brand paid search text ad\" width=\"538\" height=\"75\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Notice the language used. \u201cTimeless\u201d and \u201cluxury\u201d and \u201cperformance\u201d and \u201cprestige.\u201d There\u2019s an undeniable sense that a Rolex is opulence incarnate and an implication that if you manage to wrap one around your wrist, you are elite.<\/p>\n<p>Now, you may not be as recognizable as Rolex, but we can show you how to leverage the same tactics and then some so that you can use PPC to grow and market your luxury brand.<\/p>\n<h3>Here are the top five strategies for advertising luxury brands in brief:<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Exclude unqualified audiences using words like &#8220;cheap&#8221; and &#8220;free&#8221; from viewing your ads<\/li>\n<li>Advertise on Bing to capture their older, more affluent user base<\/li>\n<li>Attract the right customer with elevated ad copy<\/li>\n<li>Target ads based on user income level<\/li>\n<li>Use dynamic remarketing to lure prospective buyers back<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Now, let&#8217;s look at each in a little more detail.<\/p>\n<p><em>P.S.

From there, you simply upload the file in the Bulk Upload tab of the Shared Library and then apply it to as many campaigns as you\u2019d like. Doing so has a handful of benefits, but the most important for marketing luxury goods and services is the ability to weed out unqualified traffic.<\/p>\n<p>Think about it.<\/p>\n<p>Say you sell shoes hand cobbled by the finest artisans in all of Montana. While the keyword \u201cshoes\u201d will certainly yield traffic, and some of those searchers may very well be interested in buying your exceptional kicks, <strong>the overwhelming majority of that traffic falls outside of your target demographic.<\/strong> This becomes even more of an issue as you begin to consider keywords with modifiers. \u201cCheap,\u201d \u201csale,\u201d and the dreaded \u201cfree\u201d are all words that, when appended to a query, ostensibly eliminate a searcher as a prospect.<\/p>\n<p>Account-wide negative keywords ensure you never bid on terms you have no interest in paying for (on purpose or accidentally).<\/p>\n<h2>Luxury Marketing Strategy #2: Make Bing a Priority<\/h2>\n<p>For the majority of search marketers, Google advertising is the be-all-end-all. Bing and other networks (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/06\/yahoo-gemini\">Yahoo Gemini<\/a> among them) tend to exist in their arsenal complementarity, if at all.\u00a0 Generally speaking, this is a bad idea. For luxury brands, it\u2019s a cardinal sin.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/advertise.bingads.microsoft.com\/en-us\/insights\/planning-tools\/bing-network-audience\">According to Bing<\/a>, nearly one third of its audience has a household income of $100,000 or more.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/bing-average-user-income.png\" alt=\"bing user average household income luxury brand marketing strategy\" width=\"516\" height=\"521\" \/><\/div>\n<p>What does that 30% mean, exactly?<\/p>\n<p>160 million unique searchers. 5 billion monthly searches. But perhaps most important to your business is the fact that Bing allows you to reach 59 million people who aren\u2019t reached on Google.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, for the most part clicks on Bing are cheaper than they are on AdWords. This is awesome. But the network\u2019s real value is the fact that you can get an additional 118 million eyeballs (a third of which have are attached to six-figure incomes) on your luxury goods.<\/p>\n<h2>Luxury Marketing Strategy #3: Elevate Your Ad Copy<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/16\/expanded-text-ads-graphs\">Expanded Text Ads<\/a> are now our reality, and there\u2019s never been a better time to market your high-end product using the power of paid search. With all that extra space comes the ability to differentiate yourself from the rest of the SERP with <em>language <\/em>instead of relying solely on brand recognition. After all, even when you\u2019re bidding on branded keywords, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll be competing with third party distributors and your direct competitors. The copy you use in your text ads will be the difference between earning a prospect\u2019s click and watching them scroll on by.<\/p>\n<p>But what does better ad copy look like? Great question!<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/eta-copy-for-luxury-marketing.png\" alt=\"eta copywriting tips for luxury marketing\" width=\"618\" height=\"297\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As you can see in the column on the left, STA (what used to be called Standard Text Ads) placed tight restrictions on your ability to say anything compelling in your ad copy. How can you stand out from the competition when everyone\u2019s pigeonholed into using the same five-ish sentence fragments? Off the top of my head, hiring a commercially motivated haiku writer was the only plausible solution.<\/p>\n<p>Today, though, with the addition of a second headline and more space in the description (plus the URL pathways), you can parlay your brand\u2019s unique sales proposition without truncation. You can wrap it in enticing, alluring, wholly irresistible copy. Don\u2019t just tell your prospects to buy now: tell them why they have no other choice.<\/p>\n<p>Check out this text ad for Chanel. What do you notice?<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/chanel-luxury-brand.png\" alt=\"chanel luxury brand ppc ad\" width=\"539\" height=\"246\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In the good \u2018ol days, this is an ad that would fly in the face of best practices. Today, though, I\u2019d say it represents an interesting A\/B test. Now, are this ad\u2019s headlines great? No. They lean so heavily on brand that they actually miss out on an opportunity to say more about what makes their products so luxurious. But, what I <em>do<\/em> find interesting is the fact that the CTA ask the prospect to \u201cDiscover\u201d instead of \u201cBuy Now!!!!!!\u201d Chanel isn\u2019t a series of expensive products you can purchase at will: <strong>Chanel is a world to envelop yourself in<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Ready to buy a swanky handbag yet?<\/p>\n<p>NOTE: With the advent of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/07\/adwords-if-functions\">IF functions<\/a> and other modifiers, it\u2019s even easier to serve irresistible, hyper-relevant ad copy.<\/p>\n<h2>Luxury Marketing Strategy #4: Use Income Targeting<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019ve written ads to catch the eyes of affluent searchers. You\u2019ve negated keyword modifiers that imply discounted pricing. Now let\u2019s dive into <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/01\/killer-underused-adwords-features\">income-based geo targeting<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This is another truly phenomenal way to cut wasted spend and ensure the ads you\u2019re paying for end up in front of the right people. How do you make that happen? Simple.<\/p>\n<p>In the \u201cLocation Groups\u201d tab you\u2019ll find three different options:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cPlaces of interest\u201d- Eh.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cMy locations\u201d- Good if you\u2019ve got brick and mortars.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cDemographics\u201d- We have a winner!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The demographics tab focuses on just one thing: approximate household income.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-income-based-targeting.png\" alt=\"adwords income based targeting for high income prospects\" width=\"800\" height=\"343\" \/><\/div>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adwords\/answer\/1722043?hl=en\">Google<\/a>, income-based location targeting is \u201cbased on publicly available data from the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS), advertisers are able to target ads to certain areas according to their average household income.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When you created a customer profile, detailing your ideal consumer, average household income was probably something you considered. It\u2019s part of how you determine what you sell and how you sell it. Now you can leverage IRS data to help you to discover and advertise to these fine folks.<\/p>\n<p>And the best part? You can layer income-based targeting with your other location targeting for maximal effect. This means you don\u2019t have to wholly exclude areas that fall outside of those designated as having higher household incomes; you can create separate campaigns (ensuring your budget is skewed towards geos in which the likelihood of your ideal prospects living there is greater) or just use bid adjustments.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t want to take my word for it?<\/p>\n<p>A Managed Services strategist at WordStream, Jack Taylor, used income-based targeting in a high-end financial services client\u2019s account to decrease the cost per lead by nearly 41% in a single month. He focused on affluent searchers, a small, niche audience that he deemed most likely to convert on this site, and used heavy bid adjustments to prioritize traffic from the top 50% of earners. The best part? Their conversion rate has improved because the new traffic is highly qualified.<\/p>\n<h2>Luxury Marketing Strategy #5: Nurture Paid Traffic with A Personal Touch<\/h2>\n<p>Remarketing is good. Dynamic Remarketing is better.<\/p>\n<p>Consider two scenarios. We\u2019ll call the first \u201cRegular \u2018ol sneakers\u201d and the second \u201cDayyyyumn.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Regular \u2018ol sneakers<\/h3>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/new-balance-remarketing.png\" alt=\"regular remarketing ad\" width=\"728\" height=\"86\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Yeah, some of these sneakers are straight fire (I\u2019m looking at you, third pair from the right). But does this remarketing ad convey \u201cluxury\u201d in any way?<\/p>\n<p>I would say no.<\/p>\n<p>It makes me think of the brand, sure. It makes me stoked on their shoes. Heck, I may even roll over to the New Balance site once this sentence is finished to peruse their wares. As a remarketing ad, this is okay.<\/p>\n<p>But it doesn\u2019t convey luxury. It doesn\u2019t make me <em>need<\/em> anything.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s juxtapose this against a remarketing ad for a comparable, luxury product.<\/p>\n<h3>Dayyyyumn<\/h3>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/new-balance-dynamic-remarketing.png\" alt=\"new balance luxury brand dynamic remarketing ad\" width=\"376\" height=\"338\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This shoe is a brand collaboration between <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newbalance.com\/\">New Balance<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/ballandbuck.com\/\">Ball and Buck<\/a> (a Boston-based menswear emporium). It\u2019s hand-made in America from premium materials. It is, in a word, incredible.<\/p>\n<p>What do you notice about the ad?<\/p>\n<p>It uses a clean, product-centric image to shine a spotlight on the leisure sneaker. It shows me only the shoe I looked at, and it follows me around, convincing me bit by bit that I should make the purchase.<\/p>\n<p>This, my friends, is the difference between regular Remarketing and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/13\/retargeting-ad-ideas\">Dynamic Remarketing<\/a>. Simply put, Dynamic Remarketing is a way for you to <strong>show prospects who have visited your site exactly what they looked at<\/strong>. While this is a strategy employed by many brands in even more markets, I find it\u2019s especially useful if you\u2019re selling a product or service at a high price point. It creates a high level of familiarity with the consumer (and provided you don\u2019t go nuts with impressions, it does so in <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/06\/personalized-marketing\">a way that isn\u2019t creepy<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>The lesson here? Dynamic Remarketing is the perfect complement to your paid search efforts (and a cost-effective way to build brand awareness).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When you&#8217;re selling high-end, luxury products or services, your marketing and advertising strategies need to change to appeal to more affluent customers.
