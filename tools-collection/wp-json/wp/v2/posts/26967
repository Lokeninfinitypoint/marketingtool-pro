We must choose which channels to put our heart and soul into, because if we give a fraction of effort on each platform then the chances of seeing a successful return become slim.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"278a0bb8-7a9a-4ecb-937a-ffd3e2137084\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/advertising-on-facebook-reasons.jpg\" alt=\"Advertising on Facebook\" width=\"700\" height=\"400\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>That said, there is one force dominating modern-day society: <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/19\/social-media-marketing-plan\">social media<\/a>. We all know this because you (like me) likely check your Facebook, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/06\/instagram-marketing\">Instagram<\/a>, and Twitter feeds several times a day. Well, guess what? Your customers do the same.<\/p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t surprising, but this also doesn\u2019t mean you should be throwing all of your spend into every social platform out there. Yet, there is one social network that ALL marketers simply cannot ignore, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/10\/06\/social-advertising\">which is Facebook<\/a>. Don\u2019t believe me? Well, check out five reasons why you should.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MORE:<\/strong> <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/25\/does-facebook-advertising-work\">Does Facebook Advertising Work?<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>#1: Your Audience Is On Facebook<\/h2>\n<p>Facebook has a user base larger than the population of China! <strong>With 1.49 billion members worldwide, and 22 billion ad clicks per year<\/strong>, Facebook is providing businesses with the largest advertising opportunity since search. So yes, your <a title=\"facebook audience\" href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/10\/20\/facebook-audience\">audience<\/a> is on there somewhere \u2013 it\u2019s just a matter of finding them (which I\u2019ll get into in reason #3), but if you have doubts just re-read those stats because they are quite telling, my friend.<\/p>\n<h2>#2: Facebook Ads Are Cheap<\/h2>\n<p>Seriously, they\u2019re practically free! Well, not quite. In fact, the reason you need to advertise is because getting traction from organic activity on your business page won\u2019t yield results. Just take a look at the graph below, which unfortunately proves that the days of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/12\/facebook-organic-reach\">organic reach are long gone<\/a>; your posts just aren&#8217;t showing up in your fans&#8217; <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/20\/facebook-newsfeed-algorithm\">Facebook newsfeed<\/a>:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"439498a6-c13e-4942-8c93-60d64ae6f448\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/advertising-on-facebook-graph.png\" alt=\"Advertising on Facebook graph showing plummeting organic reach\" width=\"607\" height=\"553\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>On the bright side, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/27\/facebook-ads-for-entrepreneurs\">Facebook ads<\/a> tend to cost a fraction of what other online marketing channels cost. For instance, WordStream\u2019s Paid Acquisition Coordinator, Brett McHale, ran a Facebook remarketing campaign for his sister\u2019s small business and was able to reach 200 people who visited her site with just $5 per day. Pretty impressive.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re strapped for cash, just ensure that you set reasonable daily Facebook budgets so you don\u2019t exceed what you\u2019re able to spend.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of how much Facebook costs, but how far your money will go,\u201d says Brett. \u201cIf you go into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/02\/facebook-marketing-for-small-business\">Facebook advertising<\/a> with a clear focus and follow a simple strategy, the cost-efficiency of the platform will astound you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The graph below from <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/1-dollar-per-day-on-facebook-ads\">Brian Carter\u2019s Moz article<\/a> really says it all. In terms of cost to reach a thousand people, Facebook is far less expensive than all other channels (online and offline):<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d398055b-8645-4825-b687-fb47c71aa65b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/advertising-on-facebook-data.png\" alt=\"Advertising on Facebook data showing the low cost of Facebook ads compared to other channels\" width=\"916\" height=\"669\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>\u201cIf you spend $1 per day on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/03\/facebook-f8\">Facebook ads<\/a>, you will get in front of 4,000 people that wouldn\u2019t have seen you otherwise,\u201d says Brian. \u201cIf you can\u2019t spare $30 per month, you shouldn\u2019t be in business.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>#3: The Targeting Capabilities of Facebook Are Exceptional<\/h2>\n<p>Along with tons of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/13\/facebook-ad-types-cheatsheet\">different ad types<\/a>, like <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/25\/facebook-video-ads\">video ads<\/a>, the level of granularity you can get with Facebook targeting capabilities is beyond belief to me. You can literally target Obama or the Prime Minister of France. Whether it be by behaviors, interests, demographics, connections, age ranges, languages, or locations, you can dig pretty deep with these <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/28\/facebook-ad-targeting\">targeting capabilities<\/a> and layer them upon each other to ensure you\u2019re getting rid of any questionable, out-of-market clickers. The location targeting is especially useful for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/08\/facebook-local-advertising\">local businesses looking to advertise on Facebook<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2c9c5455-c8df-4ea0-a4b2-cd1e961879a5\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/advertising-on-facebook-targeting.png\" alt=\"Advertising on Facebook targeting\" width=\"560\" height=\"513\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>#4: Facebook Is Effective to Push On-the-Fence Leads Down the Funnel<\/h2>\n<p>Still nervous? Try out remarketing on Facebook through <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/12\/11\/facebook-custom-audience-strategy\">custom audiences<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This strategy works wonders for marketers because remarketing works by targeting an audience that has already visited your site, and therefore is more likely to be interested in your products or offerings at some level. If you\u2019re already doing paid search, try out \u201c<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/10\/07\/ads-on-facebook\">The Savvy Social Stalker<\/a>\u201d hack. With this technique, you\u2019ll give your PPC leads a push by remarketing to the non-converters via Facebook ads.<\/p>\n<h2>#5: Facebook Allows You to Find New Qualified Leads Easily<\/h2>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve found an audience that converts like crazy, you can clone them. I kid you not! The feature is called \u201clookalike audiences\u201d where you can take a custom audience and Facebook will reach NEW people who are similar to that audience and therefore likely to be interested in your business.<\/p>\n<p>Lookalike audiences can also be built with conversion pixels (for instance, the conversion pixels from your paid search ads!), install data from mobile apps, or simply from fans of your Facebook page. You can also further define the size and targeting options to ensure your lookalike audience is an accurate reflection of your target buyers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis approach takes the guesswork out of targeting for user acquisition, leading to increased revenue,\u201d says Content Marketing Manager at Nanigans, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.socialmediatoday.com\/users\/juliana-casale\">Julianna Casale<\/a>. \u201cWine ecommerce company Club W saw a 5X increase in revenue when they \u2018paired\u2019 their video ads with Lookalike Audience target.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If you want to keep up and beat your competitors, follow my advice and hop on the Zuckerberg bandwagon \u2013 it isn\u2019t bad!
