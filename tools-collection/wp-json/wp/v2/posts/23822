The average internet user is completely unaware that they are being digitally stalked across the web-a-verse<strong>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>Did They Forget About You or Do They Just Not Like You?<\/h2>\n<p>In a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/ads\/innovations\/remarketing.html\">video advocating\u00a0remarketing<\/a> and explaining how it works, Google claims that remarketing is useful because people get distracted easily (what do you expect with twenty open tabs?) and when something unexpected comes up, they might leave your site and forget to return later.<\/p>\n<p>And yes, that is possible &#8230; but it\u2019s also possible (and probably more likely) that they left your site because they just didn\u2019t like or want what you were offering. In which case continuing to shove your ads in front of them seems obnoxious. As Stephanie Tanner from Full House would say, \u201cHow Rude!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Remarketing thrives off the general idea that the more present a brand is across different parts of the web, the more trustworthy that brand must be. As a brand, you certainly gain street cred as more people see your ad. However, people are under the assumption that they just happen to be seeing your ad across the web, not knowing that you are, in reality, digitally stalking them like the stealthy cougar that you are.<\/p>\n<p>Most <strong>users don\u2019t realize you are actually <em>paying<\/em> to extend your engagement with them<\/strong>; they simply see your ads everywhere and assume you must be a popular and therefore trusted brand, which is a bit misleading.<\/p>\n<p>People are hardwired with the idea that the more they see your advertisement, the more your value or worth must be. In the physical, off-line world, seeing a company\u2019s ad plastered everywhere really just means they have heaps of money, and they probably wouldn\u2019t have such endless piles of the green stuff if they weren\u2019t doing something right, so that connection between brand exposure and reliability makes sense.<\/p>\n<p>Web users are still thinking with that mindset, so seeing your ads all over the web leads them to believe that your company is well known and successful. The problem is that with remarketing, that link between number of ads and trust is no longer valid\u2014you don\u2019t have advertisements all over the internet, you\u2019re just a creepy stalker!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Related: <\/strong><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/01\/22\/adchoices\">All About AdChoices<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Let&#8217;s Remarket Role-Play for a Moment<\/h2>\n<p>The absurdity of remarketing is hilarious when you apply ad retargeting to a real-life scenario:<\/p>\n<p>Imagine that you walk down to the local bakery in town for a donut, but you never end up purchasing it&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>1. In one scenario, you get a phone call and rush outside to take the call and not disrupt other pastry-eaters (you are very considerate). Finished with your call, you start to walk away when the store owner pops his head out of the shop. \u201cHey friend, didn\u2019t you want a donut?\u201d asks the hefty baker with a jolly smile. \u201cOh yeah, thanks for reminding me!\u201d you say, and then enter the bakery, get your snack, and everyone is happy thanks to remarketing.<\/p>\n<p>2. In the other scenario, you leave the bakery because the donuts look old and nasty, or you remember that you\u2019re trying to go on a diet for your upcoming college reunion. Except now when you leave the bakery and the baker is peeping around corners and following you down the street, you are getting panicky. You walk quicker, and just when you turn the corner, there he is, shoving bread in your face. \u201cBuy it! You know you want to!\u201d screams the maniacal baker. That\u2019s harassment. And in a way, that\u2019s remarketing.<\/p>\n<p>The kind of behavior that you\u2019d wind up in jail for in the off-line world translates to a successful marketing tactic in the online world.<\/p>\n<h2>Before We Gang Up on Remarketing\u2026<\/h2>\n<p>In defense of remarketing, most forms of advertising are a bit creepy to begin with. Remember the whole lets-equate-everything-to-sex advertising phase? As consumers we\u2019ve become too meta to fall victim to that tactic quite so easily, but it still occurs.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1d135348-7e81-42bb-b4d1-110fb8f2ea31\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/remarketing-sexy-advertising.jpg\" alt=\"remarketing is a strange\" width=\"448\" height=\"532\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>There\u2019s also the strategy of playing refreshing liquids-pouring-over-ice sounds as you sit in a cramped, humid, and sweat-filled Ryanair plane, offering desperate flyers mini cans of Coke at $6 a pop (experienced firsthand naturally). In a way, the ethical obstacle course is something advertisers must always struggle to maneuver through. It\u2019s all part of the advertising game.<\/p>\n<h2>Remarketing Works! And When it Ain\u2019t Broke, Don\u2019t Fix it<\/h2>\n<p>The truth is, when it comes down to it, remarketing works. Loads of advertisers have discovered that people respond positively to remarketing. Honestly, we use remarketing and it\u2019s performed pretty well for us.<\/p>\n<p>Remarketing also gives you a chance to better match a visitor\u2019s specific need. Once you know someone has visited your bikini swimwear page, you can present them with an ad tailored to this need, coupled with some additional incentive that might change their mind, like a \u201c20% off\u201d offer. And that does seem like a reasonable use, because your visitor might reconsider buying from you once they see an offer like that or for free shipping, etc.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you guys think?<\/strong> Is remarketing a valid web advertising technique or just plain creepy?
