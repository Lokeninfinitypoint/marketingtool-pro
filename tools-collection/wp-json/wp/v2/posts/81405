Create unexpected and on-brand content to build trust<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/12\/28\/content-marketing-advice\">Content marketing<\/a> is a proven lead-generation strategy. It builds trust so your new lead doesn\u2019t hesitate to register or subscribe.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s easier said than done, especially if your audience distrusts overt marketing efforts. You need to get creative with content that stands out and resonates with your core audience.<\/p>\n<p>We love this example from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/elaine-atwell-a1b87710b\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Elaine Atwell<\/a>, Content Manager at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kolide.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kolide by 1Password<\/a>.

They spend time roaming Reddit and talking to the sales team. This strategy can work for your business, too. Start by following your customers on <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/linkedin-banner\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media<\/a>, interacting with them in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/19\/brand-community\">online communities<\/a>, and listening to how they interact on sales calls.<\/p>\n<div id=\"Build-a-free-tool-your-ideal-prospect-can\u2019t-resist\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Build a free tool your ideal prospect can&#8217;t resist<\/h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wordstream-graders?camplink=mainnavbar&amp;campname=freetools\">free tool<\/a> is a lead generation goldmine. Create it once, and it will sit on your site, passively attracting new customers for years. When you add <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/04\/internal-linking\">internal links<\/a> to your free tool in content and promote it on social media, the leads really get flowing.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s extra cool about a free tool is that it can also qualify <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/linkedin-ads-bidding\">leads<\/a> for you. The people who use it are most likely your target customers.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ajdinperco.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ajdin Perco<\/a>, Head of Content at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.animalz.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Animalz<\/a>, told us how they created <a href=\"https:\/\/revive.animalz.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Revive<\/a> to get leads from their audience of marketers. Revive uses Google Analytics data to find content that\u2019s losing traffic on your blog. With that list in hand, you can refresh the posts so they rank higher on search engines and get more visits.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-Animalz-revive-1.webp\" alt=\"Lead generation examples - The Revive free tool.\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81423 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-Animalz-revive-1.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-Animalz-revive-1-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/revive.animalz.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/p>\n<p>To start the process, people head to the Revive home page and enter their email address (new lead!).

It lists articles worth refreshing, which is incredibly valuable and can lead to traffic growth.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s no small lift to create a new tool, though. Go into it with a strong understanding of how it\u2019ll improve your ideal customer\u2019s life. And have a solid plan to distribute it through social media, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/seo\">SEO<\/a>, and email.<\/p>\n<div id=\"Use-direct-messages-to-get-new-leads-faster\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Use direct messages to get new leads faster<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/01\/09\/social-media-marketing-strategies\">Social media marketing<\/a> is a great way to connect with new prospects. However, most people have to click from the social media platform to your landing page to enter their contact details, which is not great since some of them won\u2019t want to leave the social media site.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/larrykim\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Larry Kim<\/a>, CEO of <a href=\"http:\/\/customers.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Customers.ai<\/a> (formerly Mobile Monkey), told us how he used Instagram Messenger automation to collect leads right from Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how it worked. The Mobile Monkey team created a guide showing people<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/02\/how-to-get-verified-on-instagram\"> how to get verified on Instagram<\/a>\u2014valuable information for their target audience of brands and celebrities looking to grow their social media presence.<\/p>\n<p>Then, they promoted the guide using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/instagram-advertising\">paid Instagram campaigns<\/a>. Anyone who replied with \u201cVERIFIED\u201d got the guide in their <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-dm-on-instagram\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">direct messages<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-mobile-monkey-1.webp\" alt=\"Lead generation examples - Instagram post from Mobile Monkey.\" width=\"897\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81424 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-mobile-monkey-1.webp 897w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-mobile-monkey-1-480x321.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 897px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CR87iQzFCpq\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Sliding into your customers&#8217; DMs can be creepy. But Larry and his team started the conversation by giving something useful people asked for. And since Instagram won\u2019t let you place links on posts, they cut out a lot of lead-gen friction (no \u201clink in bio\u201d craziness).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt just seemed like the offer of \u2018how to get verified for free\u2019 resonated with people actively working on growing their IG presence,\u201d Larry said. \u201cPromoting it in an IG post with a call to action to comment on it and experience Instagram Direct Message automation was a great way to onboard prospective users.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Larry used <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/05\/b2b-marketing-automation-tactics\">marketing automation<\/a> to reply to requests instantly. That\u2019s a great way to scale this strategy. Follow up with everyone who replies so you don\u2019t waste any leads.

People who complete it get a recommendation for a soap scent that\u2019ll suit them, plus a visceral description of the product.<\/p>\n<p>Lyndsay says this tactic helps overcome the challenge of selling things people can\u2019t fully experience from an online shop. \u201cThe quiz uses descriptive language that helps customers pinpoint their fragrance preference. It\u2019s a creative way to showcase fragrances, especially when smell-o-vision doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/lead-capture\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lead capture<\/a> doesn\u2019t actually take place on the quiz. Instead, quiz takers immediately see a discount popup on their results page.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-willow-hill-popup-1.webp\" alt=\"Lead generation examples - Willow Hill popup with discount.\" width=\"652\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81428 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-willow-hill-popup-1.webp 652w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-willow-hill-popup-1-480x442.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 652px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.willowhillsoapcompany.com\/pages\/what-fragrance-is-best-for-you\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/04\/interactive-content\">Interactive content<\/a>, a valuable <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/22\/popup-examples\">popup<\/a> offer, and a personalized product recommendation are powerful lead-generation combos.<\/p>\n<p>This is such a versatile and low-lift tactic.

Gather a few posts covering different aspects of the same theme and use them as webinar topics.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/susie-marino129\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Susie Marino<\/a>, our Senior Content Marketing Specialist, runs a monthly webinar that\u2019s regularly one of our highest-performing lead generators. Some people learn better from video. As Susie presents the information in a fun and personal way, she\u2019s engaging the portion of our audience that might not read a blog post.<\/p>\n<p>Susie gets even more reach\u2014and leads\u2014by inviting an expert to sit in with her. For example, she recently had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/jenna-zeidan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jenna Zeidan<\/a>, Google\u2019s Senior Strategic Manager, join to talk about upcoming search and social media trends.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-localiq-video-1.webp\" alt=\"Lead generation examples - Screenshot of a webinar video.\" width=\"936\" height=\"548\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81429 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-localiq-video-1.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-localiq-video-1-480x281.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3M0BSHpWxSM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Susie says having a guest with specific expertise gave the webinar a big boost. \u201cJenna was great.

Find a business that\u2019s complementary to yours and co-create a guide or run a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/giveaway-ideas\">giveaway<\/a> on social media.
