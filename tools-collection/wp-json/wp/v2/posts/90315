Use lead scoring to prioritize high-value prospects<\/h3>\n<p>Not all leads are created equal. Prioritize prospects based on their <strong>likelihood to convert<\/strong> or their <strong>potential value<\/strong> to your business.<\/p>\n<p>We all want to attract the biggest clients possible, so why not immediately pass data about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/lead-quality\">lead quality<\/a> to your advertising platforms? Additionally, at some point, you can try optimizing exclusively for top-tier leads. With sufficient data volume, the algorithms will start identifying the most relevant users for you.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Scoring metrics<\/strong>: Develop a scoring system based on user behavior (e.g., the information provided when submitting a form on your website, such as the company size, the job title, etc.).<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/lead-scoring-wordstream-lead-scoring-model.webp\" alt=\"Lead scoring - lead scoring model matrix\" width=\"910\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-79507\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/lead-scoring-wordstream-lead-scoring-model.webp 910w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/lead-scoring-wordstream-lead-scoring-model-480x316.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 910px, 100vw\" \/><\/li>\n<li><strong>Sales alignment<\/strong>: Work closely with the sales team to understand which scores correlate with high-quality leads, and adjust your scoring criteria based on their feedback.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Dynamic retargeting<\/strong>: Use lead scores to adjust your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/08\/lead-quality\">PPC strategies<\/a>, directing more resources on high-scoring leads.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If your lead flow is limited, avoid excessive segmentation of leads into multiple categories. Over-segmentation can complicate data analysis and hinder the optimization of your campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>To ensure the effective performance of advertising algorithms, it\u2019s important to meet the recommended conversion thresholds:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Meta<\/strong> requires at least 200 conversions per month per ad set.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Google and Microsoft <\/strong>need a minimum of 30 conversions per month per campaign.<\/li>\n<li><strong>LinkedIn <\/strong>advises at least 60 conversions per month per campaign.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u26a1\ufe0f <strong>Is your Google Ads account set up for success?<\/strong> Download now &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLAccountStructure.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_LastAccountStructureGuide_Download\">The Last Guide to Google Ads Account Structure You&#8217;ll Ever Need<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"avoid-overreliance-on-a-single-platform\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Avoid overreliance on a single platform<\/h3>\n<p>One of the common pitfalls I see with our clients is that they use several platforms but don\u2019t regularly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/marketing-performance-metrics\">evaluate the effectiveness of each channel<\/a>. For example, they continue to keep a 50\/50 budget allocation between two networks, while a 70\/30 split could dramatically boost their results.<\/p>\n<p>Another case is when companies \u201cget stuck\u201d on one or two platforms without exploring new ones. If you\u2019re not testing new channels, you could lose out on potential opportunities and leads. It\u2019s all about staying agile and data-driven.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to constantly analyze your channel performance. Here are some of my recommendations to do this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If your sales cycle is short, <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/analytics\/answer\/10089681?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Analytics 4<\/a> may be enough.<\/li>\n<li>For longer and more complex sales cycles with multiple stakeholders and sales calls, <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/ai-lead-management\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a good CRM<\/a> is essential.<\/li>\n<li>For businesses with a lot of traffic channels, consider investing in third-party tools with advanced attribution tracking.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/lead-management-localiq-dash-dashboard.webp\" alt=\"view of lead management in dash by localiq platform\" width=\"946\" height=\"782\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-90343\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/lead-management-localiq-dash-dashboard.webp 946w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/lead-management-localiq-dash-dashboard-480x397.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 946px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/ai-lead-management\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dash by LocaliQ<\/a> is an AI-powered lead management platform that allows you to track and follow-up with leads.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>By consistently using data to evaluate your channels and redistributing your budget, you will see tangible results. In my experience, you can expect around a 20% boost in just a few months!<\/p>\n<div id=\"deploy-display-remarketing-and-rlsa-campaigns-strategically\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Deploy display remarketing and RLSA campaigns strategically<\/h3>\n<p>For SaaS, decision-making cycles are usually long. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-audit-pmax-display-video\">Display remarketing<\/a> and RLSA\u00a0(Remarketing Lists for Search Ads) can give you a competitive edge by targeting warm leads when they\u2019re ready to act:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Segmentation and personalization:<\/strong> Tailor your ads based on the user\u2019s previous interaction with your website. For instance, display different messages to users who abandoned the trial period and those who just viewed a pricing page.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bid adjustments:<\/strong> Increase or decrease your bids for returning visitors based on their likelihood to convert, optimizing your ad spend for the best possible ROI.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here\u2019s an extra tip from me: The audience in the SaaS niche is often quite narrow, and the number of website visitors is significantly smaller compared to the B2C segment. So when you\u2019re launching <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/08\/rlsa\">RLSA<\/a>, I recommend <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">expanding your keyword list<\/a> to include more generic search terms and using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/06\/broad-match-smart-bidding\">broad match<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/keyword-match-types-broad-match-png.webp\" alt=\"keyword match types chart with arrow pointing to broad match\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-90367\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/keyword-match-types-broad-match-png.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/keyword-match-types-broad-match-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"use-offline-conversion-tracking\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Use offline conversion tracking<\/h3>\n<p>Understand which campaigns drive real revenue by linking your CRM with the ad platforms. With this integration, you can assess lead quality, uncover weak points in your campaigns, and identify which ad groups, audiences, or keywords generate leads but fail to convert into opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>The result? Smarter decisions, optimized ad spend, and a more effective PPC strategy.<\/p>\n<p>To fully capitalize on this integration, focus on three key types of reports that transform raw data into actionable insights:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/customize-google-ads-conversion-tracking\">Conversion tracking reports<\/a>: <\/strong>These reports show the path from ad click to sale, helping you pinpoint which ads and campaigns generate revenue. Use this data to optimize spending on what works best.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Customer segmentation reports: <\/strong>These reports segment your audience using CRM data like demographics, purchases, or behavior. Tailor campaigns to specific groups for better results.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Customer lifetime value reports: <\/strong>These reports use CRM insights to let you estimate the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/10\/cac-vs-clv\">lifetime value of customers<\/a> acquired through PPC.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Clients often ask me why exporting customer lists from their CRM doesn\u2019t yield the desired results in ad campaigns. The issue doesn\u2019t lie in incorrect settings or integration errors, but in the specifics of the B2B sector.<\/p>\n<p>In B2B, most leads provide business emails (e.g., @company.com), which are rarely used to register personal accounts on platforms like Meta or Google.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/demio-form-example.webp\" alt=\"lead form example from demio\" width=\"572\" height=\"692\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-90366\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/demio-form-example.webp 572w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/demio-form-example-480x581.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 572px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Example of a typical B2B SaaS lead form at <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/demio.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>demio.com<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Since these platforms rely on personal accounts to match customer lists, business emails often fail to find corresponding users. As a result, the potential audience for ad delivery is significantly smaller\u2014or even nonexistent.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of just relying on customer lists, use other data sources like pixels or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/conversion-value-rules\">conversion events<\/a> to track user actions on your website. This allows you to <strong>build audiences based on behavior<\/strong> rather than email addresses.<\/p>\n<div id=\"conduct-regular-ppc-audits\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Conduct regular PPC audits for constant optimization<\/h3>\n<p>Even the most successful PPC campaigns require ongoing optimization. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-audit\">Regular audits<\/a> help identify areas for improvement and ensure your campaigns align with your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-plan-goals-objectives-for-small-businesses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">business goals<\/a>.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Comprehensive reviews:<\/strong> Regularly assess all aspects of your campaigns, including keyword selection, ad copy, audience targeting, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-smart-bidding\">bidding strategies<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Growth opportunities:<\/strong> Use audits to spot chances for implementing new ad formats or tactics to boost performance.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Actionable insights:<\/strong> Turn audit findings into a clear plan of action, prioritizing changes that will have the biggest impact.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you are not sure where to start your audit, you can use a free<a href=\"https:\/\/aimers.io\/tools\/google-ads-optimization-checklist\/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Google Ads Optimization Checklist<\/a> for SaaS that my team has developed.

Optimize your landing pages for conversions<\/h3>\n<p>Your ad strategy might be brilliant. But if your landing page does not convert, you won\u2019t see good results.
