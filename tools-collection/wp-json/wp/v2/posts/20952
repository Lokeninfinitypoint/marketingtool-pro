Small changes in your ad response rates can trigger massive improvements in your profitability. When you\u2019re paying Google and Facebook tens of dollars for a single click, it\u2019s crucial that you write ad copy that can push and persuade people.<\/p>\n<p>More of an auditory learner? Check out our Goal Talk Podcast episode on\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/28\/goal-talk-episode-12\">The Do&#8217;s and Don&#8217;ts of Writing Effective Ad Copy<\/a><\/p>\n<p>In this post, I\u2019m going to show you four powerful tactics anyone can use to write <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/03\/copywriting-examples\">stellar ad copy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>How to write great advertising copy<\/h2>\n<h3>1. Show viewers how you\u2019ll solve their problem<\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/02\/ppc-ad-headlines\">writing ad headlines<\/a>, most businesses start and stop at plugging in keywords. This is the first thing a visitor will read after all.<\/p>\n<p>Though using the keywords you\u2019re bidding on is important for Quality Score, when everyone (your competition included) is using the same keywords, you don\u2019t really attract much attention.<\/p>\n<p>To stand out, your ad headline needs to mirror the visitor\u2019s end goal (similar to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/16\/copywriting-formulas\">bridge after bridge copywriting formula<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>People click on an ad because it promises to help solve their problem, not because they think the ad checks all the right keyword boxes.<\/p>\n<p>Before you create an ad, think about what the user on the other end wants to accomplish and how your headline can help fulfill that need.<\/p>\n<p>For example, take a look at the ads for the keyword \u201csell books\u201d:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/compelling-advertising-copy-examples-sell-books.png\" alt=\"ad copy help\" width=\"541\" height=\"251\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Apart from writers and publishers, most people searching for this query are likely to be college students and readers who want quick cash for their books.<\/p>\n<p>The first ad focuses on exactly this:<em> sell your books for cash<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t try to push their service\u2019s features and quality. Instead, it tells viewers immediately that they can use the service to get cash (the end goal) for their books.<\/p>\n<p>Try doing this in your ad copy as well: focus on the end-solution (cash for books) that solves customers\u2019 problems.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p><strong>\u2734\ufe0f\u00a0 Want even more ad copywriting tips?

Include emotional triggers<\/h3>\n<p>While some visitors might be looking for a site with an end goal in mind, often people are browsing casually to get information or discover what solutions and services are available for a potential problem.<\/p>\n<p>For these kind of visitors, you have to spur them into action. One way to do this is through <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite120WordsforMarketingWithEmotion.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_120WordsPhrases_Download\">emotional triggers<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The reason behind this is simple: people don\u2019t make decisions based on logic alone. Instead, they are driven by emotions.<\/p>\n<p>If people read something and experience a strong emotional reaction (such as fear, anger, or disgust) they will click through.<\/p>\n<p>For example, take a look at these ads for a trainer:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/compelling-fitness-trainer-ad-copy.png\" alt=\"great advertising copy\" width=\"761\" height=\"465\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Most of these ads simply describe the services on offer. There is no way to differentiate between them apart from their locations and their prices.<\/p>\n<p>While this can work when the competition is limited, for most keywords, such ads will just blend in with the others.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast, take a look at this ad for a cosmetic surgeon in New York:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/compelling-cosmetic-surgeon-advertising-copy.png\" alt=\"compelling ad copywriting\" width=\"727\" height=\"214\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This ad works because it addresses the single biggest issue anyone who seeks a cosmetic surgeon has: that they <em>look <\/em>older and as a result, don\u2019t feel good about themselves.<\/p>\n<p>By highlighting how cosmetic surgery will help you, the patient, \u201clook younger and feel great,\u201d this ad triggers a far more emotional response than the ad below it (which mostly talks about the \u201cstate of the art facility\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how to make your ad copy emotional:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Determine who your customer is<\/li>\n<li>Determine the persona you want to take on to appeal to that customer<\/li>\n<li>Write <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/21\/emotional-ad-copy-examples\">emotional ad copy<\/a> from that persona<\/li>\n<li>Use these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/03\/emotional-marketing-copy\">273+ emotional words and phrases<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You have to be careful to balance this reaction with the rest of your message as you don\u2019t want your customers to associate your brand with a negative emotion.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, focus on resolving the fear or concern.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Focus on benefits, not features<\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.invespcro.com\/blog\/tips-and-best-practices-for-writing-better-ad-copy\/\">writing the body of your ad<\/a>, don\u2019t waste time by stating how amazing your brand is. Instead, get visitors to take action by telling them how your brand or your product will improve their lives.<\/p>\n<p>Your ad needs to be personal (use \u201cyou\u201d) and must be able to demonstrate how your service can benefit the visitor.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example from the pet insurance industry:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/compelling-ad-copy-features-vs-benefits-tips.png\" alt=\"how to write strong ad copy\" width=\"419\" height=\"239\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The first ad focuses on <em>benefits<\/em> by stating in its copy:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How much the visitor will save (5%)<\/li>\n<li>How a visitor can cut costs without cutting coverage (use of you)<\/li>\n<li>Informing that the plan works with any licensed vet (convenience)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Compare that to the ad just below it, which is vague:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>States \u201cSave Big\u201d but what does that mean exactly? How much?<\/li>\n<li>States \u201cVisit Today\u201d which doesn\u2019t need to be said if someone is already searching for you (they are already interested). This just wastes ad space.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Similarly, take a look at these two ads for \u201clasik surgery NYC\u201d:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/lasik-compelling-advertising-copy.png\" alt=\"great ad copy examples\" width=\"668\" height=\"415\" \/><\/div>\n<p>A customer who wants to get laser surgery done doesn\u2019t really care about the exact brand name of the equipment\u00a0 or even the technology used.<\/p>\n<p>What he actually cares about it whether the surgery is fast, comfortable and accurate \u2013 benefits, not features.<\/p>\n<p>This is exactly what the first ad focuses on: surgery that is <em>more comfortable<\/em>, <em>faster &amp; more precise<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Only after mentioning the benefits does the ad talk about features \u2013 \u201cbest price guarantee,\u201d \u201cnext day recovery,\u201d etc.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast, the second ad doesn\u2019t talk about benefits at all. Instead, it approaches the ad from a position of authority by stating how many surgeries they\u2019ve performed (which is a useless number because most customers have no idea what number of surgeries is normal for a Lasik practice).<\/p>\n<p>If you are finding it hard to differentiate or provide benefits in a short amount of space, you can use psychology to drive conversions, as we\u2019ll see below.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p><strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite120WordsforMarketingWithEmotion.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_120WordsPhrases_Download\">The 120 Best Words &amp; Phrases for Marketing with Emotion <\/a>\ud83d\ude0c\u00a0\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h3>4.
