When Julian Casablancas, legendary frontman of the Strokes, was asked about the similarities between the band\u2019s hit single \u201cLast Nite\u201d and Tom Petty\u2019s \u201cAmerican Girl,\u201d he issued a terse response: \u201cYeah, we ripped it off. Where have you been?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Although this laissez-faire attitude towards plagiarism is baked into the foundation of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, we\u2019ve gotta play by the rules here in the digital marketing world. So, as you peruse this collection of outstanding banner ad examples, please refrain from taking the Casablancas approach. Finding inspiration is one thing; stealing is another.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/banner-ads-examples-intro.jpg\" alt=\"banner ad example\" width=\"487\" height=\"301\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Yikes. Even if plagiarism <\/em>were<em> acceptable, this isn\u2019t a banner ad you\u2019d want to mimic.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Accompanying each banner ad example is a quick breakdown of what (in my opinion) makes it work. You\u2019ll notice some themes: the versatility and effectiveness of side-by-side comparisons, the emotional power of visual imagery, the need to undermine skepticism, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s get to it!<\/p>\n<h2>24 banner ads examples that we can all learn from<\/h2>\n<h3>1. Bridgewater State University<\/h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/banner-ads-examples-intro-bridgewater-state.jpg\" alt=\"banner ad example from Bridgewater State\" width=\"624\" height=\"168\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Let\u2019s be honest: This ad\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/click-through-rate\">click-through rate<\/a> is probably very low. Nobody stops reading a blog post to enroll in college classes. But that\u2019s okay\u2014the marketers at BSU aren\u2019t going for clicks. Instead, they\u2019re going for (meaningful, lasting) impressions.<\/p>\n<p>This is a great example of <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/banner-ad-examples\/\">banner ad<\/a> copy that gets prospects thinking. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but when I look at this ad, I can\u2019t help but think: <em>What would it look like for me to go beyond? <\/em>All of a sudden, I\u2019m picturing myself in a classroom. Although I wouldn\u2019t click on this ad, there\u2019s no denying its memorability. Sometimes, that\u2019s all that matters.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Liberty University<\/h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/banner-ads-examples-intro-liberty-university.jpg\" alt=\"banner ad example from Liberty University\" width=\"624\" height=\"90\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Here we have another example from a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/08\/04\/higher-education-marketing\">higher education advertiser<\/a>\u2014one that\u2019s effective for completely different reasons. First, I love the image on the left side of the ad; I think it evokes a feeling of community, of being part of something bigger than yourself. Never underestimate the power of a simple visual.<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, the copy addresses a common complaint about online college: that it fails to deliver the benefits of a traditional university. By reassuring prospective students they\u2019ll enjoy the flexibility of online classes and the advantages of a physical campus, the marketers at Liberty effectively erase some of the skepticism surrounding their offer.<\/p>\n<h3>3. AutoZone<\/h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/banner-ads-examples-intro-auto-zone.jpg\" alt=\"banner ad example from AutoZone\" width=\"383\" height=\"321\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Shifting gears (zing) to an entirely different industry, here we have a banner ad example from AutoZone. Referring to a specific <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/28\/pain-points\">pain point<\/a> that your product or service alleviates is a fantastic copywriting tactic; in this case, it\u2019s the all-too-relatable scenario of seeing your check engine light rear its ugly head. Mimicking this approach is a great way to grab your prospects\u2019 attention.<\/p>\n<p>Bonus points to AutoZone for their geotargeting efforts. By providing the address and business hours of a nearby store, they make the likelihood of conversion considerably higher.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Capital One<\/h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/banner-ads-examples-intro-capital-one.jpg\" alt=\"Capital One\" width=\"397\" height=\"328\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You don\u2019t need a degree in graphic design to see why this Capital One ad works so well: It\u2019s designed to make <strong>5X <\/strong>leap off the screen. Like the team at Bridgewater State, the folks who put this winner together understand that clicks aren\u2019t everything. Even if you don\u2019t click that \u201cLearn More\u201d button\u2014credit to them for using a low-pressure <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/20\/call-to-action-examples\">CTA<\/a>, as opposed to something aggressive like \u201cSign Up Today\u201d\u2014you\u2019ll remember that Capital One offers a savings rate 5X higher than the national average.<\/p>\n<p>Bonus points to Capital One for associating their copy and imagery with basketball season.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Big Brothers Big Sisters<\/h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/banner-ads-examples-big-brothers-big-sisters.jpg\" alt=\"banner ad example from Big Brothers Big Sisters\" width=\"238\" height=\"466\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This banner ad example from Big Brothers Big Sisters demonstrates perfectly how the use of images can greatly enhance the emotional impact of your marketing materials. It sounds obvious, but this ad works largely because the images allow prospects to envision themselves working as big brothers and big sisters.<\/p>\n<p>Elsewhere, I think their choice of CTA\u2014\u201cStart Something\u201d\u2014is brilliant. It gives the prospect a real sense of autonomy, no? With just two words, the advertiser sends a wonderful message: You have the power to effect change in this world.<\/p>\n<h3>6. nCino<\/h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/banner-ads-examples-ncino.jpg\" alt=\"banner ad example from nCino\" width=\"563\" height=\"155\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Those of you who operate in competitive spaces understand the importance of establishing your authority as a brand. That\u2019s exactly what the nCino marketing team does here with the headline copy: \u201cThe worldwide leader in cloud banking software.\u201d That\u2019s a bold statement\u2014one that makes the nCino brand name stick around in your mind.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, I think the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/20\/call-to-action-buttons'\">CTA button<\/a> is perfectly placed; it attracts the eye as soon as you\u2019re done scanning the headline copy. Plus, the marketers at nCino understand that they\u2019re working with a long sales cycle\u2014hence the use of a low-pressure CTA. They probably could have created a <em>bit <\/em>more contrast between the button color and the background color, but we\u2019ll give \u2019em a pass.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Disney+<\/h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/banner-ads-examples-disney2B.jpg\" alt=\"banner ad example from Disney+\" width=\"624\" height=\"170\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The effectiveness of this Disney+ banner ad can be summed up with a single word: <strong>exclusivity<\/strong>. More than anything, this ad serves as a reminder that <em>Disney+ has content you can\u2019t (legally) get anywhere else.<\/em> No matter what you\u2019re advertising, exclusivity is a heck of a sales pitch. If you have something that none of your competitors can replicate, make it known to the world.<\/p>\n<p>Bonus points to Disney+ for nailing it with their CTA. Even if you don\u2019t click that blue button, you\u2019ll remember that Disney+ is offering a free trial. Next time you\u2019re itching for an <em>Iron Man <\/em>marathon, you\u2019ll know where to go.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Amazon Web Services (AWS)<\/h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/banner-ads-examples-aws.jpg\" alt=\"banner ad example from Amazon Web Services\" width=\"593\" height=\"163\" \/><\/div>\n<p>There\u2019s nothing wrong with using a statement to establish your brand authority. If, for example, the AWS marketing team simply wrote, \u201cAWS is more reliable than the next major cloud provider,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t take issue with it. That being said, taking the <strong>cold, hard stats approach<\/strong> is infinitely more effective. Rather than asking us to simply take their word for it, the AWS team anchors their industry-leading status to a specific number\u2014i.e., that they boasted 7X fewer downtime hours in 2018 than their closest competitor.<\/p>\n<p>That, my friends, is good <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/14\/ppc-ad-copywriting\">copywriting<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>9. DocuSign<\/h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/banner-ads-examples-docusign.jpg\" alt=\"banner ad example from DocuSign\" width=\"624\" height=\"172\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Here, thanks to DocuSign, we have our first banner ad example that illustrates the power of creating a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/10\/curiosity-gap\">curiosity gap<\/a>\u2014that is, using your copy to inspire intrigue in your prospects\u2019 minds. Once you\u2019ve read that headline, you can\u2019t help but wonder: What are the six overlooked strategies that deliver rapid growth? The only way to find out, of course, is to read the ebook.<\/p>\n<p>The marketers at DocuSign clearly have a strong understanding of how display advertising fits into the marketing funnel. Since it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll get someone to buy your product or service with a simple banner ad, it\u2019s wise to offer something small (e.g., a free ebook).<\/p>\n<h3>10. Ridge<\/h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/banner-ads-examples-ridge.jpg\" alt=\"banner ad example from Ridge\" width=\"624\" height=\"171\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Some things truly never go out of style. Exhibit A: the side-by-side comparison tactic. There\u2019s a reason marketers have been employing it for decades: It\u2019s a simple, direct, and <em>painfully clear <\/em>way to communicate the value of your product or service. It takes a fraction of a fraction of a second to understand what our friends at Ridge are trying to tell us. Awkward, clunky wallets are a thing of the past; if you want to keep up with the times, you have no choice but to upgrade to a slimmer, sleeker model.<\/p>\n<p>Ask yourself: Could I substitute this copy for a side-by-side comparison image? If the answer is yes, the latter is often the right decision.<\/p>\n<h3>11. USA Today<\/h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/banner-ads-examples-usa-today.jpg\" alt=\"banner ad example from USA Today\" width=\"624\" height=\"44\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The one and only <em>native <\/em>banner ad example included in this collection comes to us courtesy of the good people at USA Today. The best part of this ad, of course, is the way it inspires <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/05\/how-to-increase-urgency\">urgency<\/a>. It\u2019s never a bad idea to let your prospects know that they only have X hours left to take advantage of whatever promotion you\u2019re running at the moment.<\/p>\n<p>As the icing on the cake, \u201cGo Ad-Free\u201d is a fantastic CTA. Why? Because it tells USA Today\u2019s readers <em>what they\u2019ll actually get <\/em>if they opt into this limited-time deal. Would the ad be worthless if the CTA were \u201cSign Me Up\u201d rather than \u201cGo Ad-Free\u201d? No way. But if you want to write banner ad copy that\u2019s truly effective, focusing on outcomes is a great approach.<\/p>\n<h3>12. Allbirds<\/h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/banner-ads-examples-allbirds.jpg\" alt=\"banner ad example from Allbirds\" width=\"317\" height=\"271\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Say it with me, folks: You don\u2019t have to choose between writing copy that\u2019s catchy and writing copy that\u2019s effective. In other words, it\u2019s possible to write copy that both sticks in your prospects\u2019 minds <em>and <\/em>communicates the value of your product or service.<\/p>\n<p>Take this Allbirds ad, for instance. While there\u2019s no denying that \u201cSlip \u2018em on, move along\u201d is a catchy, memorable tagline, this copy is much cleverer than it initially seems. Why? Because it tells you (in a rather subtle way, admittedly) what it is, exactly, that makes Allbirds shoes such a wise decision: They\u2019re easy and comfortable to wear. Whereas some footwear is a hassle to deal with, Allbirds\u2019 selection is all about convenience.<\/p>\n<h3>13. Staples<\/h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/banner-ads-examples-staples.jpg\" alt=\"banner ad example Staples\" width=\"345\" height=\"290\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Sometimes, it\u2019s best to take the dead-simple route. Although newer businesses may want to adopt the Allbirds approach and shoot for memorability, established brands shouldn\u2019t be afraid to be direct. Is this example from Staples the sexiest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/09\/ad-design\">banner ad<\/a> I\u2019ve ever seen? Nope\u2014not by a long shot. But then again, who cares?<\/p>\n<p>This ad was created for one reason and one reason only: to remind shoppers that Staples is the best place to go when you\u2019re trying to save money. I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s accomplished that goal with flying colors. Plus, the design of the ad is flawless. Notice how your eyes are naturally drawn to the \u201cShop Now\u201d CTA button? Most certainly <em>not <\/em>an accident.<\/p>\n<h3>14. Apple<\/h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/banner-ads-examples-apple.jpg\" alt=\"banner ad example from Apple\" width=\"624\" height=\"88\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Much like our friends at Ridge, Apple goes with the trusty side-by-side approach and communicates a clear, powerful message: Our credit card comes with no fees. Every other credit card comes with a lot of fees. This is a particularly strong ad because, as we saw with the Liberty University example, it makes a point to address a common pain point for those in the market for a credit card (i.e., having to deal with inexplicable fees).<\/p>\n<p>Elsewhere, \u201cApply in minutes\u201d is an excellent CTA. Not only does it call prospects to action, but it also communicates a secondary <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\">value proposition<\/a>: <em>Applying for our credit card is quick and easy. <\/em>Don\u2019t be afraid to kill two birds with one CTA.<\/p>\n<h3>15. Microsoft<\/h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/banner-ads-examples-microsoft.jpg\" alt=\"banner ad example from Microsoft\" width=\"624\" height=\"93\" \/><\/div>\n<p>There\u2019s a lesson to be learned from this Microsoft banner ad: You can write copy with the intention of making your prospects feel as if they\u2019re in the driver\u2019s seat. Allow me to explain.<\/p>\n<p>Nobody would bat an eye if the copy for this ad said, \u201cBuild and develop apps with Azure. Start your free trial today.\u201d Bad copy? Not necessarily. <em>Generic <\/em>copy? Emphatically so. And if your banner ad copy fails to engage prospects in a meaningful way, then what\u2019s the point?<\/p>\n<p>This ad is brilliant because it reworks the \u201cStart your free trial today\u201d clich\u00e9 in a way that makes prospects feel autonomous. Typically, a free trial is restricted to a set amount of time determined by the advertiser. Here, Microsoft flips that expectation on its head; all of a sudden, the <em>consumer <\/em>gets to decide when the free trial stops and the pay period begins.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a simple switch, but it makes a massive impact.<\/p>\n<h3>16. Amazon<\/h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/banner-ads-examples-amazon.jpg\" alt=\"banner ad example from Amazon\" width=\"624\" height=\"91\" \/><\/div>\n<p>People don\u2019t make purchase decisions based <em>solely <\/em>on price; often, a consumer will opt for a particular product or service because it somehow aligns with their personal values.<\/p>\n<p>Clearly, the marketers at Amazon have an appreciation for this tendency. In a country where half the working population is employed by a small business, it\u2019s no surprise that so many people are passionate about supporting the little guy. Here in the US, it\u2019s not uncommon to hear someone say that they went with Product X or Service Y specifically because it was sold by a small business.<\/p>\n<p>Advertising the fact that small businesses <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/23\/selling-on-amazon\">sell on Amazon<\/a> is a savvy move\u2014one that everyone can learn from. If you can align your brand with a principle or movement that prospects hold dear, you\u2019ll drive some serious results.<\/p>\n<h3>17. Wikibuy<\/h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/banner-ads-examples-wikibuy.jpg\" alt=\"banner ad example from Wikibuy\" width=\"624\" height=\"89\" \/><\/div>\n<p>And speaking of Amazon, our next banner ad example comes from a company that helps make online shopping more affordable: Wikibuy. As you tell from this side-by-side banner, Wikibuy offers a price comparison browser extension that scans stores in search of the best deals.<\/p>\n<p>To me, what\u2019s unique about <em>this <\/em>side-by-side comparison is that it communicates Wikibuy\u2019s value proposition through a specific, tangible product\u2014an Xbox controller. If Wikibuy ran a banner ad that simply said, \u201cWe make online shopping cheaper,\u201d it wouldn\u2019t resonate nearly as much. By anchoring their value prop to something concrete that many consumers will recognize, Wikibuy significantly enhances the impact of their ad.<\/p>\n<h3>18. UMass Dartmouth<\/h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/banner-ads-examples-umass-dartmouth.jpg\" alt=\"banner ad example from UMass Dartmouth\" width=\"327\" height=\"276\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Wikibuy uses a specific product to make their banner ad resonate more deeply with their prospects; UMass Dartmouth, in a similar vein, uses a specific <em>person<\/em>. This, in my opinion, is a textbook example of how you can take the satisfaction of your <em>current <\/em>customers (or students) and use it to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/12\/get-more-customers\">win <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/12\/get-more-customers\"><em>new <\/em><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/12\/get-more-customers\">customers<\/a> (or students).<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s why the inclusion of Jill makes this banner ad so effective: She invites UMass Dartmouth\u2019s prospects to envision themselves as MBA students. Remember when I said Bridgewater State\u2019s ad made me think about what it would mean for me to \u201cgo beyond\u201d? This is practically the same idea. If you can get your prospects to think about what it would be like to be your customer, you\u2019re making strides.<\/p>\n<h3>19. Hulu<\/h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/banner-ads-examples-hulu.jpg\" alt=\"banner ad example from Hulu\" width=\"327\" height=\"276\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Nothing too philosophical to discuss here, my friends; the Hulu marketing team is trying to inspire that sense of urgency I\u2019ve mentioned a few times. Though they\u2019re far from reinventing the wheel, I want to give credit where credit is due. I like what they\u2019ve done with the heading and the subhead; emphasizing \u201cLimited-Time Offer\u201d and driving it home with the crossed-out price tactic is a strong approach.<\/p>\n<p>Bonus points to Hulu for perfect placement of the CTA button. No matter what you\u2019re advertising, design your banner ads in such a way that prospects\u2019 eyes are naturally drawn to your CTA buttons. Here, Hulu uses the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/31\/f-z-patterns-landing-page-design\">F-pattern design<\/a>. It\u2019s fool-proof!<\/p>\n<h3>20. Invisalign<\/h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/banner-ads-examples-invisalign.jpg\" alt=\"banner ad example from Invisalign\" width=\"370\" height=\"314\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Here, thanks to Invisalign, we have another example of the curiosity gap. I have no idea what a smile assessment entails, but you better believe I want to find out. As Buzzfeed has proven time and again over the years, people go <em>bananas <\/em>for free online quizzes. If you can think of a way to create a free online quiz that pertains to your product or service, go for it!<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s why a banner ad is the perfect way to advertise such a quiz: The people you\u2019re reaching with banner ads are typically at the top of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/07\/marketing-funnel\">marketing funnel<\/a>. As such, very few of them are ready to take any kind of action that involves payment. Because a free online quiz is, uh, free, it\u2019s a fantastic way to move new prospects further down your funnel.<\/p>\n<h3>21. Dyson<\/h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/banner-ads-examples-dyson.jpg\" alt=\"banner ad example from Dyson\" width=\"352\" height=\"295\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If the AWS ad and the UMass Dartmouth ad got together and started a family, this example from Dyson would be their glorious child. Why say \u201cWe make 5-star products\u201d or \u201cOur products will exceed your expectations\u201d when you can use a customer testimonial to say <em>both <\/em>of those things in a much more organic and believable way?<\/p>\n<p>If you want to go one step further\u2014and why wouldn\u2019t you?\u2014I\u2019d encourage you to combine the power of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/05\/customer-testimonials\">testimonial<\/a> with the power of visual imagery (i.e., a picture of your product <strong>in action<\/strong>). As much as I like this Dyson ad, it would be slightly better if we saw a customer actually using the product being promoted.<\/p>\n<h3>22. AAA<\/h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/banner-ads-examples-aaa.jpg\" alt=\"banner ad example from AAA\" width=\"358\" height=\"305\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This is hands-down the <strong>best <\/strong>use of visual imagery out of the whole bunch. When I look at this picture of the woman inspecting under the hood, I immediately flash back to all the times I\u2019ve found myself stranded on the side of the road. With those flashbacks, of course, come all the associated emotions: frustration, anger, anxiety, and so on. Emotions like these are incredibly good motivators\u2014which is why AAA is tapping them to get people to sign up.<\/p>\n<p>Think about the emotions you want to stir inside your prospects. Then, think about how you can use simple, direct imagery to get the job done. If you\u2019re truly thoughtful, you\u2019ll put together some winning banner ads.<\/p>\n<h3>23. One A Day<\/h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/banner-ads-examples-one-a-day.jpg\" alt=\"banner ad example from One A Day\" width=\"624\" height=\"88\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Here\u2019s another great example of a banner ad that directly addresses a common myth. In this case, One A Day is undermining the idea that being health conscious is complicated and time-consuming. As this ad does a stellar job of communicating, all it takes to improve your nutrition is a single daily supplement.<\/p>\n<p>I love the design of this banner, too; I think the use of bright colors is an effective way to cast a positive light on top of the messaging. Plus, making the CTA \u201cSave Now\u201d rather than \u201cBuy Now\u201d is a tremendous way to sneak an additional value proposition into the ad.<\/p>\n<h3>24. Liberty Mutual<\/h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/banner-ads-examples-liberty-mutual.jpg\" alt=\"banner ad example from Liberty Mutual\" width=\"361\" height=\"300\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Finally, we\u2019ve got this winner from insurance provider Liberty Mutual. Unsurprisingly, it\u2019s the copy (and value prop) that I\u2019m most fond of: <em>We\u2019ll do the work while you save money<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>What makes this banner ad <em>great <\/em>rather than <em>good <\/em>is the use of a specific number ($782). Again, it\u2019s all about making your message <strong>resonate<\/strong>. If Liberty Mutual simply said, \u201cYou could save money,\u201d that wouldn\u2019t make much of an impact on their prospects.<\/p>\n<p>When someone sees $782, their mind goes straight to all the things they could do with those savings: pay rent, make a car payment, put a dent in their debt, etc. In other words, the inclusion of a specific number makes this ad emotional\u2014and, therefore, far more memorable.<\/p>\n<p>If the main value prop behind your banner ad is savings, consider using a specific number.<\/p>\n<h2>Let these banner ads examples inspire your next campaign!<\/h2>\n<p>Like I said earlier, we all need creative inspiration every now and then. So take a look at these great examples, get your ideas rolling, and then get started on your next campaign\u2014complete with your own clickable banner ads!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sometimes we all need some creative inspiration.
