Cat Person. Other divisive things.<\/p>\n<p>2017 has been one heck of a year, and no subset of the marketing world embodies that truth more so than Google Ads (formerly known as Google AdWords).

One of the chief angles from which the business value of Google Ads\u00a0is decried goes something like this: \u201cI already organically rank at the top of the SERP for [insert keyword specific to business]: why should I waste money on ads when people can already find me?!\u201d Well, inquisitive business owner, because over the last two years, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/26\/google-ranking-click-through-rate\">the value of a #1 organic ranking<\/a> has decreased a whopping 37%.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"936304e4-a2e4-4538-9cb0-a05faa55b64f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/change-in-average-google-organic-ctr-2015-vs-20171-1.jpg\" alt=\"organic search rnaking are worth less in 2017\" width=\"650\" height=\"500\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The advent of featured snippets and other big, shiny SERP features, and the ever-growing prevalence of mobile searches has shoved organic search results below the fold. As this happens, Google\u00a0ads (and <em>shopping<\/em> ads in particular) have become even more important for businesses advertising online.<\/p>\n<h2>#3: Major Changes to How Google Spends Your Budget<\/h2>\n<p><em>\u201cStarting October 4, 2017, campaigns will be able to spend up to twice the average daily budget to help you reach your advertising goals.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Boy, that one\u2019s a doozy.<\/p>\n<p>Mere months ago, Google significantly <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/05\/adwords-daily-budget-changes\">altered the way your budget is allocated<\/a> throughout the course of a given month.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"77170ae8-a8e4-436c-bbcc-fcb13c670699\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-change-daily-budget1-1.png\" alt=\"adwords change to daily budget\" width=\"505\" height=\"132\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>If a campaign in your account has a budget of $500, Google can decide to spend up to $1,000. Note that this change affects all budgets, whether they are unique to a campaign or if they are shared. Now, Google has always had the ability to exceed your daily budget: they just capped it at 20% instead of, you know, 100%. They call this \u201coverdelivery,\u201d and it ensures that, in the course of a 30.4-day period, you get as many clicks (read: spend as much money) as possible.

Who has time to dream up new ad copy when there are a dozen other tasks to cross off on a given day?!<\/p>\n<p>Well, Google hears you, SMB marketer, and they\u2019ve got your back. Just this month, the Ad Variations interface was introduced in the new Google Ads\u00a0Experience.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"b5731eaf-f3c7-4ed4-af22-9f279004322c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-ad-variant-create-new-variant1.png\" alt=\"adwords 2017 new ad variant testing\" width=\"387\" height=\"322\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>This new feature allows you to find and replace keywords, update entire section of your ads (perfect for sharing those post-holiday deals with prospects), and invert your headlines simply by bouncing through some pick lists. You no longer have an excuse to skip your split testing.<\/p>\n<h2>#5: Exact(ish) Match Keywords<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/12\/exact-match-keyword-change-data\">Exact match keywords<\/a> have long been the conversion-driving force behind many a Google Ads\u00a0account. The level of control they afforded advertisers made tailoring ad and landing page copy to a searcher\u2019s query a breeze. Please note the use of past tense.<\/p>\n<p>In Q1, Google altered the way it defines exact match keywords, opting to broaden their scope.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2eb7c36b-0551-485e-bd3e-e0a2d628a097\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/exact-match-keyword-function-word-change-adwords.png\" alt=\"exact match keyword changes in 2017\" width=\"640\" height=\"300\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Today, \u201cexact\u201d is relative. Google Ads\u00a0now ignores, adds, or removes function words to match your target exact match keywords to very similar search queries. After analyzing 100 Google Ads\u00a0accounts over a 30-day period <em>after this change went into effect, <\/em>we discovered that, on average, 18% of active exact match keywords were rendered superfluous. If you haven\u2019t already audited your account, get in there and tidy things up before the new year!<\/p>\n<h2>#6: Custom Intent Audiences<\/h2>\n<p>The chief advantage of Google Ads, the ability to leverage user-intent (as conveyed through keywords), is lost on the Display network. As such, in the last month, Google has begun to take a more audience-centric, Facebook-like approach with the GDN.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c12a2009-6f1f-44d0-92cf-31c5e027e53d\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-custom-intent-audiences-auto-create.png\" alt=\"adwords new custom intent audiences\" width=\"366\" height=\"379\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/21\/new-adwords-features\">Custom intent audiences<\/a> give you the ability to find \u201cpeople who want to buy the specific products you offer \u2014 based on data from your campaigns, website and YouTube channel\u201d on the Display Network.

Custom intent audiences can be created manually, using topics and URLs to discover brand-spankin\u2019 new prospects, <em>or<\/em> you can lean on Google\u2019s machine learning (buzzword of the year).

Why not meld the two together?<\/p>\n<p>Although they\u2019d been in beta for a good long while, in October Google finally launched <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/24\/adwords-promotion-extension\">promotion extensions<\/a> to all Google Ads\u00a0accounts. If you\u2019re not familiar with these wonderful tidbits, promotion extensions allow you to show a HOT deal <em>and<\/em> a sizeable price tag icon beneath your text ad copy, like so:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c4670510-1c10-443c-aff3-181838448727\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-adwords-promor-extensions1-1.png\" alt=\"adwords promotion extensions\" width=\"314\" height=\"350\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The real value of promotion extensions, though, isn\u2019t in what they <em>add<\/em>: it\u2019s what they <em>subtract<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>By shifting the supporting information for your 20% off Christmas sale into a promotion extensions, you can leverage the full extent of your ETA (two headlines and a <em>fat<\/em> description) to convey the benefits of your offering and append a killer CTA.<\/p>\n<h2>#8: If Functions Enable Bespoke Copy<\/h2>\n<p>For my money, this is the most exciting change to come to Google Ads\u00a0since expanded text ads launched.<\/p>\n<p>Like promotion extensions in their ability to augment your ad copy to better serve specific searchers, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/07\/adwords-if-functions\">Google Ads\u00a0IF functions<\/a> allow you to tailor your copy based on either device (desktop or mobile) or audience. Why is this valuable, you might ask? Because your KPIs could probably benefit from reference to that hot, mobile-specific deal you\u2019re running.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"b5177555-a850-4b73-8223-b0877c1cbb35\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords_if_functions_device_ex.png\" alt=\"adwords if functions for mobile ads\" width=\"732\" height=\"297\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>More important than the device-targeted IF function is the audience iteration I mentioned. If you have an audience of recent cart abandoners or folk who completed a form fill on your site and never followed up, use IF functions to augment your copy to convey urgency, a special offer, or some other irresistible benefit.<\/p>\n<h2>#9: The Impact of Expanded Text Ads (A Retrospective)<\/h2>\n<p>Before you berate me in the Twitterverse, yes, I know Expanded Text Ads didn\u2019t come out in 2017.<\/p>\n<p>For most search advertisers they did, however, become <em>useful <\/em>in 2017. When ETA\u2019s first hit Google Ads\u00a0accounts, they simply didn\u2019t perform as advertised. This was due to advertisers\u2019 inability to write long(er) copy <em>and<\/em> all of that delicious historical performance data stored in our standard text ads.<\/p>\n<p>Well, months of split testing and CTR-related panic, things finally settled down. Then they flipped entirely. That\u2019s right, expanded text ads, now <em>the<\/em> text ad option available in your Google Ads\u00a0account, are actually useful.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"9c630ec6-d805-4c41-8ddd-5675e7826108\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/expanded-text-ads-high-ctr-2017.jpg\" alt=\"adwords expanded text ads improved ctr in 2017\" width=\"997\" height=\"602\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/14\/forgotten-adwords-best-practices\">Our own Mark Irvine pulled data<\/a> from more than 11,000 accounts and learned that Expanded Text Ads are <em>crushing <\/em>it. As advertisers continue to adapt to writing more copy, and Google releases more (and more useful) ad extensions, this trend should continue.<\/p>\n<h2>#10: Major Changes to Ad Rotation Settings<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019re in the middle of crushing a blog post about what moved and shook Google Ads\u00a0in 2017: I assume you\u2019re no slouch. This leads me to believe that you\u2019re a diligent split tester! As such, you probably noticed that <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/29\/adwords-ad-rotation-changes\">changes to ad rotation settings<\/a> that Google implemented towards the tail end of the summer.<\/p>\n<p>The plethora of ad rotation options available to advertisers were left on the Oregon Trail to die of a broken leg or dysentery. Now, your options have been streamlined, down to simply \u201coptimize\u201d and \u201crotate indefinitely.\u201d If you\u2019d been leaning on \u201crotate evenly,\u201d \u201coptimize for conversions,\u201d or smart bidding strategies, you were forced to completely rethink your approach to budget management. Good times. Today, you can manage ad rotation at the ad group <em>or<\/em> campaign level (yay!), but the smorgasbord of options by which that rotation can be defined has been scaled back significantly.<\/p>\n<h2>#11: Life Events Targeting for Everyone<\/h2>\n<p>Way back in June, Bryant Garvin, director of digital marketing at Purple (a mattress company), <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/05\/google-adwords-life-events-targeting\">shared some astounding figures<\/a>\u2026<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A 21.8% increase in purchase intent and 34.6% in lift consideration among people who were moving.<\/li>\n<li>A 23.1% increase in purchase intent and 25.1% lift in consideration among people who were engaged or recently married.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>How?

But this year, Google decided to help advertisers optimize for conversions by eliminating that 30% cap.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"8ff26788-1063-498f-9046-d28999edc925\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/changes-to-enhanced-cpc-bidding1.png\" alt=\"changes to enhanced cpc bidding adwords 2017\" width=\"679\" height=\"259\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>If the idea of paying a premium-premium for hyper-valuable keywords doesn\u2019t appeal to you, you can remove ECPC from your account and opt to manually control your bids; used sparingly throughout your account, though, this change has the potential to significantly augment your account performance.<\/p>\n<h2>#19: Smart Display Campaigns<\/h2>\n<p>The Display network is made up of <em>millions<\/em> of websites.

While less unique than, say, custom intent audiences, smart display campaigns will still help you drive conversions for your business; it\u2019s just that instead of a manicured set of keyword and URL-based parameters, you simply trust Google to place your creative in the right spots based on account history, ad creative, and a CPA goal.<\/p>\n<h2>#20: WordStream\u2019s New Free Keyword Tool<\/h2>\n<p>Shameless self-promotion?

This will help lower your CPCs on long-tail keywords that people are actively searching for, terms you\u2019re matching out to at a premium because your phrase match keywords don\u2019t encompass the entire query.
