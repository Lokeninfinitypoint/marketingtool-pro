Facebook demographic targeting<\/h2>\n<p>Facebook demographic targeting is a Core audience type, based on any of the information users supply to Facebook about themselves in their profiles.<\/p>\n<h3>How it works<\/h3>\n<p>The most basic demographic targeting option is by age, location, and gender.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-demographic-targeting.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"172\" alt=\"facebook ad targeting in iOS 14 and privacy first world: demographic targeting setup\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Then there is Detailed Targeting, which includes education level, financial or relationship status, whether they\u2019re parents or not, and more.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-detailed-targeting-demographics.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"330\" alt=\"facebook ad targeting in iOS 14 and privacy first world: ads manager detailed demographic targeting\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Privacy challenges<\/h3>\n<p>Overall, these will stick around fairly well given the self-reported nature of the information and likely won\u2019t be impacted unless some new take on the privacy laws is started.<\/p>\n<h3>Tips<\/h3>\n<p><strong>1. Target lifestyle demographics<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Although these may feel like very powerful options\u2014and they can be\u2014in our experience, they are better focused and applied to those types of options most explored on Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>For example, when on Facebook, people are more likely to update their profile and talk about getting engaged, how their kids are doing, or whether they bought a new home. Their education level and job experience is less likely to be up to date or accurate (that\u2019s what LinkedIn\u2019s for!).<\/p>\n<p>For that reason, the targeting options in this section that more closely tie to someone\u2019s personal life are usually a better bet than something outside of it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/facebook-demographic-targeting.png\" alt=\"facebook detailed targeting\" width=\"720\" height=\"395\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-57047\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/facebook-demographic-targeting.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/facebook-demographic-targeting-480x263.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>From our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/10\/facebook-ad-targeting-options\">epic Facebook ad targeting infographic<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>2. Facebook behavior &amp; interest targeting<\/h2>\n<p>This is another Core audience type. You can target behaviors and interests concurrently with demographics, but we just separated them out because they are more impacted by privacy.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook can infer information about users based on the information they provide in their Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger profiles as well as their engagement with sites in the Facebook audience Network.<\/p>\n<h3><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/facebook-behavior-interest-targeting.png\" alt=\"facebook behavior interest targeting\" width=\"503\" height=\"503\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-57048\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/facebook-behavior-interest-targeting.png 503w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/facebook-behavior-interest-targeting-480x480.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 503px, 100vw\" \/><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>From our <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/10\/facebook-ad-targeting-options\"><em>epic Facebook ad targeting <\/em><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/10\/facebook-ad-targeting-options\"><em>infographic<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>You can find behavior and interest targeting options by browsing Facebook\u2019s predefined lists or just start typing into the Detailed Targeting search box and locate individual targeting options.<\/p>\n<p>These options are very powerful. For example, you can target users who are interested in finance, but not just finance in general. You can segment by users who are looking at topics related to credit cards vs insurance vs mortgages:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-detailed-targeting-finance.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"142\" alt=\"facebook ad targeting in iOS 14 and privacy first world: detailed targeting options\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Privacy challenges<\/h3>\n<p>In the future, with signal loss from third-party tracking pixels around the Facebook network, it\u2019ll be harder for Facebook to create these segments with the same level of specificity.<\/p>\n<p>For example, when you search for Olympics, you are presented with lots of different interest targeting options for different years, summer vs winter, NBC, etc.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-detailed-targeting-olympics.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"377\" alt=\"facebook ad targeting in iOS 14 and privacy first world: detailed targeting example\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Just like with any other list segmentation process, it\u2019s easier to come up with lots of nuanced groups within a list if it\u2019s a big list to begin with. But the crackdown on third-party pixels essentially means Facebook will have a smaller list of signals to create new target groups from.<\/p>\n<p>So Olympics targeting will still be around, but rather than a list of years and TV network names, we may only see \u201cSummer Olympics\u201d and \u201cWinter Olympics,\u201d or maybe even just \u201cOlympics.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Tips<\/h3>\n<p><strong>2. Use it while you can<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>From a campaign strategy perspective, it\u2019s likely in your best interest to take advantage of these specific targeting options now while they\u2019re still around but prepare yourself and your clients for targeting loss in the future and start to look at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/31\/facebook-audience-targeting\">other Facebook targeting strategies<\/a> to help fill the void.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Try interest stacking<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>With audiences getting less specific, it might make more sense to target multiple interests in one ad set.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/generate-leads-facebook-ads-ios-detailed-targeting.png\" alt=\"facebook audience interest stacking\" width=\"600\" height=\"393\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-49576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/generate-leads-facebook-ads-ios-detailed-targeting.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/generate-leads-facebook-ads-ios-detailed-targeting-480x314.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For example if you\u2019re looking to target marketers, instead of creating an ad set to target users interested in Buffer, you might add Hootsuite + Sprout Social + StreamYard, etc. all into the same audience.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Facebook custom audience targeting<\/h2>\n<p>Advertising isn\u2019t always about finding new audience members. It\u2019s equally important to reengage those who are already familiar with your brand.<\/p>\n<h3>How it works<\/h3>\n<p>Custom audiences allow you to retarget users who have engaged with your brand in two ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Your own data: <\/strong>website or app activity, offline activity, and customer lists.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Facebook&#8217;s data: <\/strong>users who have interacted with your other Facebook assets, including videos, lead forms, Instant Experiences, Events, business Page, and more.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-custom-audience-creation.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"426\" alt=\"facebook ad targeting in ios 14 privacy first world: custom audience setup in ads manager\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Challenges<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cYour Sources\u201d are the targeting options that are impacted the most (and most directly) by all the tracking changes we\u2019re experiencing now.<\/p>\n<p>You may have noticed you\u2019re getting warnings like the one below, telling you that your audience may not include everyone who has been to your website due to tracking data loss.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-size-website-decrease-1.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"346\" alt=\"facebook ad targeting in privacy first world: notification in ads manager about audience size decrease due to iOS 14\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>That\u2019s one issue. And <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/11\/lower-facebook-ads-cpm\">smaller audiences mean increased CPMs<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, you\u2019re probably also getting this message saying that you also can\u2019t exclude everyone you\u2019d like from your campaigns because of&#8230;you guessed it&#8230;data loss.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-exclusion-limitations.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"450\" alt=\"audience exclusion limitation in facebook ads manager due to iOS 14\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>So not only can\u2019t you retarget everyone who has been to your website, but you also can\u2019t exclude everyone who has made a purchase\u2014due to privacy constraints.<\/p>\n<h3>Tips<\/h3>\n<p><strong>4. Use broad targeting &amp; audience expansion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For Website and App activity targeting, Facebook recommends using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/01\/facebook-audiences\">broad targeting<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/11\/facebook-advertising-strategies#targeting-expansion\">targeting expansion<\/a> and we\u2019re on board with that.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/generate-leads-facebook-ads-ios-targeting-expansion.png\" alt=\"facebook ads detailed targeting expansion\" width=\"600\" height=\"272\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-49577\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/generate-leads-facebook-ads-ios-targeting-expansion.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/generate-leads-facebook-ads-ios-targeting-expansion-480x218.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Going broader with your audience\u2019s interests gives Facebook\u2019s algorithm more to work with.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Upload customer lists<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Customer lists are one way to try and mitigate some of these losses, but they aren\u2019t and have never been perfect.<\/p>\n<p>Customer lists let you upload a list of user names, emails, phone numbers, etc. into an ad platform for matching to users in that platform\u2019s database. When a user is matched, they\u2019re added to your list and you\u2019re able to target them.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-customer-list.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"286\" alt=\"facebook ad targeting iOS 14 privacy: customer list audience setup\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>But the issue here is that not all users are able to be matched. Maybe they gave you a bogus email or simply a different one than what they signed up for Facebook with. Or they have multiple emails and Facebook isn\u2019t aware of that.<\/p>\n<p>No matter the cause, customer uploads can be a great way to backstop the loss of cookied website visitors, but it won\u2019t be a complete solution.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Related<\/strong>: <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/11\/facebook-advertising-strategies\">6 Facebook Ad Strategies to Try if You&#8217;re Hurting After the iOS14 Update<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>6. Rely on Facebook sources<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The easiest way to have full tracking capabilities for your target audience is to stop relying on the cookies and uploads altogether and simply rely on the platform interactions instead.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-facebook-sources.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"426\" alt=\"facebook ad targeting in iOS 14 and privacy first world: ads manager data source selection\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Anything in the second section is a Facebook-owned data source, meaning that Facebook owns that touchpoint and isn\u2019t subject to privacy issues if they use that interaction to target someone.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>With these privacy challenges, an optimized account is more important than ever before.

If they came to your page but didn&#8217;t purchase, target them with a Catalog campaign. If they\u2019ve liked a lot of your content, send them a lead gen form to download a guide. Just because it happens on Facebook and not your website, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not user behavior that should be taken advantage of.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/facebook-ads-on-platform-engagement-page-events.png\" alt=\"facebook ads - page behavior targeting\" width=\"500\" height=\"506\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-55235\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/facebook-ads-on-platform-engagement-page-events.png 500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/facebook-ads-on-platform-engagement-page-events-480x486.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw\" \/><strong>8.

Facebook recommends ThruPlay (as do we) as it will optimize to get the most completed video views if the video is 15 seconds or shorter. If it\u2019s longer than 15 seconds, it will optimize for people most likely to watch 15 seconds.<\/p>\n<h2>4.

Stay away from website audiences<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Lookalike effectiveness will really depend on how well you can create source audiences for Facebook to model from, so our tips here are the same as for custom audiences.
