If you continue to violate that same policy, you\u2019ll be entered into the strikes system which impacts your entire account.<\/p>\n<h3>Strike one<\/h3>\n<p>The first strike comes into play if any portion of your ad violates the same policy you were previously warned about within 90 days of the original warning. This will result in a temporary hold on your account for three days\u2014meaning none of your ads will run.<\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">Once your three-day advertising \u201ctime out\u201d is up, your account will continue to run as normal\u2014but the violating ad will stay disabled until corrected. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Strike two<\/h3>\n<p>You get a second strike\u00a0if you violate that same policy again within 90 days of the first strike. Once the second strike is initiated, your account will be put into a longer, seven day time out.<\/p>\n<p>For strikes one and two, you&#8217;ll be required to submit an acknowledgement form in addition to correcting the ad at fault.<\/p>\n<h3>Strike three<\/h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you manage to repeatedly violate the same policy again within 90 days of the second strike. The final third strike\u00a0will result in account suspension for an indefinite period.<\/p>\n<div data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d0b38506-2334-4dd3-a330-a687122e95bb\" data-langcode=\"en\" class=\"embedded-entity align-center\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-three-strikes-policy-summary.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"427\" alt=\"google ads three strikes policy summary\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/10957124\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Sounds a bit harsh, right?<\/h3>\n<p>Google is so advanced in these policies that it even covers 3D printing of any of the unapproved products.\u00a0\u00a0And remember, it\u2019s not just your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/14\/ppc-ad-copywriting\">ad copy<\/a> that could get a disapproval, but <strong>any content related to your account<\/strong>\u2014including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/02\/landing-page-tips-and-tricks\">landing pages<\/a>, images, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/06\/03\/adwords-ad-extensions-cheat-sheet\">ad extensions<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So this may sound harsh, b<span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">ut considering the following details, it\u00a0may not be not as harsh as you think:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whenever a strike or warning is issued, you\u2019ll receive an email notifying you of the violation (on top of the usual notification within the native platform).

What this means is, you&#8217;ll still incur a hold on your disapproved asset until you correct the violation.

Until September 21, 2021, the ad approval process will be status quo.<\/p>\n<p>As with any pilot, there is a chance that the new systems will be rescinded depending on the results. But Google sounds like they\u2019re hopeful that the new system will be here to stay:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cIn the future, we plan to expand the strikes system in phases to scope more of our policies in.

Of course, this will especially impact accounts that have struggled with those three policies in the past or already have approved yet questionable content running.

Here are my recommendations for how you can get ready for this pilot\u2014regardless of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/google-ads-3-strike-policy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">what the three-strikes\u00a0ad policy means for your account<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Appeal or resolve any outstanding disapprovals<\/h3>\n<p>Take this new initiative from Google as an opportunity as well as a reminder to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/15\/google-ads-account-audit-post-covid\">review your account<\/a> for any outstanding disapprovals.<\/p>\n<p>You may as well sweep through and appeal or apply changes to rid yourself of any disapproved content so that you have less to worry about later\u2014especially since Google mentioned plans for this system to incorporate other policies in future.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Check all corners of your account and website for any potentially triggering content<\/h3>\n<p>Save yourself a headache later and double check all of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/29\/google-ads-creative-studio\">digital assets<\/a> for anything that could get picked up by the automated review system to play it safe.<\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">As we know, it can be easy to get an incorrect disapproval. While some of that is on Google, we can focus on what we <em>can<\/em> control by removing or changing any verbiage or images that could even remotely pose a risk to those three policies. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>A good rule of thumb is: if you\u2019re questioning it, it\u2019s probably best to change it.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AdWordsGrader_AWGrader\">While you&#8217;re at it, try our FREE Google Ads Performance Grader to get a full audit of your account!<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>3. Roll out any new content prior to September if possible<\/h3>\n<p>This way, if anything does get disapproved for violation of one of those three policies, you save yourself a warning come September.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, any time we make a change to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/14\/writing-ad-copy-at-scale\">ad copy<\/a> (or roll out a new ad or <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/12\/11\/google-image-extensions\">ad extension<\/a>) it automatically goes through Google\u2019s review process. So\u00a0if possible, try activating those campaigns now to test the waters of what does (or doesn\u2019t) get approved. And if it doesn\u2019t, you\u2019ll have plenty of time to appeal it.<\/p>\n<div data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"07cb7840-0732-4b21-aff6-d22571a4e558\" data-langcode=\"en\" class=\"embedded-entity align-center\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-disapproval-appeal.jpg\" width=\"775\" height=\"275\" alt=\"google ads disapproval appeal form\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">You can then pause the campaign until you\u2019re ready to go live in September.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>4. Set up advertising on other channels<\/h3>\n<p>As Google continues to build a no-nonsense policy structure, it\u2019s becoming more important than ever to not rely on one single <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-multichannel-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing channel<\/a>. With the process for disapprovals continuing to be automated, you can\u2019t always trust that bots will understand your ad context like a person.<\/p>\n<p>In the event you do get disapproved\u2014or worse, suspended\u2014you\u2019ll have peace of mind knowing you still have<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/search-marketing-display-video\/7-ways-drive-leads-and-awareness-your-local-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> your brand awareness growing<\/a> elsewhere while you resolve your Google issues.<\/p>\n<h3>5. DON\u2019T make a backup account now or after your suspension<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019ll admit, I thought of the same exact workaround. If my account gets suspended for repeat disapprovals of these three policies, I can easily create a new account to try again, right?<\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">Wrong. Google thought of everything already. In the same announcement, the platform promises that creating new accounts will result in more suspensions with the following statement:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cWe already administer immediate account level suspensions when we detect egregious policy violations such as circumventing our systems (e.g.,<strong> creating new accounts to bypass multi-strike suspensions<\/strong>), phishing or misrepresenting the product or service to intentionally mislead users.\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>So, should you be concerned about Google&#8217;s three-strikes ad pilot?<\/h2>\n<p>While advertisers aren&#8217;t surprised by the three-strikes program, many feel the disapproval and appeal processes need improvement. In my opinion, the policies it enforces are harder to inadvertently violate, so this shouldn&#8217;t have a major impact on the average account. But it all depends on your industry, what other channels you&#8217;re advertising on, and more. Either way, follow my tips to prepare and you can feel more confident when the pilot rolls out in September 2021!<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It feels like just yesterday we were discussing issues like how to dispute Google Ad disapprovals or the new restrictions for\u00a0Housing, Employment, and Credit policies.
