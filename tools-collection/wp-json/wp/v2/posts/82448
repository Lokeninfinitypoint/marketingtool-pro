You can use one of these approaches or a combination of any of them. The goal is to get the juices flowing and see where they take you!<\/p>\n<div id=\"problem-solving-approach\"><\/div>\n<h3>1. The problem-solving approach<\/h3>\n<p>This approach is centered around <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/28\/pain-points\">pain points<\/a>. Put your pain point glasses on for a day and pay attention to every little thing that you find even the slightest bit inconvenient, cumbersome, challenging, boring\u2014basically any negative adjective you can think of. Then brainstorm ways you can solve those problems. The more common the task, the better, because the greater the need.<\/p>\n<p>For some inspiration, check out these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lifehack.org\/articles\/lifestyle\/25-creative-products-that-you-never-knew-you-needed.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">creative products you never knew you needed<\/a> by Lifehack.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/umbrella-cup-holder-business-idea.webp\" alt=\"umbrella cupholder business idea\" width=\"621\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-82451\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/umbrella-cup-holder-business-idea.webp 621w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/umbrella-cup-holder-business-idea-480x463.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 621px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>An <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lifehack.org\/articles\/lifestyle\/25-creative-products-that-you-never-knew-you-needed.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">umbrella cupholder<\/a>?

The personal inventory approach<\/h3>\n<p>This is the tried-and-true approach to coming up with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/12\/06\/small-business-ideas\">small business ideas<\/a>. Take a personal inventory of what comes naturally to you. Consider:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Your passions: <\/strong>Things you care about<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your core values:<\/strong> Standards you live by<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your best skills: <\/strong>What you\u2019ve become good at with practice<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your talents: <\/strong>What you\u2019re naturally good at without any practice<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your hobbies:<\/strong> Things you could do all day<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>List these out and see what kinds of ideas arise from them. I personally recommend this as the top way to brainstorm business ideas, because the more aligned your business is with your core self, the less friction you\u2019ll experience in starting, running, and growing it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/brainstorm-business-idea-personal-inventory-approach.webp\" alt=\"map showing personal inventory approach to business brainstorm\" width=\"741\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-82452\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/brainstorm-business-idea-personal-inventory-approach.webp 741w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/brainstorm-business-idea-personal-inventory-approach-480x388.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 741px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>There are several ways to map out your personal inventory, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hilarydefreitas.com\/3-things-you-should-consider-when-starting-a-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this one<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<div id=\"market-research-approach\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. The market research approach<\/h3>\n<p>This is the more practical approach to take when brainstorming business ideas, and one you should incorporate into any of the other approaches. After all, you need to make sure you can actually <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/04\/20\/go-to-market-strategy\">go to market<\/a> with your idea and be positioned for long-term success.<\/p>\n<p>Consider industry trends, emerging technologies, and consumer behavior so you can get an idea of the competitive landscape, identify unmet needs, discover niche audiences, and more. Market research encompasses a broad range of strategies, including surveys, social media listening, reading research reports and surveys, using market intelligence tools, and more.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/market-research-business-brainstorm.webp\" alt=\"chart showing market research approach to business brainstorm\" width=\"936\" height=\"523\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-82453\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/market-research-business-brainstorm.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/market-research-business-brainstorm-480x268.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.contify.com\/resources\/blog\/top-business-market-research-techniques\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udcda <strong>Free guide download &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite120WordsforMarketingWithEmotion.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_120WordsPhrases_Download\">135 of the Best Words &amp; Phrases for Marketing with Emotion<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"competitive-analysis-approach\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. The competitive analysis approach<\/h3>\n<p>Competitive analysis technically falls under market research, but these are so effective that they\u2019re worth calling out as their own approach. In short, a competitive analysis systematically examines the key components of other businesses like yours so you can identify gaps to fill and how to best position yourself. You can look at strengths, opportunities, weaknesses, and threats (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/12\/20\/swot-analysis\">SWOT analysis<\/a>) or use any other criteria that works for you. Here are a few <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/swot-analysis-examples\">SWOT analysis examples<\/a> for inspiration.<\/p>\n<p>This approach is great for once you\u2019ve got a clear picture of the type of business you want to start but want more guidance on coming up with the details of that business (like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">your target audience<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/25\/buyer-persona-examples\">buyer personas<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\">value proposition<\/a>, etc.).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/competitive-analysis-basic-marketing-template.webp\" alt=\"basic competitive analysis template example screenshot from wordstream\" width=\"936\" height=\"506\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76073\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/competitive-analysis-basic-marketing-template.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/competitive-analysis-basic-marketing-template-480x259.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>For help with this, use our <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/21\/competitive-analysis-templates\"><em>competitive analysis templates<\/em><\/a><em>!<\/em><\/p>\n<div id=\"business-name-approach\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. The business name approach<\/h3>\n<p>This, of course, should not be your only approach, but it\u2019s a good strategy to throw in when you need a break from all that market research. Creative business names can give way to creative business ideas, and vice versa.<\/p>\n<p>Do a business naming brainstorm session\u2014use our list of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/08\/business-name-ideas\">creative business names<\/a> to start!

The influencer approach<\/h3>\n<p>The right way to come up with a new business idea depends on what\u2019s driving you to start a business in the first place. And if it\u2019s simply that you have an entrepreneurial itch, but no prior experience, then take the time to expose yourself to some entrepreneurial inspo!<\/p>\n<p>Read books written by entrepreneurs, listen to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/20\/small-business-podcasts\">small business podcasts<\/a>, and start following inspirational business owners on social media. You\u2019ll open yourself up to a wide range of concepts, perspectives, approaches, and mindsets that can give way to great business ideas.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/brainstorm-business-idea-influencer.webp\" alt=\"influencer approach to brainstorming business idea\" width=\"884\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-82455\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/brainstorm-business-idea-influencer.webp 884w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/brainstorm-business-idea-influencer-480x325.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 884px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CtwPybwLEh6\/?img_index=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Everett Taylor <\/em><\/a><em>is one of many inspirational entrepreneurs you can follow on social media.<\/em><\/p>\n<div id=\"networking-approach\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. The networking approach<\/h3>\n<p>In addition to following popular entrepreneurs on social media, it\u2019s also a good idea to network with \u201cregular\u201d entrepreneurs. The influencers can provide inspiration but talking with people just like you will give you an added level of practicality to your ideation process.<\/p>\n<p>Find networking events and discussions happening in your local community and even virtually. Here are some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/growing-a-business\/7-networking-groups-every-small-business-owner-should-join\/437040\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">broader small business networking groups<\/a> to start with.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/score-website.webp\" alt=\"SCORE website homepage\" width=\"936\" height=\"535\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-82456\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/score-website.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/score-website-480x274.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.score.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>SCORE<\/em><\/a><em> is a great place to find local networking events in your area.<\/em><\/p>\n<div id=\"freelance-website-approach\"><\/div>\n<h3>8. The freelance website approach<\/h3>\n<p>Who says your new business has to be unique? If you\u2019re looking to start a freelance business, take a look at popular websites like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fiverr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fiverr<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.upwork.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Upwork<\/a>. You can find business ideas that use skills and talents you already have, or ideas that require you to develop new skills to reach growing markets.<\/p>\n<p>For example, take a look at fiverr. The navigation menu and \u201cpopular services\u201d section alone can give you a starting point from which to generate ideas.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Website development<\/li>\n<li>Logo design<\/li>\n<li>SEO<\/li>\n<li>Architecture and interior design<\/li>\n<li>Social media marketing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/fiverr-homepage.webp\" alt=\"fiverr website homepage\" width=\"936\" height=\"457\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-82457\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/fiverr-homepage.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/fiverr-homepage-480x234.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>fiverr\u2019s homepage alone is filled with business ideas based on demand or skillset.<\/em><\/p>\n<div class=\"incontent-red\">Looking for more ways to drive people to your site?

The Generation Z approach<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/09\/gen-z-stats\">Generation Z<\/a> is the upcoming generation of consumers, and they are known for being partial to brands that name specific core values and stand for them. If you\u2019ve got a cause you personally care about or specific set of values that you live by, let this serve as the foundation of your business idea.<\/p>\n<p>Examples include sustainability, civil rights, individuality, accessibility, and more. Similar to the personal inventory approach, starting a business out of something you\u2019re personally connected to tends to reduce friction throughout the business\u2019s evolution.
