That probably means you\u2019re going to run some social advertising (Facebook Ads, anyone?) and establish a brand presence on Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and maybe even some other social media networks.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/social20media20copy20graphs.jpg\" alt=\"social media copy graphs\" width=\"800\" height=\"540\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.alexa.com\/topsites\/countries\/US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Let\u2019s be honest, there are so many platforms with different length and tone requirements that it can be hard to figure out where to start when it comes to writing social copy. Luckily, we\u2019ve got some best practices you can follow to get you started. Here are seven ways to write more likable\u2014or more shareable, more heart-able, more tweetable\u2014social copy:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Create brand guidelines for social media copywriting<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Establish a goal for each social post<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Write for the audience on each social platform<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Encourage engagement<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Complement the visual with relevant copy<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Use hashtags and emojis wisely<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Stay on top of social media trends<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Let\u2019s get started. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">1. Create brand guidelines for social media copy<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">First and foremost, you need to decide who your brand wants to be on social media. While this may seem simple, it can get more complicated than you\u2019d initially expect. For instance, do you want to have the same voice on social as you do on your website? In <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/08\/facebook-local-advertising\">local advertising<\/a> or email marketing? What about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/26\/out-of-home-advertising\">out-of-home advertising<\/a> campaigns?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Social media provides a unique opportunity to show off the fun side of your brand, whether that is through consistently playful social copywriting or through showing off your fun employees. Don\u2019t believe me? Check out this tweet. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/social20media20copy20pop20tarts.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"562\" height=\"841\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">You wouldn\u2019t see Pop-Tarts make the same jokes during a TV commercial or in its customer service. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If you\u2019re not sure where to start when writing brand guidelines, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/10\/content-style-guide\">we\u2019ve got you covered<\/a>. If you\u2019re already working with some solid brand copywriting guides, that\u2019s even better. Simply add social media to your book of rules and jump off from there.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">2. Establish a goal for each social post<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">While it may be easy to establish a goal for each ad on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/31\/how-to-advertise-on-facebook\">Facebook<\/a>, Twitter, or LinkedIn, this can be tricky when it comes to organic posts. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">ICYMI: When you\u2019re building out social ad campaigns, each platform will have you select a goal to focus your advertising and increase performance. That goal could be anything from branding to clicks or conversions. If you\u2019re wondering how to establish a goal for your organic social media posts, why not start with the goals you apply to paid ads and expand your options from there? Consider these, for instance:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Branding<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Clicks<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Shares<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Conversions<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Followers<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Likes<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Comments or inbox replies<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Once you have set the goal, you can measure how successful a post is. Then, it\u2019s time to get <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/15\/copywriting-tips\">copywriting<\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">3. Write for the audience on each social platform<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Here\u2019s the thing about copywriting for social media: Each <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/03\/social-media-networks\">social media network<\/a> is created differently to serve different needs for different audiences. Which means you shouldn\u2019t use the copy you write for LinkedIn on Twitter and vice versa. In fact, when you\u2019re writing those brand guidelines, try to identify the *most* formal and informal you\u2019ll be on social media to establish some boundaries. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">For an exercise in social copywriting, let\u2019s pretend your office hosted a Halloween party with some clients and you\u2019d like to put the photos up on social. We\u2019ll use the most popular platforms as an example.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">LinkedIn<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">: \u201cHad a spooky time with @Client1, @Client2, and @Client3 last night at our annual Halloween Monster Mash\u2014let\u2019s haunt together again soon.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Tags are important on any platform, but especially if you\u2019d like your clients to repost! <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Facebook<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">: I\u2019d feel comfortable posting the same copy on Facebook, but you may want to consider posting more than one photo and tagging more people. Facebook lends itself to photo albums, and you\u2019re far more likely to see your \u201cfriends\u201d interacting with a post that has plenty of visuals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Twitter: <\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">\u201cIt\u2019s getting spooky up in here. The annual Monster Mash is under way, see you on the other side.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This platform lends itself to live updates, so you should try to tweet during the party. While that leaves less time for copy review, keep it short, sweet and throw in a picture. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Instagram: <\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">\u201cHappy Halloween from these spooky characters!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Like Twitter, Instagram can be used in real-time. If you had a Halloween fashion show or costume contest, you could snap pics and add them to your story right away. The day after, you can choose the best of the party photos and post it to your timeline, keeping the copy simple, casual, and direct.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">4. Encourage engagement<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If you\u2019ve decided to dig into social media, your brand is probably looking to tap into an audience that they cannot engage through other mediums. There is almost no other place that you can engage with potential customers like you can on social platforms. Yes, that should make you a bit cautious, but it should also be exciting!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Voss holds the crown for engaging their social media audience through contests and giveaways. The company\u2019s follower counts have exploded, and it has a very distinct brand on Instagram (and note all the co-branding tags!).<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/social20media20copy20voss.png\" alt=\"social media copy voss\" width=\"800\" height=\"462\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">A lot of companies tend to just talk about themselves on social, whether that means professing their mission, showing off their products or employees, or announcing company changes. Sure, that\u2019s great and all\u2014but if you only do that, your followers will get pretty bored. Or no one will see the value in following your accounts to begin with. Bring your brand down to Earth and start with something simple, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/13\/ugc-instagram\">user-generated content<\/a> from a relevant product giveaway or customer appreciation post. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">5. Complement the visual with relevant copy<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If there is anything that most B2B brands could do better, it\u2019s connecting the visual to the copy. Hey, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/17\/direct-to-consumer-marketing\">direct-to-consumer brands<\/a> could use help here too! I\u2019ve found that sometimes, we just want to have something, anything to post alongside a big brand statement like, \u201cWe believe sharing is caring, which is why we\u2019re launching this new initiative. Check it out now.\u201d But that copy is below the image of \u2026 a puppy? Why??<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As part of their Proud to Belong campaign, Ray-Bans posted a series of re-cut videos and photos on their social accounts. It provided the company a unique opportunity to pair those visuals with copy that can add to or explain the campaign.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/social20media20copy20rayban.png\" alt=\"social media copy rayban\" width=\"800\" height=\"513\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The best thing you can do is work hand-in-hand with your designer to make sure the messaging is cohesive throughout the post.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">6. Use hashtags and emojis wisely<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Remember when everyone used <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/29\/instagram-hashtags\">hashtags<\/a> all the time, on every single post? You\u2019d have some copy for the caption and then *at least* five hashtags. I did it, too! I\u2019m not ashamed!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Here\u2019s the thing. Hashtags <em>still <\/em>work; they function the same exact way they used to, at the beginning of social media platforms taking off. And people <em>still <\/em>use them to discover new content; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/21\/social-media-influencers\">influencers<\/a> are <em>still <\/em>leveraging them. It\u2019s up to you to decide if you want to include them in the posts you publish for your brand. If you want to contribute to a trending topic on Twitter, go for it. But outside of Twitter, I recommend making it a brand choice. Don\u2019t post copy with a ton of hashtags \u2026 and then write the next post without any.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Nike is definitely one of those brands that uses its own hashtags consistently and well. We all know #justdoit, no matter what the current campaign is.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/social20media20copy20nike.png\" alt=\"social media copy nike\" width=\"800\" height=\"590\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Similarly, emojis drive engagement and show that you\u2019re keeping up with the cool kids. However, make sure that emoji definitely means what you think it means before you post it. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">7. Stay on top of social media trends<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Though this probably sounds fairly obvious, make sure you (or whoever is in charge of writing your social media copy) is active on social media. That means they should be following a variety of accounts across platforms, looking at trending topics, and be able to comment on silly things like, \u201cgoing to tell my kids this is\u2026\u201d or the recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B7l01DEF4HI\/\">Dolly Parton challenge<\/a> comparing LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, and Tinder. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This tweet from Netflix was right on top of the internet poking fun at IHOP rebranding to IHOB. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/social20media20copy20netflix.png\" alt=\"social media copy netflix\" width=\"974\" height=\"314\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Opportunities for comments and jokes like this get stale quickly, so stay on top of trends\u2014plus, this is going to be your best defense against an accidental social media snafu. We\u2019ve all seen them, we\u2019ve all heard corporate apologies for them, try not to be one of them. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">Bonus tip: Just start drafting that social media copy<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Finally, as with any copywriting, you just have to <em>write<\/em>. A lot. Write a ton of different versions of the same copy, then start all over again with a different idea. Talk to your team about the messaging\u2014feedback is essential. All this gets easier when you plan ahead, so you can knock a full month of copywriting out in a couple days. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Social media content comes in
