For example, the Instagram profile picture minimum size is technically 110 x 110 px. Or, when creating a carousel post of image and video slides in different sizes, there\u2019s a square button that allows you to opt to have the slides stay in their original sizes rather than being automatically cropped to the same size. Also, <span data-teams=\"true\">Instagram image posts used to be square but they have since <a href=\"https:\/\/help.instagram.com\/1631821640426723\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">updated the display size<\/a>, although you can still upload square images as long as they&#8217;re 1080 height. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>Instagram also tends to compress images in posts that are uploaded in a larger file size than allowed, so try saving your Instagram content files in the most compact format possible without sacrificing quality.

Follow these six steps.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Create your Instagram business account<\/h3>\n<p>There are two ways you can <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-create-a-new-instagram-account\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">create a new Instagram account<\/a>. The first option is navigating to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.instagram.com<\/a> directly and following the prompts to create an account. Alternatively, you could download the Instagram app and sign up that way.<\/p>\n<p>For either of these two options, you could also sync your Facebook account to have your new Instagram account loaded up with your Facebook profile details. If you want to go this route, you\u2019ll need an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-advertise-on-facebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">account set up on Meta<\/a> via <a href=\"https:\/\/business.facebook.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/business.facebook.com\/<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no right or wrong account creation option, and they\u2019re all equally popular, so it depends on what might be best for your Instagram marketing needs. For example, if your business is already well established on Facebook, it may be easiest to just sync your Facebook page. Or, maybe you\u2019re launching a full Meta marketing strategy for a new brand, in which case you might want to get set up via the Meta Business Manager first.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have your account, <strong>be sure it&#8217;s set as a business Instagram account <\/strong>by clicking the \u201cedit profile\u201d button at the top of your account\u2019s page. Tap the <strong>switch to professional account<\/strong> prompt at the bottom of the edit profile page. From there, you can follow the prompts to select a category for your business, add contact details, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/10\/best-business-instagram-accounts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">example Instagram business accounts<\/a> to get some ideas of how to arrange your own account.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/instagram-marketing-professional-account.webp\" alt=\"instagram marketing - professional account option\" width=\"276\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-94268 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/instagram-marketing-professional-account.webp 276w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/instagram-marketing-professional-account-138x300.webp 138w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 276px) 100vw, 276px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>2.

The SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and timely) goal structure can <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/instagram-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">guide your Instagram<\/a> goal planning during this step.<\/p>\n<p>You might also want to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/facebook-ads-benchmarks-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">check out industry benchmarks<\/a> to see the average performance for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/01\/instagram-analytics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">key Instagram metrics<\/a> in your industry.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here are some Instagram marketing metrics to consider including in your goals:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Likes: <\/strong>Total number of users who clicked the \u201cheart\u201d button on your post.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Comments:<\/strong> Total number of users who commented on your post.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Shares: <\/strong>Total number of times a user sent your post to other users via <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-dm-on-instagram\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram direct messages<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Saves:<\/strong> Total number of users who saved your content to their archives.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Views:<\/strong> The number of times your post or reel was displayed on a user\u2019s screen.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Profile visits: <\/strong>Total number of times users visited your business\u2019s Instagram profile.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reach:<\/strong> Total number of unique accounts that saw your Instagram content at least once.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Follower count: <\/strong>The number of accounts that follow your business\u2019s page. Ideally, you want more or roughly the same number of accounts to be following you as you follow, known as your <strong>follower ratio<\/strong>. This makes your brand appear more desirable.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Of course, there are a ton of other actions and engagements you can track to measure your Instagram marketing results\u2014don\u2019t forget about end-goal conversions like website visits, sales, or leads. The point is to add a bit of structure to your strategy here.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/instagram-marketing-metrics.webp\" alt=\"instagram marketing metrics chart\" width=\"868\" height=\"659\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-94259 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/instagram-marketing-metrics.webp 868w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/instagram-marketing-metrics-480x364.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 868px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>3.

Create and publish your posts<\/h3>\n<p>This is arguably the most fun step in the Instagram marketing process: executing on your posts! You can <strong>click the plus sign <\/strong>at the bottom center of your Instagram screen to start posting.<\/p>\n<p>Instagram allows you to create posts ahead of time and save them as drafts, or you can use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/01\/17\/best-free-social-media-management-tools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">third-party tools<\/a> and marketing partners to do the heavy lifting for you when it comes to post creation, scheduling and optimization.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Track your performance<\/h3>\n<p>As you continue to post and engage on Instagram to promote your business, you\u2019ll need to keep a close eye on how everything is going. You\u2019ll probably want to use third-party tools and marketing partners for complete Instagram reports, but the first place you should go during this step is directly into the <strong>dashboard<\/strong> of creator tools offered within the platform.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/instagram-marketing-creator-tools.webp\" alt=\"instagram marketing -creator tools screenshot\" width=\"304\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-94255 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/instagram-marketing-creator-tools.webp 304w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/instagram-marketing-creator-tools-152x300.webp 152w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>From there, you can click into a few different<strong> insights <\/strong>pages.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/instagram-marketing-insights.webp\" alt=\"instagram marketing - insights page\" width=\"275\" height=\"503\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-94256 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/instagram-marketing-insights.webp 275w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/instagram-marketing-insights-164x300.webp 164w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"instagram-marketing-tips\"><\/div>\n<h2>Our top Instagram marketing tips<\/h2>\n<p>Once you get up and running on Instagram, keep these tips in mind.<\/p>\n<h3>Be active and engage with content<\/h3>\n<p>A critical step in the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/instagram-marketing-tips\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram marketing process<\/a> is interacting with your followers and the people you want to follow you.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re already posting follow-worthy content, then start liking, commenting, and following others. For instance, search popular hashtags and like away! Write complimentary comments on people\u2019s posts and repost from others to gain attention.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pro tip:<\/strong> You can opt to get notifications when accounts you\u2019re targeting share a new post, so you can interact with it sooner rather than later.<\/p>\n<h3>Test out different types of content<\/h3>\n<p>You might find that certain post types resonate best with different audiences. Don\u2019t be afraid to flex your content and test as needed. For example, Reels tend to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.socialinsider.io\/blog\/instagram-benchmarks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">double<\/a> your reach as opposed to standard posts. So, if you\u2019re prioritizing reach, you could post more Reels instead of image posts.<\/p>\n<h3>Set up an Instagram Shop<\/h3>\n<p>For businesses promoting products, an Instagram Shop is a quick and easy way to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/15\/selling-on-instagram\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sell on Instagram<\/a>. Users can click on your Instagram Shop to make purchases without having to leave the platform.

For example, you\u2019ll likely want to be promoting your business\u2019s Instagram account across other placements like your website, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-promote-your-youtube-channel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube channel<\/a>, and more. Additionally, always be thinking about how you can recycle other marketing materials into Instagram posts.<\/p>\n<p>You should be striving to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/22\/cross-channel-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">provide a seamless cross-channel experience<\/a> for your potential customers, so be sure that whatever you\u2019re posting on Instagram aligns with what you\u2019re promoting elsewhere.<\/p>\n<h3>Use hashtags carefully<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-use-hashtags-with-hashtag-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hashtags<\/a> can be a game-changer when you\u2019re trying to get found on Instagram. However, there are some outdated hashtag practices you\u2019ll want to avoid. It\u2019s best to prioritize only the most popular or relevant hashtags in your post captions, as stuffing your captions with tons of custom hashtags is a thing of the past.<\/p>\n<p>Not only that, but you might consider moving your hashtags down in your post caption so they\u2019re not as apparent. Today, users are much more aware of how hashtags help businesses gain more traction on social media. Using them too prominently in your post captions could come off a bit \u201cdesperate\u201d for views and likes.<\/p>\n<h3>Try using AI<\/h3>\n<p>There are a ton of different <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-prompts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ways you can use AI to optimize your Instagram<\/a> creative, brainstorm captions, and more. Whether you\u2019re using the Meta AI features within the Instagram platform or trying out third-party AI tools, be sure to give any AI-generated content an extra edit manually to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/brand-consistency\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">maintain brand consistency<\/a> and credibility.<\/p>\n<div id=\"instagram-marketing-examples\"><\/div>\n<h2>10 Instagram marketing examples<\/h2>\n<p>If you need some <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-to-post-on-instagram\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram marketing inspiration<\/a>, check out what these 10 businesses are posting on Instagram.<\/p>\n<h3>1.
