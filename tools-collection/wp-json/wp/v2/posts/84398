That\u2019s why establishing your YouTube SEO strategy early and checking in often is helpful.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how to get started.<\/p>\n<h3>Contents<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#youtube-seo-tips\">YouTube SEO tips and basics<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#how-to-get-found-on-youtube\">More ways to get found on YouTube<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#get-started-with-youtube-seo\">Get started<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"youtube-seo-tips\"><\/div>\n<h2>YouTube SEO tips to get your content in front of more viewers<\/h2>\n<p>YouTube is a platform for video content, but it\u2019s important to remember it\u2019s also a search engine. And some might even argue (like in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2023\/02\/03\/opinion\/youtube-beats-google.html\">The New York Times<\/a>) that it\u2019s a better one than Google. Here are tips for approaching your YouTube content creation and promotion with SEO in mind:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Do keyword research<\/h3>\n<p>Whether it\u2019s the foundation of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/13\/content-marketing-strategy\">content strategy<\/a> or a step in your brainstorming, keyword research belongs in your content ideation process. This is true for blog posts and guides that you want to rank on the Google SERP. It\u2019s also true for YouTube. These videos could appear on the Google SERP, and you want them to show up on YouTube\u2019s own search results page. Because, after all, YouTube is a search engine.<\/p>\n<p>So when you\u2019re creating YouTube videos, check for keyword opportunities. You can take a look at trending videos on your own account\u2019s homepage to start. Common <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/best-seo-tools\">SEO tools<\/a> like Semrush and Ahrefs have the option to focus keyword research on YouTube. This will let you explore many of the same features\u2014keyword term matches, long-tail related keywords, and level of competition to rank.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trends.google.com\/trends\/explore?gprop=youtube\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Trends<\/a> also has a drop-down option to select YouTube Search to explore trending topics. This is another option (especially if you don\u2019t have a subscription to Ahrefs, Semrush, or a similar tool) to look into keyword opportunities. The features aren\u2019t as extensive, but you can check out interest in a certain area and get some ideas for related keywords.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/youtube-seo-do-keyword-research.webp\" alt=\"using google trends for youtube seo\" width=\"886\" height=\"539\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-84429\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/youtube-seo-do-keyword-research.webp 886w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/youtube-seo-do-keyword-research-480x292.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 886px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Remember, you can also optimize retroactively. If you have a channel up and running, take a look at the video content on there and follow these steps to see if there\u2019s an opportunity to target your title or description\u2014which brings us to the next tip.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd0e <strong>Need help finding the right keywords?<\/strong> Try our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h3>2. Optimize your titles and descriptions<\/h3>\n<p>Once you have your keywords, make sure that your video title and description are optimized for SEO. Here are a few tips:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use your target keywords.<\/strong> Include your target keyword in your title, ideally at the beginning. And these should appear in your description, as well.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Keep it short.<\/strong> The title should land between 50 and 60 characters, and your description between 125 and 200 characters.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Be descriptive and specific. <\/strong>The titles and descriptions should match the content of the video\u2014keyword intent matters on YouTube, too.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/youtube-seo-optimize-titles.webp\" alt=\"example of youtube results with optimized titles\" width=\"887\" height=\"544\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-84430\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/youtube-seo-optimize-titles.webp 887w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/youtube-seo-optimize-titles-480x294.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 887px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The first organic result matches the search term exactly.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>3. Add relevant tags<\/h3>\n<p>Tags are keywords that you can add to your video\u2019s metadata. YouTube isn\u2019t clear on how effective tags are for reaching new viewers. The answer on <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/youtube\/answer\/146402\">YouTube Help<\/a> states that \u201cyou can add [tags] to your video to help viewers find your content,\u201d and that they ultimately \u201cplay a minimal role in your video&#8217;s discovery.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But when you\u2019re uploading your video to YouTube, it takes just a few moments to add tags. So it\u2019s worth adding these, whether or not the impact is \u201cminimal.\u201d On the details section of the video upload screen, after you\u2019ve added your title and description, scroll down and click on the prompt to show more.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/youtube-seo-add-tags.webp\" alt=\"add tags to videos for youtube seo\" width=\"859\" height=\"435\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-84431\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/youtube-seo-add-tags.webp 859w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/youtube-seo-add-tags-480x243.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 859px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Once the tags section appears, write in a few words and phrases to describe the content of your video. For example, if you\u2019re uploading a video on baking a cake, you might include: how to bake a cake, baking a birthday cake, pineapple upside down cake.<\/p>\n<p>Pro tip: If it\u2019s a tutorial for how to use your product or your service, make sure to include your brand name as a tag.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udcda\u00a0<strong>Free guide download<\/strong>\u00a0&gt;&gt;\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download\">The 36 Best Call to Action Phrases Ever (&amp; Why They Work)<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>4. Select a category<\/h3>\n<p>Below the section to add tags, you\u2019ll have the option to select a category for your YouTube video. It\u2019s unclear whether a category impacts reach\u2014some threads on Reddit say it can improve or tank performance and others question whether it does anything. But like adding tags, selecting a category takes just a moment, so it\u2019s worth adding to your routine. If it does increase your chances to rank, you don\u2019t want to miss the opportunity.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/youtube-seo-choose-video-categories.webp\" alt=\"add category to youtube video for youtube seo\" width=\"860\" height=\"437\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-84432\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/youtube-seo-choose-video-categories.webp 860w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/youtube-seo-choose-video-categories-480x244.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 860px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here are the options that you have to select a category on YouTube:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Autos &amp; Vehicles<\/li>\n<li>Comedy<\/li>\n<li>Education<\/li>\n<li>Entertainment<\/li>\n<li>Film &amp; Animation<\/li>\n<li>Gaming<\/li>\n<li>How to &amp; Style<\/li>\n<li>Music<\/li>\n<li>News &amp; Politics<\/li>\n<li>Nonprofits &amp; Activism<\/li>\n<li>People &amp; Blogs<\/li>\n<li>Pets &amp; Animals<\/li>\n<li>Science &amp; Technology<\/li>\n<li>Sports<\/li>\n<li>Travel &amp; Events<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Because the impact is unclear, don\u2019t spend too much time debating here. Take the two seconds to choose the best fit for your video, then move on to more important factors in your YouTube SEO.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Customize your thumbnail<\/h3>\n<p>YouTube will automatically select a still frame from your video as a thumbnail when you upload. You do not want to use this. Instead, you want to take the time to create your own. According to YouTube, <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/youtube\/answer\/12340300?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">90%<\/a> of the best-performing videos have custom thumbnails. People want to click on a visually appealing video, and a fuzzy still frame isn\u2019t going to cut it.<\/p>\n<p>Customizing your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/07\/youtube-thumbnail\">YouTube thumbnail<\/a> can be a project for a designer, or it can be straightforward editing in Canva or even Google Slides with a screengrab and a title overlay. Take a look at the thumbnails for the budgeting videos below. They\u2019re all different, but they\u2019re all fairly low-production in terms of design elements. Most are still images with titles, screenshots, or logos added.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/youtube-seo-customize-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"example of customized youtube thumbnails\" width=\"680\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-84433\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/youtube-seo-customize-thumbnail.webp 680w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/youtube-seo-customize-thumbnail-480x424.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 680px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re creating your custom thumbnail for YouTube, keep these specs in mind:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimum resolution of 1280&#215;720.<\/li>\n<li>Minimum width of 640 pixels.<\/li>\n<li>File types JPG, GIF, or PNG.<\/li>\n<li>Maximum file size 2MB for videos or 10MB for podcasts.<\/li>\n<li>Required 16:9 aspect ratio.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And while you\u2019re customizing, don\u2019t forget to add your logo as a watermark in the thumbnail, too.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Set up playlists<\/h3>\n<p>YouTube allows you to create playlists of multiple videos. Once you have a few related videos on your YouTube channel, it\u2019s setting one up.<\/p>\n<p>By setting up a playlist of related videos, you can keep engaged viewers watching your content for longer. This could be multiple videos on a certain topic, like the garden creation or cake baking we talked about earlier. It could also be videos for a specific audience, like a collection of videos with marketing tips or SMBs or yoga classes designed for teachers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/youtube-seo-make-playlists.webp\" alt=\"example of youtube playlist\" width=\"839\" height=\"362\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-84434\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/youtube-seo-make-playlists.webp 839w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/youtube-seo-make-playlists-480x207.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 839px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zRDQqJEuRcw&amp;list=PLui6Eyny-UzwjVpXSAgjOh8FPkpuwImex\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>7. Double-check your file name<\/h3>\n<p>I am guilty of downloading files and never adjusting the name. This is frustrating at the moment when I have 16 files named &#8220;screenshot&#8221; on my desktop. It\u2019s also more than a missed organizational opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to your YouTube videos, take the time to rename the files with your keyword, or even your full title that might include \u201chow to.\u201d This is another opportunity to signal the content of the video to YouTube\u2019s search engine in the video\u2019s metadata.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Review analytics and adjust your strategy<\/h3>\n<p>Your YouTube SEO strategy will include a lot of front-end optimization to give your videos the best chance of reaching your audience. But it\u2019s important to check in on performance.<\/p>\n<p>From the sidebar of your YouTube Studio page, head to the Analytics section.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/youtube-seo-use-analytics.webp\" alt=\"analytics section in youtube studio\" width=\"226\" height=\"542\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-84435\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/youtube-seo-use-analytics.webp 226w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/youtube-seo-use-analytics-125x300.webp 125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here, you\u2019ll see overall views, watch time, and channel subscribers. You can also dig into the performance of specific videos and details of your audience, including a breakdown of new and returning viewers. This will help you create new content, or even find ways to optimize existing content with new keywords, based on your audience\u2019s interest. Plus, it\u2019s a good way to see what isn\u2019t working and save your time.<\/p>\n<p>After all, YouTube has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.globalmediainsight.com\/blog\/youtube-users-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2.7 billion users<\/a>. And these users spend an average of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oberlo.com\/statistics\/average-time-spent-on-youtube\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">48 minutes each day<\/a> interacting with content. Your audience is online, so it\u2019s a matter of creating the content that they\u2019re interested in viewing and getting that content in front of them.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/time-spent-on-youtube.webp\" alt=\"chart showing time spent on youtube\" width=\"874\" height=\"480\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-84436\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/time-spent-on-youtube.webp 874w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/time-spent-on-youtube-480x264.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 874px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>YouTube SEO can help serve your video content to more interested viewers on YouTube and on the Google SERP, so it\u2019s worth taking the extra time.

Create a channel trailer<\/h3>\n<p>This is one of my favorite tips because I wish there were more YouTube channel trailers. These brief videos can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduce your audience to you and your brand.<\/li>\n<li>Provide an overview of the type of content that you publish.<\/li>\n<li>Preview the style of your YouTube videos.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This last one is particularly helpful. If your content <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/2024-seo-strategies\">strategy<\/a> leans heavily to posting videos of podcast interviews or how to series or confessional, chatty USG content, this is good to know upfront.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, you don\u2019t have to create much net-new content for this, as featuring highlights from your existing content is key.

Share across other channels<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/seo\">SEO<\/a> is an excellent lever for reaching new audiences on YouTube. But if your business has followers on other platforms, there\u2019s a good chance at least some of them are already using YouTube. They need to know about your content, there.<\/p>\n<p>So <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-promote-your-youtube-channel\">promote your YouTube content<\/a> in your other marketing channels. Embed relevant YouTube videos in your blog posts. If you have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/25\/email-newsletter-ideas\">newsletter<\/a>, you can add a section featuring your YouTube channel and include links to new videos in follow-up communications.

For instance, try out some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/july-content-ideas\">summer-themed content<\/a> related to your brand, whether it\u2019s a series of lawn care videos throughout June or a weekly rating of new ice cream shops in your area.
