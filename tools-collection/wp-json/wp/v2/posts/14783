If you had any doubts about your ecommerce audience being there, set them aside \u2013 your potential customers are most certainly there, regardless of your industry, business size, budget, or goals. Sure, Facebook has had its fair share of bad publicity, rising costs, and targeting changes in the last year; however, the tech giant continues to reign supreme as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/28\/facebook-advertising-benchmarks\">least expensive online advertising channel<\/a> and its robust <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/10\/facebook-ad-targeting-options\">targeting options<\/a> are incomparable to others.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking to get started with Facebook Ads for ecommerce to propel your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/31\/2020-ecommerce-marketing-trends\">ecommerce marketing efforts<\/a> and drive sales, keep on reading. In this guide, you\u2019ll learn:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How to identify your target audiences on Facebook<\/li>\n<li>How to select the proper Facebook campaign objectives<\/li>\n<li>How to set your accounts up for Facebook ecommerce success<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Setting the stage for Facebook ecommerce<\/h2>\n<p>Before you begin driving Facebook ecommerce sales, let\u2019s take a few steps back and lay the foundation of your account. Begin by setting up an advertising account for your business in <a href=\"https:\/\/business.facebook.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook Business Manager<\/a>. This is where you will house all of your business assets, such as your business Page, Ads Manager account, and your Catalog (more on this later).<\/p>\n<p>Next, whether you are ready to begin advertising or not, generate the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/952192354843755\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook Pixel<\/a> in Ads Manager and implement it on your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/08\/how-to-build-an-ecommerce-website\">ecommerce site<\/a>. With this pixel installed, you can begin tracking users for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/11\/facebook-conversion-tracking\">future benefits<\/a>, such as custom audience creation and targeting, and tracking both overall performance and conversions. You can also use pixel-generated data to improve your Facebook ecommerce campaigns.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c40e1e43-b54f-4270-a767-0959deb420cd\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ecommerce-create-audience.jpg\" alt=\"create audience for Facebook ecommerce\" width=\"689\" height=\"432\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>If you are not quite ready to launch your Facebook ecommerce\u00a0campaigns, you should still complete these steps. This will save you time down the road, and you will be ahead of the game by having data and audiences already accumulating for your later use.<\/p>\n<h2>Funnel-based Facebook ecommerce campaigns<\/h2>\n<p>Facebook currently offers thirteen campaign objectives, as seen below. While it may be enticing to select conversions for your ecommerce campaigns, that may not always be the best option in terms of driving your bottom line and using your budget effectively.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"20196680-876c-4999-aa30-053e6e6b797c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ecommerce-create-campaign.jpg\" alt=\"create a campaign for Facebook ecommerce\" width=\"836\" height=\"764\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Facebook breaks up campaign objectives into three stages: awareness, consideration, and conversion. Look at these as you would a conversion map or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/22\/facebook-sales-funnel\">sales funnel<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Facebook ecommerce campaigns: Awareness<\/h3>\n<p>Awareness campaigns are excellent introductory points. Test these with a cold audience that is not yet familiar with your products. These campaigns are typically lower in cost as they are top of the funnel.<\/p>\n<p>In these ads, say hello, introduce yourself, just as you would when meeting someone in real life. Don\u2019t start off with a hard sell, as that may be off-putting. After all, you wouldn\u2019t attend a networking event and say, \u201cHello, nice to meet you, give me money.\u201d Would you? We haven\u2019t been acquainted yet, so you might \u2013 but the chances you\u2019ll get that money will be slim.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"da8a626e-0fb7-4649-afcc-1a37b7d3224c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ecommerce-awareness-campagin-meme.jpg\" alt=\"awareness meme\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Facebook ecommerce campaigns: Consideration<\/h3>\n<p>As users get further down your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/13\/facebook-funnel\">Facebook funnel<\/a> but have not yet converted, test out a traffic campaign. It\u2019s an excellent method of driving more traffic to particular product pages, which can increase your chances of sale. Admittedly, I use this campaign objective as our introductory point over an awareness or reach campaign for Facebook ecommerce clients, because we can drive users to the website and tag them with the pixel so in the case that they don\u2019t convert. That way, we can retarget them to come back later with new messaging around features or special promotions. The former awareness options may not get us that far.<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re getting started with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/13\/facebook-ecommerce-tips\">Facebook ecommerce<\/a>, you should test out either or both of these options to see what works best for you. With this campaign type, using a call to action such as \u201cLearn More\u201d can be effective in driving users to your site as they are still in the discovery phase and do want to learn more.<\/p>\n<p>Purple mattress company does an exemplary job with ads, as seen below. \u00a0This ad showcases the new bed sheets without making a hard sell. The company wants you purchase the sheets, but the primary goal of this ad is to educate, to entertain, to stand out among bedding competitors, and to drive that click-through to the site. Take this into account when brainstorming the ways you can turn your products into captivating, informative, helpful, or even entertaining ads to drive new users into your funnel.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6eafeb98-2dec-4d52-bd12-a60a077b954e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ecommerce-consideration-campaign-ad-example.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook ecommerce consideration campaign ad\" width=\"535\" height=\"788\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Facebook ecommerce campaigns: Conversions<\/h3>\n<p>Now that your audience knows you, it\u2019s time to get down to business and encourage them to return and make that purchase. Launch a conversion goal campaign with warmer audiences. One tactic that is effective here is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/04\/facebook-retargeting\">retargeting<\/a> a warm audience, such as previous website visitors, page visitors, cart abandoners, or newsletter subscribers, by enticing them to come back to your site and complete the purchase.<\/p>\n<p>For conversion campaigns, stepping it up a notch with a stronger call to action such as \u201cShop Now\u201d is effective in increasing your chances of a sale, as seen in the Nisolo shoe ad below. If you have a special promotion to share, this is a good time to incentivize.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5c00e302-3df2-49a1-9780-61f643f2dc53\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ecommerce-conversion-campaign-ad-example-1.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook ecommerce conversion campaign ad\" width=\"331\" height=\"340\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The reason you should focus on warmer audiences here is that trying to make a hard sell with a cold audience can be more expensive this far down funnel and with this campaign objective. Historically, we\u2019ve seen that results are far from fruitful.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/24\/facebook-free-leads\">Facebook\u2019s algorithm<\/a> tends to be more rewarding to advertisers if they can achieve the selected campaign goal. For example, if a conversion campaign is selected and does not drive many conversions, Facebook will see that campaign and its assets as irrelevant to the audience, thus providing a poor user experience on their platform. Word has it that if you aren\u2019t able to complete about 30 goals per day, your impression-share will decrease over time and costs will go up. The adverse seems to be true as well in that if you are able to drive high goal completion rates, impression share goes up and costs decrease. It\u2019s a \u201cyou scratch my back, I\u2019ll scratch yours\u201d type of relationship between Facebook and advertisers.<\/p>\n<h2>Make the most of your Facebook ecommerce campaigns<\/h2>\n<p>Good news for Facebook\u00a0ecommerce sellers: Products can be advertised using every <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/23\/facebook-ad-examples\">ad type on Facebook<\/a>. If you\u2019re looking to showcase a single product, try single image or video ads. If you have multiple products, Carousel ads and Collection ads are optimal here, as they give users more options to choose from and can increase your chance of a sale.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d843153c-e61a-4a86-9189-eb6482f49202\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ads-for-ecommerce.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook ads for ecommerce\" width=\"666\" height=\"700\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Catalog sales<\/h3>\n<p>Single creative ads and Carousel ads can use used in all campaign objectives except Catalog Sales. For this campaign objective, you\u2019ll need to use Collection ads.<\/p>\n<p>Collection ads may sound and appear similar to Carousel ads, but they are much more personalized, customizable, and automated. Carousel ads, as seen above, scroll left to right with individual slides. Collection ads, on the other hand, take up more screen real estate for a catalog-like shopping experience, as seen here.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"58f91bd6-6553-4f90-a632-7c87d24222b8\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ads-for-ecommerce-catalog-sales.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook ecommerce catalog sales ad\" width=\"339\" height=\"608\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via Adweek.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>To set up a Catalog Sales campaign and begin advertising your product inventory, head to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/products\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Catalog Manager<\/a>, where you will be prompted to create or upload a product fee or you can view any that have already been shared with you.

Need we say more as to why video ads are stepping stones to Facebook ecommerce success?<\/p>\n<p>Video leaves less to the imagination and manages customer expectations. It\u2019s also a faster visual way to connect with your audience. From showcasing your brand story or products in awareness campaigns to displaying new features or customer testimonials in conversion retargeting campaigns, there are endless creative possibilities of how to advertise your products to drive that sale through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/25\/facebook-video-ads\">Facebook video ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"92aceef8-c541-4d75-8f49-c01990f351b0\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ads-for-ecommerce-video-ads.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook video ad\" width=\"337\" height=\"427\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Video ads, compared to their static image counterparts, often convert at higher rates. Video ads can currently be used in each campaign objective type except for Catalog Sales. If you have dialogue in your video, cover all bases by telling your story textually, visually, and acoustically, as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/tjmccue\/2017\/09\/22\/top-10-video-marketing-trends-and-statistics-roundup-2017\/#21911ac77103\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">85% of Facebook users watch video without sound<\/a>, says Forbes. We also don\u2019t want to disregard anyone that may be hearing impaired. To assist with the acoustic to visual component, append captions.<\/p>\n<p>You can easily add captions to your videos in the ad level where you select your creative. From there, you can select the first option for Facebook to automatically generate captions or you can upload your own SubRip Text file or SRT file. The former option quickly scans your video and generates captions that you can review and edit as needed. Keep an eye out for any miscaptions of your brand name, people\u2019s names, and, especially if anyone has an accent in your video, review before saving as this feature can miscaption words on occasion.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"e32d64b9-08c2-4fe0-a094-a305aba71e63\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ads-for-ecommerce-video-ads-captions-recommended.jpg\" alt=\"captions for video ads\" width=\"718\" height=\"320\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Facebook ecommerce: From setup to success<\/h2>\n<p>As an ecommerce brand, you have the luxury of using a variety of Facebook\u2019s features to your advantage.
