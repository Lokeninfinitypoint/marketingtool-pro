Google has put retention reports blatantly in the Life Cycle report to reflect its importance. Though this section of GA4 is currently sparse, I can imagine we will see updates in the coming years.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/ua-vs-ga4-tabs.png\" alt=\"ga4 vs universal analytics menus\" width=\"600\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-62247\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/ua-vs-ga4-tabs.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/ua-vs-ga4-tabs-480x479.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Users vs traffic<\/h3>\n<p>As you may know, a user is a person that comes to your site.

Today though, monetization could include ad revenue, in-app sales, or ecommerce.<strong> In GA4, monetization reports take all streams of revenue into account.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On the downside, if you don\u2019t track anything of direct monetary value on your site, this entire section of GA4 is useless.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/google-analytics-4-monetization.png\" alt=\"google analytics 4 monetization view\" width=\"720\" height=\"339\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-62240\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/google-analytics-4-monetization.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/google-analytics-4-monetization-480x226.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is a bummer because in UA, conversion reports weren\u2019t solely focused on money.

Each session was made up of different \u201chit types.\u201d These hit types included page hits, ecommerce hits, social interaction hits, etc. In contrast, GA4 is an event-based platform, meaning everything is considered an event. First visit? Event. Pageview? Event.

It\u2019s likely you\u2019ve used Product Linking with Google products before, maybe through Search Console or Google Ads. Basically all it does is link data between different Google Products, there is no real difference with Product Linking in GA4 other than the platforms available.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In GA4 you now have the option to link to Google Merchant Center, Google Optimize, and BigQuery natively and for free!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/ga4-link-integrations.png\" alt=\"google analytics 4 link integrations\" width=\"400\" height=\"573\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-62243\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/ga4-link-integrations.png 400w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/ga4-link-integrations-209x300.png 209w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Available customizations<\/h3>\n<p>Perhaps the most underrated feature of Google Analytics 4 is the ability to customize the platform to meet your needs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Not only are you able to create custom reports in GA4 like you could in UA, but you can actually add those reports right to your navigation.<\/strong> That\u2019s right, no more having to navigate to a separate part of the platform! In GA4, if you want to create a new report, you can put it anywhere in the Reports navigation.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/ga4-page-screens-report.png\" alt=\"ga4 page screens report\" width=\"720\" height=\"478\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-62244\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/ga4-page-screens-report.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/ga4-page-screens-report-480x319.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Other customization options include changing the name of collections and topics in the secondary navigation using the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/analytics\/answer\/10460557?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Library<\/a>(not to be confused with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-library\">Google Ads library<\/a>).<\/p>\n<h3>Explorations<\/h3>\n<p>You can create dashboard-esque reports using the Explorations in GA4. I like to say that Exporations is the love-child of custom dashboards from Universal and user interface of Data Studio.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/google-analytics-4-explore-tab.png\" alt=\"ga4 explore tab\" width=\"720\" height=\"309\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-62245\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/google-analytics-4-explore-tab.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/google-analytics-4-explore-tab-480x206.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Machine learning capabilities<\/h3>\n<p>We started to see the roll out of machine learning tools with Universal Analytics. Insights were rolled out in 2018 to help people find trends and outliers in their data. As time went on, the machine learning got more sophisticated and allowed users to \u201cask questions\u201d in the search bar as a way of quickly finding information.<\/p>\n<p>When GA4 was released, insights were baked into the platform more than ever. Not only are insights available and highlighted throughout the platform, but new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-analytics-ai\">machine learning tools<\/a> were also introduced!<\/p>\n<h3>Anomaly detection<\/h3>\n<p>Anomaly detection, which was previously reserved for insights, is now available on most line charts. This tool is extremely helpful for identifying statistical differences in your data at a glance. In order for anomaly detection to work, Google must have sufficient historical data to build predictive models. Which leads to the next new tool\u2014predictive analytics!<\/p>\n<h3>Predictive analytics<\/h3>\n<p>Previously, if someone wanted to access predictive analytics, they would have to pay for another tool or create them themselves. But, no more! GA4 introduced predictive analytics for LTV, churn probability, likely churners, likely top spenders, likely purchases, purchase probability and more.<\/p>\n<h3>Attribution<\/h3>\n<p>For the last few years, Google has been working on its tools. With the rollout of Universal Analytics, it rolled out its multi-channel funnel tools. Then, in December of 2019, it rolled out its Attribution Project tool which allowed users to access a group of tools surrounding attribution and conversion.<\/p>\n<p>Now in GA4, we see a section in the primary navigation called \u201cAdvertising,\u201d Upon clicking into this section of GA4, we will find all of the same tools from the Attribution Projects. This includes conversion paths, time to conversion, the model comparison tool, and touchpoints to conversion.<\/p>\n<p>But the tools aren\u2019t the only attributions you\u2019ll see in GA4. In the last few months, Google announced that all users were getting access to Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/30\/data-driven-attribution-default-update\">data-driven attribution model<\/a>. Once that rolled out, all GA4 properties were changed to using that model as their default conversion model, whereas UA still relies on last-click.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/google-analytics-4-attribution-panel.png\" alt=\"google analytics 4 conversion panel\" width=\"300\" height=\"439\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-62246\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/google-analytics-4-attribution-panel.png 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/google-analytics-4-attribution-panel-205x300.png 205w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Lots to learn<\/h2>\n<p>Here is the thing: We are just starting to really understand GA4. And much like every other Google product, it changes every day! There is still so much to learn and discover in GA4, and this process will look different for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>I highly encourage you to get out there and play around in GA4. It may be uncomfortable, but I assure you it\u2019s much more like UA than you think it is, just a bit more sophisticated. And who could be mad about that?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>GA4 is not to be feared.
