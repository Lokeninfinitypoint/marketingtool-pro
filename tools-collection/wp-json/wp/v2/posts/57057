Those stats are interesting, but they\u2019re not meant to be the foundation of your long-term TikTok strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Why? Because your business isn\u2019t average.<\/p>\n<p>You have unique customers and followers with their own online habits\u2014stay-at-home parents don\u2019t peruse social media at the same time as most restaurant workers.

But only if you\u2019re posting quality content that\u2019s relevant to your audience.<\/p>\n<p>It goes like this. Every time someone opens TikTok, the first thing they see is a curated collection of content from new (to them) creators called the For You Page (FYP). <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/07\/how-to-get-on-tiktok-fyp\">Land a spot on the coveted \u201cFor You Page\u201d<\/a> and your organic reach goes through the roof!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/TikTok-times-TikTok-for-you-1.jpg\" alt=\"Best times to post on TikTok - Screenshow of a TikTok post from the For You Page\" width=\"305\" height=\"594\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-72521 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/TikTok-times-TikTok-for-you-1.jpg 305w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/TikTok-times-TikTok-for-you-1-154x300.jpg 154w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The TikTok algorithm uses two signals to decide what to place on the FYP. The post has to share some characteristics (music, topic, etc.) with content the user previously engaged with. And it needs enough engagement to prove that people will like it.<\/p>\n<p>The second one is where timing comes in. If you post fresh content when your current users are most likely plugged in, it\u2019ll get more early engagement. Then that post has a better shot at being discovered on FYPs.<\/p>\n<p>So don\u2019t skimp on what you post. But make sure to share it at the right time.<\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s the best time to post on TikTok?<\/h2>\n<p>The best time to post on TikTok depends on when your unique audience is thumbing through videos. You\u2019ll learn when that is after posting some content (we\u2019ll show you how in a bit).<\/p>\n<p>But where do you start if you don\u2019t have data yet? Let\u2019s use a few recent studies to help us pick times to post your first TikToks.<\/p>\n<p>Each study came up with a slightly different answer. So we\u2019ll triangulate based on all three to get the best options.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the absolute best times to post on TikTok according to each study:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hootsuite.com\/best-time-to-post-on-tiktok\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hootsuite<\/a>: 7 p.m. on Thursday<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/sproutsocial.com\/insights\/best-times-to-post-on-tiktok\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sprout Social<\/a>: 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Tuesday<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/influencermarketinghub.com\/best-times-to-post-on-tiktok\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Influencer Hub<\/a>: 9 a.m. on Tuesday, 12 a.m. on Thursday, and 5 a.m. on Friday<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>That\u2019s a pretty big spread. But if you look at where things do intersect, we can draw a few conclusions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Weekdays beat weekends by a long shot<\/li>\n<li>Before work and at the end of the traditional workday are safe bets<\/li>\n<li>Tuesday and Thursday are the best overall days to post<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The results don&#8217;t mean you should only post on Tuesdays and Thursdays. TikTok recommends releasing new content up to four times each day, so plan to spread them around a little. Especially as you learn when your audience is most active.<\/p>\n<h3>Best time to post on TikTok by day<\/h3>\n<p>The Influencer Marketing Hub study is based on 100,000 posts\u2014more than the others. So we\u2019re using it to inform our daily TikTok schedule. Note that these times are all Eastern Standard Time.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-get-on-tiktok-fyp-best-time-to-post-tiktok.png\" alt=\"best time to post on tiktok\" width=\"720\" height=\"675\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-65211\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Best time to post on TikTok on Monday<\/h4>\n<p>6 a.m., 10 a.m., and 10 p.m. are the best times to post on Monday. Seems like people want to wind up their week and wind down their Monday on TikTok.<\/p>\n<h4>Best time to post on TikTok on Tuesday<\/h4>\n<p>2 a.m., 4 a.m., and 9 a.m. are the top times to post on Tuesday. There\u2019s also particularly high engagement at 9 a.m., so schedule some content then.<\/p>\n<h4>Best time to post on TikTok on Wednesday<\/h4>\n<p>7 a.m., 8 a.m., and 11 p.m. are the best target times for posting on Wednesday. Similar to Monday, people want to start and end their day watching short-form videos.<\/p>\n<h4>Best time to post on TikTok on Thursday<\/h4>\n<p>9 a.m., 12 p.m., and 7 p.m. are your best bets for posting on Thursday. Engagement is high at noon, so it\u2019s a good time to catch people dreaming about the weekend.<\/p>\n<h4>Best time to post on TikTok on Friday<\/h4>\n<p>5 a.m., 1 p.m., and 4 p.m. rank highest for posting on Friday. That makes sense since people are often doing fun stuff instead of watching TikTok on Friday night.<\/p>\n<h4>Best time to post on TikTok on Saturday<\/h4>\n<p>11 a.m., 7 p.m., and 8 p.m. is when you\u2019ll want to target your first few Saturday posts. Interesting that fewer people are watching early on Saturday. They&#8217;re either up and going or recovering from Friday night.<\/p>\n<h4>Best time to post on TikTok on Sunday<\/h4>\n<p>7 a.m., 8 a.m., and 4 p.m. are the best options for posting on Sunday. That afternoon slot is a good time to help people chase away the Sunday scaries.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a handy chart to keep it all straight.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Day<\/strong><\/th>\n<th><strong>Best time to post on TikTok<\/strong><\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monday<\/td>\n<td>6 a.m., 10 a.m., 10 p.m.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tuesday<\/td>\n<td>2 a.m., 4 a.m., 9 a.m.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wednesday<\/td>\n<td>7 a.m., 8 a.m., 11 p.m.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Thursday<\/td>\n<td>9 a.m., 12 p.m., 7 p.m.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Friday<\/td>\n<td>5 a.m., 1 p.m., 3 p.m.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Saturday<\/td>\n<td>11 a.m., 7 p.m., 8 p.m.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sunday<\/td>\n<td>7 a.m., 8 a.m., 4 p.m.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<div id=\"worst\"><\/div>\n<h2>When\u2019s the worst time to post on TikTok?<\/h2>\n<p>Knowing when not to post is as important as knowing when to post. According to Influencer Marketing Hub\u2019s data, the worst times to post on TikTok are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>5 p.m., 6 p.m., and 9 p.m. on any day of the week<\/li>\n<li>10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Sunday through Wednesday<\/li>\n<li>12 a.m. to 4 a.m. on Friday through Monday<\/li>\n<li>Any time after 9 a.m. on Tuesday<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Keep in mind that this data is based on worldwide usage.

It\u2019s also really helpful to picture when your potential customers are likely to view your posts.<\/p>\n<p>Start by creating <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/23\/buyer-personas\">personas<\/a> and then imagining their typical day. When are their busy times, downtimes, bored times, stressed times, and social times?<\/p>\n<p>For example, if your target audience is kids, right after school might be prime time for TikTok. But if working professionals are who you want to engage, lunchtime or late at night is probably better.<\/p>\n<p>Knowing this will help you get a ballpark range as to when they\u2019re most likely to be on TikTok, as well as what some of the themes in your content should be.<\/p>\n<h3>Access analytics from a Pro account<\/h3>\n<p>A TikTok Pro account is free and easy to set up.

While you can and should experiment with longer-format content, the conventional wisdom\u2014as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/tiktok-wants-longer-videos-like-not\/#:~:text=By%20November%202021%2C%20the%20optimal%20recommended%20video%20length,had%20doubled%20to%20between%2021%20and%2034%20seconds.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">suggested by TikTok in 2021<\/a>\u2014is that videos between 21 and 34 seconds are best.<\/p>\n<p>TikTok Live, of course, is an exception. You can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/01\/how-to-go-live-on-tiktok\">learn how to go live on TikTok here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Stay positive<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, it&#8217;s important to lead with emotion. But on TikTok, that emotion should be happy, positive, or funny. That same study by Semrush found that 58% of viral videos skewed towards humor and happiness.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/TikTok-times-graph-genres.png\" alt=\"Best time to post in TikTok - Graph showing the most popular TikTok grenres\" width=\"720\" height=\"574\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-72530 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/TikTok-times-graph-genres.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/TikTok-times-graph-genres-480x383.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>6. Get into a rhythm (pun not intended)<\/h3>\n<p>The more videos you post, the more likely you are to show up on someone\u2019s FYP right? Yes and no. TikTok recommends posting 1-4 times per day. But don\u2019t just post just to post. Find a format, theme, or genre that people like and that you can create variations on. Then only post when you have crowd-pleasing content. You can get even <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/tiktok-marketing-for-small-businesses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more TikTok marketing tips here.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>7. Hop on trends\/challenges<\/h3>\n<p>Going against the grain isn\u2019t the name of the game on TikTok. Use viral sounds, participate in challenges, do the duets, embrace it all. TikTok songs are like Instagram hashtags. They are portals to endless threads of videos that just may lead a viewer to yours. And use hashtags too.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Don\u2019t try too hard<\/h3>\n<p>At the end of the day, TikTok is a place for happiness, humor, and relatability. Forcing any one of these things has the opposite effect. Don\u2019t stress, be yourself, and actually have fun. This will reflect in your content and resonate with viewers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/TikTok-times-TikTok-tries-too-hard-1.jpg\" alt=\"Best times to post on TikTok - screenshot of a TikTok joking about people who try too hard\" width=\"392\" height=\"594\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-72531 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/TikTok-times-TikTok-tries-too-hard-1.jpg 392w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/TikTok-times-TikTok-tries-too-hard-1-198x300.jpg 198w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"FAQ\"><\/div>\n<h2>When to post on TikTok FAQs<\/h2>\n<p>A lightning round of Q&amp;A to help you pick the best times to post on TikTok.<\/p>\n<h3>Does posting time matter on TikTok?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, as long as your content is already good quality and relevant.

[Recap]<\/h2>\n<p>TikTok has a large audience and high organic reach. To engage as many people on the platform as possible, you\u2019ll need to post the right content, at the right frequency, at the right time.<\/p>\n<p>Finding the right time for your business to post on TikTok will take some testing.

Test fewer and more frequent posts. Try different days and times. Keep track by downloading the results from your TikTok pro account on your desktop.<\/p>\n<p>But most importantly, just start posting. There\u2019s an engaged audience just waiting for your brand of brilliance\u2026don\u2019t leave them hanging!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Want more best times?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a
