Expanded ads in AIOs and AI Mode<\/h3>\n<p>Several announcements highlighted Google\u2019s push for AI-powered discovery. As the GML speakers put it, the goal is to turn non-commercial intent into \u201cads that don\u2019t interrupt but help your customers discover you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Along that theme, users will soon begin to see expanded ads in their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ai-overviews\">AI Overviews<\/a> that align with the educational nature of the result. This is something we&#8217;ve anticipated since the announcement of AI Overviews.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how it\u2019ll work.
