Authority<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/10\/social-proof-guide\">Social proof<\/a> works like herd mentality: people following others just because.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s said that we do business with those we \u201cknow, like, and trust.\u201d Social proof is the illustration of that. If peers or brands or celebrities we admire say so, we\u2019ll agree.<\/p>\n<p>Online, social proof plays out most directly in the form of reviews which can influence <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adweek.com\/prnewser\/ogilvy-cannes-study-behold-the-power-of-word-of-mouth\/95190?red=pr\">three-fourths<\/a> of people. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nielsen.com\/us\/en\/press-room\/2012\/nielsen-global-consumers-trust-in-earned-advertising-grows.html\">92%<\/a> of us will trust recommendations from other people \u2013 even if we don\u2019t know them personally!<\/p>\n<p>Interestingly, one of the best authoritative power phrases isn\u2019t even a word <em>per se<\/em>, but numbers.

Example: <a href=\"https:\/\/adespresso.com\/academy\/blog\/facebook-ad-secrets-revealed-by-sumome-hubspot-and-marketo\/\">21 Facebook Ad Secrets Revealed by <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/adespresso.com\/academy\/blog\/facebook-ad-secrets-revealed-by-sumome-hubspot-and-marketo\/\"><strong>SumoMe, HubSpot, and Marketo<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a positive impression of those brands, you\u2019ll undoubtedly like the information within, too.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Anger<\/h2>\n<p>Beqa Latsabidze, a 22-year-old, unemployed student from Georgia, set up a website in the middle of 2016.<\/p>\n<p>It was devoted to posting \u201cgushing stories\u201d about Hillary Clinton before last year\u2019s infamous election, with the hope of generating visits and AdSense dollars.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why, but it did not work,\u201d he later told <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/11\/25\/world\/europe\/fake-news-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-georgia.html\">The New York Times<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of beating his head against the proverbial wall forever though, he switched gears.<\/p>\n<p>Beqa started posting anti-Hillary messages. Some true. Mostly false. And thousands of dollars began to pour in. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/11\/25\/world\/europe\/fake-news-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-georgia.html\">The New York Times<\/a> sums up the success:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cIf his pro-Clinton site had taken off, Beqa said, he would have pressed on with that, but \u2018people did not engage,\u2019 so he focused on serving pro-Trump supporters instead. They, he quickly realized, were a far more receptive audience \u2018because they are angry\u2019 and eager to read outrageous tales.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Another scrappy internet entrepreneur, Vancouver-based John Egan, was saw similar results with his own site.<\/p>\n<p>The catalyst for this sudden, massive upturn in fortunes? Again, directly from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/11\/25\/world\/europe\/fake-news-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-georgia.html\">Times<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cHe, too, discovered that writing about Mr. Trump was a \u2018gold mine.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s all Trump,\u2019 Mr. Egan said by telephone. \u2018People go nuts for it.\u2019<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Like it or not, doesn\u2019t really matter.
