And <a href=\"http:\/\/www.capitalfm.com\/artists\/justin-bieber\/news\/youtube-comments\/\">even Justin Bieber knows not to read the comments on YouTube<\/a>: \u201cI don&#8217;t read YouTube comments because those can get you sad.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/justin-bieber-doesnt-read-comments-1.png\" alt=\"Justin Bieber Doesn't Read Comments\" width=\"360\" height=\"430\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Seriously though. I have a love-hate relationship with comment streams. The quality can vary so widely and it usually depends on what kind of atmosphere and community the blog owners cultivate. I love sites with upvoting systems that allow the best comments to rise to the top and which encourage regular commenting and conversation \u2013 see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.seomoz.com\/blog\">SEOmoz<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/\">Reddit<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xojane.com\/\">XOJane<\/a>, where I\u2019ve lost hours of my life poring through user-generated magic.<\/p>\n<p>But no blog or website is immune to comment stream idiocy. Allow strangers to plaster their thoughts on your Internet space and some of those thoughts are going to be variously dumb and outright offensive. Much like lukewarm casseroles at a potluck are breeding grounds for bacteria, comment streams seem to be breeding grounds for obnoxious and illogical arguments. That\u2019s why we have <a href=\"http:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/godwins-law\">Godwin\u2019s Law<\/a>, which states that &#8220;As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving\u00a0Nazis\u00a0or\u00a0Hitler\u00a0approaches\u00a01.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/godwins-law1-of-comments-1.png\" alt=\"Godwin's Law of Blog Comments\" width=\"400\" height=\"233\" \/><\/div>\n<p>When entering any argument or debate, it\u2019s always good to be armed with a solid knowledge of <strong>logical fallacies<\/strong> \u2013 those nefariously common pitfalls of the human mind, patterns of thought that we all slip into that are nevertheless dead wrong. Being familiar with these fallacies makes it easy to call out your opponent when he\u2019s making a right fool of himself. This is especially true in the battlefields of comment streams, where people are approximately 200% dumber than in real life. (Science fact.)<\/p>\n<p>With that in mind, here are 10 logical fallacies (blogical fallacies? no?) to know and avoid, commonly found in a comment stream near you.<\/p>\n<h2>#1: Appeal to Authority<\/h2>\n<p>The appeal to authority hinges on a na\u00efve trust that important people always know what they\u2019re doing. You know how when you were a kid, you thought your mom was some kind of magical genius who could fix anything? Then, you grow up and realize they let <em>anyone<\/em> be a mom.<\/p>\n<p>The appeal to authority fallacy frequently pops up when you criticize an authority figure \u2013 for example, a famous writer or a powerful CEO. For example, see this comment on Larry\u2019s post about <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/03\/13\/dear-ebay-its-not-adwords-its-you\">eBay\u2019s lousy paid search strategy<\/a>:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/appeal-to-authority-comment-fallacy-1.png\" alt=\"Blog Comment Ad Hominem Attack\" width=\"599\" height=\"84\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Just because eBay is a big company with a big marketing budget doesn\u2019t mean that whoever\u2019s in charge of their PPC knows what they\u2019re doing. Big companies \u2013 whole empires even! \u2013 fail all the time. The history of the world is a catalog of failures. <strong>Authority doesn\u2019t equal competence<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>#2: Argumentum ad Hominem<\/h2>\n<p>A commenter is resorting to an ad hominem attack when he gets personal, otherwise known as \u201cbeing a dick.\u201d See the examples below. Both \u2013 coincidence? I think not \u2013 on posts where I was writing about sexism. When I complained about the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/03\/09\/worst-google-doodles\">Google Doodle for International Women\u2019s Day<\/a>, one friendly commenter accused me of PMS\u2019ing:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-hominem-attack-comment-fallacy-1.png\" alt=\"Crappy Comment\" width=\"651\" height=\"160\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Then there was the time <a href=\"http:\/\/thefrenchexit.blogspot.com\/2010\/04\/things-i-am-into-lately-vinaigrette.html\">I \u201cbitched and moaned\u201d about a literary journal that only published men<\/a>:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-hominem-comment-stream-1.png\" alt=\"Personal Attacks in Blog Comments\" width=\"504\" height=\"333\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The editor of that journal didn\u2019t like my post and didn\u2019t like my forehead either. (I\u2019ve edited some of these comments for language.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Protip for comment writers:<\/strong> Leave people\u2019s body parts and functions out of your arguments and you look <em>way<\/em> more credible.<\/p>\n<h2>#3: Ignoratio elenchi<\/h2>\n<p>Doncha just love Latin? Ignoratio elenchi is otherwise known as the irrelevant conclusion, missing the point. People who \u201cjust like to hear themselves talk\u201d (or see their comments in print, as the case may be) are especially prone to the ignoratio elenchi comment that has nothing to do with anything.<\/p>\n<p>An extra-special brand of this is the irrelevant spam comment \u2013 years ago I wrote a (highly ironic, of course) post called \u201c<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2011\/03\/04\/how-to-start-seo-business\">How to Start an SEO Business in 3 Ridiculously, Impossibly Easy Steps<\/a>,\u201d based on a stupid eHow article, and we still get <strong>comments from people who obviously haven\u2019t read the post<\/strong>, thanking me for helping them start their SEO business. For example:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ignoratio-elenchi-comment-fallacy-1.png\" alt=\"Irrelevant Blog Comment\" width=\"651\" height=\"104\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Sigh. (I stripped the link out and published it to make him look silly, natch.)<\/p>\n<h2>#4: The Thought-Terminating Clich\u00e9<\/h2>\n<p>From Robert Jay Lifton\u2019s book on brainwashing and mind control, <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Thought-Reform-Psychology-Totalism-Brainwashing\/dp\/0807842532\">Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism<\/a><\/em>, we get the concept of the \u201cthought-terminating clich\u00e9\u201d:<\/p>\n<p>A commonly used phrase, sometimes passing as folk wisdom, used to quell\u00a0cognitive dissonance. Though the clich\u00e9d phrase in and of itself may be valid in certain contexts, its application as a means of dismissing dissent or justifying\u00a0fallacious logic\u00a0is what makes it thought-terminating.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, as some Wikipedia editor put it, \u201cend the debate with a clich\u00e9\u2014not a point.\u201d <strong>\u201cIt is what it is\u201d is the ultimate thought-terminating clich\u00e9 of our time<\/strong>. It adds no value. Don\u2019t engage with commenters who refuse to engage with you.<\/p>\n<h2>#5: Appeal to Tradition<\/h2>\n<p>The appeal to tradition fallacy, otherwise known as \u201cargumentum ad antiquitam,\u201d insists that we keep doing something simply because it\u2019s the way it has always been done. Tradition, damnit! Popular among commenters who <strong>fear change<\/strong>. Used to justify slavery, war crimes, and so forth.<\/p>\n<h2>#6: The Just-World Hypothesis<\/h2>\n<p>Some people have a tendency to believe, or to want to believe, that the world is fundamentally just and people are fundamentally good. So if you try to point out something evil or unjust in the world, this conflicts with their worldview and they get defensive. \u201cOh come on, things aren\u2019t that bad!\u201d \u201cNobody is hurting you on purpose, etc.!\u201d This is also used to rationalize bad things happening \u2013 see the tendency for some SEOs to assume that if a site gets delisted or takes a hit in rankings, it must, ergo, have done something bad to deserve this. We can call this the \u201c<strong>Just-Google Hypothesis<\/strong>.\u201d But sometimes bad things happen to good people, and it\u2019s entirely possible that a website could get screwed by Google unjustly and for no good reason. \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d right?<\/p>\n<h2>#7: The Google Effect<\/h2>\n<p>More a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/06\/cognitive-biases\">cognitive bias<\/a> than a logical fallacy per se, the Google effect refers to the tendency to forget information that can be easily found online. Then there\u2019s the cell phone effect, which leads to people having no idea what their spouse\u2019s actual phone number is. You can see a similar effect in comments when a reader asks a question that either:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Is<\/strong> <strong>already answered in the post they are commenting on<\/strong>, i.e., see above, doofus, or<\/li>\n<li><strong>Could be answered with a simple Google search<\/strong>, cutting out the middle man.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This is what the acronym <a href=\"http:\/\/lmgtfy.com\/\">LMGTFY<\/a> is for.<\/p>\n<h2>#8: Fallacy of Composition<\/h2>\n<p>Assuming that something true of one part of the whole must be true of the rest. You see this when people say stuff like \u201cBut a buddy of mine works at Amazon and he\u2019s real cool so they couldn\u2019t possibly be bad for small businesses!\u201d Similarly, when someone gets burned by a shady \u201cSEO\u201d firm and then goes on to assume that all SEO\u2019s are selling snake oil. <strong>Just because part of the \u201cindustry\u201d is corrupt doesn\u2019t mean that SEO isn\u2019t a legitimate field<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>#9: The Chiller-Than-Thou Fallacy<\/h2>\n<p>OK, I made this one up. But I see it ALL THE TIME. Chiller-than-thou commenters are always telling you to relax, get a grip, calm down, be cool, etc. For example, this one <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blisstree.com\/2013\/04\/04\/beauty-shopping\/selfies-plastic-surgery\/\">directed at my friend Carrie Murphy<\/a>:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/chiller-than-thou-fallacy-blog-comments-1.png\" alt=\"Aggressive Blog Comment\" width=\"613\" height=\"135\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Joke\u2019s on them, because <strong>inevitably the chiller-than-thou commenter ends up looking very unchill<\/strong>. I mean, if they\u2019re so calm and relaxed, why are they leaving aggressive comments on your blog instead of just closing the tab and stepping out onto the patio for a smoke? Would a chill person bother to comment at all? I think not.<\/p>\n<h2>#10: The Dunning-Kruger Effect<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/rationalwiki.org\/wiki\/Dunning-Kruger_effect\">The Dunning-Kruger Effect<\/a> is the name given to the phenomenon where incompetent people fail to realize they are incompetent because they lack the ability to distinguish between competence and incompetence. That\u2019s part of being incompetent! Put in blog comment terms, the worst blog commenters fail to recognize that they are the worst blog commenters because <strong>they\u2019re so bad at blog commenting they can\u2019t distinguish between good comments and bad comments<\/strong>. That\u2019s why they\u2019re always leaving bad comments. This leads us to a troubling conclusion: Some trolls don\u2019t even <em>know<\/em> they\u2019re trolls. Frightening, isn\u2019t?<\/p>\n<p>Get in on the fun \u2013 let me know what logical fallacies you\u2019re tired of seeing in blog comments. Or, just leave a comment with a glaring fallacy of its own, intentionally or unintentionally. That\u2019ll be fun and self-referential!<\/p>\n<p>See also:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_cognitive_biases\">List of cognitive biases<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_common_misconceptions\">List of common misconceptions<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/seobullshit.com\/10-kinds-comment-spam\/\">The 10 kinds of comment spam<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learn ten common logical fallacies and cognitive biases that show up in blog comments.
