Google Ads pricing varies depending on your industry, customer lifecycle, current trends, and how well you manage your account.<\/p>\n<h3>Industry<\/h3>\n<p>The biggest influence on Google Ads pricing is industry. For example, the business services vertical (legal, accounting, real estate, etc.) is one of the more competitive verticals in Google Ads, which generally translates to higher costs per click (CPC) and costs per lead (CPL). This is due to the nature of the professional services industry: one new client could yield upwards of $1,000 &#8211; $10,000 depending on your business, so a CPC of $10 is a small price to pay for that client.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/2025-GA-Benchmarks-CPC-871x1024.webp\" alt=\"2025 google ads cost per click benchmarks chart\" width=\"871\" height=\"1024\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91514 size-large\" \/><\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, businesses in the arts and entertainment vertical have lower CPCs, but they need to reach a lot more customers to hit that $1,000 &#8211; $10,000 number.<\/p>\n<p>\u2b07\ufe0f <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/google-ads-industry-benchmarks?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2025GoogleAdsBenchmarks_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\"><strong>Download our latest Google Ads benchmarks here!<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Customer lifecycle<\/h3>\n<p>You also have to take into account the lifecycle of your customer. For bigger ticket offerings, it takes longer for potential clients to move through the decision-making process, and your business needs to stay top-of-mind throughout that journey. This may involve multiple visits to your website, a content download or two, participation in a webinar, and more\u2014before taking that final step.<\/p>\n<h3>Current trends<\/h3>\n<p>Neither consumer trends nor online advertising platforms are ever in a state of rest. It&#8217;s important to keep up with what&#8217;s going on in your industry and within your niche\u2014sentimentally and empirically. Take COVID, for example. At the height of the pandemic, the average cost per click for the apparel industry was about $1.40. It dropped down to $0.70 in April when average conversion rates went up, and then ended up at $0.89 in May.<\/p>\n<h3>How well you manage your account<\/h3>\n<p>A recent study by Google showed that the average ROI on Google Ads is 800%\u2014that is, $8 for every $1 spent. Of course, this all depends on how well you manage your account. You can&#8217;t just activate your ads and kick back. If you want to keep your Google Ads costs low and your returns high, you need to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep a proper <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/02\/adwords-account-structure-guide\">Google Ads account structure.<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Report on your performance and make data-driven <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/24\/google-ads-optimization\">optimizations<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Maintain your keyword lists.<\/li>\n<li>Perform regular account audits and more.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udcb0 Are you wasting any spend in Google Ads? <\/strong>Find out instantly with the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Free Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"determine\"><\/div>\n<h2>How does Google Ads determine your cost per click?<\/h2>\n<p>The great part about Google Ads is that while it works as an auction, the winners aren&#8217;t chosen based on bid alone, and you don&#8217;t necessarily pay your maximum bid. How is this possible? Let&#8217;s take a quick run-through of how Google Ads determines the winners and what they pay per click.<\/p>\n<h3>Step #1: Quality Score<\/h3>\n<p>When someone searches on Google, Google looks to see if any advertisers are bidding on keywords relevant to that query. If yes, an auction is triggered and Google enters all relevant ads into the auction. Its first step in choosing a winner is to assign each ad a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/quality-score\">Quality Score<\/a>. This is a number from 1-10 determined by the ad and landing page&#8217;s relevance to the keyword, expected click-through rate (which involves your historic performance), and landing page experience.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more, head on over to this post: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/19\/whats-a-good-quality-score\">What is a Good Quality Score for Each Type of Keyword?<\/a><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/07\/16\/quality-score-cost-per-conversion\"><\/a><a href=\"\/quality-score\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Step #2: Ad Rank<\/h3>\n<p>Google will then calculate each contending ad&#8217;s Ad Rank, which determines if and where your ad will be placed in the paid results section. Ad Rank is your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/19\/whats-a-good-quality-score\">Quality Score<\/a> multiplied by your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/maximum-bid\">maximum bid<\/a> (the most you&#8217;re willing to pay per click on your ad).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/google-ads-cost-google-ads-auction-formula.jpg\" alt=\"google ads cost - google ads auction formula\" width=\"935\" height=\"326\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91781 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/google-ads-cost-google-ads-auction-formula.jpg 935w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/google-ads-cost-google-ads-auction-formula-480x167.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 935px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nThe ads with the highest Ad Rank scores are the ones that get shown.<\/p>\n<h3>Step #3: Cost per click<\/h3>\n<p>If your ad gets shown, you only pay if someone clicks on it. But as mentioned above, you don&#8217;t necessarily pay your maximum bid. The Google Ads cost-per-click formula is: the Ad Rank of the ad below yours divided by your Quality Score, plus one cent.<\/p>\n<p>With this formula, an advertiser can pay less per click than another advertiser in the SERP and still be in a higher position due to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/19\/does-quality-score-still-matter\">better Quality Score<\/a>. This is why advertisers with a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/06\/small-marketing-budget\">small budget can compete with big spenders<\/a> on Google.<\/p>\n<p>For a more in-depth explanation of the Google Ads auction, head to our post &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/14\/how-does-google-ads-work\">How Does Google Ads Work?

Here are some (but certainly not all) of the additional factors that influence your costs.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/14\/ppc-landing-page-experience\">Landing page relevance<\/a> and experience<\/li>\n<li>Auction-time quality<\/li>\n<li>The device, location, and context of users&#8217;\u00a0searches<\/li>\n<li>Alternative <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/19\/google-ads-automated-bidding\">bidding methods<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Alternative ad formats<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span>\ud83d\udcd9 <strong>Free guide<\/strong> <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/ways-to-save-money-in-google-ads?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_SaveMoneyinGoogleAds_Download\">&gt;&gt; 6 Easy Ways to Save Money on Google Ads NOW!<\/a><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"budget\"><\/div>\n<h2>How does budgeting work with Google Ads costs?<\/h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s move on to the next component of Google Ads cost: budgeting. All too often, advertisers see their Google Ads budget for the month <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/20\/stop-burning-your-adwords-budget\">get burned up<\/a> in a matter of days, leading them to believe Google Ads is prohibitively expensive. This isn\u2019t necessarily the case; more often than not, it&#8217;s the result of a misunderstanding of how <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/14\/google-ads-budgeting-strategies\">Google Ads budgeting<\/a> works. So let&#8217;s set the record straight. Here are the terms to know:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Budget:<\/strong> How much you&#8217;re able to spend on Google Ads<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bid:<\/strong> The most you&#8217;re willing to pay for a click on your ad.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Spend:<\/strong> The amount Google takes out of your budget when an ad participates in an auction.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cost:<\/strong> The actual amount you pay for a click on your ad.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Daily average budgets<\/h3>\n<p>When you set up a campaign in Google Ads, you will be asked to provide a daily budget. There is a shared budget feature, but if you&#8217;re just starting out, it&#8217;s best to give each campaign its own separate budget. But the daily budget you set does not mean Google will spend that exact amount each day. You\u2019re giving Google a rough idea of what you\u2019d like your daily spend to average out to at the end of the month\u2014meaning it could exceed or fall short of that amount on any given day, which leads us to spending limits.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Spending limits<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Technically, Google could spend up to 100% more of, or double, your budget\u2014if it means more clicks or conversions. This means that if you set a daily average budget of $50, your daily spending limit is $100. You will never pay more in a day than your daily spending limit, and you will never pay more than a month than your monthly spending limit (your average daily budget x 30.4; although if you&#8217;re not paying for Google Ads with the invoice method, you can <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/26\/google-ads-monthly-spend-limit\">set a monthly spend limit<\/a> at the account level).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/cost-of-google-ads-daily-budget-illustration.png\" alt=\"how much does google ads cost - how daily budget works\" width=\"720\" height=\"384\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-57762\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/cost-of-google-ads-daily-budget-illustration.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/cost-of-google-ads-daily-budget-illustration-480x256.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/6385083\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>How to determine your average daily budget<\/h3>\n<p>To calculate your average daily budget, simply take your budget for the month for that campaign and divide it by 30.4.

If you run a bakery that closes at 7 p.m., for example, you may not want your ads to be shown outside your normal business hours. Alternatively, you can specify that your ads run continually throughout the day, but allocate a greater portion of your daily budget for hours during which you want <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/02\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps\">increased visibility<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Geotargeting<\/h3>\n<p>Just as you can allocate more of your Google Ads budget to certain times of day, you can also spend more of your budget on certain geographical areas. This technique is known as geo-targeting, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/07\/google-ads-geotargeting\">location targeting<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Geotargeting allows you to ensure your ads appear only for Google searchers in specific areas, which can be as large as a state or province, or as small as a three-block radius from your store.<\/p>\n<p>Google Ads geotargeting can be an excellent way to capitalize on growing mobile traffic trends and on-the-go shopping habits of today\u2019s consumers, and it might factor into how you allocate your daily ad budget. For example, you may want your ads to appear alongside relevant searches in a particular state, but you could also allocate more budget to searches conducted in a specific city or even neighborhood.<\/p>\n<h3>Device targeting<\/h3>\n<p>Long gone are the days when prospects searched exclusively from desktop browsers. Today, consumers are searching online\u00a0across multiple devices (often at the same time),\u00a0which means you need to pay attention to where your most valuable leads are coming from. This is where <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/12\/29\/adwords-networks-devices-settings\">device targeting<\/a> comes into play.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say that you want to appear on results across both desktop and mobile searches, but that mobile traffic is more valuable to you.

But we&#8217;re going to break it down.<\/p>\n<h3>The key influence on pricing in Google Ads: keywords<\/h3>\n<p>In some ways, you can think of PPC advertising roughly along the same lines as traditional print advertising; you\u2019d expect to spend more on a glossy full-page ad in a national magazine than you would for a classified ad in a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/now-is-the-time-to-lean-into-local-news\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">local newspaper<\/a>. In digital marketing, however, the pricing isn&#8217;t influenced by the format of the ad, but rather the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-intent\">intent<\/a> of and competition for the keywords you\u2019re bidding on. So you can expect to spend more on a high-intent keyword like &#8220;roof repair near me&#8221; than something lower intent like &#8220;how much does it cost to repair a roof.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In super-competitive markets like legal and accounting, clicks can get much pricier. Keyword costs can also fluctuate, and we typically see changes in Google Ads costs across industries year over year. Let\u2019s take a look at some CPC benchmarks year over year in Google Ads to give you an idea of how much click costs can fluctuate for your business.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/2025-GA-Benchmarks-CPC-YOY-836x1024.webp\" alt=\"google ads average cost per click year over year benchmarks chart\" width=\"836\" height=\"1024\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91515 size-large\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>What is the average CPC in Google Ads?<\/h3>\n<p>If you take the average CPCs\u00a0across all different types of businesses and keywords in the US, <strong>the overall average CPC in Google Ads is $5.26<\/strong>. That&#8217;s on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/20\/google-adwords-search-versus-display\">Search Network<\/a>. On the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/18\/google-display-network-tips\">Google Display network<\/a>, clicks tend to be cheaper, averaging under $1.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the cost-per-click for long-tail keywords?<\/h3>\n<p>People sometimes like to point at the grand, show-stopping keyword categories above as a definitive example of how expensive Google Ads can be. The reality, however, is that<strong> these keyword categories only make up a small portion of total search volumes.<\/strong> Long-tail keywords actually account for the majority of web searches and are also often significantly cheaper than shorter keyword-rich queries <em>and<\/em> can have as much\u2014if not more\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/30\/commercial-intent-keywords\">commercial intent.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>For example, if someone has an ant problem in their kitchen, &#8220;exterminator [their town],&#8221; is one search they might perform. &#8220;Exterminator&#8221; as a broad keyword will likely have a high search volume and may be pricey. But they might also search for &#8220;how to get rid of ants in the kitchen.&#8221; This is a long-tail keyword with potentially lower competition and costs associated. The intent may not be as strong, since they could be looking to DIY, but it&#8217;s still pretty strong, so they&#8217;ll likely be open to\u2014or even click on\u2014an ad for an exterminator.<\/p>\n<p>This is the kind of opportunity that long-tail keyword targeting presents to advertisers.
