Backlinking allows you to direct both <strong>users and link equity<\/strong> to desired pages on your website. It\u2019s pretty much the most critical tool in the organic search marketer\u2019s toolkit\u2013without it, you\u2019d have a really hard time getting any of your pages to rank in the index and drive traffic. You\u2019d also have no way of funneling users to the parts of your site where they will ultimately become customers.<\/p>\n<p>That last component of backlinking is what we\u2019re going to focus on today. Because while deep linking is similar to backlinking, it differs critically in this way: deep links always link to <strong>specific pages<\/strong> on your website or in your app, rather than your homepage.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-example.webp\" alt=\"example of what is deep linking on mobile device\" width=\"936\" height=\"428\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75467\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-example.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-example-480x219.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>What exactly does that mean? And why is linking to <em>specific pages<\/em> an important distinction to make in the context of link building in general? These are precisely the questions we\u2019re going to answer in this post.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s your deep, easy guide to deep linking.<\/p>\n<h2>What is deep linking?<\/h2>\n<p>When you look across the web, you\u2019ll often see <em>deep linking <\/em>explained in the specific context of mobile apps. Simply put: deep linking is the <strong>practice of linking to specific pages in one\u2019s mobile app<\/strong>. As opposed to, say, a backlink, which would exist on one\u2019s website.<\/p>\n<p>In other places, though, you\u2019ll see deep linking defined as <strong>any link to a specific page on one\u2019s website or mobile app. <\/strong>And personally, as someone who has been doing <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/search-engine-optimization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO<\/a> for a variety of businesses for a number of years, I think this more inclusive definition is a more productive one for business owners and marketers to understand. Why? Because not everybody has an app. But most marketers at least have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/18\/website-maintenance\">website<\/a>, and therefore, have backlinks. Unfortunately, most of them aren\u2019t backlinking correctly.<\/p>\n<p>That said, we don\u2019t want to neglect the folks out there who are <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-market-an-app\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing apps<\/a>, so the second half of this post is going to focus on deep linking in the context of mobile apps. But first, we really need to understand <em>why<\/em> it might be a good idea to link to a specific page on your website, and how to do it in a way that <strong>increases site navigability, drives users to convert, and spreads link equity across your site<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\ud83d\udea8 Want more ideas to drive traffic?

Increase site navigability<\/h3>\n<p>A carefully, well-thought-out site navigation helps users understand where they need to go to get what they want: whether that\u2019s an educational resource, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/05\/product-landing-pages\">product page<\/a>, or a free demo page. Consider the navigation of wordstream.com.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-example-wordstream-navigation.webp\" alt=\"deep linking benefits - example of wordstream navigation bar that includes deep links through site\" width=\"936\" height=\"489\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75468\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-example-wordstream-navigation.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-example-wordstream-navigation-480x251.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Blog, Free Tools, Resources: these could all be considered deep links, in that they allow users to navigate to deeper pages on the WordStream website. Drill down into Resources, and you\u2019ll see even more deep links, these to specific pieces of content:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-example-wordstream-resources.webp\" alt=\"deep linking benefits - links to specific resources from navigation bar on wordstream.com\" width=\"936\" height=\"456\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75470\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-example-wordstream-resources.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-example-wordstream-resources-480x234.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now, you wouldn\u2019t be wrong if you merely called these internal links, but they are <strong>deep<\/strong> in the sense that they allow users to navigate from a commonly visited page, the homepage, to pages that are crucial for education, and may otherwise go unnoticed if not for these prominent placements in the navigation.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Drive users to convert<\/h3>\n<p>Our next use case for deep linking is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/conversion-rate-optimization\">conversion rate optimization<\/a>. Linking to your homepage from your paid search campaigns, email campaigns, and Tweets might be beneficial in certain scenarios\u2013say, if you\u2019re running prospecting campaigns, and want people to familiarize themselves with your website or app prior to sending them to a product page. But in the majority of situations, the fewer clicks a user has to make before converting, the more likely they are to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/29\/how-to-promote-a-product\">buy your product or service<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s where deep linking comes in. Check out this email campaign from Nokia. They could have linked to their homepage, or to a collection page containing all of their home security products, but by deep linking to a product page, they are creating an efficient and cohesive experience that encourages users to convert.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-benefits-conversions.webp\" alt=\"example of email with deep linking to drive conversions\" width=\"382\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75471\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-benefits-conversions.webp 382w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-benefits-conversions-191x300.webp 191w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This concept goes for all types of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/28\/best-marketing-campaigns-examples\">marketing campaigns<\/a>, including affiliate and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/14\/referral-program-ideas\">referral campaigns<\/a>, guest posts, display campaigns, and even links within one\u2019s own site. By being direct and deliberate with where you\u2019re sending potential customers, you increase the likelihood of them taking the action you want them to take.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Drive link equity across your site or app<\/h3>\n<p>As a proponent of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/09\/google-ranking-factors\">increasing search rankings<\/a>, number three is my personal favorite. Link equity, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2010\/07\/15\/how-to-find-and-drain-link-juice\">link juice<\/a>, is the stuff that allows your page to rank in Google\u2019s index, <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">drive traffic<\/a>, and drive revenue for your business. Here\u2019s how it works, in a nutshell:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most of the link equity on your site resides on your homepage. Your homepage is the foundation from which all other pages on your site gain \u201cranking power.\u201d So, the better you structure your deep links, or the closer you bring your most important pages to the homepage (i.e. the fewer clicks, the better), the better chance they will have to rank. In the world of SEO, this is also called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/information-architecture\">information architecture<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>The amount of link equity your page has equates to the sum and quality of its internal and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/blog\/external-links\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">external links<\/a>. We\u2019ve talked about internal links above. <em>External links<\/em> differ in that they come from other websites. If you can get external links to your page from websites that have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/12\/domain-authority\">high domain authority<\/a>, you give your page a massive boost in authority in the eyes of Google.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-link-juice.webp\" alt=\"graphic that shows how link juice is transferred between sites\" width=\"936\" height=\"519\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75472\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-link-juice.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-link-juice-480x266.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>So in the above example, Web Page A would have a better chance of ranking (based purely on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/06\/on-page-seo\">off\u2013page factors<\/a>) than Web Page B.<\/li>\n<li>In order to give your page the best chance to rank for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-targeting\">keyword you\u2019re targeting<\/a>, you need to use the right anchor text. Anchor text is the text upon which you\u2019re linking. So if you were trying to drive link equity to a page targeting the keyword \u201canchor text,\u201d you would link like this: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/anchor-text\">anchor text<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-anchor-text.webp\" alt=\"example of anchor text for deep linking opportunities\" width=\"653\" height=\"260\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75473\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-anchor-text.webp 653w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-anchor-text-480x191.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 653px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The more accurate and relevant your anchor text is to your page\u2019s target keyword, and to what people are searching for, the more link equity you can send to that page.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Deep linking for mobile apps<\/h2>\n<p>As promised, we\u2019ve come to the part of our discussion where we\u2019ll specifically address mobile apps. Why would you want to deep link to your mobile app? For all the same reasons you would deep link to your website: to increase navigability, drive users to convert, and drive link equity.<\/p>\n<p>But when we talk about mobile linking in the context of mobile apps, we\u2019re most often going to be concerned with that second use case: driving users to convert.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at this great example from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsflyer.com\/\">Apps Flyer<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-mobile-apps.webp\" alt=\"how deep linking for mobile apps works\" width=\"936\" height=\"583\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75474\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-mobile-apps.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-mobile-apps-480x299.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As a mobile app marketer, you\u2019re going to have any number of campaigns out in the ecosystem at a given time. Campaigns on a range of platforms, with a range of messaging, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/04\/customer-segmentation-models\">targeting a range of prospective customers<\/a>. Deep linking in those campaigns helps drive users to the <em>correct<\/em> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/19\/customer-journey-map-templates\">user journey<\/a> in your app: one that nurtures them with the correct content and app experience, and ultimately, encourages them to sign up.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\ud83d\udca1 Get the best ideas ever to promote your business or app &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite30BestWaysToPromote.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Marketing_The30BestWaysToPromoteYourBusiness_Download\">30 Best Ways to Promote Your Business<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<h3>When to deep link to your mobile app<\/h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at some common use cases for deep linking in mobile apps, and talk about why each works.<\/p>\n<h4>1. Abandoned checkout flow<\/h4>\n<p>Consider an app like Instacart. Millions of daily active users use the Instacart app for local food delivery. But how many of them actually get through the entire checkout process? That\u2019s where a well-timed email campaign or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/11\/09\/sms-marketing\">SMS notification<\/a>, combined with a deep link to the customer\u2019s cart, can really come in handy.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-mobile-apps-uses.webp\" alt=\"abandoned cart email with deep link to app\" width=\"436\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75475\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-mobile-apps-uses.webp 436w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-mobile-apps-uses-218x300.webp 218w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>By linking this email directly to the customer\u2019s cart, Instacart can drive more sales on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/17\/shopping-cart-abandonment\">abandoned carts<\/a> than if they simply linked to the app\u2019s homepage.<\/p>\n<h4>2. User acquisition<\/h4>\n<p>Consider this example: you\u2019re marketing a personal finance mobile app, like Robinhood. You\u2019re running a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/26\/facebook-objectives\">Facebook campaign<\/a> targeting prospects that you know are interested in precious metal investing. Your ad necessarily drives folks to the app store to download your app, with the message that if they do so, they can get a free $50 coupon for their first precious metal investment.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-mobile-apps-benefits-user-acquisition.webp\" alt=\"example of deep linking from robinhood\" width=\"936\" height=\"508\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75476\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-mobile-apps-benefits-user-acquisition.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-mobile-apps-benefits-user-acquisition-480x261.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Where do you direct users after they download the app? To the homepage? No, you deep link to a collection of common precious metal stocks, with the coupon pre-filled in the user&#8217;s cart. Or, directly to a great gold stock. In doing so, you not only incentivize them to download the app but to start investing in it right away.<\/p>\n<h4>3. In-app contextual education<\/h4>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you\u2019re marketing a sports publication like the Athletic. You have an amazing staff of writers and loyal readers, but in order to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/10\/cac-vs-clv\">increase lifetime value<\/a> and retention rate, you really need to get users <em>into <\/em>your mobile app, where they can stay on top of your latest content and offers.<\/p>\n<p>A deep link to your article, combined with a well-timed \u201ckeep reading for free in the app\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/13\/call-to-action-examples\">CTA<\/a>, is exactly what you need.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-mobile-apps-integration.webp\" alt=\"example of mobile site deep linking to mobile app\" width=\"300\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75477\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-mobile-apps-integration.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/deep-linking-mobile-apps-integration-151x300.webp 151w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>After downloading the Athletic app in the App Store, new subscribers will then go directly to the article they were reading on the web. With this user flow, the Athletic can reduce friction, and keep customers focused on what the publication does best: putting out awesome sports journalism that demands continuous patronage.<\/p>\n<h2>When in doubt, go deep<\/h2>\n<p>That about wraps this one up. If you\u2019re looking for one takeaway from this post, it\u2019s this: when in doubt, go deep. Whether you\u2019re deep linking on your website or mobile app, doing so gives you the ability to increase navigability, serve accurate contextual content, drive link equity, and drive more conversions.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is deep linking, how does it impact your SEO, and how do you do it right?
