So put those policies on blast to meet this holiday marketing trend.<\/p>\n<h3>Shoppers want flexible shipping options<\/h3>\n<p>While holiday shoppers hunt for bargains, one target of their frugality will be shipping.

BIPOS became a household term in 2020 as retailers scrambled to operate under heightened safety protocols. The convenience of shopping online coupled with the instant gratification of picking up immediately was a big hit.<\/p>\n<p>This year, Salesforce\u2019s holiday report says that 39% of consumers will seek out retailers that offer BOPIS as an option. It also showed that retailers offering BOPIS <em>grew seven times faster<\/em> than competitors that didn\u2019t. A 700% increase in growth would make even Scrooge smile.<\/p>\n<h3>Buyers need confidence in return policies<\/h3>\n<p>Maybe it\u2019s tied to the need to protect finances, but it\u2019s never been more important to promote your company\u2019s return policy (assuming it\u2019s a good one).<\/p>\n<p>The Salesforce report showed that 93% of consumers research a brand\u2019s return policy before choosing who to buy from. And 78% of shoppers walk away from their shopping cart if they can\u2019t return the products for free. The moral is, if you want return customers, let them return purchases.<\/p>\n<h3>How to lean into this trend<\/h3>\n<p>Fast, free, and flexible shipping are likely table stakes for converting holiday shoppers in 2023. On the marketing front, it\u2019ll be important to get the message out that your company offers those things.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/holiday-marketing-trends-example-shipping.jpg\" alt=\"Holiday marketing trends - copy of an ad promoting free shipping\" width=\"930\" height=\"543\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75707 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/holiday-marketing-trends-example-shipping.jpg 930w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/holiday-marketing-trends-example-shipping-480x280.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 930px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And while your return policy may seem as dry as Aunt Edna\u2019s fruit cake, don\u2019t be afraid to make it the star of a few holiday promotional posts.

Gen Z has the technical savvy to know how marketers deliver that online and are willing to accept the tradeoffs.<\/p>\n<p>Research from Tinuiti, for example, noted that Gen Zers are<a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketingdive.com\/news\/allow-tracking-younger-consumers-more-likely-okay-with-target\/691452\/?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Issue:%202023-08-25%20Social%20Media%20Today%20Newsletter%20%5Bissue:53955%5D&amp;utm_term=Social%20Media%20Today\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u00a0three times more likely <\/a>than older generations to say yes to Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency prompts (and other tracking prompts like it).

Younger buyers are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/21\/marketing-to-generation-z\">more likely to respond<\/a> to a micro-influencer that lives like them versus a high-profile celebrity.<\/p>\n<p>Marketers play a direct role in establishing their brand as authentic, too. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/21\/marketing-to-generation-z\">Three-quarters<\/a> of Gen Zers want brands to respond to feedback (and believe this qualifies the brand as authentic).<\/p>\n<h3>Diversity is queen<\/h3>\n<p>Many studies, like the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/09\/gen-z-stats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one from Creatopy<\/a>, prove that Gen Z wants brands to take a stand on social issues.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/holiday-marketing-trends-chart-social-issues.jpg\" alt=\"Holiday marketing trends - bar graph showing that Gen Z shoppers care about causes\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75709 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/holiday-marketing-trends-chart-social-issues.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/holiday-marketing-trends-chart-social-issues-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And since <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/social-trends\/2020\/05\/14\/on-the-cusp-of-adulthood-and-facing-an-uncertain-future-what-we-know-about-gen-z-so-far-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gen Z is the most diverse<\/a> generation in history, you can expect diversity and inclusivity to be high on the list of topics they want brands to support.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/social-trends\/2019\/01\/17\/generation-z-looks-a-lot-like-millennials-on-key-social-and-political-issues\/psdt_1-17-19_generations-08\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Data from Pew Research<\/a> backs it up.

Even if it\u2019s just one or two influences who can share things like <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-create-a-holiday-gift-guide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gift guides<\/a>. Just make sure you<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/21\/social-media-influencers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> choose influencers<\/a> that will be relevant to your Zoomer audience. No flashy celebrities, just people who live and speak like the people you\u2019re trying to connect with.<\/p>\n<p>Next, be available to connect with Gen Z shoppers directly. That means replying to social media comments and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/16\/get-more-google-reviews\">responding to reviews<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/holiday-marketing-trends-example-response.jpg\" alt=\"Holiday marketing trends - screenshot of review responses\" width=\"736\" height=\"596\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75710 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/holiday-marketing-trends-example-response.jpg 736w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/holiday-marketing-trends-example-response-480x389.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 736px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Create a holiday <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/customer-referral-program\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">referral program<\/a> to get more of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/26\/word-of-mouth-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">word-of-mouth<\/a> recommendations Gen Z covets.<\/p>\n<p>Since Gen Z is so diverse, they\u2019re more likely to celebrate several different traditions.
