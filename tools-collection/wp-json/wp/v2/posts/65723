So let\u2019s dive into how to form a profitable marketing partnership\u2014with examples to learn from. But first, the basics.<\/p>\n<h2>What is partnership marketing?<\/h2>\n<p>Partnership marketing is a collaboration between two companies or brands to reach a broader audience base and mutually benefit both parties. The partnership can be between brands and influencers, or between two brands that are not directly competing with each other.<\/p>\n<p>A well-known example of such marketing is the collaboration between Uber &amp; Spotify. The brand services offered are complementary to each other&#8217;s business and hence, the partnership fits in well.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/partner-marketing-spotify-uber-integration.png\" alt=\"partner marketing examples - uber and spotify\" width=\"720\" height=\"503\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-65730\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/partner-marketing-spotify-uber-integration.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/partner-marketing-spotify-uber-integration-480x335.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.androidheadlines.com\/2014\/11\/spotify-uber-partnership-uber-spotify-confirmed.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Why partner marketing?<\/h2>\n<p>Numbers speak louder than words, and here are some insights that explain the power of partnership marketing:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/partnerize.com\/resources\/blog\/partner-affiliate-marketing-research-the-state-and-future-of-partnerships-survey-1-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">54%<\/a> of companies state that brand partnerships drive over 20% of their total revenue.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.partner-path.com\/partner-program-benchmark-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">68%<\/a> of consumers make buying decisions after viewing partnership campaigns.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/partnerize.com\/resources\/blog\/partner-affiliate-marketing-research-the-state-and-future-of-partnerships-survey-1-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">74%<\/a> of organizations reveal that brand partnerships and affiliate marketing are the top-most priorities.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>6 tips to build profitable marketing partnerships<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s now take a look at seven ways to <a href=\"https:\/\/shanebarker.com\/blog\/affiliate-marketing-strategies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">develop partnerships <\/a>that stand out from the crowd and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/17\/website-visibility\">bring visibility to your brand<\/a> through affiliate marketing, a form of brand collaboration.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Build partnerships with like-minded businesses<\/h3>\n<p>When considering partnership marketing as an option, it is important to consider both your and their values. For example, if H&amp;M were to partner with Raw Beauty, this would send a confusing message to both brands\u2019 audiences.<\/p>\n<p>H&amp;M is a fast-fashion brand, whereas Raw Beauty promotes slow fashion, organic skincare, and conscious consumerism.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/partner-marketing-hm-raw-beauty.png\" alt=\"partner marketing - h&amp;m vs raw beauty brands\" width=\"720\" height=\"439\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-65731\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/partner-marketing-hm-raw-beauty.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/partner-marketing-hm-raw-beauty-480x293.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The concept on which these two brands are collaborating would look flawed as they won&#8217;t be reflecting what they claim. Without proper alignment of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/31\/brand-personality-messaging\">brand personalities<\/a>\u00a0and goals, such a partnership will most likely affect either of the brands negatively.<\/p>\n<p>So be sure to collaborate with similar organizations that align with your goals and the nature of your business.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Create partnerships that deliver turnkey solutions<\/h3>\n<p>Turnkey solutions are those that are easily implemented in an existing system without disruption. They\u2019re more \u201cplug and play,\u201d while custom solutions require modifications.<\/p>\n<p>These terms are typical for software solutions, but you can also apply them to brand partnerships. For example, consider the Doritos Locos Taco\u2014a Taco Bell taco with a Doritos shell.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/partner-marketing-examples-doritos-taco-bell.webp\" alt=\"partner marketing examples - doritos and taco bell\" width=\"373\" height=\"498\" class=\"wp-image-65733 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/partner-marketing-examples-doritos-taco-bell.webp 479w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/partner-marketing-examples-doritos-taco-bell-225x300.webp 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 373px) 100vw, 373px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ocregister.com\/2012\/02\/17\/taco-bell-doritos-taco-coming-in-march\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cspdailynews.com\/snacks-candy\/taco-bell-partners-frito-lay-doritos-locos-tacos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">partnership between Doritos and Taco Bell<\/a> can be considered \u201cturnkey\u201d because it didn\u2019t require either brand to change its existing products or business models\u2014Taco Bell simply added a new item to its menu.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Align your goals with those of your partner<\/h3>\n<p>With partner marketing, it\u2019s essential to identify the final goal of the collaboration. Do you want to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/09\/b2b-sales-strategies\">Increase sales<\/a>?<\/li>\n<li>Venture into an untapped market?<\/li>\n<li>Spruce up brand awareness?<\/li>\n<li>Spread a message?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Identifying the end goal will help you to ideate on collaborations and create impactful partnerships. It also allows both brands to set quantifiable goals to strive for.<\/p>\n<p>This is why the partnership between Forever 21, a fashion brand, and Atkins, a weight loss brand, was a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/12\/28\/marketing-fails\">marketing fail<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>When Forever 21 sent Atkins bars to its customers, customers perceived this as a hint for them to lose weight and a form of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/us-news\/forever-21-accused-fat-shaming-after-mailing-diet-bars-orders-n1033911#:~:text=Clothing%20store%20Forever%2021%20is,that%20came%20with%20their%20clothes.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">body shaming<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/partner-marketing-examples-forever21-atkins.png\" alt=\"partner marketing examples - forever 21 and atkins\" width=\"547\" height=\"456\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-65732\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/partner-marketing-examples-forever21-atkins.png 547w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/partner-marketing-examples-forever21-atkins-480x400.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 547px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\n<em><a href=\"https:\/\/fatgirlflow.com\/forever-21-atkins-diet-bars\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>A well-designed <a href=\"https:\/\/visme.co\/blog\/partnership-proposal\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">partnership proposal<\/a> with clearly aligned goals can help both you and your partner brand to succeed.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Make sure your audiences are not the same<\/h3>\n<p>This is a tricky one! While it\u2019s important to have shared goals in the partnership, a shared audience won\u2019t really help you to expand your reach. You\u2019ll likely be talking and engaging with the same sets of people you\u2019ve already reached\u2014and collaborating with a competitor.<\/p>\n<p>One of the primary benefits of a partnership is to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/10\/brand-awareness\">increase brand awareness<\/a> and sales among untapped markets.<\/p>\n<p>Consider the brand partnership between Nike and Apple. While their target customers vary in many ways, they do share similarities in lifestyle, core values, and things that motivate them. Partnering allowed each brand to gain exposure to new but relevant audiences.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/partnership-marketing-examples-nike-apple.png\" alt=\"partner marketing examples - nike and apple\" width=\"720\" height=\"477\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-65729\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/partnership-marketing-examples-nike-apple.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/partnership-marketing-examples-nike-apple-480x318.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/3535382\/nike-ceo-apple-collaboration\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>5. Proactively promote your partner<\/h3>\n<p>Cross-promotion is a form of promotion where one brand features products or logos of other brands through numerous platforms. From social media to websites, newsletters, emails, push notifications, and other marketing channels, the possibilities are endless.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure that in addition to any specific co-marketing campaigns, you\u2019re promoting your partner\u2019s brand consistently to keep the relationship strong.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p>\u2734\ufe0f <strong>Free guide:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite30BestWaysToPromote.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Marketing_The30BestWaysToPromoteYourBusiness_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&gt;&gt; The 30 Best Ways to Promote Your Business (With or Without Money!)<\/a><\/strong><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h3>6. Marry your customer data<\/h3>\n<p>Collective data can be quite useful in partnership marketing. Each company has data on its products and purchases\u2014like what users buy, what they add to their carts but don\u2019t buy, and more. This data can help you identify <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/13\/sales-promotion-examples\">the best offers to put forth<\/a> with your partner campaigns, form a communication strategy that resonates with your audience, and establish and reach clear goals.<\/p>\n<h2>4 successful partnership marketing examples<\/h2>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, partnership marketing can be tricky and has to be dealt with strategically. However, if you develop a clear framework and a thorough plan, brand partnerships can work wonders in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/12\/growth-marketing\">helping your business grow<\/a>. Here are a few examples of successful brand partnerships that have helped brands achieve great results in the past.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Constant Contact and Partner Services<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.constantcontact.com\/partners\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Constant Contact<\/a> is a boutique digital marketing agency that partners with various independent companies ranging from small businesses, educational startups, and universities to corporates, to help them find marketing solutions to their customer problems.<\/p>\n<p>The partnership, in this case, is led by a single major brand, i.e. Constant Contact, where other brands do not play a public-facing role. However, a partnership of such a kind works when there is goodwill and trust in a single brand, and other smaller brands do not enjoy the same luxury.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/partner-marketing-example-constant-contact.png\" alt=\"partner marketing examples - constant contact\" width=\"720\" height=\"408\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-65734\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/partner-marketing-example-constant-contact.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/partner-marketing-example-constant-contact-480x272.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nThe services provided by other brands come under the dominant brand leading to mutual benefit.<\/p>\n<h3>2.
