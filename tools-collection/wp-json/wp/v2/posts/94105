The system strives to show you a mix of both, and there are nuances to how each is ranked.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Connected content: <\/strong>These are posts from friends, accounts you\u2019re following, and groups you\u2019ve joined. Most of the posts you see fall in this category, and it\u2019s chosen based on how you\u2019re connected to the publisher and how you\u2019ve interacted with similar content.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Recommended content:<\/strong> This includes posts published by accounts you aren\u2019t friends with or following, but that may have some relevance to you. Facebook recommends this content based on how you\u2019ve interacted with similar content from similar publishers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Facebook content standards<\/h3>\n<p>You can\u2019t discuss the Facebook algorithm without mentioning the platform\u2019s two sets of content standards. If you run afoul of these rules, no amount of relevance or connection will get your post past the algorithm\u2019s filters.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/transparency.meta.com\/en-gb\/policies\/community-standards\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Community Standards<\/a> are rules about what people can and can\u2019t share on the platform. They cover areas like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Violence and criminal behavior:<\/strong> Threats, terrorism, organized crime, and the like.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Safety:<\/strong> Think bullying, harassment, suicide, or self-injury content.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Objectionable content:<\/strong> Includes hate speech, adult nudity, and sexual exploitation.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Integrity and authenticity:<\/strong> This covers misinformation, fake accounts, spam, etc.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Respecting intellectual property:<\/strong> Things like copyright and trademark rights are covered here.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/help\/1257205004624246\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Recommendation Guidelines<\/a> are the rules that govern what content Facebook will <em>not<\/em> suggest to users in areas like Groups, Pages, Marketplace, or the main feed. Even if a post doesn\u2019t break Community Standards, it may still be downranked or excluded from recommendations if it could create a poor or unsafe experience.<\/p>\n<p>These guidelines restrict things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Borderline content<\/strong>: Sensational, misleading, or low-quality posts.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sensitive topics<\/strong>: Health claims, political or civic content, and unverified information.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Potentially unsafe or inappropriate material:<\/strong> Violence, sexually suggestive content, and spammy links.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>The Facebook algorithm vs. other social media algorithms<\/h3>\n<p>Another way to contextualize how the Facebook algorithm works is to compare it to other popular social media sites. Here\u2019s a quick rundown of their key differences:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Facebook algorithm:<\/strong> It prioritizes meaningful interactions between friends, family, and groups. Its ranking factors lean heavily on relationship strength, type of content, engagement, and recency.<\/li>\n<li><strong>TikTok algorithm:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/tiktok-algorithm\">The TikTok algorithm<\/a> focuses on the discovery of new-to-you creators through its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/07\/how-to-get-on-tiktok-fyp\">For You Page<\/a> (FYP). Ranking factors center around previous interactions (watch times, likes, etc.), video information, and your device and account settings.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Instagram algorithm:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/instagram-algorithm\">Instagram\u2019s algorithm<\/a> takes a blended approach that balances both personal connections and trending, engaging content. Its ranking factors rely on relationship history, engagement signals, and relevance to your interests, among others.<\/li>\n<li><strong>X (formerly Twitter) algorithm: <\/strong>Real-time conversations and trending topics are at the forefront of what X\u2019s algorithm shares most. It ranks content heavily on recency, engagement, and personalization to the user.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-giveaway.webp\" alt=\"Facebook algorithm - Facebook post from Hope House Coffee.\" width=\"593\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-94109 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-giveaway.webp 593w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-giveaway-480x486.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 593px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/giveaway-ideas\">Giveaways<\/a> like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/share\/r\/14Jofhu3Vgj\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this one<\/a> are a great way to juice the Facebook algorithm with engagement.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>User controls<\/h3>\n<p>Even though the algorithm is always working in the background to order the content on your feed, you have considerable control over what it chooses to show you. Here are several of the most prominent user controls you can apply to influence the algo:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Favorites: <\/strong>You can mark certain friends or Pages as Favorites so their posts appear higher in your feed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Snooze:<\/strong> Temporarily hide posts from a person, Page, or Group for 30 days without unfriending or leaving.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Unfollow:<\/strong> Stop seeing posts from someone entirely while still staying connected.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Hide Post\/See Fewer Like This: <\/strong>Tell the algorithm you don\u2019t want to see similar content in the future.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Feed Preferences:<\/strong> A settings hub where you can manage Favorites, Snooze, Unfollows, and reconnect with people\/Pages to shape your feed experience.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"facebook-algorithm-updates-and-trends\"><\/div>\n<h2>Facebook algorithm updates and trends to know about<\/h2>\n<p>If there\u2019s one thing constant about Facebook\u2019s algorithm, it\u2019s change. Here are some trends to be conscious of as you post throughout 2025 and beyond.<\/p>\n<h3>Prioritizing Reels<\/h3>\n<p>Starting around 2023, Facebook began increasing the weight given to short-form video content. They started pushing Reels into feeds and recommendations. This was likely a response to the popularity of TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>For brands, that means it\u2019s time to experiment with some quirky, little, fun, and educational videos if you want to expand your Facebook reach.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-dentist.webp\" alt=\"Facebook algorithm - Facebook post from a dentist.\" width=\"399\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-94110 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-dentist.webp 399w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-dentist-200x300.webp 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/share\/r\/17GHc5F3CF\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Even dentists<\/em><\/a><em> can have some fun with Facebook Reels.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>AI-driven content recommendations<\/h3>\n<p>Given <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/meta-platforms-meta-ends-ai-200401578.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s big AI push<\/a>, it\u2019s no surprise that Meta rolled out more AI-powered suggestions in the Feed, surfacing posts from outside your friend network if they\u2019re predicted to be relevant.<\/p>\n<p>Hyper-relevance for your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">target audience<\/a> is the name of the game here.

If you try to fudge your way into people\u2019s feeds, the system will flag your content as engagement bait and throttle your chances of greater placement.<\/p>\n<p>Here are several ways to keep your content from being tagged as clickbait:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Deliver what your post promises: <\/strong>If you say you\u2019ll share four unique, unheard of ideas, don\u2019t just list things everyone already knows.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Avoid clickbait titles:<\/strong> Don\u2019t use captions like \u201cYou won\u2019t believe what happened next!\u201d or \u201c#5 will shock you!\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Stay consistent with your brand:<\/strong> Don\u2019t post about a topic just because it&#8217;s popular if it has nothing to do with your business or typical content.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t beg for reactions:<\/strong> Stay away from copy like \u201cLike if you love pizza.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>8. Post at the right time<\/h3>\n<ol start=\"8\"><\/ol>\n<p>Get a little early engagement boost by posting content when your audience is most likely to be online.<\/p>\n<p>If you look at studies into the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/06\/best-time-to-post-on-facebook\">best time to post on Facebook<\/a>, you\u2019ll see they mostly don\u2019t agree.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-best-times.webp\" alt=\"Facebook algorithm - Graphic if best times to post research.\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-94118 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-best-times.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-best-times-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Your best bet is to take an educated guess based on your audience, then home in on it through trial and error.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you want to reach professionals in their 30s, you might post after the typical workday. But if your audience is active retirees, you could try a little earlier in the day.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Be active in groups<\/h3>\n<p>Content shared in<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/16\/create-facebook-group\"> Facebook groups<\/a> gets prioritized in feeds because it\u2019s considered meaningful interactions with people you\u2019re connected to. As a brand, you can leverage this ranking factor by becoming a regular participant in a relevant Facebook group.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes, customers will create a Facebook group to talk about your brand. That\u2019s what happened for this travel trailer manufacturer.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-camper.webp\" alt=\"Facebook algorithm - Facebook post from Scamp Travel Trailers group.\" width=\"937\" height=\"413\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-94119 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-camper.webp 937w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-camper-480x212.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But even if that hasn\u2019t happened, you can look for groups that tie into what you sell. For example, this brand could search for camping, travel trailer, or off-road adventure communities.<\/p>\n<p>A word of caution. Don\u2019t be overly salesy on any <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/reddit-marketing\">online forum<\/a>. Go in to be helpful, answer questions, and participate. Your educational posts will get an algorithm boost and you\u2019ll grow an engaged, targeted audience.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Track your analytics<\/h3>\n<p>Facebook offers a robust dashboard of analytics you can track that\u2019ll help you understand how the algorithm works for your brand.<\/p>\n<p>For example, you can see which content type gets the most views and engagements. Then, use that data to inform your next campaign.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-analytics-300x101.webp\" alt=\"Facebook algorithm - analytics dashboard.\" width=\"300\" height=\"101\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-94120\" \/><\/p>\n<p>All this data will tell you when, what, and where to share on Facebook for maximum reach.<\/p>\n<div id=\"facebook-algorithm-faqs\"><\/div>\n<h2>Facebook algorithm FAQs<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve covered a lot of ground. Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about the Facebook algorithm.<\/p>\n<h3>How does the Facebook algorithm decide what I see?<\/h3>\n<p>To decide which posts end up in your feed, Facebook looks at who posted, the type of content, how likely you are to interact, and how recent it is.<\/p>\n<h3>How often does the Facebook algorithm change?<\/h3>\n<p>Constantly. Meta makes small tweaks to its algorithms all the time, with major updates a few times a year.<\/p>\n<h3>How can businesses beat the Facebook algorithm?<\/h3>\n<p>You can\u2019t \u201cbeat\u201d the Facebook algorithm, and you shouldn\u2019t try. Instead, work with the algorithm by posting a variety of engaging, high-quality content that your audience will find educational and entertaining.<\/p>\n<h3>How can I reset my Facebook algorithm?<\/h3>\n<p>You can\u2019t fully reset your Facebook algorithm, but you can influence it by adjusting your feed settings like prioritizing friends, unfollowing pages, hitting the \u201cSnooze\u201d button on content you don\u2019t want to see, and so on.<\/p>\n<h3>Is the Facebook algorithm the same as Instagram\u2019s?<\/h3>\n<p>Facebook and Instagram\u2019s algorithms are similar, but not identical. Both emphasize engagement, but Instagram relies more heavily on visual discovery and trending audio.<\/p>\n<h3>What\u2019s the best time to post on Facebook?<\/h3>\n<p>The best time to post on Facebook depends on when your audience is most active on the platform, which you can find in your Facebook analytics dashboard and by tracking your content success.<\/p>\n<h2>Learn how the Facebook algorithm works<\/h2>\n<p>Too often, social media algorithms are portrayed as some type of sophisticated lock that needs to be bested for success. You\u2019ll do a lot better if you think of it like a suggestion engine you need to work with instead of against.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that the algorithm\u2019s biggest priority is fostering engagement. Let that knowledge guide what you post and when. Publish content that gets people commenting and sharing. And don\u2019t hesitate to jump into the conversation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learn how to use the Facebook algorithm to your advantage for more reach and
