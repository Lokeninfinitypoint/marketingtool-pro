But it&#8217;s your agency&#8217;s job to lead them to the right marketing solution for their business growth.<\/p>\n<p>And in many cases, the right marketing solution is PPC.<\/p>\n<p>Whether your agency has only recently started offering PPC services or you&#8217;re looking to expand your client base in this area, this article is for you\u2013I\u2019ll share some of our best strategies for selling Google Ads and winning new PPC business.<\/p>\n<p>Use these tried-and-true methods to sell more of your clients on PPC.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Follow up with EVERY lead<\/h2>\n<p>Unless you have a dedicated sales team or you are a salesperson at heart and just love to prospect for leads, I\u2019d imagine that just making first contact with a prospect is a big hurdle for most. If you do have a sales team or the time, I recommend a strong follow-up process for all <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/08\/25\/inbound-marketing-strategy\">inbound leads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t\u2013it\u2019s all about taking advantage of opportunities you might not realize are opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>You may also need to nurture leads through the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/07\/marketing-funnel\">marketing funnel<\/a> before you can close a sale for your PPC services.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/sales-funnel-1.jpg\" alt=\"sales funnel image\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75752\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/sales-funnel-1.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/sales-funnel-1-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>2. Go after low-hanging fruit<\/h2>\n<p>This includes current clients who are not using Google Ads. If you already know their business model and budget you should have a strong sense of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/12\/does-google-adwords-work\">whether PPC will be a good fit for them<\/a>,\u00a0what <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/ppc\">PPC strategies<\/a> will apply, and what will be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/12\/05\/best-ad-platform\">the best ad platform for them<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>From there, you can put together a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/13\/marketing-proposal\">marketing proposal<\/a> that shows them how PPC will complement their existing strategy&#8211;and the types of results they can anticipate.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udea8 Get our latest <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteGoogleAdsBenchmarks2023.html?cid=Web_WS_incontent_guide_2023benchmarks_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incontent_links\">search ads benchmarks<\/a> to see average results by industry!<\/p>\n<h2>3. Talk the talk<\/h2>\n<p>Fold PPC into ALL of your new business opportunities and marketing material. Don\u2019t talk about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/26\/marketing-channels\">marketing channels<\/a> like organic search or <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/12\/07\/amplify-email-marketing-with-ppc\">email marketing<\/a> without considering how paid search marketing complements these channels.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Create a referral program<\/h2>\n<p>Client referrals are one of the main ways we found agencies <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/02\/strategies-to-grow-your-digital-marketing-agency\">get new clients<\/a>. To sell PPC to more clients, you can create a referral program that rewards your existing clients for referring your PPC services to new businesses. This can help you expand while showing your existing clients you value them and their business.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/state-of-the-agency-client-acquisition.png.webp\" alt=\"state-of-the-agency-new-client-source\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>5. Partner with complementary agencies or businesses<\/h2>\n<p>If your agency specializes in PPC and\/or a small range of digital marketing services, you can partner with an agency that provides complementary services. This could be a web design firm, a PR agency, etc. By partnering with a complementary agency, you&#8217;re able to market your PPC services to their clients (and they&#8217;re able to market their services to your clients), which helps you expand your client base and sell Google Ads to more clients overall.<\/p>\n<p>\u26a1\ufe0f <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteGrowYourMarketingAgency.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Agency_StrategiestoGrowYourAgency_Download\">6 Absolute Best Strategies to Grow Your Digital Marketing Agency<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>6. Understand the importance of the first outreach attempt<\/h2>\n<p>The first attempt is your reps\u2019 best shot to reach a prospect because <strong>connect rates drop 33% after the first attempt<\/strong>. Make sure your reps get the most from these calls by having their pitch prepared and the right time blocked off. Coach them to continue following up on accounts when they have contact information for the decision-maker, and to break off after 6+ touches on weaker accounts. When they have time (or when lead flow is low), they can always return to these weaker accounts where some potential exists.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"750cf3ec-1259-4602-b158-385dd2dd581e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/agencies-sell-ppc-contact-rate.png\" alt=\"contact rate graph\" width=\"713\" height=\"492\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Source:<a href=\"http:\/\/www.insightsquared.com\/2015\/07\/should-you-keep-calling-that-prospect-a-new-study-gives-the-answer\/\"> Insightsquared<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>7. Don&#8217;t lose the art of the follow-up<\/h2>\n<p>Many reps assume that if they haven\u2019t connected with a prospect by the fourth or fifth attempt, they never will. But our data told a different story: <strong>Even after 10 attempts, reps were able to connect <\/strong>with their prospects almost 5% of the time. Connect rate declines quickly at first, but levels off around the sixth dial\u2013this means that there are a lot of conversations buried in seemingly unreachable prospects.<\/p>\n<h2>8. Develop a plan that optimizes your reps\u2019 time<\/h2>\n<p>The number of times you should have your reps <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/18\/how-to-follow-up-with-sales-leads\">call each prospect<\/a> depends on your lead flow. If your reps are drowning in leads, it makes more sense for them to focus on making first attempts, where there is a significantly higher connect rate.<\/p>\n<p>Conversely, when lead flow is dry, don\u2019t hesitate to have them dig into some older leads that they haven\u2019t connected with yet. It may take them 20 calls to reach a single prospect, but that\u2019s one more conversation they\u2019d have than if they\u2019d given up.<\/p>\n<p>When you do connect with your prospects, remember that the focus of your conversation isn\u2019t paid search\u2013it\u2019s their business and how they can grow it. PPC is just a means to an end they care about.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/google-ads-roi-stat.jpg\" alt=\"google ads roi stat\" width=\"936\" height=\"355\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75750\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/google-ads-roi-stat.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/google-ads-roi-stat-480x182.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>9. Know how to respond to common objections<\/h2>\n<p>When <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/15\/ppc-agency-pricing\">selling PPC to your clients<\/a>, you know they&#8217;re going to have some questions&#8211;and probably some objections, as well. You and your reps will need to be prepared to respond to these in a way that makes your clients feel comfortable about their investment in PPC moving forward. Here are some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/30\/ppc-client-business-questions\">common PPC objections<\/a> and how to respond to them.<\/p>\n<h4>\u201cMy SEO is good enough!\u201d<\/h4>\n<p>It\u2019s crazy to depend entirely on organic search as a lead source. Organic results are unreliable and have shrinking real estate on the SERP, especially on mobile.<\/p>\n<p>Further, we\u2019ve found that the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-intent\">most high-intent searchers<\/a> (people who are really ready to buy) are more likely to click paid results than organic results, even if they\u2019ve found your site organically while they were in the research phase. Plus, tons of studies show that <strong>doing PPC adds incremental traffic on top of your SEO<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3606317d-5e3b-411c-b5af-594c00b32aa4\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/agencies-sell-ppc-seo.png\" alt=\"seo and ppc graph\" width=\"608\" height=\"450\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>So \u201cI\u2019m already doing SEO\u201d is not a good argument against PPC.<\/p>\n<h4>\u201cIt\u2019s too expensive.\u201d<\/h4>\n<p>Putting aside the fact that SEO isn\u2019t free (it requires both technical and creative resources), PPC is only \u201cexpensive\u201d if you ignore what you\u2019re getting back from it. There are tons of levers to pull in PPC to control spend so that you only pay for the clicks most likely to convert, which is the key to getting a strong return on your investment.<\/p>\n<h4>\u201cThe clicks don\u2019t convert!\u201d<\/h4>\n<p>If your prospect says PPC hasn\u2019t converted for them in the past, one of a few things could be going on:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. They\u2019re not tracking conversions properly.<\/strong> If it\u2019s a business that gets a lot of calls, <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/marketing-dashboard\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">make sure they\u2019re using call tracking<\/a> so that calls are properly attributed back to the ads that drove them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Their offer just isn\u2019t compelling.<\/strong> If that\u2019s the case no channel is going to deliver conversions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Landing page problems.<\/strong> Maybe ads link back to the home page, so leads get lost, or the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/great-landing-pages\">landing page<\/a> isn\u2019t focused. This can be solved with landing page optimization.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. They\u2019re not remarketing.<\/strong> The first time isn\u2019t always a charm! More often than not, you have to take your date out to dinner a few times before you sleep with them\u2014and sales courtship isn\u2019t too different! If a visitor doesn\u2019t convert right off the bat, all hope is not lost. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/17\/retargeting-campaign-tips\">Remarketing<\/a> is a great CRO tool because it allows you to continue to engage with and nurture people who have already expressed interest in your website.<\/p>\n<p>For example, last summer I tried Jeni\u2019s gourmet ice cream for the first time at a friend\u2019s house. It\u2019s absolutely divine but, at $12 a pint, I had no intentions of stocking my freezer with it. However, I will admit, I checked up on their site pretty regularly to peruse the latest flavors. Next thing I know, I\u2019m getting slammed with remarketing ads! I managed to stay strong after seeing a few, but caved pretty quickly.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"74868314-52c9-4c15-aaa9-15774043816c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/agencies-sell-ppc-ice-cream.png\" alt=\"jeni's ice cream remarketing\" width=\"979\" height=\"618\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>I\u2019m now $56 poorer and 10 pounds heavier and I have remarketing to thank.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>All these things are fixable and getting it right can turn PPC into a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/20\/google-ads-for-lead-generation\">lead generation machine<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h2>One last note before you go forth and sell PPC to clients\u2026<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve been focusing on how to win new PPC business, but as a final caveat, I want to stress that it\u2019s also important to know when to say <em>no<\/em> to a new client.
