This is where understanding the types of campaigns available to you comes into play.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook offers a highly scaffolded campaign creation experience. What does that mean in English?<\/p>\n<p>Facebook silos campaign objectives into three categories: Awareness, Consideration, and Conversion. Although each of these categories has a legit use case for B2B advertisers, not all the individual objectives are worth deploying on a consistent basis.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-campaign-objectives-b2b-advertisers.png\" alt=\"facebook campaign objectives for b2b advertisers\" width=\"568\" height=\"214\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>See those little guns? Pretend they\u2019re blasting objectives right out of your Business Manager UI.<\/p>\n<p>Product catalog sales and Store visits are, by and large, useless for B2B advertisers. Reach campaigns can be great for getting top-level content in front of unfamiliar prospects, but without a robust content program and some serious remarketing in place, these campaigns are tough to tie back to revenue. And while you might be able to find some use for them, the three eliminated objectives in the Consideration column only have the potential to represent mid-funnel value for your business <em>if<\/em> you have the requisite collateral. Frankly, most small B2B advertisers don\u2019t have apps and find images more cost-effective to spin up than video.<\/p>\n<p>The four remaining objectives\u2014<strong>Brand awareness, Traffic, Lead generation, and Conversions<\/strong>\u2014are the areas in which you need to focus if you want to successfully advertise your products or services to other businesses on Facebook. From left to right, these objectives align with what we in the business call a \u201cfunnel.\u201d Here\u2019s how it works:<\/p>\n<h3>Brand awareness<\/h3>\n<p>These campaigns pull prospects into the top of your marketing funnel. The goal of these campaigns is to pique prospects\u2019 interest.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/b2b-facebook-advertising-goals-brand-awareness-campaign.jpg\" alt=\"facebook b2b advertising brand awareness campaign goals\" width=\"600\" height=\"375\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Likely, they\u2019re not going to lead directly to a sale (though some people may be so taken with your messaging that they can\u2019t help but sign on the dotted line). The audiences you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/13\/b2b-social-media\">target<\/a> within brand awareness campaigns should be broad, made up of layered characteristics your prospects <em>may<\/em> possess. Brand awareness campaigns are also a great place to use 8%-10% lookalike audiences based on your past converters or existing customers. This allows you to avoid putting your techy SaaS offering in front of geriatric technophobes.<\/p>\n<h3>Traffic<\/h3>\n<p>Traffic campaigns allow you to drive\u2026. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/14\/increase-traffic-to-my-website\">Traffic<\/a>! You\u2019ve got two options here: you can send prospects to your Facebook page (don\u2019t, it\u2019s a waste of money) <em>or<\/em> your website (ding ding ding!).<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-b2b-advertising-traffic-campaign-objective.png\" alt=\"facebook for b2b advertisers campaign objective drive traffic\" width=\"162\" height=\"142\" \/><\/div>\n<p>These campaigns are one of my favorite methods of building highly specific remarketing lists (and, in turn, lookalike audiences). The strategy is relatively straightforward; while with Brand awareness campaigns you\u2019re likely looking to cast a wide net, Traffic campaigns are the place to begin ratcheting down, matching your products and services to specific demographic, psychographic, and industry profiles.<\/p>\n<h3>Lead generation<\/h3>\n<p>Pound for pound, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/24\/facebook-lead-ads\">Facebook lead gen ads<\/a> represent the best bang for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/17\/b2b-lead-generation\">B2B advertiser<\/a>\u2019s buck.\u00a0 They allow you to collect prospects\u2019 information directly within Facebook, removing a potential point of friction: your website.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/b2b-facebook-advertising-lead-ads-roi.png\" alt=\"facebook lead ads are perfect for b2b advertisers\" width=\"650\" height=\"315\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This isn\u2019t to say that your site\u2019s not gorgeous; the real win with lead ads is the fact that they\u2019re auto-filled using information pulled directly from a prospect\u2019s Facebook page. If all it takes to sign up for X\u2014where X is your offer\u2014is two clicks, a prospect who isn\u2019t particularly familiar with your brand is more likely to convert this way than if they\u2019d been asked to enter that same information manually.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook lead ads allow you to collect valuable contact information from your prospects, which you can use to build email lists, add prospects to your email nurture program, or simply hand warm leads over to your sales team.<\/p>\n<h3>Conversion campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>These are your closers, the ace up your sleeve. They also tend to be expensive. For that reason, I advise that you NEVER use Conversion campaigns to send prospects to pages on your website proper; instead, maximize the value of every click (you\u2019re payin\u2019 for \u2018em) by sending traffic to targeted landing pages. If you sell software, conversion campaigns should be used to funnel prospects to product trials or demo signups.<\/p>\n<p>***<\/p>\n<p>Understanding which campaign types align with your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/09\/b2b-sales-strategies\">B2B sales<\/a> and marketing goals will help you build an effective foundation for B2B advertising on Facebook. Of course, even the best B2B Facebook campaign will fall flat on its face if you\u2019re not filling it with the right ad sets.<\/p>\n<h2>Ad Sets: Where the Magic Happens<\/h2>\n<p>While campaigns are containers defined by objectives, the ad set level is where you\u2019ll control everything from budget and scheduling to audience and ad creation. You know, the important stuff that makes Facebook a completely viable channel for your B2B marketing budget.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-set-logo-facebook-advertising.png\" alt=\"facebook business manager ad set logo\" width=\"221\" height=\"44\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Before we talk ad types and audiences (the fun stuff), though, let\u2019s jump into budgeting and scheduling.<\/p>\n<h3>Budget &amp; Scheduling<\/h3>\n<p>In Facebook, you can assign each ad set a daily or lifetime budget.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve spent time managing a Google Ads (formerly known as Google AdWords) account, daily budgets will probably feel more familiar to you; simply assign a daily spend threshold, a start date, and an end date. I like to use small daily budgets for early-stage B2B clients because they\u2019re more predictable; they\u2019re perfect for experimentation, figuring out what works without inadvertently blowing through budget.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, Facebook <em>will spend your money each day, no matter what<\/em>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-b2b-advertising-budget-schedule-screen.png\" alt=\"facebook b2b advertising ad scheduling and budgeting at the ad set level\" width=\"582\" height=\"340\" \/><\/div>\n<p>For more seasoned Facebook marketers, I\u2019d suggest working with a lifetime budget; just use relatively short (3-5 days) intervals for your start and end dates until you\u2019re more comfortable with the shift away from daily normalcy. Facebook will deploy budget across the period you\u2019ve selected in the way that makes the most sense in relation to your campaign goal.<\/p>\n<p>Advertisers can game this system to squeeze a little more value out of lifetime budgets by implementing ad scheduling; think of it like a negative placement on the Google Display network.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/b2b-facebook-advertising-ad-schedule.png\" alt=\"b2b facebook ads ad scheduling \" width=\"456\" height=\"412\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Basically, you\u2019re telling Facebook that you\u2019d like it to determine <em>when<\/em> to serve your ads within a given period, but forcing the algorithm to ignore time slots during which your prospects aren\u2019t likely to convert. This ensure that your lifetime budget isn\u2019t squandered in the wee hours of the morning or on the weekends, when your prospects are too busy with fantasy football rosters to book a demo.<\/p>\n<p>While budget management should be guided by performance, you <em>need<\/em> to keep those campaign goals we just ran through in mind.<\/p>\n<p>Use ad scheduling in conversion campaigns to funnel prospects into product demos while they\u2019re sitting at the office, then open your ad scheduling up (or revert to a lower daily budget) on lower value campaigns with offers that can be consumed at all hours (like a content download).<\/p>\n<h3>Ad Placement<\/h3>\n<p>While determining ad spend and scheduling are important steps towards making Facebook a viable marketing platform for your business, all that hard work can be undone by poorly chosen placements. You see, \u201cFacebook Ads\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201cNews Feed ads.\u201d Unless you tell it otherwise, Facebook ads are eligible to show up in obscure corners of the internet, too.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/b2b-facebook-ad-placement-priority-selection-1.png\" alt=\"facebook ad placement for b2b advertisers\" width=\"650\" height=\"377\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Within Facebook itself, ads can be served in:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The news feed<\/li>\n<li>Groups<\/li>\n<li>Right column<\/li>\n<li>Instant articles<\/li>\n<li>In-stream videos<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>While some of these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/12\/10\/facebook-ad-placements\">Facebook ad placements<\/a> are useful to B2B advertisers (lookin\u2019 at you,<strong> news feed and right column<\/strong>) the rest afford less visibility and decrease opportunities for conversion. You\u2019re in the business of making money, not being ignored. You <em>want<\/em> ad engagement. Make sure your ads show up in the right places by opting out of automatic placements.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/no-automatic-placement-b2b-facebook-advertising.png\" alt=\"facebook for b2b advertisers don't use automatic placements\" width=\"584\" height=\"241\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Facebook states that and choosing custom placements will \u201creduce the number of people you reach,\u201d when compared with the automatic option. But if that reduction means an increase in <em>quality<\/em>, is it really an issue?<\/p>\n<p>Facebook has a handful of other placement options but, outside of boosting brand awareness, they\u2019re not particularly useful for B2B advertisers.<\/p>\n<p>It gives you the ability to segment your advertising by device (I\u2019d recommend sticking with \u201call devices\u201d unless you\u2019ve got some mobile-specific campaign ideas).<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-b2b-advertising-device-type-selection.png\" alt=\"b2b advertisers should pay attention to the devices their ads are showing on\" width=\"305\" height=\"120\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Facebook ads also allow you to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/22\/best-instagram-ads\">advertise on Instagram<\/a>: that\u2019s right, the Image-centric social channel doesn\u2019t have its own advertising interface. Instead, advertisers can opt to show their creative in either feed or story form. Finally, Facebook ads can also be served across the Facebook Audience Network (those obscure corners of the internet I mentioned earlier). In my experience, both Instagram and the Audience Network are only useful for B2B advertisers when included in remarketing campaigns; if you\u2019re going with custom placements, opt out.<\/p>\n<p><strong>POTENTIAL GAMECHANGER ALERT<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As I was writing this guide, Facebook <em>just <\/em>announced a change that allows advertisers to \u201cselect specific placements within the Audience Network to control where ads will be shown.\u201d That changes things\u2026<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-advertising-audience-network-b2b-placements.png\" alt=\"facebook audience network improvement managed placements\" width=\"573\" height=\"90\" \/><\/div>\n<p>With the ability to target specific sites on the Audience Network, you can serve creative in places your customers frequent. If you currently use Managed Placements over on Google Ads, copy your list of sites into Facebook and see if any of them are on the Audience Network, too. It\u2019s worth experimenting with!<\/p>\n<h2>Audiences: The Key to Facebook Ads Success<\/h2>\n<p>Facebook\u2019s <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/27\/facebook-ad-targeting-options-infographic\">suite of targeting options<\/a> makes creating effective B2C campaigns straightforward.<\/p>\n<p>If your restaurant has a projector, a particularly rare hefeweizen on tap, and serves up the most eclectic wings in the city, Facebook makes it incredibly easy to target football-loving beer aficionados looking to watch kung fu movies within 5 miles of your front door.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/example-facebook-b2c-interest-targeting.png\" alt=\"example of interest targeted b2c facebook ads audience\" width=\"535\" height=\"390\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Finding a business\u2019s primary decision makers, on the other hand, can prove to be a bit tricky.<\/p>\n<p>While Google Ads gives you the ability to segment your offerings based on <a href=\"\/keywords\">keywords<\/a> (and thus, intent), Facebook is <em>audience based<\/em>. Instead of finding prospects based on a direct input (a search query), you can layer dozens of distinguishing factors to create a model of your ideal customer. In more touchy-feely corners of marketing we might call this a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/23\/buyer-personas\">buyer persona<\/a>. If you can consistently pair the right audience with the right offer, you\u2019re well on your way to B2B marketing dominance.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook audience creation comes in three main flavor, each of which is useful for B2B advertisers: core, custom, and lookalike.<\/p>\n<h3>Core Audience Creation<\/h3>\n<p>Outside of Custom and Lookalike audiences (which have their own interface), most your audience creation will occur at the ad set level. Enter any ad set in your account and you\u2019ll see a screen that looks like this:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/b2b-facebook-core-audience-creation.png\" alt=\"facebook ads b2b core audience creation\" width=\"586\" height=\"768\" \/><\/div>\n<p>There\u2019s a lot going on here (we\u2019ll touch on that first \u201cCustom Audiences\u201d section in a minute), but it\u2019s all <em>very<\/em> intuitive.<\/p>\n<p>Location, age, gender, and language allow you to whittle away subsets of your audience who, despite conveying an affinity for your product, simply aren\u2019t a fit. Think of this section as the audience equivalent of ad scheduling. It doesn\u2019t do you any good if the Latvian version of your perfect prospect clicks an ad for something you only sell to businesses within 100 miles of Boston: save your budget for the people who can actually become customers.<\/p>\n<p>The \u201cDetailed Targeting\u201d section at the bottom of the Audience interface allows you to include <em>and<\/em> exclude prospects who display specific characteristics. This is an incredible way to ensure your ads are served to the right people, making it easier to maximize the value of every dollar spent on advertising.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to location, age, gender, and language, you can find prospects using a combination of the following demographic categories:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Education<\/li>\n<li>Financial<\/li>\n<li>Relationship status<\/li>\n<li>Financials<\/li>\n<li>Work (employer, job title, industry)<\/li>\n<li>Home type<\/li>\n<li>Ethnicity<\/li>\n<li>Generation<\/li>\n<li>Parents<\/li>\n<li>Life events<\/li>\n<li>Political affiliation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Between this robust suite of audience options <em>and<\/em> the equally expansive interest and behavioral categories, finding the prospects you\u2019re looking for is a cinch. Speaking of, don\u2019t sleep on the B2B category within \u201cBehaviors\u201d targeting; it allows you to use company size, industry, and seniority to put your ads in front of the right people. This will allow you to get your ads in front of decision makers, saving your budget for prospects with the power to pull the trigger.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ads-b2b-behavior-targeting.png\" alt=\"facebook ads b2b behavioral targeting\" width=\"501\" height=\"217\" \/><\/div>\n<p>While the CMO at NounVerb might not have known she needed your product (and therefore wouldn\u2019t have found your company through search), Facebook ads allow you to preemptively offer a solution instead of sitting back on your heels.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to dig into audience creation a bit more, check out our infographic for a detailed breakdown of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/27\/facebook-ad-targeting-options-infographic\">Facebook\u2019s targeting options<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Custom Audiences<\/h3>\n<p>If you aren\u2019t quite sold on core audiences (yet), Custom Audiences might be a better starting place for your Facebook Advertising experience.<\/p>\n<p>Custom audiences can be created using five different methods, but the only three that you should focus on as a B2B marketer are those based on a customer file (email addresses you upload), website traffic (using the pixel), and Engagement (selectively).<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ads-b2b-audience-creation.png\" alt=\"b2b facebook advertising custom audience creation\" width=\"548\" height=\"518\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Creating audiences based on a customer file allows you to leverage your existing database to find your prospects while they\u2019re commenting on their neighbor\u2019s erratic lawncare habits.

My favorite way to use Custom Audiences created from a customer file is to segment an existing email nurture list, isolating \u201cDid Not Opens\u201d or other inactive prospects, and hitting lukewarm (or ice cold) leads with ad creative they can\u2019t help but click.<\/p>\n<p>Website traffic audiences differ in that the audiences you can create are made up of people who have\u2026. visited your website.

Before this innovation was added, I\u2019d have told you not to waste your budget on engagement audiences for B2B advertising (outside of lead form-specific audiences I still maintain this belief). That being said, if you\u2019re using lead ads to generate net-new prospects or push content, Engagement audiences are clutch.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ads-custom-audience-lead-ad-form.png\" alt=\"b2b advertisers can create custom audiences based on interactions with facebook lead ads\" width=\"411\" height=\"233\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As you can see, these Custom Audiences allow you to build new audiences based on actions taken involving lead ads.<\/p>\n<p>If someone opened but didn\u2019t submit the form, present them with a different, albeit comparable offer; perhaps they\u2019d be more comfortable visiting your website instead of forking over valuable contact information via Facebook. On the other hand, you can use audiences made of prospects who <em>did<\/em> complete your lead ad form to serve lower funnel offers like product demos or free trials.<\/p>\n<p>Using a combination of Core and Custom Audiences would be more than enough to help you find qualified B2B prospects, but Facebook has one more audience-creation trick up its sleeve: Lookalikes.<\/p>\n<h3>Lookalike Audiences<\/h3>\n<p>I saved the best for last.<\/p>\n<p>While new prospects might not display the exact same characteristics and Facebook behavioral patterns as your existing customers, I\u2019d wager a mirror image of the people currently paying you is a solid starting point for your lead acquisition. Lookalike Audiences allow you to create a brand-new audience of prospects whose demographic and psychographic makeup parallel your source audience.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSource audience\u201d can be any Facebook audience you\u2019ve already created; to maximize the utility of Lookalikes, though, you should use high-value audiences like converters (based on the Facebook Pixel) or customer emails.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve selected your source audience and a target location (country), Facebook will immediately generate an estimated audience size for your Lookalike:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-advertising-b2b-lookalike-audience-creation.png\" alt=\"lookalike audiences are the secret weapon for b2b facebook advertisers\" width=\"650\" height=\"107\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This new audience consists of the 1% of Facebook users in your chosen location that most closely resembles your source audience. Combined with the interest, behavioral, and demographic targeting I touched on earlier, you\u2019re ready to hit brand new prospects with some compelling creative.<\/p>\n<p>Time to start closing deals.<\/p>\n<p>***<\/p>\n<p>For many B2B marketers, Facebook represents the next frontier in online advertising.
