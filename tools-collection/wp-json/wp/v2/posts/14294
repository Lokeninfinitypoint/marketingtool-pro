By selling on Amazon through\u00a0FBA, you at least get to remove inventory management, shipping, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pandadoc.com\/electronic-signature-software\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the signature process<\/a>, and returns from your plate.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, Amazon\u2019s customer service via email, phone, and <a href=\"https:\/\/getvoip.com\/live-chat-software\/\">live chat tools<\/a> can save you from hiring employees to handle complaints and returns. Customer service and returns for any orders your customers place are\u00a0handled directly by FBA and their <a href=\"https:\/\/freshdesk.com\/knowledge-base-software\">knowledge base software<\/a> database. This saves you time and frustration so you can focus on selling on Amazon to the best of your ability.<\/p>\n<p>And there are more benefits:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can use Amazon FBA to quickly grow your business since its fulfillment centers have been designed with wide-ranging inventory in mind.<\/li>\n<li>There is\u00a0no minimum number of products you must send in order to participate in this program.<\/li>\n<li>Storing your products in the Amazon fulfillment centers is cost-effective.<\/li>\n<li>You basically <a href=\"https:\/\/services.amazon.com\/fulfillment-by-amazon\/pricing.htm\/ref=asus_fba_snav_p\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pay\u00a0as\u00a0you\u00a0go<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Amazon charges for storage space and the orders it fulfills for your customers. Shipping costs are included in your fees.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The Amazon fulfillment center that stores your products will be assigned to you. You can box up a variety of items and ship them to the assigned warehouse. You are only responsible to package them correctly and send them to the fulfillment center.<\/p>\n<p>Be sure to pay attention to where Amazon assigns items to be sent, though. For example, you may be sending in 20 copies of a cookbook, but they assign 10 to one center and 10 to another.<\/p>\n<p>If these benefits sound worth it for your business, you\u2019ll just need to sign up for an FBA account. Here are three main steps to get started:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create your product listings\u2014add them in one at a time or in bulk with <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.amazonservices.com\/?ld=NSGoogle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon\u2019s API<\/a><u>.<\/u><\/li>\n<li>Prep your products and make sure they are ready to sell and ship to Amazon.

The\u00a0process of\u00a0selling on Amazon\u00a0begins when you grow your inventory and start listing products for sale in the Amazon Marketplace. The process of making money on Amazon starts with these four steps.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how make $1,000\/month selling on Amazon.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Choose your product niche<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s important to have a strategy for choosing your product niche. When you find the right niche,\u00a0it\u00a0can potentially become a gold mine for you in your Amazon selling business. Choosing one product niche can help you better track which products are selling and which are not.<\/p>\n<p>When you find a great niche, you can also sell online without a huge competitive market stealing customers away from you. However, this process starts with an objective analysis of the product niche, whether that\u2019s matcha tea or minimalist watches.<\/p>\n<p>Search for your product on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/shopping?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Shopping<\/a> to understand how many other brands are selling similar items. Check out the minimum advertised price (MAP) pricing. If you are going to have to compete against 25 other large retailers, the market may be too saturated to enter.<\/p>\n<p>Choosing your product niche and sales funnel also involves understanding your customer persona Seasonality will also play a role, as products only in demand during the holidays, or specific times of the year require a different approach than year-round, evergreen products.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/selling-on-amazon-product-niche.jpg\" alt=\"pool toy example photo \" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>A niche like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Swimline-Giant-Shootball-Basketball-Swimming\/dp\/B00769SDUW\/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=pool+toys&amp;qid=1555098653&amp;s=home-garden&amp;sr=1-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">swimming pool basketball toys<\/a>, for instance.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, you should sell high-end, branded items (that only you sell) with high margins and low product weight.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Price your items to sell<\/h3>\n<p>If you want your items to sell, you need to price them accordingly. When you price your products higher than your competition, it\u00a0can kill both your Amazon venture and any trust with your customers. 91% of customers buy from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lyfemarketing.com\/branding-services\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">trusted branding<\/a>, so you need to build this customer trust on Amazon, too.<\/p>\n<p>Once you build trust and start generating sales, you may see that Amazon starts to promote your products. Amazon automatically promotes other products in the section on the product detail page under \u201cCustomers who bought this item also bought.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/selling-on-amazon-customers-also-shop-for.jpg\" alt=\"&quot;customers also shop for&quot; example\" width=\"925\" height=\"212\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Setting the price for your product involves the following strategy:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Have a profit margin over 50% to 66%.<\/li>\n<li>Price your item between MAP and MSRP pricing.<\/li>\n<li>Know your cost of goods sold (COGS).<\/li>\n<li>Remember to count additional fees, such as the Amazon commission on sales, Amazon FBA fees, customer return fees, fees for returns that you have incurred, overhead costs, packing and shipping costs, and any category-specific costs. For example, vendors selling apparel on Amazon will incur category-specific costs due to the high rate of customer returns for these items.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Finally, search for other Amazon products similar to yours. Use the same three keywords that you used for your description page and search for other products to see what appears.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll want to stand out from this list with strong pricing, high quality imagery, and a highly clickable product title.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Improve product page ranking<\/h3>\n<p>Ask yourself if your price is comparable to your competitors\u2019. You need to have a competitive price and <a href=\"https:\/\/contentwriters.com\/product-descriptions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">unique product descriptions<\/a> so that your product ends up on page one of the Amazon search results. Page one results mean that customers are seeing your products first,\u00a0which\u00a0will increase the probability of a sale.<\/p>\n<p>You can get your products to page one results when you invest in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/17\/amazon-seo\">Amazon SEO strategies<\/a> like the following:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Relevant product title<\/li>\n<li>Your Amazon backend keywords<\/li>\n<li>Your product\u2019s price and conversion rate<\/li>\n<li>Your Amazon reviews<\/li>\n<li>Your product\u2019s price<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Making sure you have high-quality <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/26\/product-photography\">product photos<\/a> is also important, which is why I recommend using <a href=\"https:\/\/learn.g2crowd.com\/free-photo-editing-software\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free photo editing tools<\/a> to improve your image quality.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/selling-on-amazon-photo-editing.jpg\" alt=\"photo editing image\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Research your competition to continually generate sales from high rankings. Tweak your product title to generate a high click-through rate so that you can continually generate organic sales.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that ecommerce promotions often follow retail holidays like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/16\/black-fiveday\">Black Friday<\/a>, Cyber Monday, and even other more general promotions like winter clearance or fall sales. Promotional periods are high sales periods, which is another reason your profit margin should be high.<\/p>\n<p>Most often, sellers choose to deviate from a stable price in the following instances:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Launching new products<\/li>\n<li>Cross-selling<\/li>\n<li>Selling stock clearance items<\/li>\n<li>Sales like Black Friday or Cyber Monday<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>However, lowering your price for these reasons means that you usually lower them to near break-even level\u2014sometimes even lowering them below the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/07\/agency-profitability-metrics\">profitability<\/a> level. This is not recommended for normal pricing, so you have to deeply understand your profit margin and cost of goods sold (COGS).<\/p>\n<p>Remember, your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/16\/return-on-ad-spend-roas\">return on ad spend<\/a> for any marketing should always be 3:1. So if you spend $100 on marketing, you need to generate $300 in sales to maintain profitability.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Add detailed product information<\/h3>\n<p>Products can be listed in the Amazon Marketplace catalog one at a time. However, if you obtain a professional selling subscription, you have the option to add larger groups of products through the bulk tools. If the products are not yet listed on Amazon, you can identify the UPC\/EAN and SKU.<\/p>\n<p>Then, you describe the attributes of the product, such as a title and detailed description information. If the product is already listed on Amazon, you need to identify the number of products you have to sell, list the condition, and the shipping options.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to make a lot of money on Amazon, simply describing the basics of your product is not good enough. Amazon keywords are everything for sellers. A good majority of sales on Amazon occur through organic searches for products. If you haven\u2019t optimized your product descriptions and <a href=\"https:\/\/firstsiteguide.com\/grammar-checker-tools\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">checked your grammar<\/a> and SEO, you can lose out on traffic to your products and sales.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/selling-on-amazon-product-description.jpg\" alt=\"product description image\" width=\"824\" height=\"516\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>Now, go\u00a0make money by selling on Amazon!<\/h2>\n<p>Making a profit by selling on Amazon is possible if you think smart, implement a well-planned strategy, and effectively market your business.<\/p>\n<p>Identify your process, (whether you\u2019re shipping products yourself or using FBA), engage in Amazon SEO, optimize your product pages, market your brand effectively, and price your items to sell.<\/p>\n<p>Because remember, even if you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, you can join \u2019em\u2014and make $1,000 each month selling on \u2019em if you follow these steps.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Selling on Amazon is a powerful way to sell more products and grow your ecommerce business.
