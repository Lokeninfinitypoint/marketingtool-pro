If people called your phone number or mailed in a check after seeing your print ad, it was to purchase your product.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s no longer the case.<\/p>\n<p>Today, on the internet, an ad can have a click-through rate of 100%, but not earn your business a cent of revenue. Yet, the advertisement is still treated as THE most important element of the advertising campaign, even though it\u2019s not what gets users to buy, sign up, download, or call anymore.<\/p>\n<p>Now, what drives action is load times, landing pages, and everything that happens <em>after<\/em> an ad is clicked. Online, that\u2019s known as the <a href=\"https:\/\/instapage.com\/blog\/post-click-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post-click experience<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">The pre-click vs. the post-click experience<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Before the internet, there was only the ad and the conversion. But the click has changed all that. Online, prospects take action by clicking an ad, and then they take action again by choosing to claim or not claim an offer.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, we can divide the user experience into two parts as it relates to a marketing campaign. Everything before the click, and everything after:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The pre-click experience:<\/strong> The user experience before the click. Affecting the pre-click experience are things like where your ad is shown, how it\u2019s presented, its colors, headlines, value proposition, etc.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The post-click experience:<\/strong> This is everything after the click. Affecting the post-click experience are things like visual hierarchy, conversion ratio, retargeting, and message match.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Like a headline is only good if it gets people to read the copy, an ad is only good if it gets people to click and visit the landing page. And a landing page is only effective if it gets visitors to convert.<\/p>\n<p>Advertisers are familiar with a lot of the things that make a good pre-click experience, but elements affecting the post-click experience may seem a little more foreign. And you can\u2019t fix what you don\u2019t know is broken\u2026<\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">4 elements every advertiser should know for post-click optimization<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s an unfortunate truth that most ad dollars are wasted. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/29\/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks\">average Google AdWords click-through rate<\/a> is only 3.17% across all industries, and on the display network it\u2019s an embarrassing 0.63%:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6baea6d9-fc8d-4a6e-9932-2304d23140c3\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-advertising-benchmarks-average-ctr.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"983\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>That means, on average, out of every 100 people who see your ad, 96-99 of them are not clicking it. And what\u2019s worse \u2014 when they DO click it, only between 0.77% and 3.75% of them convert.<\/p>\n<p>To boost that conversion rate, here are a few elements every advertiser should know to <a href=\"https:\/\/instapage.com\/blog\/post-click-optimization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">optimize the post-click experience: <\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Message match<\/h3>\n<p>Publishing an ad is like making a promise. It says to the viewers, \u201chere\u2019s what we have to offer.\u201d The last part of the promise is fulfilled when they claim your offer and determine if it was as advertised.<\/p>\n<p>But before they even get there, the landing page has to fulfill the promise of the ad by letting visitors know they\u2019re in the right place.<\/p>\n<p>That can be accomplished with a headline, colors, and images that are identical to the advertisement. Your visitors won\u2019t bother to evaluate your copy or even glance at your form if they think you\u2019ve pulled the old bait and switch trick with your ad and landing page.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a great example of message match from <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLPaidFacebookHowtoCompeteInAdWords.html\">WordStream<\/a>. Here\u2019s the ad:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d1bc9399-87ba-4b7e-8123-53c3f65937fc\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/post-click-optimization-wordstream.png\" alt=\"post-click optimization examples\" width=\"361\" height=\"297\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>And the corresponding landing page:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"b834a1e5-5e7c-4b6e-b1ce-8a895fb7e5a9\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/post-click-optimized-landing-page-ws.jpg\" alt=\"post-click ux landing pages\" width=\"700\" height=\"671\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>No navigation<\/h3>\n<p>On your website, navigation links help visitors move between pages to learn more about you. On your landing page, though, they\u2019re holes that let visitors escape. And those holes are killing your conversion rate.<\/p>\n<p>You should think as every link outside of your call-to-action button as a distraction, and you should eliminate as many as possible. The ideal conversion ratio (ratio of links to conversion goals) on a landing page is 1:1. Terms of service and privacy policies can be tucked into the footer, but they shouldn\u2019t distract the visitors from the CTA button. Here\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/offers.adobe.com\/en\/uk\/marketing\/landings\/econsultancy_the_multichannel_reality.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an example from Adobe<\/a>:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"9d0dec49-9ea5-4353-a1f7-b0313da6cb62\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adobe-landing-page-post-click-experience.jpg\" alt=\"optimizing the post click experience\" width=\"700\" height=\"574\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Visual hierarchy<\/h3>\n<p>Theories of attention state that we don\u2019t perceive everything equally. It was proposed in Germany over 100 years ago by three psychologists who concluded that \u201cthe whole is other than the sum of its parts.\u201d As in, when you\u2019re crossing the street, you don\u2019t notice birds flying overhead because you\u2019re focused on getting to the opposite curb safely. In that scenario, cars are more important to attend to than birds, because cars directly threaten your well-being.<\/p>\n<p>In most everyday situations when our safety isn\u2019t at risk, there are certain cues that jerk our attention around. Things that are bigger, higher, move faster, contrast their surroundings \u2014 these are a few of those visual cues.<\/p>\n<p>On your landing page, you can use this theory to guide visitors to your most important elements. Here\u2019s how:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Higher = more important than things that are lower.<\/strong> Your headline should be higher than your body copy. Your body copy should be higher than your form. Before they can convert, they have to know why.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bold, italics = more important than letters which aren\u2019t bold or italicized.<\/strong> These should be things like your headline, benefits, or words like \u201cfree,\u201d \u201climited-time offer\u201d or \u201cwhile supplies last&#8230;\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>High contrast = more important than things with low contrast.<\/strong> When you\u2019re creating your landing page, you have to be mindful of the colors you\u2019re using because the most important elements have to stand out on your page. The 60-30-10 rule is great to follow in this instance. It says 60% of your page should be your base, then 30% should be your background, and 10% should be your accent. That accent should be things like your logo, your CTA button, and maybe your form. Your visitors shouldn\u2019t have to hunt to find out where to convert.<\/li>\n<li><strong>White space = things with more space around them are important enough to own their own section of a page.<\/strong> This is a great way to draw attention to badges and testimonials, and your CTA button in particular. Your button shouldn\u2019t be surrounded by clutter. It should be all alone, easy to find.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bulleted = more important than things which aren\u2019t bulleted.<\/strong> Bullets are best used when listing benefits.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Research has shown that both on and off the internet, people skim when they\u2019re not pleasure reading. Using these cues to guide their eyes instead of letting them skim block text can be effective in getting them to evaluate your offer completely.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an <a href=\"https:\/\/get.simplymeasured.com\/2016-07-19-Social-Decisions-Faster.html#sm.00004ufl3c19ibe25rt9q6rf7io2p\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">example from Simply Measured<\/a> that guides the visitor to the CTA button logically and effectively:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1586c76d-337f-42fa-a1cc-fd4279109152\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/simply-measured-post-click-ux.jpg\" alt=\"post click ux\" width=\"700\" height=\"782\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Good \u201cthank you\u201d page<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to treat the \u201cthank you\u201d page as an afterthought. You\u2019ve already got their email address, their credit card number \u2014 so who cares what\u2019s on the next page, right?<\/p>\n<p>Wrong.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/03\/thank-you-pages\">The \u201cthank you\u201d page<\/a> is probably the most underrated and underused landing page type there is.<\/p>\n<p>To your new leads, the \u201cthank you\u201d page can be viewed as a test \u2014 how you\u2019re going to treat them once they\u2019re a customer. Are you truly grateful to have their business? Are you going to treat them like they\u2019re more than the contents of their wallet?<\/p>\n<p>When a \u201cthank you\u201d page is a big blank page that simply says \u201cthank you\u201d on it, you\u2019ve failed the test. Your new lead thinks, \u201cthey got what they want.\u201d And now they\u2019re a little more skeptical when your emails show up in their inbox. Here\u2019s what a good \u201cthank you\u201d page does:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>First, it shows sincere gratitude<\/strong> \u2014 as it should. These new leads, customers, are the reason your business is growing. It\u2019s nothing without them, so act like it by making sure your \u201cthank you\u201d is unique, personal, grateful, and complimentary as you can.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Second, it should let new leads know how when and where they\u2019ll get their new resource.<\/strong> Will it come in their inbox later today? Will it download to their computer immediately? They should know so there\u2019s no confusion, and they should also be given a way to contact you in case the asset never gets there.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Lastly, it should offer additional, relevant content.<\/strong> If your lead just downloaded a book on email marketing tactics, the \u201cthank you\u201d page should direct them to more resources on email marketing. And a great way to find out where your visitor is in the marketing funnel is to offer them different types of content. Offer a tip sheet on subject lines and a case study on how one business used your tool to grow their subscriber list by 100,000. They may be closer to purchase than you think.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Most \u201cthank you\u201d pages leave much to be desired. But that\u2019s good news for you, because creating a great one is an easy way to stand out.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example of a \u201cthank you\u201d page that nails all three points, from <a href=\"https:\/\/offers.impactbnd.com\/blog-subscribe-thanks?submissionGuid=0ecc3145-eab7-4af3-99f3-6e128b2391e4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IMPACT Branding &amp; Design<\/a>:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"de69690c-bb98-4c42-914c-41432fdfff97\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/impact-thank-you-page-post-click.jpg\" alt=\"thank you page optimization\" width=\"704\" height=\"546\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Post-click optimization is a win-win <\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Today, most sales aren\u2019t made with ads.
