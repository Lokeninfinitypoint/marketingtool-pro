For example, if your business really is the only dedicated supplier of lion-taming equipment in North America, this will be your USP. Sure, there are plenty of companies that sell general circus equipment, but <em>your <\/em>business focuses solely on high-end accessories for the discerning big cat behavioral performance artist \u2013 this is what sets you apart from the rest of the clowns.<\/p>\n<p>However, for most businesses, identifying a unique selling prop is not this easy. In fact, for more conventional companies, it can be very difficult. Fortunately, there are a number of ways you can make a name for yourself, even if you make or sell a common product or service. Let\u2019s look at some unique selling proposition examples.<\/p>\n<h2>Unique Selling Proposition Examples: What Makes a Strong USP?<a id=\"examples\"><\/a><\/h2>\n<p>The best USPs directly address a specific need experienced by a company\u2019s ideal customer. A great unique selling prop, sometimes known as a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\">value proposition<\/a>, should also emphasize what individual quality separates a business from its competition.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some examples of unique selling propositions that work.<\/p>\n<h3>Vistaprint&#8217;s Unique Selling Proposition: Fast, Cheap Printing for Growing Businesses on a Budget<\/h3>\n<p>Small, growing businesses and solo entrepreneurs have to-do lists a million items long, and one of those items is the need for business cards. You might also need signage for your physical business or delivery vehicles, branded swag to raise brand awareness as you make the conference rounds, labels and stickers, brochures &#8230; you get the idea. So where do you turn?<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"align-center\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/usp-example-vistaprint-1.png\" alt=\"unique selling prop examples\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vistaprint.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vistaprint <\/a>is a one-stop shop for online printing: You can order everything you need online and get it shipped fast. It&#8217;s easy and affordable and completely engineered with small businesses in mind. What&#8217;s not to like?<\/p>\n<h3>Saddleback Leather&#8217;s Unique Selling Proposition: Rugged Leather Goods with a 100-Year Warranty<\/h3>\n<p>Credit where credit is due \u2013 if it hadn\u2019t been for the guys over at <a href=\"http:\/\/fizzle.co\/\">Fizzle<\/a>, I might have gone the rest of my life without discovering <a href=\"http:\/\/www.saddlebackleather.com\/\">Saddleback Leather<\/a>. This company\u2019s USP (and website in general) perfectly exemplifies how it addresses customers\u2019 specific needs <em>and<\/em> highlights a truly unique quality of its products.<\/p>\n<p>Now, you might think that finding a unique \u2013 and memorable \u2013 USP for a leather satchel company would be difficult. However, take a look at Saddleback\u2019s 10-part\u00a0 \u201cAbout Us\u201d page.<br \/>\nAmateur bullfighting. Escaping from a corrupt Mexican Federal Police officer. Trading puppies for 100 tacos in Juarez \u2013 Saddleback\u2019s \u201cAbout Us\u201d page reads like a pilot for a new AMC show. This ties in perfectly with the rugged, adventurous aesthetic of the company\u2019s products.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/unique-selling-proposition-saddleback.png\" alt=\"unique selling proposition examples - saddleback leather's about us page\" width=\"500\" height=\"510\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-59297\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/unique-selling-proposition-saddleback.png 500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/unique-selling-proposition-saddleback-480x490.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As if that weren\u2019t enough, Saddleback also offers a 100-year(!) warranty, which the firm half-jokingly refers to as its \u201cThey\u2019ll Fight Over It When You\u2019re Dead\u201d warranty. How many companies remind you to mention a product warranty in your will? Not only does this make a bold statement about the company\u2019s confidence in the craftsmanship of its products, it also appeals to its ideal customer \u2013 daring, thrill-seeking travelers who need bags that can survive their globe-trotting adventures.<\/p>\n<p>Seriously, just writing about these bags makes me want to buy one. Genius.<\/p>\n<h3>Voodoo Doughnut&#8217;s Unique Selling Proposition: Donuts So Wacky, the Wait Is Part of the Experience<\/h3>\n<p>Donut shops are ten a penny \u2013 especially here in Boston, where you can trip on a curb and practically fall into a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts \u2013 but Voodoo Doughnut in Portland, Oregon, manages to make traditional baked goods sexy in a highly distinctive way.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/voodoo-doughnut-unique-selling-proposition-1.jpg\" width=\"934\" height=\"934\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Although virtually everything about Voodoo is unique, <a href=\"http:\/\/voodoodoughnut.com\/doughnuts.php\">its extensive range of donuts<\/a> (and the obvious relish with which the owners devise their sugary creations) set it apart from any other donut shop. In their quest to create a truly unique menu, Voodoo\u2019s owners even fell afoul of the FDA after experimenting with two particular recipes that included Pepto-Bismol and NyQuil \u2013 stunts that could have threatened their business, but ultimately helped word of the small donut shop go <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/01\/15\/viral-content-marketing-tips\">viral<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>A diverse menu isn\u2019t the only thing that makes Voodoo unique. Its hot pink rockabilly d\u00e9cor, cash-only policy and late-night opening hours have made Voodoo far more than just a donut shop \u2013 it\u2019s a tourist attraction. Sure, you can get a donut almost anywhere, but Voodoo\u2019s USP is the diversity of its menu <em>and<\/em> the experience of waiting in line for a decadent taste of what lies within.<\/p>\n<p>The popularity (and notoriety) of the store has even allowed the owners to open a second branch in Denver, and additional stores are planned for other locations across the country. Voodoo\u2019s USP gets people talking in a way that few <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/04\/25\/social-media-roi\">social media marketing<\/a> campaigns could ever hope to accomplish.<\/p>\n<h3>Osmium&#8217;s Unique Selling Proposition: All Hand-Made and All Local<\/h3>\n<p>The clothing and fashion industries are savagely competitive, and finding a unique selling proposition in this market is far from easy \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean it has to be complicated, either. This is exemplified excellently by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.osmium.com\/\">Osmium<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/osmium-about-us-1.jpg\" width=\"1084\" height=\"533\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The phenomenal rise in popularity of handmade goods in recent years has transformed traditional arts and crafts from a casual pastime into big business, thanks in large part to the success of online handmade marketplace Etsy. However, clothing remains one area in which mass-produced goods are still very much the norm, due to the substantially cheaper materials and overseas labor utilized by most chain retailers. This is how the simplicity of Osmium\u2019s USP helps the small company shine.<\/p>\n<p>Every single garment sold by Osmium is made by hand, with the majority of the company\u2019s inventory being made right here in Boston. The company places emphasis on its <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/20\/ethical-marketing\">ethical<\/a> production processes and the durability of its products, both of which differ starkly from most conventional clothing manufacturers.<\/p>\n<h2>Unique Selling Proposition Best Practices<a id=\"best-practices\"><\/a><\/h2>\n<p>So, now we\u2019ve seen some strong unique selling proposition examples, what should you bear in mind when trying to create your own USP?<\/p>\n<h3>Get Inside Your Ideal Customer\u2019s Head<\/h3>\n<p>Before you start thinking about which qualities set your business apart from similar companies, you need to know almost everything about your perfect customer.<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re identifying your ideal prospect, consider the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What does your perfect customer <em>really<\/em> want?<\/li>\n<li>How can your product or service solve their problem(s)?<\/li>\n<li>What factors motivate their buying decisions?<\/li>\n<li>Why do your existing customers choose your business over your competitors?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Remember \u2013 it\u2019s not enough to merely target a rough demographic. You need to know <em>exactly<\/em> who you want to sell to and why. Once you know this, you can get to work on the next unique selling proposition best practice, which is\u2026<\/p>\n<h3>Explain How Your Business Solves Your Ideal Customers\u2019 Problems<\/h3>\n<p>Consumers don\u2019t want to buy products \u2013 they want to solve their problems. This could be as simple as purchasing a reliable set of tools that will last for years, but it can (and frequently is) much more complex.<\/p>\n<p>Take the cosmetics industry, for example. Companies in this space don\u2019t just sell make-up \u2013 they sell lifestyle ideals; glamour, confidence, and style. Think about this in a problem-solving context; people who may not feel glamorous, confident or stylish <em>will<\/em> if they use a particular product. This lies at the heart of most cosmetics advertising, and this concept applies to many other industries, too.<\/p>\n<p>To create a strong USP, you have to examine the profile of your perfect customer and then market your products in a way that shows them you can meet their needs and solve their problems. You can&#8217;t hope to write persuasive, compelling copy in the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/11\/voice-of-the-customer\">voice of the customer<\/a> unless you know who they are. If your prospective customers choose your products, how will their lives be improved? What makes your business so different that prospective customers should choose your products or services? The answers to these questions should form the bedrock of your USP.<\/p>\n<h3>Make Your Business Irresistible to Your Customers<\/h3>\n<p>Now that you know who your ideal customer is and the problems they face, it\u2019s time to tell them precisely why they should choose your business over your competitors.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/fedex-usp-1.jpg\" width=\"955\" height=\"513\" \/><\/div>\n<p>FedEx is the perfect example of this principle. Sure, there are dozens of package carriers people can choose from (including the USPS), but FedEx\u2019s slogan of \u201cWhen it absolutely, positively has to be there overnight\u201d transformed the company from just another logistics company to a market-leading global brand. Even though the company dropped the slogan years ago, FedEx\u2019s USP and branding helped it become a proprietary eponym \u2013 a trademarked name often used as a generic term, like Kleenex, Band-Aid and Coke.<\/p>\n<p>Another USP best practice you should think about in this stage is making your customers a promise. FedEx, for example, guarantees it can get any package (from anywhere) to its destination overnight. This not only addresses customers\u2019 specific need (reliable package delivery), but also makes them a promise \u2013 to deliver their packages with care, on time, every time.<\/p>\n<h3>Create an Elevator Pitch<\/h3>\n<p>So, you\u2019ve figured out who your perfect customer is, explained how your business can solve their problems, and told them why they should choose you instead of the competition. However, you\u2019ll rarely have the opportunity to wax lyrical about any of this at length. Just as advertisements have mere seconds to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/10\/08\/funny-ads\">capture consumers\u2019 attention<\/a>, your USP should be almost immediately obvious.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/elevator-pitch-grumpy-cat-1.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Thinking of your USP in terms of an elevator pitch is a great way to condense what makes your business different, and how you can use it as the foundation of your marketing efforts.<\/p>\n<p>Not sure where to even start? Don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ve got <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/16\/elevator-pitch-examples-templates\">13 awesome elevator pitch examples and templates<\/a> to help you out.<\/p>\n<h3>A Unique Selling Proposition Template<\/h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s see how this works, using our lion-taming equipment supply business as an example. Note that everything in brackets can be changed to suit the specifics of your company, and that this framework can apply to both companies and individual products.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For [lion tamers]<\/li>\n<li>Who [need high-quality lion-taming equipment]<\/li>\n<li>[Lucky Leo\u2019s Lion-Taming Emporium]<\/li>\n<li>Is [the world\u2019s only dedicated online lion-taming equipment distributor]<\/li>\n<li>That [provides the very best lion-taming equipment, delivered straight to your door].<\/li>\n<li>Unlike [other circus equipment supply companies],<\/li>\n<li>[Lucky Leo\u2019s Lion-Taming Emporium] is [the only e-commerce business in North America that caters specifically to these performers].<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>See how easy it is once you have all the pieces of the puzzle? If someone asks about your business, you can use this as a snappy, concise way to explain what your company does. Thinking of your business or products in this way allows you to focus on what really matters \u2013 your ideal customer \u2013 and identify any glaring problems with your USP.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Use Your Unique Selling Proposition in Advertising<a id=\"ppc-ads\"><\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Now you\u2019ve nailed down your USP and condensed it into an elevator pitch-style summary, how can you use it in your PPC advertisements? By applying everything above to the principles of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/08\/15\/ad-copywriting-tips\">writing killer ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s <strong>essential<\/strong> that your USP is highlighted in your ad copy. Preferably, it should be in the headline or first line of your ad. If you choose to feature your USP in the headline, make sure it\u2019s keyword-rich. Alternatively, if you include elsewhere in your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/03\/20\/improving-adwords-ctr\">ad copy<\/a>, make sure it emphasizes the benefits of using your product or service. Many advertisers can\u2019t resist the temptation to rave about product features before moving onto the benefits to their customers, but this is a rookie mistake. By emphasizing the benefits of your service, you\u2019re placing greater value on the emotional payoff and appealing to your prospects\u2019 desire to solve their problems.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/unique-selling-prop-ppc-ad-1.jpg\" width=\"279\" height=\"108\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Safety was the primary benefit in this ad, but what about choice or specialized knowledge? You could create other ads that emphasize the diversity of your inventory or the specialized knowledge of your staff across both lines of copy in your ad:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/usp-in-ppc-ads-1.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"128\" \/><\/div>\n<p>However you choose to incorporate your USP into your PPC ads, be sure to target one highly specific need per ad. Trying to solve all your prospects\u2019 problems in a single ad will dilute its strength and result in lower <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/17\/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate\">conversions<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Use Your Unique Selling Proposition on Your Landing Pages<a id=\"landing-pages\"><\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Now that you\u2019ve written a series of compelling PPC ads highlighting your USP and its benefit to your ideal customer, it\u2019s time to turn your attention to your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/19\/landing-page-tool\">highly optimized landing pages<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s use the first ad above as an example. Creating a dedicated landing page for this ad could focus on the USP in several ways and reinforce the benefits of ordering from Lucky Leo\u2019s. How?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your landing page copy could begin by reinforcing the inherent dangers faced by lion tamers, and how these risks are increased by using poor-quality equipment.<\/li>\n<li>You could then highlight the quality and craftsmanship of your products \u2013 and the fact that Lucky Leo\u2019s is the <strong>only<\/strong> specialized lion-taming equipment distributor in North America \u2013 before\u2026<\/li>\n<li>Including a strong call to action and providing more information about your home delivery services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It almost goes without saying, but you should <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/12\/great-landing-pages\">make landing pages<\/a> for each of your ads.
