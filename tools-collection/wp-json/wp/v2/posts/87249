The only difference is if there\u2019s no machine learning adjustment for your bid depending on the likelihood of a conversion.<\/p>\n<p>My guess is that anyone using enhanced CPC is likely already familiar with manual CPC because they are so similar. For manual CPC you set your bid, Google then enters you into the auction with a maximum bid of the amount you set, and then depending on the combination of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/14\/how-does-google-ads-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">your bid and ad rank<\/a>, you\u2019ll potentially earn a spot on the SERP.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/google-ads-enhanced-cpc-bid-keyword.webp\" alt=\"google ads enhanced cpc - example keyword \" width=\"751\" height=\"344\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87270 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/google-ads-enhanced-cpc-bid-keyword.webp 751w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/google-ads-enhanced-cpc-bid-keyword-480x220.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 751px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As this transition is taking place, if you are using enhanced CPC and do nothing to your campaign, it will automatically default back to manual CPC in March 2025. For the most part, things will be the same for you as they were with enhanced CPC. You\u2019ll need to regularly review performance and make adjustments based on the metrics to try and improve your campaign results.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on how much volume of clicks and conversions your campaigns have, it may make sense for you to adjust this twice a week, once a week, every couple of weeks, or maybe even longer. More often than not, for my clients, I try to adjust once a week or once every two weeks using only the latest data to make sure things are moving in the right direction.<\/p>\n<p>With manual CPC you have full control. Google will not interfere with or adjust your bids.<\/p>\n<h4>Maximize clicks<\/h4>\n<p>Maximize clicks is the second bidding strategy you can use to focus on a click activity in Google Ads, but unlike manual CPC, this strategy is entirely automated by Google.<\/p>\n<p>With maximize clicks, Google will try and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/21\/how-much-does-adwords-cost\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spend your entire daily budget<\/a> every single day while getting as many as possible for your budget. A kind interpretation of that strategy is that Google will try and get you lots of clicks at a low cost per click to get you as much volume as it can.<\/p>\n<p>But a less friendly interpretation is that even if click costs are very high on a certain day for your<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/keyword-prioritization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> keywords<\/a>, Google will still try to bid to get as many clicks as possible and spend your entire daily budget, even though it\u2019s a less efficient day.<\/p>\n<p>Maximize clicks does allow you to have a bid limit for the campaign. If for some reason you know you don\u2019t want to bid over five dollars for a certain campaign, all you have to do is set that as a max bid limit and Google will bid anywhere below and up to that $5 limit while still trying to spend your entire daily budget every day at that bid.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/google-ads-ecpc-going-away-max-clicks-screenshot.webp\" alt=\"enhanced cpc - max clicks bid strategy example \" width=\"709\" height=\"353\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87271 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/google-ads-ecpc-going-away-max-clicks-screenshot.webp 709w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/google-ads-ecpc-going-away-max-clicks-screenshot-480x239.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 709px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Maximize clicks does not pay attention to anything that has to do with conversion performance. It\u2019s only trying to get as many clicks as possible and spend your entire budget.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a performance marketer trying to optimize for your conversion or conversion value metrics, which you likely are if you\u2019ve opted into enhanced CPC, maximize clicks might not be the right fit for you even though it\u2019s the only other strategy that focuses on clicks.<\/p>\n<h3>Optimizing for conversions<\/h3>\n<p>The next two strategies focused on conversion performance and may be a better fit for users who were optimizing using enhanced CPC since they also take conversion performance into account.<\/p>\n<h4>Maximize conversions<\/h4>\n<p>The maximize conversion bid strategy is similar to the maximize clicks strategy in that it does try to spend your entire ad budget every single day, but rather than trying to get as many clicks as possible, Google will try to get as many conversions as possible for that same budget. As a performance marketer, I prefer a conversion-focused strategy over a click-focused strategy because that\u2019s where businesses can actually make progress and move forward with their customers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/google-ads-ecpc-maximize-conversions.webp\" alt=\"enhanced cpc - maximize conversions\" width=\"664\" height=\"323\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87264 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/google-ads-ecpc-maximize-conversions.webp 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/google-ads-ecpc-maximize-conversions-480x233.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Maximize conversions is also similar to maximize clicks in that Google lets you add a target cost per action. The difference is that rather than being a maximum, this lets you tell Google what you want your average cost per conversion to be. Over time, individual conversions may be at a higher level than your target CPA and others will likely be lower, but on average, Google is trying to get you as many conversions as it possibly can at your target CPA. This is also one of the bid strategies where Google will actually throttle spending, meaning it will likely pull back on spending if it\u2019s not consistently hitting the target CPA. From the advertiser perspective, you\u2019ll keep spending and converting at a reasonable rate if Google can hit your target CPA, but if it can\u2019t it\u2019ll save you money by pulling back until it finds ways to be more efficient and hit your target.<\/p>\n<p><strong>For advertisers currently using enhanced CPC, maximize conversions, especially with a target CPA included, is a strong option for replacement.<\/strong> You\u2019ll be able to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/04\/google-ads-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lean into Google\u2019s machine learning<\/a> to help optimize conversion performance, but you won\u2019t have to make granular CPC changes on a regular basis to try and hit those stats.<\/p>\n<h4>Maximize conversion value<\/h4>\n<p>Maximize conversion value is the other conversion-focused strategy, and again most things are very similar to the maximize conversion strategy, but rather than trying to get you a higher number of conversions, Google is going to optimize to get you more conversion value or more revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Just like a few others, when you\u2019re using only maximize conversion value, this strategy will continue to try and spend your entire daily budget every single day.<\/p>\n<p>However, you can also add a target return on ad spend (target ROAS) to tell Google what level of performance you want to see from that campaign. Again, some individual sales will have a higher ROAS and others will have a lower ROAS, but over time if you have enough conversion volume and realistic ROAS goals, the campaigns will likely end up performing pretty close to the target you set.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/google-ads-ecpc-max-conversion-value.webp\" alt=\"enhanced cpc - max conversion value screenshot\" width=\"664\" height=\"324\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87273 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/google-ads-ecpc-max-conversion-value.webp 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/google-ads-ecpc-max-conversion-value-480x234.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For businesses using enhanced CPC that focus on revenue rather than number of conversions, I believe target ROAS is a great option for you to test for all the same reasons target CPA is for those focusing on conversions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your campaigns will optimize to the profitability metrics you set.<\/li>\n<li>Google will throttle spending if you\u2019re not hitting targets and spend as much as possible if you are.<\/li>\n<li>You avoid needing to review keyword-level bids on a regular basis, instead letting Google make those adjustments in real time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"enhanced-cpc-tips\"><\/div>\n<h2>Tips for Google Ads bidding without using enhanced CPC<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re using enhanced CPC bidding because you\u2019re focusing on conversions but still want some control, my recommendation would be to test out maximize conversions with a target CPA or maximize conversion value with a target ROAS as those are the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/15\/smart-bidding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> smart bidding strategies<\/a> that will optimize conversion, but also allow you to control the metrics that you want to see as the end results. In some instances, your performance metrics like CPA and ROAS might look similar to your enhanced CPC campaigns, but your CPCs may look drastically different than they did when you were using enhanced CPC.<\/p>\n<p>In my experience, and what I\u2019ve heard is the experience of many other advertisers, although the CPCs are higher for automated bidding strategies, the resulting CPA or ROAS are comparable because of the machine learning on the back end.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re using enhanced CPC and are interested in testing one of these conversion bidding strategies, or honestly, any of the other bidding strategies, then my suggestion for you would be to set up a campaign experiment in Google Ads and see what performs best.<\/p>\n<p>If your campaign can still retain enhanced CPC from the time between October and March, maybe leave ECPC in place in your control campaign and run experiments with other bidding strategies to see how they perform.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/google-ads-enhanced-cpc-going-away-campaign-strategy.webp\" alt=\"google ads enhanced cpc - campaign experiment\" width=\"753\" height=\"229\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87268 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/google-ads-enhanced-cpc-going-away-campaign-strategy.webp 753w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/google-ads-enhanced-cpc-going-away-campaign-strategy-480x146.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 753px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But if you\u2019re reading this article after March 2025 or if your account will no longer let you opt into ECPC, then it might make sense for you to test manual CPC against any of the other bidding strategies that you think might be a good fit for your campaign. Manual CPC is the closest thing we have to enhanced CPC, so you\u2019ll be able to control performance as close as possible to your existing campaign. You can use the experiment campaign to test a new strategy and see if machine learning can do a better job or if you need to retain Manual CPC and just accept the fact that you\u2019ll no longer have automated adjustments to your bids depending on the likelihood of conversion.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/google-ads-ecpc-example-campaign-experiment.webp\" alt=\"google ads enhanced cpc - example campaign experiment \" width=\"829\" height=\"262\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87267 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/google-ads-ecpc-example-campaign-experiment.webp 829w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/google-ads-ecpc-example-campaign-experiment-480x152.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 829px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Say goodbye to enhanced CPC and hello to new bid strategy testing opportunities<\/h2>\n<p>As a marketer who\u2019s been in the space for 15 years now, I\u2019m definitely bummed to see that enhanced CPC is going away. If I ever use manual bidding, I always opt into ECPC because it has performed pretty well in the majority of my accounts. Although we\u2019re retaining the Manual CPC strategy, it still feels like the writing is on the wall. We\u2019re continuing to shift further and further into Google\u2019s fully automated bidding hands and away from more advertiser control. That said, you will likely see very strong performance from automated bidding as long as you have your conversion tracking set up properly and your feeding data back into the system on a regular basis get more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/2024-google-ads-news\">Google Ads updates<\/a> here).<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully, this rundown gives you an understanding of how this transition away from ECPC will take place and what you\u2019ll be able to do in your account moving forward.
