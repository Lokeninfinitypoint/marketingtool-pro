So in this post, I&#8217;m going to share eight tips and resources to help minority businesses succeed.<\/p>\n<h2>Tips for minority-owned businesses<\/h2>\n<p>Read on for a mix of info and inspo! If you&#8217;re not a minority business owner, share this post with someone who is!<\/p>\n<h3>1. Get certified as a minority-owned business (MBE)<\/h3>\n<p>Obtaining an official certification as a minority business enterprise (MBE) gives you access to lots of different advantageous resources: client databases, increased business partnership opportunities, training and management workshops, networking events, and lots more.<\/p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uschamber.com\/co\/run\/business-financing\/certification-guide-for-minority-owned-business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">US Chamber of Commerce<\/a>, there are a few ways to get certified:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>NMSDC certification:<\/strong> National Minority Supplier Development Council, Click here for the <a href=\"https:\/\/nmsdc.org\/mbes\/mbe-certification\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">certification process<\/a>. After verifying your eligibility, all you\u2019ll need to do is gather up the necessary documents, complete the online application, pay the fee, and wait for the final approval.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/mbe-certificate-example.jpeg\" alt=\"minority owned business certificate\" width=\"720\" height=\"490\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-60119\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/mbe-certificate-example.jpeg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/mbe-certificate-example-480x327.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Federal certification:<\/strong> SBA\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/federal-contracting\/contracting-assistance-programs\/8a-business-development-program#section-header-0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">8(a) Business Development Program<\/a> is for socially and economically disadvantaged people who either have or want to start their own business. A robust nine-year program, participants receive benefits like training, technical assistance, contractual help, and much more. Here are the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/federal-contracting\/contracting-assistance-programs\/8a-business-development-program#section-header-0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eligibility requirements and application process steps<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>State\/city certification:<\/strong> Some regions and cities grant their own assistance for minority-owned businesses. To check out opportunities in your area, do a quick Google search to explore all the opportunities in your area.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>2. Apply for minority business grants and loans<\/h3>\n<p>Starting and growing a business is certainly a pocket-bender, but there are small and minority-owned business grants and loans to help.<\/p>\n<p>Each grant or loan will have its own eligibility requirements based on employee count, gross annual revenue, and more. You can use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/advisor\/business-loans\/small-business-grants-for-minorities\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Forbes&#8217; full list of small business grants for minorities here<\/a>. If you qualify, go ahead and start the application process. After all, even the smallest amount helps!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/asian-women-giving-circle-minority-owned-business-grants.png\" alt=\"asian women giving circle homepage\" width=\"609\" height=\"646\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-60118\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/asian-women-giving-circle-minority-owned-business-grants.png 609w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/asian-women-giving-circle-minority-owned-business-grants-480x509.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 609px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>3. Embrace your minority experience<\/h3>\n<p>This one may sound a little clich\u00e9 (it totally is), but it\u2019s important. No matter your race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation, embrace your identity and incorporate it into the pride and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/23\/how-brand-your-business\">branding foundation<\/a> of your business.<\/p>\n<p>Rihanna is just one example of a minority business owner who is constantly uplaying her authentic Caribbean roots and staying true to her message of diversity and inclusion. But you don&#8217;t have to be a celebrity to embrace the minority experience.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/minority-owned-buisness-instagram.png\" alt=\"tips for minority-owned businesses - instagram post embracing minority experience\" width=\"720\" height=\"417\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-60120\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/minority-owned-buisness-instagram.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/minority-owned-buisness-instagram-480x278.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>4. Expand into other languages<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s no doubt that most people in the U.S. speak English fluently, but as the world becomes more globalized, you\u2019ll be surprised by how helpful linguistic diversity can be.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you are a LatinX-owned business, go ahead and invest in English and Spanish translation services for your website and social accounts. Not only can you expand your audience, but you\u2019re supporting the minority community by making it easier for them to discover, learn about, and access your brand.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure that they can connect with every piece of marketing you put out there. After all, the goal is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/05\/accessibility-inclusivity-advertising\">inclusivity<\/a>, not exclusivity.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/languages-spoken-in-us.jpeg\" alt=\"minority languages spoken in the US\" width=\"720\" height=\"360\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-60129\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/languages-spoken-in-us.jpeg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/languages-spoken-in-us-480x240.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>5. Follow minority influencers on social media<\/h3>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re looking for inspiring quotes or practical tips, there are plenty of minority entrepreneur influencers out there that can give you your daily dose.<\/p>\n<p>Whether it\u2019s lifestyle influencer Nabela Noor all the way to \u201cThe Glow Up\u201d founders Shannae Ingleton-Smith and Tania Cascilla, there are so many minority success stories that you can learn from.<\/p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t matter what industry you are trying to dominate. It doesn\u2019t matter what specific goals you want to achieve. Sometimes, learning from others can be the best way to cut through the red tape of business and get right to the success you\u2019re looking for.<\/p>\n<p>Manifest victory by having it show up on your social feed every single day!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/minority-entrepreneur-influencer-bio.png\" alt=\"instagram bio of a minority entrepreneur influencer\" width=\"720\" height=\"330\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-60126\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/minority-entrepreneur-influencer-bio.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/minority-entrepreneur-influencer-bio-480x220.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/susanne.mariga\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Susanne Mariga<\/a> is just one of the many minority entrepreneur influencers out there.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>6. Diversify your team<\/h3>\n<p>The minorities that make up an MBE doesn&#8217;t need to all have the same background. In fact, it&#8217;s best to surround yourself with hard-working, dedicated, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/28\/diversity-in-marketing\">diverse<\/a> employees that come from all different kinds of ideologies, goals, and values on diversity and inclusion.<\/p>\n<p>This is a great way to strengthen the minority community as a whole, not to mention strengthen your brand integrity.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Use minority-owned labels and badges<\/h3>\n<p>Platforms like Google Shopping, Instagram, and Facebook offer ways for minority-owned businesses to declare themselves as such.
