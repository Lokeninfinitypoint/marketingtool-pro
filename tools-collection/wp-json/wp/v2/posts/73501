The executive summary isn\u2019t just a teaser. It should be a condensed and skimmable version of everything you\u2019ve provided in the full document.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll place the summary at the beginning of your business plan. That way, a reader can learn what they need to know upfront, without wading through the entire plan. A version of your summary may also be useful as the copy on your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/27\/guide-to-about-us-pages\">\u201cAbout Us\u201d page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>At a very high level, an executive summary for a business plan should do three things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Present the problem<\/strong>: A quick explanation of the problem you aim to solve.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Suggest the solution and its costs<\/strong>: An overview of your proposed solution and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\"> value proposition<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Explain the benefits<\/strong> A summary of the benefits to clients and investors.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To accomplish these goals, your executive summary should follow the same structure as your business plan and cover all of the same topics. In fact, you should assume some readers will make their decision based only on your summary without ever reading the full plan.<\/p>\n<div id=\"purpose\"><\/div>\n<h2>What\u2019s the purpose of an executive summary?<\/h2>\n<p>Most people won\u2019t take the time to read your entire 15-page business plan. At least not at first. You need an elevator pitch they can read in about five minutes that convinces them to consider your proposal. That\u2019s what an executive summary does.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s break that down into the ways an executive summary helps your reader make a decision about your business.<\/p>\n<h3>Informs<\/h3>\n<p>An executive summary gives the reader all the information they need to make an educated decision. It should include the most compelling data from your business plan. It\u2019ll provide context about the current market, competitors, financials, and growth plans.<\/p>\n<p>Men\u2019s grooming brand Harry\u2019s gives website visitor\u2019s plenty of detail about their company on their About Us page, which acts as an executive summary about their business.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Executive-summary-example-harrys.jpg\" alt=\"Executive summary example - Harry's shave club about us page\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73504 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Executive-summary-example-harrys.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Executive-summary-example-harrys-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.harrys.com\/en\/us\/our-story\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Proves<\/h3>\n<p>You can\u2019t just say there is a problem and that yours is the right solution. You\u2019ll need to give enough background detail to prove those statements. Your executive summary should leave the reader with confidence in the opportunity you present.<\/p>\n<h3>Persuades<\/h3>\n<p>Within a few paragraphs, your executive summary should lead the reader to believe that the logical conclusion is to work with your business. You\u2019ll use language and stats that build a case to that end.<\/p>\n<p>Like Harry\u2019s, hammock maker Yellow Leaf uses their About Us page like an executive summary about their company.

But how do you go about writing one? Use these steps to craft a summary that gets people excited about your business\u2013and drives them to take action.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Complete your business plan first<\/h3>\n<p>While a good executive summary functions as a standalone document, it is solely based on your business plan. So the first step is to complete the rest of the plan and use it to guide your summary.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Decide who your reader will be<\/h3>\n<p>You may write multiple executive summaries for the same business plan, each one targeting a different reader and purpose. If you\u2019re asking the bank for a loan, you\u2019ll probably focus more on short and long-term financials. Or if the summary is meant to convince someone to hire your company, the summary will lean heavier on social proof and capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>Before you get to work, make sure you\u2019re clear on your target audience and what information they\u2019ll need to make a decision.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Create an outline<\/h3>\n<p>A structural outline of your executive summary will help you see where each piece of information fits. It\u2019ll show you the logical progression from problem to conclusion. It\u2019ll also make <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/07\/improve-writing-skills\">writing<\/a> the summary much easier.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Write a compelling introduction<\/h3>\n<p>The first few sentences should hook your reader so they want to keep reading. Write an introduction that quickly explains what your business is about and why it matters to your intended reader.<\/p>\n<p>When a one-woman show becomes a billion-dollar industry trailblazer, it\u2019s not hard to catch people\u2019s attention in an executive summary. Be like Spanx and lead with the uniqueness of your business.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Executive-summary-example-Spanx.jpg\" alt=\"Executive summary example - Spanx about us page\" width=\"935\" height=\"494\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73508 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Executive-summary-example-Spanx.jpg 935w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Executive-summary-example-Spanx-480x254.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 935px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/spanx.com\/pages\/about-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>5. Tell a story<\/h3>\n<p>People are more likely to understand and take action on information presented in story form. As you\u2019re writing your executive summary, make sure to include the characters (customers, business leaders), your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/02\/how-to-write-a-business-mission-statement\">mission statement<\/a>, and an arc that explains the current and future states.<\/p>\n<p>With a focus on sustainability and comfort, fashion brand Allbirds has an interesting story to tell. The company does it well in an About Us page that can be easily translated into an executive summary.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Executive-summary-example-Allbirds.jpg\" alt=\"Executive summary example - allbirds about us page\" width=\"567\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73509 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Executive-summary-example-Allbirds.jpg 567w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Executive-summary-example-Allbirds-480x508.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 567px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.allbirds.com\/pages\/our-story\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>6. Write in a professional but approachable tone<\/h3>\n<p>An executive summary is written for an executive (it says so right in the name!). So the language and layout you choose should be professional and confident.<\/p>\n<p>That said, you don\u2019t want to overcomplicate the summary. Remember, your audience is busy. The easier it is to understand your summary with a quick skim, the better your chances of getting them to say yes.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Get feedback<\/h3>\n<p>Have a few people read your executive summary in under five or 10 minutes. Then ask them questions like \u201cwhat does my company do?\u201d and \u201chow will my business solve the problem?\u201d The idea is to find out if your summary is easy to understand in a short amount of time.<\/p>\n<div id=\"catchy\"><\/div>\n<h2>Tips for writing a compelling executive summary<\/h2>\n<p>Your executive summary has a big job to do. Let\u2019s make sure it\u2019s ready to capture attention and motivate action.<\/p>\n<h3>Keep it short<\/h3>\n<p>For much the same reason, your executive summary shouldn\u2019t be very long. For most business plans, a one or two page summary should be enough. It\u2019ll almost never be longer than 10% of the entire business plan. A good rule of thumb is to make the summary as brief as possible while still being comprehensive.<\/p>\n<h3>Avoid useless jargon<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/07\/conversion-sabotaging-words\">Useless jargon<\/a> like \u201cindustry-leading\u201d and \u201cbleeding edge\u201d don\u2019t add any substance to your position. At best, they\u2019re extra words that slow readers down. At worst, they\u2019ll hurt your credibility.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>Looking for some useful words?

Ideally, a reader should be able to recite the major points after a 60-second scan.<\/p>\n<h3>Refer directly to your business plan<\/h3>\n<p>An executive summary should act as a reference guide to your business plan. If there\u2019s expanded financial data in the plan that\u2019s not in the summary, call it out and say where it is. Readers can then choose to dive into specific pieces of your business plan depending on their interests.<\/p>\n<div id=\"example\"><\/div>\n<h2>Executive summary example<\/h2>\n<p>Whenever you take on a new task, it helps to see all the parts in action. Here\u2019s an executive summary I created for a fictitious business called Nirvana Studios. Swipe this template to write your next executive summary.<\/p>\n<h3>Nirvana Studios executive summary example<\/h3>\n<p>Since 2016, Nirvana Studios has provided boutique health and wellness services at accessible prices to communities around New York City.<\/p>\n<p>People in these communities regularly fill waitlists for Reiki, sports massage, yoga, and nutritional support classes. And a recent survey showed that people of all generations now consider holistic wellness to be critical for long-term health.<\/p>\n<p>That said, there are few opportunities for middle-income earners in New Jersey to access these important services. Existing local providers cater to high-income clients, leaving the bulk of the population unable to afford the benefits of holistic wellness.<\/p>\n<p>By leveraging a proven and profitable operational model, a streamlined technology stack, and advantageous vendor relationships, Nirvana Studios can bring Reiki and the rest right to the New Jersey neighborhoods that need them most. We anticipate instant demand for these services, especially when delivered at rates the average office worker or plumber can afford.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A record of successful growth<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In 2015, Nirvana Studios co-founders Imani Evans and Rosa Diaz\u2014themselves yoga and Reiki master instructors\u2014realized that they couldn\u2019t afford the classes they taught. To solve the problem, Diaz and Evans worked with business consultants, commercial real estate professionals, and technology experts to create a business plan to reduce the overhead of running wellness studios while maintaining fair pay for instructors.<\/p>\n<p>The resulting model allows Nirvana Studio locations to offer services similar to its competitors but at a 30% discount.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Executive-summary-graph-service-cost-1.jpg\" alt=\"Executive summary example - Graphic showing cost comparison of services\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73512 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Executive-summary-graph-service-cost-1.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Executive-summary-graph-service-cost-1-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The mix of experienced instructors, beautiful studios, and accessible pricing allowed Nirvana to quickly expand to 20 locations throughout the five boroughs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Unmatched investment opportunity<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Both market and company financials show that this is the right time to invest in Nirvana Studios.<\/p>\n<p>For starters, there\u2019s never been more public interest in holistic health. A recent Trudential Insurance report showed that 93% of their clients wanted more access to yoga and stretching classes. Meanwhile, the mentions of preventative health on social media skyrocketed by 483% between 2021 and 2023.<\/p>\n<p>Nirvana is perfectly positioned to grow in this atmosphere of heightened need. With dramatically lower operational costs, the projected net profit for the proposed New Jersey locations is over 45%. That\u2019s based on maintaining client pricing that\u2019s 25% lower than existing studios in the market.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Executive-summary-graphic-profit.jpg\" alt=\"Executive summary example - Graphic highlighting the company's 45% profit\" width=\"936\" height=\"382\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73513 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Executive-summary-graphic-profit.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Executive-summary-graphic-profit-480x196.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Class fees from 10 new locations are expected to generate $50 million in the first full year of operation. In addition, it\u2019s anticipated Nirvana will generate $5 million at an 80% profit margin in retail sales from branded clothing and products in the first full year of New Jersey operations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Financial requirements for expansion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In order to maximize the opportunity for growth in the New Jersey Market, Nirvana Studios requires a $5 million dollar investment. The additional funds will be used to secure long-term leases, outfit physical locations, acquire equipment, and pay for marketing until the studios are operational.<\/p>\n<p>In exchange for this investment, the investor will receive 10% ownership in Nirvana Studios NJ, LLC, a subsidiary of Nirvana Studios Inc.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The right plan at the right time\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Nirvana Studios mission has always been to provide holistic wellness to more people through operational excellence.
