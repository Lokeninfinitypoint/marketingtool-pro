After all, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/25\/does-facebook-advertising-work\">organic reach on Facebook<\/a> is pretty much dead, right?<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/why-advertise-on-facebook-organic-reach-decline.png\" alt=\"how to get real facebook likes\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" \/><\/div>\n<p>However, there is still some marginal value in having a large number of page Likes. If nothing else, Likes serve as a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/10\/social-proof-guide\">form of social proof<\/a>. More likes make you appear popular to people who are just discovering your brand. And having more followers gives you a small bit of organic reach.<\/p>\n<p>If you manage a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/16\/facebook-business-page\">Facebook business page<\/a> and run <a href=\"\/facebook-advertising\">Facebook ads<\/a>, check it out: <strong>I&#8217;ve stumbled across a weird hack that allows you to invite real people who have engaged with your content to Like your page \u2013 and you don&#8217;t have to pay a penny<\/strong>. So far, I give the results a big thumbs up.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/one-weird-facebook-trick-get-more-likes.jpg\" alt=\"how to get facebook likes\" width=\"500\" height=\"749\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;Hidden&#8221; Invite Button<\/h2>\n<p>Before going further, I want to be clear. I don&#8217;t know if this Invite Button is a hidden feature or something that Facebook is testing in beta. This doesn&#8217;t seem to be available on every Facebook account so you may or may not have it.<\/p>\n<p>Also, what I&#8217;ll be discussing isn&#8217;t the invite option Facebook has given us for years (&#8220;Invite friends to like this page&#8221;). With that option you&#8217;re limited to only inviting your friends.<\/p>\n<p>No, the hidden Invite button I&#8217;ve found is completely different. It opens you up to reach a new and much bigger audience beyond the people who have already Liked your page.<\/p>\n<p>To find out if your account has access to this Invite button, go to your Facebook Page or the Facebook app (only the regular Facebook app, not the Facebook Pages Manager App, which doesn&#8217;t appear to have this feature).<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/hidden-facebook-invite-button.jpg\" alt=\"hidden facebook invite button get more likes\" width=\"600\" height=\"676\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Click on the people who engaged with your post. You&#8217;ll see three types of buttons:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Invite<\/strong> \u2013 This is the new button I haven&#8217;t seen before. Clicking on this will invite the person who engaged with your post to Like your page.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Liked<\/strong> \u2013 These are the people who have Liked your page already.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Invited<\/strong> \u2013 These are the people who you have sent an invitation, but haven&#8217;t yet accepted.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Limitations of the New Button<\/h2>\n<p>There is a limit to the number of invitations you can send per day. It seems to be somewhere between 500 and 1,000.<\/p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve hit your limit, Facebook will tell you as much. Check back in a day or two to see if you can start inviting more people who have engaged with your posts.<\/p>\n<p>Also, the Invite button seems to come and go a bit randomly. Weirdly, it doesn&#8217;t appear every time. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<h2>The Results?<\/h2>\n<p>Generally, I\u2019ve been seeing an <strong>acceptance rate between 15 and 20 percent<\/strong>. That&#8217;s ridiculously high.<\/p>\n<p>But it makes sense. You\u2019re targeting people who have expressed an interest in your page already by liking your updates. I use <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/11\/16\/facebook-remarketing\">remarketing<\/a> so people who aren\u2019t connected to me on Facebook will see my ads.<\/p>\n<p>Over the past couple of weeks, I&#8217;ve added nearly 1,000 fans using this Invite button. It isn&#8217;t spam! You&#8217;re adding them organically.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/get-more-facebook-page-likes-hack.png\" alt=\"get more facebook page likes\" width=\"800\" height=\"523\" \/><\/div>\n<p>What&#8217;s super funny is people have even sent thank you notes. They feel honored that I invited them to my page!<\/p>\n<h2>Thumbs Up!<\/h2>\n<p>I definitely like the conversion rate \u2013 1 in 5 people I invite to engage end up liking my page. And you can&#8217;t beat the price.<\/p>\n<p>When you run a paid Like campaign, you don&#8217;t know for sure who is going to end up Liking your page. It could just be some random person who doesn&#8217;t even have interest in your product or service. Totally worthless.<\/p>\n<p>However, with this Invite button, you know people have engaged with your content so they&#8217;re more likely to Like. Hopefully you can keep biasing them positively toward your brand and turn them from fan to customer.<\/p>\n<h3>Want more tips to increase your organic Facebook reach?<\/h3>\n<p>Check out my new post
