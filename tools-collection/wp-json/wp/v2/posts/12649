Some quick math, however, will likely change your mind. There are over 250 million adults in the United States. 16% of that figure gives us \u2026 <strong>40 million shopping procrastinators.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Evidently, this final stretch of the holiday season provides plenty of sales opportunities for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/ecommerce\">retailers<\/a> of all kinds. Don\u2019t take your foot off the gas until Santa\u2019s boots are inside a fireplace.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Last year brought a 24% increase in shipping discounts<\/h3>\n<p>According to eMarketer, the 2018 holiday season brought a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.emarketer.com\/content\/us-2018-holiday-season-review-and-2019-preview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">24%<\/a> YoY increase in discounted shipping offers. It\u2019ll be a few months until this season\u2019s data is finalized and distributed, but we\u2019re all adults here\u2014we can make an educated guess. Though I won\u2019t be so bold to claim that this season\u2019s spike will climb as high as 24%, we can comfortably assume that your competitors are just as eager\u2014if not <em>more <\/em>eager\u2014to entice last-minute shoppers with discounted shipping.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"64bd1465-6542-4113-9a59-9acb8d2822a7\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/last-minute-holiday-shopping-guide-discounts.jpg\" alt=\"offers for discounts and free shipping\" width=\"741\" height=\"209\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s no secret that online shoppers are fond of discounted (and free) shipping all year long. But when time is running out and your prospects are under the gun to submit their orders, few things are more powerful than inexpensive, flexible shipping. As eMarketer\u2019s data shows, more and more companies are taking note of this trend and adjusting accordingly. If you don\u2019t follow suit, you might not hit the holiday <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/17\/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate\">conversion numbers<\/a> you\u2019re looking for.<\/p>\n<h3>3. 35% of shoppers expect you to store their information<\/h3>\n<p>I should probably clarify. I\u2019m not saying that 35% of shoppers expect you to store <em>all <\/em>their information; they simply want you to remember their <strong>shipping and billing addresses<\/strong> as they try to submit their orders. This figure comes by way of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/feature\/online-shopping-trends\/landing\">Google\u2019s Global Retail Study<\/a>, conducted in February of this year.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s nothing complicated to dissect here. As you know from your own shopping experiences, it\u2019s annoying when you want to submit an order to an online store you\u2019ve already used and you\u2019re asked to re-enter your shipping and billing information. A lot of shoppers\u2014including those who are browsing your site <em>as we speak<\/em>\u2014would prefer to breeze through the order submission process and get back on with their lives. Put differently, they want <strong>minimal<\/strong> <strong>friction<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a93e148a-9f4d-4804-a4c1-dc86338ef35f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/last-minute-holiday-shopping-guide-shipping-form-fill.jpg\" alt=\"form fill for shipping name, address, and other info\" width=\"756\" height=\"869\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Nobody wants to do this charade every time.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If you want to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/03\/increase-sales-online\">drive a boost<\/a> in your last-minute holiday sales, make it painless to submit an order to your online store.<\/p>\n<h3>4. 49% of shoppers want ads based on purchase history<\/h3>\n<p>Yet another valuable insight from Google\u2019s most recent Global Retail Study: <strong>Practically half of shoppers say they want personalized ads based on past purchases.<\/strong> I\u2019ll say more on this topic in the next section of the guide, but this is definitely an insight you\u2019ll want to take to heart. Your prospects are telling you something in unambiguous terms: They want the ads they see online to be catered to their preferences.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"19c5becc-44d8-4760-a8fd-1e34a48d6a7e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/last-minute-holiday-shopping-guide-personalized-ad.jpg\" alt=\"example of a personalized ad with Cole Haan boots\" width=\"730\" height=\"320\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The final stretch of the holiday season is the perfect time to remind your past customers of how awesome your store is. As the pressure to buy a gift continues to climb, online shoppers become more and more eager to find inspiration. With a well-timed, personalized ad\u2014on Facebook, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/20\/instagram-advertising\">Instagram<\/a>, Google, or wherever\u2014you can save the day just in the nick of time.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Microsoft product ads drive a 20% increase in CVRs<\/h3>\n<p>Before I move on to my five last-minute holiday tips, we\u2019ve got one last statistic to discuss\u2014this one coming from our friends at Microsoft Advertising, formerly known as Bing Ads. According to internal data collected over the past few years, <strong>product ads <\/strong>have helped retailers drive a 35% increase in clicks, a 62% increase in conversions, and a 20% increase in conversion rates.<\/p>\n<p>Basically, this ad type from Microsoft can help you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/14\/increase-traffic-to-my-website\">grow your site traffic<\/a> and sell more products. What better time to get on board than the holiday season?<\/p>\n<p>The equivalent of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/04\/google-shopping-campaigns-tips-tricks\">Google Shopping ads<\/a>, Microsoft product ads are image-based promotions that live at the top of the search results page. Designed to entice users looking to make purchases, a product ad includes a picture, a title, a price, and your brand name. If you\u2019re savvy, a product ad can also include a special offer (e.g., \u201cGet 20% off) that further differentiates you from your competitors. No wonder they\u2019re so effective at getting users to click, huh?<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c90664e5-c369-4d36-98b4-daa07270b68f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/last-minute-holiday-shopping-guide-increase-cvr-microsoft-advertising.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft shopping ads\" width=\"714\" height=\"427\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Here\u2019s the bad news: If you\u2019re not already advertising on Google Shopping, it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll be able to get up and running with Microsoft product ads in time for Christmas. You can\u2019t take advantage of this ad type until you\u2019ve created and uploaded a complete product catalog, and that\u2019s a task that requires quite a bit of time.<\/p>\n<p>For those of you who <em>are <\/em>on Google Shopping, you\u2019re in luck. Within the Microsoft Advertising interface, you can simply <strong>import your Google Shopping campaigns<\/strong> and hit the ground running. Microsoft will need to approve your ads, of course, and you\u2019ll have to manually create things like negative keywords and sitelink extensions. But if you work quickly (and, as I said before, make your shipping options flexible), you can get in front of last-minute Bing shoppers as they furiously try to finish their holiday shopping.<\/p>\n<p>Worst case: Your product ads don\u2019t go live <em>quite <\/em>in time, but you\u2019ve still got an awesome new ad type to take advantage of in the new year.<\/p>\n<h2>5 actionable tips for the end of the holiday season<\/h2>\n<h3>1. Run one-day sales on Super Saturday<\/h3>\n<p>As I\u2019m sure some of you already know, the last Saturday before Christmas is known as <strong>Super Saturday<\/strong>\u2014one final chance for those 40 million procrastinators to buy gifts for their friends and family members. Estimates vary, but according to ABC News, retailers can expect to generate something in the ballpark of <a href=\"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Business\/winter-storm-threatens-retailers-bottom-line\/story?id=9382072\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$15 billion<\/a> in revenue\u2014<strong>in just one single day<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not enough, however, to\u00a0simply open your doors on Saturday, December 21; you need to go the extra mile and give your prospects a <em>reason<\/em> to pick you over your competitors. For better or worse, that means you need to run some killer one-day sales.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"abce6d45-70dd-46c3-9935-4d7ba9cd7096\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/last-minute-holiday-shopping-guide-super-saturday-sale.jpg\" alt=\"Super Saturday Sale\" width=\"650\" height=\"361\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Shoppers will always appreciate discounted prices, but that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t get creative with your Super Saturday strategy. Think about products that complement one another. If you manage a bookstore, for example, maybe you could frame your sale around the different types of books you sell: <em>Buy one mystery novel and get a second one half-off!<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>2. Use local inventory ads on Google &amp; Bing &#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>Google shared one heck of a statistic back in 2018: In just two years, the frequency of \u201cnear me\u201d mobile search queries grew by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/consumer-insights\/near-me-searches\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">over 500%<\/a>! Clearly, shoppers like to see which stores have certain products in stock before getting in their cars or hopping on the bus. I have to imagine this tendency only gets stronger as the number of days before Christmas dwindles. After all, no one has any time to waste!<\/p>\n<p>To help you turn this trend into some additional revenue, Google created <strong>local inventory ads<\/strong>. Here\u2019s how they work. When a prospective shopper searches \u201cwomen\u2019s perfume near me,\u201d they see a series of local inventory ads\u2014each one providing an image, a price, in-store availability, and (perhaps most importantly) directions. Basically, a local inventory ad is an easy way to let your prospects know that you have the exact thing they\u2019re looking for!<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d58de079-618e-47c9-b7c7-e546bc5266f1\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/last-minute-holiday-shopping-guide-local-inventory-ads.jpg\" alt=\"local inventory ads example\" width=\"716\" height=\"596\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>As with Microsoft product ads, you have <strong>absolutely no time to waste<\/strong>. Once you\u2019ve submitted your local inventory feed, Google needs a few days to review and verify everything. To speed up the process\u2014which, again, is a <em>must <\/em>at this point\u2014consider limiting your inventory feed (for now) to just a handful of popular products. This will allow you to quickly create your feed and get it approved as fast as possible. Even if your local inventory ads don\u2019t go live until a day or two before Christmas, that\u2019s alright\u2014people will be shopping! Plus, those ads will still be valuable even after the holiday season has ended.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of Microsoft: They offer local inventory ads, too!<\/p>\n<h3>3. \u2026 and offer ads on Facebook!<\/h3>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re advertising a physical store or an online brand, there\u2019s so much to love about Facebook offer ads\u2014a mobile-only ad type that allows you to entice prospective customers with irresistible deals. Users who claim an online offer will receive a discount code and subsequently get sent to your website to shop. If you\u2019re targeting in-store shoppers, they\u2019ll receive a barcode (or QR code) that they can present while checking out.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5f412a2f-dd8b-468e-9ddb-2bfe8beff603\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/last-minute-holiday-shopping-guide-facebook-offer-ads.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook offer ad\" width=\"645\" height=\"408\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>For those who are interested, here\u2019s a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/21\/facebook-offer-ads\">step-by-step guide to creating Facebook offer ads<\/a>. Once you\u2019re ready to make one of your own, here\u2019s my advice: Determine who you\u2019re going to target before writing your ad copy. That way, you\u2019ll be able to make your messaging as personalized and engaging as possible. When you\u2019re competing with other retailers to win over last-minute holiday shoppers, every little thing counts. If you can make your procrastinator prospects feel as if you\u2019ve created a special offer <strong><em>just for them<\/em><\/strong>, you should see some great results.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Take advantage of location bid adjustments<\/h3>\n<p>Word to the wise: You can set your keyword bids to automatically change (either increase or decrease) according to the physical location of whoever\u2019s triggering your search ads. If you\u2019re advertising a brick-and-mortar business\u2014whether it\u2019s a clothing store, a restaurant, a hair salon, or whatever\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/geo-targeting\">location bid adjustments<\/a> are a fantastic way to increase brand awareness, site traffic, and overall sales.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a27226ae-7522-45a5-9555-0db7d6c567ce\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/last-minute-holiday-shopping-guide-location-bid-adjustments.jpg\" alt=\"location bid adjustments\" width=\"502\" height=\"229\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Via <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.emarketeers.com\/e-insight\/7-pro-tips-to-boost-your-google-ads-roi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Emarketeers<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The final stretch of the holiday season provides the perfect opportunity to combine the power of location bid adjustments with hyper-specific ad copy. For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re marketing a local Italian restaurant. If someone in your area searches \u201crestaurant gift card,\u201d a location bid adjustment can help you win the top ad position and prominently showcase <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/14\/ppc-ad-copywriting\">your winning copy<\/a>: \u201cGive the Gift of Italy\u2502Gift Cards Now Available.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>P.S. With the <strong>bid simulator <\/strong>(found under the Keywords tab in the Google Ads interface), you can get a sense of how changes to your bids will impact your results.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Remarket to past customers<\/h3>\n<p>Stat #4: <strong>49% of shoppers want ads based on their purchase history<\/strong>. If someone asked me to make the case for personalized remarketing with a single statistic, if might be that one. What else do you need to hear? People want to see relevant ads across search and social.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m repeating myself, but this warrants emphasis: When the holiday season is winding down and the competition between you and your rivals is peaking, the power of personalized messaging cannot be overstated. And although platforms like Google and Facebook allow you to segment cold audiences by demographics and interests, there\u2019s no group of people you know better than your own customers. That\u2019s why you should make them your focus as Christmas draws closer!<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"87a87c6e-3ff8-4a82-acb4-6e0c60803ae9\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/last-minute-holiday-shopping-guide-remarket-past-customers.jpg\" alt=\"option to remarket to past customers\" width=\"722\" height=\"180\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Knowing the specific products your past customers have purchased is an incredible asset. Let\u2019s say, for example, that you\u2019ve kept an (anonymized) record of all the Facebook users who converted on an ad for a pair of running sneakers. Instead of going after a batch of entirely new prospects, why not retarget those customers with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/21\/facebook-carousel-ads\">carousel ad<\/a> that showcases all your other running-related products? Although this approach means reaching far fewer people, you can take comfort in the fact that they\u2019re much more likely to click and convert. If you\u2019re under the gun to hit specific holiday season targets, it makes sense to go after high-quality prospects!<\/p>\n<p>Social isn\u2019t the only place to get your remarketing on, however. With <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/12\/remarketing-lists-for-search-ads\">remarketing lists for search ads (RLSA)<\/a>, you can increase your bids on specific keywords when they\u2019re triggered by users who\u2019ve visited particular pages on your website. Let\u2019s stick with the example of running gear. If you have an (anonymized) list of everyone who\u2019s visited the page on your site dedicated to a specific pair of sneakers, you can increase your bid on the keyword \u201crunning gear\u201d whenever it\u2019s searched by one of those people.<\/p>\n<p>At this crucial time of year, high-quality prospects are the name of the game.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The holidays are almost here, so it&#8217;s getting late for shopping\u2014but not too late.
