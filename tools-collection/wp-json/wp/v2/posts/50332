But here are some:<\/p>\n<p><strong>20. Focus on repeat customers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Look at your analytics and identify the repeat customers to improve their experience. The better brand loyalty you establish, the more revenue you can generate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>21. Promote \u201ceyecatcher\u201d products<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Promote entry-level products that work well with additional products. In doing so, you can <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/11\/call-to-action-examples-for-email-newsletter-signups\">increase signups<\/a> and sell more products later, ultimately increasing the customer revenue.<\/p>\n<p><strong>22. Hone your pricing strategy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You might try a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/03\/price-increase-letter-examples\">price increase<\/a>. If you have strong customer loyalty towards your product, they are likely willing to pay a substantial price for the same.<\/p>\n<h3>AARRR metrics for revenue<\/h3>\n<p>Your business growth ultimately lies in the revenue you secure. So, measure these metrics to check the revenue you earn and lose with every customer. These metrics are particularly crucial for subscription-based business models.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">Customer lifetime value (<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/10\/cac-vs-clv\">CLV<\/a>): <\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">This metric is crucial to determine the overall customer experience. It measures the value of a customer for your company over the period of their relationship (see average customer lifespan).<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">Average revenue per user (ARPU): <\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">This metric gives you an idea of the revenue you\u2019re generating from each user in a specific duration. It divides revenue generated in a period by the number of average users in that period.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">Annual recurring revenue (ARR): <\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">This metric is for subscription products or services. It evaluates the revenue generated every year for a subscription.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">Monthly recurring revenue (MRR): <\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">This metric measures the predicted income from subscriptions sold in a month.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">Revenue churn: <\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">This metric looks at the revenue lost in a given period. It calculates the MRR lost in a month and deducts the total price of upgrades or additional services bought in the month.\u00a0 <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Keep a check on these numbers to fuel revenue-driven growth for your business.<\/p>\n<h2>The real definition of growth marketing (recap)<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">Growth marketing is more than just a buzzword for growing businesses.
