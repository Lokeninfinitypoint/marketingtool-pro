Here are 40 Twitter statistics marketers should know to improve their strategies in 2024.<\/p>\n<h2>Twitter popularity statistics<\/h2>\n<p>1. There are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/twitter-monthly-active-users-2015-7?r=UK&amp;IR=T\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1.3+ BILLION<\/a> accounts created on Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>2.

That equates to a growth of 4% in 2021 alone.<\/p>\n<p>3.

Okay, I do realize you likely already knew this fact, but understanding exactly how popular is critical as well. Not only are there millions of people logging onto Twitter each month, but there are millions logging on every single day! People are also using the platform specifically to discover new things, whether it\u2019s news stories, products, or experiences. And while 3.39 minutes daily spent on the platform may not seem like a lot, it is definitely plenty of time to be one of the new things that your target audience member discovers during their daily Twitter check.<\/p>\n<h2>Twitter demographic statistics<\/h2>\n<p>8. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/265647\/share-of-us-internet-users-who-use-twitter-by-age-group\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">56% of US Twitter audiences identify as male<\/a> and 44% identify as female.<\/p>\n<p>9.

Yet, there are some conclusions we can make about the mass in that the majority of Twitter users fall into the \u201caffluent millennial\u201d category. Twitter is most commonly used in the US, Japan, and the UK. Twitter is also clearly a platform more popular amount younger age groups, but has been growing in popularity amongst adults.<\/p>\n<p>However, the main takeaway from all of these demographic statistics is that whoever your target audience is there is more then likely a large segment of them actively using Twitter. Lucky for you, like Facebook and Instagram, Twitter allows marketers to target ads based on a variety of demographic characteristics. Take advantage of the huge audience Twitter has and drill down to find your future customers on the platform.<\/p>\n<h2>Twitter marketing statistics<\/h2>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"9ab62222-65b2-4fc1-ba64-0c5c4bce731c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/twitter-statistics-egg-mcmuffin.jpg\" alt=\"egg mcmuffin tweet\" width=\"594\" height=\"439\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>21. <a href=\"https:\/\/business.twitter.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Time spent viewing ads online is 26%<\/a> higher on Twitter compared to other leading platforms.<\/p>\n<p>22.
