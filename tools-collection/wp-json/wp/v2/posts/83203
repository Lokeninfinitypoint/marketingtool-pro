However, these generated search responses are full of problems and potentially dangerous inaccuracies. For example, Google\u2019s AI doesn\u2019t seem to understand jokes or sarcasm from the sources it pulls, and it\u2019s also been found to cite outdated (<a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/lilyraynyc\/status\/1795106675600367697\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">or even dead<\/a>) URLs.<\/p>\n<div id=\"ai-overviews-predictions\"><\/div>\n<h2>Life after AI Overviews: 3 predictions for the future of search<\/h2>\n<p>Wondering what happens next now that Google AI Overviews are here to stay? Check out these three predictions for where this might lead.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Google\u2019s reputation and industry dominance are at risk<\/h3>\n<p>As demonstrated by the examples above (and many more going viral on social media under the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=%23GoogEnough&amp;src=hashtag_click\">#googenough<\/a><span> hashtag<\/span>) Google AI Overviews and Search have a severe quality and reliability issue right now.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTrust in Google Search is eroding\u2014even if Alphabet is making billions of dollars every quarter. As that trust erodes, people may start searching elsewhere, which will slowly trickle down and hurt performance for advertisers and further reduce organic traffic to websites,&#8221; said Danny Goodwin, Managing Editor at Search Engine Land, in <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/google-ai-overview-fails-442575\">this recent article<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also been speculation that Google is &#8220;panicking&#8221; because of the threat from other AI companies developing products that could challenge or replace Google search as the industry standard.<\/p>\n<h3><span>2. Organic traffic from Google will decline\u2013maybe drastically<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>There are a few reasons why your organic search traffic will see an impact from AI Overviews and its new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ai-mode\">AI Mode<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To start, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/06\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">top-ranking organic results<\/a> will now be further down the page. Unless your site ends up in the Overview itself, your potential customers will have to scroll further down below the fold to click directly on your organic listing.<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, inaccurate results may also cause a decline in traffic. AI Overviews have proven to be unreliable, so they may not include your site in a response even when they technically should. You could end up missing out on traffic by not being pulled into a relevant Overview.<\/p>\n<p>Further, providing more thorough information directly on the SERP makes clicking off to a specific page less likely. The typical user previously would have clicked into a few pages from the SERP to further research their query. Now, people might feel like they found everything they needed from an Overview without having to click into any of the sources (even though that\u2019s not necessarily recommended).<\/p>\n<p>In fact, it\u2019s been estimated that, for the average business, organic search engine traffic volume will drop as much as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/2024-02-19-gartner-predicts-search-engine-volume-will-drop-25-percent-by-2026-due-to-ai-chatbots-and-other-virtual-agents\">25%<\/a> by 2026 because of AI chatbots and other virtual agents providing searchers with information instead. What\u2019s arguably even more concerning is, currently, <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/search-engine-traffic-2026-prediction-437650\">79%<\/a> of consumers expect to use AI-enhanced search within the next year and 70% had at least some trust in generative AI search results.<\/p>\n<h3>3. SEO best practices will change (quickly!)<\/h3>\n<p>Many of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/05\/seo-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tried and true SEO tips and tricks<\/a> from over the years will need to evolve to align with the new AI Overview search experience.<\/p>\n<p>Further complicating matters, <a href=\"https:\/\/sparktoro.com\/blog\/an-anonymous-source-shared-thousands-of-leaked-google-search-api-documents-with-me-everyone-in-seo-should-see-them\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">leaked Google documents<\/a> have recently come out that appear to contain previously undisclosed information on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/09\/google-ranking-factors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google\u2019s ranking factors<\/a>. These <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/google-search-document-leak-ranking-442617\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u00a0Google documents<\/a> are considered to be \u201cone of the biggest stories in the history of SEO and Google Search,\u201d according to Danny Goodwin.<\/p>\n<p>For example, it was found that Google keeps (or at least has the capability to keep) a copy of every indexed page, so it can \u201cremember\u201d past versions of a page and could possibly take change history into account when ranking sites on the SERP.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-ai-overviews-leaked-document-linkedin-post.webp\" alt=\"google ai overviews - leaked document linkedin post screenshot\" width=\"523\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83216 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-ai-overviews-leaked-document-linkedin-post.webp 523w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-ai-overviews-leaked-document-linkedin-post-480x551.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 523px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/posts\/kylebyers_this-is-one-of-the-most-exciting-times-for-activity-7201540512678318083-fmX3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>We don\u2019t know for sure what the leaked documents mean or which of the 14,000+ factors found in them really matter most for your rankings, but one thing is certain.

Consider these pieces of advice.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Don\u2019t give up on SEO altogether&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s not time to throw in the SEO towel just yet. SEO will continue to be a major marketing channel for businesses of all different verticals, but be ready to pivot your SEO strategy according to the new SERP structure.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn a nutshell, AI overviews represent nothing more than a shift in attention from ranking pages to the SERPs themselves. The focus now turns to the answers served in the AI snippets,\u201d said Goran Mirkovic, CMO at <a href=\"https:\/\/freemius.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Freemius<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYes, it might be harder to attribute results, and a new category of AI optimization may emerge, but we\u2019re still dealing with the same searchers looking for information on the internet. The core rules of the game remain the same\u2014who better serves the demand for information; wins! As long as we can meet this demand, whether through our website, Google&#8217;s search results, or potentially another platform in the future\u2014will continue to generate revenue,&#8221; Goran said.<\/p>\n<h3>2. &#8230;but start exploring other marketing channels<\/h3>\n<p>The fact of the matter is your organic website traffic may start to look a little different than what it was pre-AI Overviews. To make up for any traffic losses, start to consider what other <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/26\/marketing-channels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing channels<\/a> you could lean into to continue to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/02\/promote-your-business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">grow your business online<\/a>. For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/video-marketing-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video marketing<\/a> could be another avenue for quality content that converts.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs SEOs and content marketers, and businesses as a whole, we typically neglect video,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/zacharris36\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zac Harris<\/a>, an SEO consultant who has worked with brands like SpyFu and Copy.ai.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYes, continue to create written content, but think about how to get the maximum amount of value out of that. Can we create video content to go with that? \u00a0Can we create <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/youtube-shorts-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shorts<\/a> and slice up videos for LinkedIn and social?\u201d Zac said.<\/p>\n<p>This is also a good time to rethink your search advertising strategy and budget. As organic traffic dips and content marketing and SEO potentially become less cost-effective, you can increase your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-marketing-live-2024\">paid search<\/a> budget to keep your lead flow strong. And definitely allot some of that budget to search engines other than Google\u2013we\u2019ve found that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/2024-google-ads-benchmarks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">both cost per click and cost per acquisition are significantly lower<\/a> in Microsoft Ads.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-ads-benchmarks-microsoft-versus-google-costs.webp\" alt=\"google ads benchmarks - microsoft versus google ads cost per click comparison chart\" width=\"510\" height=\"369\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82736 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-ads-benchmarks-microsoft-versus-google-costs.webp 510w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-ads-benchmarks-microsoft-versus-google-costs-480x347.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 510px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Data from US-based LocaliQ campaigns shows the difference in costs per click between Google and Microsoft.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>3.
