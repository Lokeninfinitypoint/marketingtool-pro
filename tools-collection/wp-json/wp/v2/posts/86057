In other words when another site links to your site do they use text like \u201cDemers Construction\u201d (not aggressive anchor text) or do they always use \u201cexact match\u201d anchor text for the keyword you\u2019re targeting like \u201chome remodeling wilmington ma?\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you\u2019re not sure how many pages your site has or what content is being created for you (by your own team or by an SEO you hired, for instance) you can look in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/16\/how-to-use-google-search-console\">Google Search Console<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/pages-indexed-google-search-console.webp\" alt=\"page index report in google search console\" width=\"844\" height=\"375\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86105\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/pages-indexed-google-search-console.webp 844w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/pages-indexed-google-search-console-480x213.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 844px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If the number surprises you, you can then drill down to see the actual pages that are being indexed and not. Similarly, you can go to google.com and type site:yoururl.com and quickly see the pages Google has indexed for your site (note that this is a rough estimate, and you don\u2019t always see all of the pages indexed):<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/not-all-pages-indexed.webp\" alt=\"not all pages indexed in google\" width=\"312\" height=\"570\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86106\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/not-all-pages-indexed.webp 312w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/not-all-pages-indexed-164x300.webp 164w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In this instance, you\u2019ll note there are 10 pages of results for this local home remodeling company, and if you click to the last page of results, you can see there are actually several more listings:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/more-listings-on-google-serp.webp\" alt=\"more listings in google\" width=\"876\" height=\"544\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86109\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/more-listings-on-google-serp.webp 876w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/more-listings-on-google-serp-480x298.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 876px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This may be fine and by design for this site, but if this were a site that had taken a hit in terms of traffic, it may be due to the fact that they have a larger number of pages than necessary being indexed.<\/p>\n<p>For <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/27\/backlink-audit\">analyzing backlinks<\/a> you\u2019ll need a third-party tool like Ahrefs, Semrush, or similar to look at the anchor text pointing to your site:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/anchors-in-ahrefs.webp\" alt=\"checking anchors in ahref\" width=\"887\" height=\"580\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86110\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/anchors-in-ahrefs.webp 887w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/anchors-in-ahrefs-480x314.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 887px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In this case, we can quickly see that a lot of the text linking to this site is branded or generic anchors, so the issue for this site likely isn\u2019t overly aggressive exact match anchors (if we looked at this report and saw a heavy percentage of anchor text like \u201chome remodeling wilmington ma\u201d that would be a potential red flag).<\/p>\n<h2>Most SEO best practices are still best practices<\/h2>\n<p>Certain <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/outdated-seo-tactics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO tactics<\/a> that used to work don\u2019t work anymore, and certain mixes of tactics won\u2019t be as impactful as they used to.<\/p>\n<p>But for the most part basic <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/seo-issues\">SEO best practices<\/a> still work. If you have a small business, you likely want to focus on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/03\/google-my-business-optimization\">Optimizing your Google Business Profile<\/a> for search.<\/li>\n<li>Getting more positive reviews.<\/li>\n<li>Getting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/04\/12\/local-citations\">local citations<\/a> and making sure your data is consistent.<\/li>\n<li>Building location pages and making sure they\u2019re targeting the right keywords.<\/li>\n<li>Building links to your site generally and into your location pages.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Additionally, a key takeaway here is that if you have a mix of:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Local Services Ads (for services businesses)<\/li>\n<li>Google Ads<\/li>\n<li>A map presence<\/li>\n<li>Organic listings<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You may still be impacted by core updates, but your leads from Google will be much better diversified and much more resilient to future updates (no matter how volatile they may be).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Here&#8217;s what you need to know in the aftermath of Google&#8217;s August core update&#8211;plus tips to save your site.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":228,"featured_media":86112,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[9],"tags":[],"dipi_cpt_category":[],"class_list":["post-86057","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-seo"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v25.8 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Google&#039;s August Core Update: Everything We Know (+What to Do Next) | WordStream<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Google rolled out a big core update in August 2024.
