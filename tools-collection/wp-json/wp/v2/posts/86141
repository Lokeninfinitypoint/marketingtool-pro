After all, customer acquisition is important for growing a business.<\/p>\n<p>But what if each of those new customers also returned to make more purchases, leave glowing reviews, and share their great experiences on social media? Your business would grow exponentially faster with much less work acquiring new leads.<\/p>\n<p>How do you reach that dream scenario? By building brand loyalty.<\/p>\n<p>In this guide, we\u2019ll cover 12 ways to build brand loyalty by strengthening your messaging, leveling up your focus on customers, and encouraging repeat business.<\/p>\n<p>Before we get to the strategies, though, let\u2019s clarify what brand loyalty is and why it\u2019s worth focusing on.<\/p>\n<h3>Contents<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#what-is-brand-loyalty\">What is brand loyalty?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#12-ways-you-can-foster-brand-loyalty\">12 Ways you can foster brand loyalty<\/a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#ace-your-brand-story\">Ace your brand story<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#offer-consistant-products-and-services\">Offer consistent products and services<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#prioritize-customer-experience-over-transactions\">Prioritize customer experience over transactions<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#personalize-your-outreach\">Personalize your outreach<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ask-for-feedback-and-use-it\">Ask for feedback and use it<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#work-with-your-unhappy-customers\">Work with your unhappy customers<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#develop-your-online-presence\">Develop your online presence<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#engage-on-social-media\">Engage on social media<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#get-involved-with-your-community\">Get involved with your community<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#launch-a-loyalty-program\">Launch a loyalty program<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#try-a-referral-program\">Try a referral program<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#stick-to-your-brand-values\">Stick to your brand values<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"what-is-brand-loyalty\"><\/div>\n<h2>What is brand loyalty?<\/h2>\n<p>Brand loyalty describes a consumer\u2019s tendency to purchase from one company repeatedly despite alternate offers and opportunities. This decision to repeat purchases can be motivated by a relationship with the brand, which may include trust in the product, appreciation for the customer service, or shared belief in the company values.<\/p>\n<p>Encouraging a customer to buy again usually costs much less than attracting and converting a new customer.\u00a0 That means brand loyalty can have real monetary results for your business. According to Bain &amp; Company, businesses get an average <a href=\"https:\/\/media.bain.com\/Images\/BB_Prescription_cutting_costs.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">25%<\/a> increase in profit when they boost customer retention by just 5%.<\/p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t just a cumulative, lifetime value. Some studies suggest that repeat, loyal customers spend more per purchase than their first-time counterparts, even up to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.business.com\/articles\/returning-customers-spend-67-more-than-new-customers-keep-your-customers-coming-back-with-a-recurring-revenue-sales-model\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">67%<\/a> more when they have a long-standing relationship with your brand.<\/p>\n<p>This relationship between your customers and your brand, however, isn\u2019t likely to just happen; you need to focus on building brand loyalty.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 <strong>Before a customer can be loyal, they need to be aware of your business.<\/strong> Download <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLTheDefinitiveGuideBrandAwareness.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_BrandAwareness_Guide_Download\">The Definitive Guide to Brand Awareness: Top Strategies, Examples &amp; How to Measure Success<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"12-ways-you-can-foster-brand-loyalty\"><\/div>\n<h2>12 ways you can foster brand loyalty<\/h2>\n<p>Consistent and coordinated efforts throughout your product, marketing, and customer service cultivate brand loyalty. Here are some surefire strategies for building brand loyalty with your customers.<\/p>\n<div id=\"ace-your-brand-story\"><\/div>\n<h3>1. Ace your brand story<\/h3>\n<p>Building trust and loyalty requires a connection. A compelling brand that inspires emotional resonance with your audience is an excellent way to foster that connection.<\/p>\n<p>Your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/08\/brand-story\">brand story<\/a> captures your company\u2019s origin and its why. It explains the motivation behind certain products or offerings, the gaps they fill in the market, and the vision that led to the brand\u2019s launch.<\/p>\n<p>Take this example from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.puresolutions.com\/pure-page\/our-story\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pure Solutions<\/a>, a family-owned organic lawn care and pest control company based in New England.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/brand-loyalty-wordstream-mission.webp\" alt=\"Brand loyalty - Mission statement from Pure Solutions.\" width=\"797\" height=\"296\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86144 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/brand-loyalty-wordstream-mission.webp 797w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/brand-loyalty-wordstream-mission-480x178.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 797px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.puresolutions.com\/pure-page\/our-story\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This brief paragraph on the business\u2019 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/27\/guide-to-about-us-pages\">About Us page<\/a> outlines the initial gap in the market, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\">value proposition<\/a>, the brand\u2019s values, and the commitment to organic-based solutions that are effective and safe for kids, pets, and the environment. Plus, it encourages an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/03\/emotional-marketing-copy\">emotional reaction<\/a> by including words like \u201csafer\u201d and \u201cprotect.\u201d<\/p>\n<div id=\"offer-consistant-products-and-services\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Offer consistent products and services<\/h3>\n<p>This is going to seem like an obvious one, but it\u2019s worth stating. In order to foster brand loyalty, you need to consistently offer quality products and services.<\/p>\n<p>Consistency is important when you have repeat customers. Last year, I re-ordered the same Warby Parker glasses that I have loved for years (through multiple prescription changes). Except this time, the frames were flimsier, lighter, and smaller, even though they cost more than my previous pair. It was upsetting to lose my glasses and my go-to supplier at once. I\u2019ve been ordering glasses and sunglasses from a different place since.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not alone in craving consistency as a consumer. In a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/the-goods\/2019\/4\/9\/18296792\/starbucks-habit-millennials-money\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vox<\/a> article on Millennial money habits, Mae Rice writes, \u201cStarbucks\u2019s brand isn\u2019t good coffee so much as predictability: experiences you\u2019ve already had, drinks you\u2019ve already drunk. It promises to sustain your routines.\u201d It\u2019s the familiar consistency maintained in different locations and at different times that keeps bringing many loyal customers back.<\/p>\n<p>But consistency shouldn\u2019t be at the expense of quality. (Chances are, your business doesn\u2019t have the ubiquity and customer base that Starbucks does.) In fact, your brand values might be worth a premium to your ideal customer base. For example, PwC found that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pwc.com\/gx\/en\/news-room\/press-releases\/2024\/pwc-2024-voice-of-consumer-survey.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">80%<\/a> of consumers are willing to pay more for sustainably produced or sourced products (read how AI can help you deliver <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/ai-for-customer-service\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">consistent customer service<\/a>).<\/p>\n<div id=\"prioritize-customer-experience-over-transactions\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Prioritize experience over transaction<\/h3>\n<p>Customer service plays a huge role in building and maintaining brand loyalty. You want your customers to become dependable repeat buyers, five-star <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/16\/get-more-google-reviews\">reviewers<\/a>, and even your evangelizers on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/drive-traffic-from-reddit\">Reddit<\/a>. The way to get there is to prioritize creating a relationship with exceptional customer experience rather than simply facilitating a seamless transaction.<\/p>\n<p>Take Chewy, for instance. The pet food and goods marketplace sends beautiful condolence notes to customers whose pets have passed away.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/brand-loyalty-wordstream-customer-note.webp\" alt=\"Brand loyalty - Customer note from pet goods supplier.\" width=\"878\" height=\"547\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86145 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/brand-loyalty-wordstream-customer-note.webp 878w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/brand-loyalty-wordstream-customer-note-480x299.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 878px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MadeMeSmile\/comments\/1b93s9e\/my_dog_passed_on_tuesday_and_i_got_this_email\/?rdt=34603\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>They often offer reimbursement for unused food, an assurance to not worry about returns and donate instead, and a cancellation of any automated orders. The posts are heartbreaking, but the company&#8217;s actions seem genuine and caring during a hard time for any pet owner.<\/p>\n<p>This is a prime example of fostering an emotional connection that guarantees a loyal customer. It also encourages any pet lover who hears about the caring act to start using Chewy.<\/p>\n<div id=\"personalize-your-outreach\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Personalize your outreach<\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to customer acquisition, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/blog\/digital-customers-research-blog\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">59%<\/a> of customers say tailored engagement based on past interactions is very important to win their business. That demand for personalized interaction is even greater with your existing customers.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s annoying when you get an email from a brand that makes it seem like they\u2019re not paying attention to the data they\u2019re collecting. For instance, I hate it when I get an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/17\/shopping-cart-abandonment\">abandoned cart<\/a> email with a discount when I\u2019ve already made that purchase without the 10% off code. And I\u2019m not alone. So take the time to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/06\/personalized-marketing\">personalize your interactions<\/a>, develop a relationship with your customers, and build that brand loyalty.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc4b<strong> For more ways to promote brand loyalty, <\/strong>check out our free guide on\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite30BestWaysToPromote.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Marketing_The30BestWaysToPromoteYourBusiness_Download\">The 30 Best Ways to Promote Your Business (With or Without Money)<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"ask-for-feedback-and-use-it\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Ask for feedback and use it<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re trying to build a relationship with your customers, you need to know how they feel. That means you need feedback.<\/p>\n<p>Soliciting feedback can look different, depending on your goal and business structure. It might mean asking for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">customer reviews<\/a> about your service on Google or your website, sending an email with a short survey, or offering a gift card for a quick phone call to answer questions about using your app.<\/p>\n<p>No matter where it comes from, when you ask for feedback, you need to take it seriously and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/24\/customer-feedback\">use it<\/a>. Responding thoughtfully, using it to consider changes to your product or marketing, and following up with the next steps or updates are important steps.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, if someone took the time to let you know how their purchase made them feel\u2014whether positive, negative, or disappointingly mid\u2014they cared enough to do it. That\u2019s a great place to start building loyalty.<\/p>\n<div id=\"work-with-your-unhappy-customers\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. Work with your unhappy customers<\/h3>\n<p>Unhappy customers who reach out frustrated with negative feedback about a purchase or leave a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-respond-to-negative-reviews\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">negative review<\/a> about a disappointing product aren\u2019t appealing. But believe it or not, they do present an opportunity to build brand loyalty.<\/p>\n<p>In marketer and entrepreneur Jay Baer\u2019s <em>Hug Your Haters<\/em>, he explains how customers who reach out with a problem are emotionally invested in the interaction and the outcome. That gives you the opportunity to provide excellent customer service and solve the problem. And if you\u2019re able to do that, you might find yourself with another loyal customer. As Baer explains, when you\u2019re able to solve a customer\u2019s problem, they are more likely to remain loyal and spend more.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/brand-loyalty-wordstream-Review.webp\" alt=\"Brand loyalty - Review on Google.\" width=\"833\" height=\"359\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86146 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/brand-loyalty-wordstream-Review.webp 833w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/brand-loyalty-wordstream-Review-480x207.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 833px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you find yourself in the unfortunate-but-common position of dealing with a frustrated customer, lean into it.<\/p>\n<div id=\"develop-your-online-presence\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. Develop your online presence<\/h3>\n<p>A well-established online presence ensures that customers can easily find and interact with your brand wherever they\u2019re online. That includes your website, social media, review forums, or elsewhere. Being readily accessible encourages your customers to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/27\/how-to-increase-instagram-engagement\">engage more frequently<\/a>, which also encourages them to keep coming back to your business.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, this consistent, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/23\/how-brand-your-business\">cohesive branding<\/a> across your online presence helps ensure your customers recognize your brand easily. If you\u2019re trying to foster brand loyalty, try <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/17\/increase-online-presence\">increasing your online presence<\/a> first.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/brand-loyalty-wordstream-amazon-logo.webp\" alt=\"Brand loyalty - Amazon logo.\" width=\"878\" height=\"503\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86147 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/brand-loyalty-wordstream-amazon-logo.webp 878w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/brand-loyalty-wordstream-amazon-logo-480x275.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 878px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A partial logo that\u2019s immediately recognizable? That level of <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/10\/brand-awareness\"><em>brand awareness<\/em><\/a><em> is the goal.<\/em><\/p>\n<div id=\"engage-on-social-media\"><\/div>\n<h3>8. Engage on social media<\/h3>\n<p>Your presence on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/01\/09\/social-media-marketing-strategies\">social media<\/a> is particularly important. According to Sprout Social\u2019s research, <a href=\"https:\/\/sproutsocial.com\/insights\/data\/social-media-connection\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">65%<\/a> of consumers feel more connected to brands that have a robust presence on social media. And social media offers more opportunities for direct engagement.<\/p>\n<p>When customers talk about your product on<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/23\/tiktok-marketing\"> TikTok<\/a>, comment on your brand\u2019s Instagram grid posts, or even tag you in their<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/05\/linkedin-advertising\"> LinkedIn<\/a> updates, you should respond. Take the time to write comments, send DMs thanking them for their business and praise, and even re-share their content with your audience. This goodwill can go a long way.<\/p>\n<div id=\"get-involved-with-your-community\"><\/div>\n<h3>9. Get involved with your community<\/h3>\n<p>Getting involved with your community is an excellent way to deepen your brand identity and strengthen your relationship with your existing customers. Look into organizations in your area. Start with your local chamber of commerce, then look for community business organizations, whether they\u2019re targeted toward small business owners, young professionals, or something else.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, Concord, NH, has a non-profit organization called <a href=\"https:\/\/intownconcord.org\/about-us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In Town Concord<\/a> that organizes events with local businesses.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/brand-loyalty-wordstream-petals-pedals.webp\" alt=\"Brand loyalty - Community event schedule from a local business.\" width=\"845\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86148 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/brand-loyalty-wordstream-petals-pedals.webp 845w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/brand-loyalty-wordstream-petals-pedals-480x341.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 845px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>That\u2019s a lot of local businesses for one small town.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If these organizations don\u2019t exist, or your following is less IRL and more online, consider <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/26\/partner-marketing\">partnering with other businesses<\/a> to co-host events or launch specific product collaborations. This is another great way to tap into the community to build brand loyalty.<\/p>\n<div id=\"launch-a-loyalty-program\"><\/div>\n<h3>10. Launch a loyalty program<\/h3>\n<p>To encourage <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-find-customers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new customers<\/a> to keep coming back to make more purchases, incentivize them with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/18\/loyalty-marketing\">loyalty program<\/a>. This could take a few different shapes, depending on your business. Your loyalty program could be a discounted bundle for recurring services, a tiered system of offerings based on cumulative purchases, or a points-based system accrued on transactions.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/brand-loyalty-wordstream-insider-benefits.webp\" alt=\"Brand loyalty - List of benefits of a brand's loyalty program.\" width=\"607\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86149 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/brand-loyalty-wordstream-insider-benefits.webp 607w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/brand-loyalty-wordstream-insider-benefits-480x474.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 607px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Sephora\u2019s Beauty Insider loyalty program is tiered with points that unlock discounts, sale access, free samples, and more.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>And if these don\u2019t seem to work for your setup, that\u2019s fine. Your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/loyalty-program-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">unique loyalty program<\/a> could even be a physical punch card to keep your customers coming back in until they fill it out.<\/p>\n<div id=\"try-a-referral-program\"><\/div>\n<h3>11. Try a referral program<\/h3>\n<p>A<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/14\/referral-program-ideas\"> referral program<\/a> not only turns good customers into your best salespeople; it also endears them to your brand.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a personal example. Two friends and I talked about my recent switch to Blueland laundry tablets. They were both considering a similar swap. I shared a lot of information about my laundry habits, like my preference for cold water, my stacked washing machine, and my preference for only washing full loads.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the interesting part. While I enthusiastically explained how well the product worked for my use case, I was strengthening my own affinity for the Blueland laundry tablets.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes, the best way to be sold is also to sell. A referral program emboldens your biggest advocates\u2014your repeat customers\u2014to encourage their friends or business contacts to do business with you. That\u2019s next-level loyalty to your brand.<\/p>\n<div id=\"stick-to-your-brand-values\"><\/div>\n<h3>12. Stick to your brand values<\/h3>\n<p>Associating your brand with a specific set of values is a great way to develop strong relationships with like-minded buyers. But it\u2019s important to show commitment to all those values so you don\u2019t chase off your most loyal customers.<\/p>\n<p>Say you promote your products as sustainable and beneficial for the environment. Then, you choose to replace your fully recyclable packaging with a plastic that has to end up in landfills. You\u2019ll break a brand promise and sour your best customer relationships.<\/p>\n<h2>Build brand loyalty to grow your business<\/h2>\n<p>Brand loyalty may not feel as important to growth as generating the next new lead. But when you compare the impact of one customer purchasing ten times versus a one-and-done new customer, the value of a brand-loyalty focus becomes clear.<\/p>\n<p>Use the tips we\u2019ve curated here as a starting point. Test a few to see which ones fit your business and which generate the best response from your customers.<\/p>\n<p><input type=\"hidden\" id=\"hippowiz-ass-injected\" value=\"true\" \/><input
