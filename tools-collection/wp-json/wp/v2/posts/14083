And while you may be doing all the things to promote your shop, there\u2019s one simple-but-powerful way to scale growth without spending a dime: verticalization.<\/p>\n<p>Verticalization is simply the process of making your agency industry-specific. So instead of serving ecommerce, healthcare, and home services clients, you pick one and go all in on it.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at why narrowing your market focus is a sneaky smart way to grow your agency faster. And more importantly, let\u2019s see the plan to do it efficiently and effectively.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f 300 of your agency competitors told us how they choose services, set pricing, and think about challenges.

A sprinter that spends time training for the shot put won\u2019t win many races.<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/17\/how-to-start-a-digital-marketing-agency\">marketing agency<\/a> that becomes the expert in a single vertical will outperform an unfocused generalist. With that success comes the reputation as the go-to agency for other businesses in the same vertical, creating a flywheel of growth.<\/p>\n<h3>Get more relevant referrals<\/h3>\n<p>Why would a SaaS prospect care about the results you\u2019ve driven for a brick-and-mortar client? They really don\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>When you work exclusively in one market, your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">reviews<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/05\/customer-testimonials\">testimonials<\/a> come from businesses very like the ones you\u2019re trying to sign. Your prospects see feedback from people who have the same challenges they do and feel comfortable that you can solve them.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Agency-growth-verticalization-testimonial.webp\" alt=\"Screenshot of a testimonial from a healthcare PPC agency\" width=\"936\" height=\"477\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-79025 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Agency-growth-verticalization-testimonial.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Agency-growth-verticalization-testimonial-480x245.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Verticalized customer testimonials are perfect decoration for your website and landing pages.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Increase lifetime value<\/h3>\n<p>The keys to increasing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/10\/cac-vs-clv\">client lifetime value<\/a> are offering more services and keeping clients around longer.<\/p>\n<p>As you gain insider knowledge of a target industry, you\u2019ll be able to apply it to other services.

It\u2019s a lot easier to grow when you\u2019re not replacing lost clients with new ones.<\/p>\n<h3>Build trust through expertise<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s a lot easier to become an expert in all things <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/11\/ecommerce-ppc\">PPC for ecommerce<\/a> clients than to do the same for multiple verticals.

Onboarding new clients is more efficient, and you deliver better results faster while reducing the overhead to do it.<\/p>\n<h3>Reduce your competition<\/h3>\n<p>There are a lot of multi-vertical agencies. There are considerably fewer agencies that only serve restaurant chains or home repair and maintenance businesses.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Agency-growth-verticalization-real-estate.webp\" alt=\"screenshot of a Google ad for restaurant PPC agency\" width=\"936\" height=\"362\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-79028 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Agency-growth-verticalization-real-estate.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Agency-growth-verticalization-real-estate-480x186.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Your agency will stand out in the crowd when you target a specific vertical.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Plus, now that you\u2019re the go-to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-promote-your-digital-marketing-agency\">agency<\/a> in your industry, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/15\/ppc-agency-pricing\">charge a premium<\/a> for your services over your competitors..<\/p>\n<h2>How to verticalize your agency in seven steps<\/h2>\n<p>The good news is that verticalization isn\u2019t a huge undertaking. The hardest part is committing\u2014it\u2019ll feel weird turning down clients outside of your niche.<\/p>\n<p>Once you set your mind to it, just follow these seven steps and you\u2019re on the way to the riches that come from niches.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Pick a vertical<\/h3>\n<p>This is the most difficult step for many agencies for two reasons. First, you\u2019ll inevitably experience FOMO when opportunities in a different industry pop up. And second, this step requires a good bit of research.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-research\">Keyword research<\/a> is your best friend here. Why? Because if people are searching for an agency in a specific vertical, there\u2019s evidence of demand.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDental marketing agency\u201d and \u201crestaurant marketing agency,\u201d for example, both get searched a couple hundred times a month in the US, which indicates substantial demand. \u201cDance school marketing agency,\u201d on the other hand, doesn\u2019t get searched much at all.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc4bYou can use our free <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">keyword tool<\/a> to learn which industries search the most for digital marketing agencies.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Study your industry<\/h3>\n<p>Got the industry you want to go after? Good. Now it\u2019s time to study.<\/p>\n<p>Winning the trust of advertisers in your target vertical requires you to answer several questions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are the most common <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/28\/pain-points\">pain points<\/a>?<\/li>\n<li>What are the most common obstacles to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/27\/growth-academy\">growth<\/a>?<\/li>\n<li>What are these businesses trying to accomplish?<\/li>\n<li>Who are they trying to get in the door? How long is the average <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/26\/sales-cycle\">sales cycle<\/a>?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To find your answers, follow Reddit threads, industry Slack groups, and influencers on X (FKA Twitter) and LinkedIn.<\/p>\n<p>Empathy plays a huge role in the endeavor. Whenever you spend time learning about your chosen industry, try to imagine yourself in their shoes. That will help you market their business more effectively and make your pitches more effective.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Develop a strategy<\/h3>\n<p>This is where all the knowledge you\u2019ve acquired pays off. Before you start pitching, you need to get the wheels turning on strategy. You\u2019ve got to think in terms of the funnel.<\/p>\n<p>For example, what do conversions look like in this industry?<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve decided to target the local gym scene. Ask yourself: What do gym owners consider conversions? They probably include things like watching a Facebook video, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/07\/call-only-ads\">making a phone call<\/a>, signing up for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/25\/email-newsletter-ideas\">newsletter<\/a>, downloading a guide, scheduling a consultation, doing a trial period, and purchasing a membership.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Agency-growth-verticalization-fitness-ad.webp\" alt=\"screenshot of a fitness ad offering free trial\" width=\"936\" height=\"484\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-79029 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Agency-growth-verticalization-fitness-ad.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Agency-growth-verticalization-fitness-ad-480x248.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>When you understand an industry\u2019s sales funnel, you can tailor ads to move people through it.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve determined those conversion actions, it\u2019s time to figure out how you\u2019re going to drive them. Get <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/08\/facebook-video-ads\">Facebook video<\/a> views by targeting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/facebook-lookalike-audiences\">lookalike audiences<\/a> based on gyms\u2019 current customers. Drive content downloads by targeting the people who watched at least half of those videos. Use the contact information you get from those content downloads to offer free trial periods. You get the idea.<\/p>\n<p>Notice how the strategy you build for customer #1 works for all of your clients? That\u2019s how you scale quickly.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Find new prospects<\/h3>\n<p>Rubber, meet road. You\u2019ve got a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/21\/facebook-funnel\">full-funnel marketing<\/a> strategy built for a specific industry that you know inside and out. Now it\u2019s time to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/01\/how-to-get-clients\">get new clients<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Google searches are, again, a good place to start. Try entering industry specific keywords that match your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">ideal customer<\/a> like \u201cdentists near me\u201d or \u201csmall retail businesses in Oregon.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>You can also search <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/03\/01\/business-directory-listings\">business directories<\/a> like Yelp and others to find businesses that have good reviews and are more active online. Those are often easier to sell to since they value internet traffic.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Review their ads and pitch<\/h3>\n<p>Since you\u2019re just starting out, you\u2019ll probably have to do some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/03\/cold-email\">cold outreach<\/a>. Take the potential prospects you\u2019ve found and evaluate their Google search results.<\/p>\n<p>Are they running paid search ads? If so, are they doing a good job?<\/p>\n<p>If the answer to both of those questions is a resounding no, give those places a call or send an email and let them know how you can help. You can include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/15\/google-ads-benchmarks\">Google Ads industry benchmark costs<\/a> for them to compare as another way to show your vertical expertise.<\/p>\n<p>One word of caution. Be careful how you present this information. You don\u2019t want to insult the people who may hire you.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Audit your work<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ve signed a handful of clients in your new industry\u2026congrats! But your path to verticalization isn\u2019t complete.<\/p>\n<p>The next step is to audit your work against the overall vertical for things like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/quality-score\">Quality Score<\/a>, impression share, and wasted spend. You can use a tool like our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Paid_GGL_Search_AdWords_AdWordsGrader_AWGrader&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=PPC&amp;utm_campaign=paid_freetool&amp;utm_content=rsa&amp;utm_term=check%20adwords&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAvoqsBhB9EiwA9XTWGUPcJYP0pi3_o9KFavl8jq9hfDd8xlcsulgFR5pb2SmE4v3X0esXtRoCdAEQAvD_BwE\">Google Ads Grader<\/a> to complete your audit.<em><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Package the results and recommendations in a verticalized report and send it to your clients.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Find your next client<\/h3>\n<p>Your first successful clients are a fantastic source of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/10\/social-proof-guide\">social proof<\/a>. Use it to gain new clients.<\/p>\n<p>For starters, don\u2019t be afraid to ask your clients for references and reviews. It may feel odd at first, but it\u2019ll be familiar to most people (we all get asked for reviews all the time). Make sure to include the request on invoices, in emails, and have a link on your website so people can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/09\/google-ratings\">rate you on Google<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Use customer testimonials to write up <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/03\/how-to-write-a-case-study\">case studies<\/a> and plaster them all over your website. You can even add it to future client pitches. Any place where a little extra social proof will help win a new client.<\/p>\n<h2>To scale agency growth, go vertical<\/h2>\n<p>It seems counterintuitive to grow faster by narrowing your addressable market. But tripling your new-business close rate in one vertical is much better than failing to win new business in a bunch of them.<\/p>\n<p>To put yourself on the path of growth through verticalization, remember these seven steps:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pick a vertical<\/li>\n<li>Study your industry<\/li>\n<li>Develop a strategy<\/li>\n<li>Find new prospects<\/li>\n<li>Review and pitch<\/li>\n<li>Audit your work<\/li>\n<li>Find your next client<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Ready for more growth?
