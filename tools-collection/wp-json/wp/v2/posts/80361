But the payoff can be huge if you can get it right.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some steps to build a performance marketing strategy that will bring results.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Define your objectives<\/h3>\n<p>To create an effective performance marketing campaign, it is fundamental that you have a clear understanding of what you are trying to accomplish because it will help you define every other step.<\/p>\n<p>Your targets should be specific, measurable, and achievable. It should also be aligned with your overall <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-plan-goals-objectives-for-small-businesses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">business goals<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/smart-goals-acronym.webp\" alt=\"smart goals acronym\" width=\"460\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-80522\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/smart-goals-acronym.webp 460w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/smart-goals-acronym-231x300.webp 231w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For example, social media advertising is a great option if you want to sell a product or service. However, if your goal is to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">drive traffic to your website<\/a>, then paid search might work better.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have identified these goals, they should form the foundation of all your marketing activities. Every campaign should be designed to support them in some way.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Choose the right digital channels<\/h3>\n<p>One of the keys to being successful at performance marketing is using multiple channels. The reality is that not all channels are created equal, and some will work better than others for your particular business.<\/p>\n<p>The best way to do this is by setting up a few channels, testing them with small amounts of money, and tracking the results over time so you can make better decisions in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some common types of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/26\/marketing-channels\">digital marketing strategies<\/a> you can choose from:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Content marketing: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/content-marketing-trends-2024\">Content marketing<\/a> is the process of creating, distributing, and promoting your company\u2019s content to attract potential customers. It can build authority, trust, and loyalty with consumers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Social media marketing: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/local-marketing-lab\/local-social-media-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Social media<\/a> is an essential part of any online marketing strategy. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have become a place where your consumers spend the most time.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Display ads:<\/strong> Display ads are typically placed on news sites, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blogituplife.com\/what-does-blog-stand-for\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blogs<\/a>, or e-commerce sites. These ads often appear in the form of pop-up banners that contain a link back to your website.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Email marketing: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/12\/27\/email-marketing-ios15\">Email marketing<\/a> helps you build relationships with prospects so they trust your brand and buy from you when ready.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/black-friday-email-template-sale.webp\" alt=\"black friday email template - example of black friday sale email to customers\" width=\"336\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76986\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/black-friday-email-template-sale.webp 336w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/black-friday-email-template-sale-168x300.webp 168w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>3. Identify partners<\/h3>\n<p>The biggest challenge of managing a performance marketing campaign is finding the right partners to work with. The relationship you have with your partner can make or break your campaign.<\/p>\n<p>You need to find partners with a vision and goals similar to yours who will help you reach people that matter.<\/p>\n<p>The best partners have access to a large following and provide high-quality leads with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics\">strong conversion rate<\/a>, meaning they&#8217;re more likely to convert into paying customers.<\/p>\n<p>When looking for partners, ensure they offer transparency about their work and methods. This will help you understand what kind of return on investment (ROI) you can expect from working with them over time.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Launch and optimize campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>Now that you have a budget and a target audience, it is time to launch your campaigns. You will need to set up a landing page and website where you intend to direct the traffic from these ads.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have all the elements in place, you&#8217;ll want to optimize your campaigns for performance.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics\">Optimizing for performance<\/a> means constantly tracking and improving the metrics that matter most to your business. You should be looking at how many customers are being acquired, how much they spend, and how long they stay engaged with your brand.<\/p>\n<p>Optimization is a never-ending process because it&#8217;s not about finding and sticking with the winning strategy. Instead, you must constantly test new ideas and see which works best in different situations.<\/p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/23\/optimize-performance-max-campaigns\">optimize your ads<\/a> by changing their keywords or budgets to improve performance.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/google-ads-location-targeting-optimization.webp\" alt=\"google ads location targeting bid optimization\" width=\"936\" height=\"532\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76522\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/google-ads-location-targeting-optimization.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/google-ads-location-targeting-optimization-480x273.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For example, if an ad gets clicks but not conversions (sales), you should make changes or remove the ad altogether. Or, if an ad isn&#8217;t getting any clicks, you&#8217;ll want to try a different approach, keyword, or title until you find something that works better.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Monitor results<\/h3>\n<p>Monitoring the results of your performance marketing campaigns is crucial to your success. The key is understanding what&#8217;s working, what&#8217;s not, and what can be improved.<\/p>\n<p>The best way to track your performance is to use a dedicated software program to give you all the information you need in one place. This way, you&#8217;ll be able to see how each channel is performing and make adjustments as needed.<\/p>\n<p>You should also pay attention to the quality of traffic that your campaigns send to your site. You can do this by looking at bounce rate, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/expected-ctr\">click-through rate (CTR)<\/a>, conversion rate, and other metrics over time.<\/p>\n<p>The results should be monitored daily, and you should also look at the data weekly or monthly. This will help you identify trends and evaluate the performance of your campaigns over time.<\/p>\n<div id=\"performance-marketing-examples\"><\/div>\n<h2>3 performance marketing examples<\/h2>\n<p>Here are some examples of successful performance marketing strategies.<\/p>\n<h3>Dove Chocolate sponsored content on BuzzFeed<\/h3>\n<p>BuzzFeed is a famous digital media company that allows advertising on its website.
