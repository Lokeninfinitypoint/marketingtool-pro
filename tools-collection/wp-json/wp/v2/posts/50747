LinkedIn Stories<\/h3>\n<p>Like most other major social media networks, LinkedIn has now adopted stories, which refresh every 24 hours. Their twist to this is to \u201c<em>Share what\u2019s happening in your professional life<\/em>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Use this post type to\u00a0share tips, updates, and\u00a0hiring alerts, as well as to express your company culture.<em><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/em>This feature also lets you add stickers or overlay text to your video or image, and followers can respond to your story through direct messages\u2014making it even easier for you to start a conversation.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/linkedin-company-page-features-stories.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"646\" alt=\"example of linkedin story\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/27\/linkedin-stories\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>If you want to spice up the video further, you can use one of my favorite video editing tools called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.movavi.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Movavi<\/a> to create the video\u00a0offline and then upload the story to Linkedin. Most people don\u2019t realize it, but this is what the more successful creators do to make their videos stand out on places like <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/22\/instagram-reels-ideas-for-businesses\">Instagram Reels <\/a>and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/11\/advertising-on-tiktok\">TikTok<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>How to create a LinkedIn story:<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>On your homepage, tap on the &#8220;+&#8221; sign on your profile.<\/li>\n<li>Upload a video or image from your gallery. Alternatively, you can record a new one.<\/li>\n<li>Add stickers or text to your video or image.<\/li>\n<li>You have the option to mention any relevant profiles.<\/li>\n<li>Hit &#8220;Share Story&#8221;, and you&#8217;re done.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>You can also add a call to action to your stories. For instance, if you\u2019re able to offer a white paper to individuals who are interested in how your company can help them, you\u2019d tell them to give their email address for access and then use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.onehourprofessor.com\/best-email-marketing-software-services\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">email marketing software<\/a> to automate a follow-up process to convert them to a customer.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/27\/linkedin-stories\">Get more LinkedIn Story tips and ideas here.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>2. Featured Posts<\/h3>\n<p>The Featured Posts\u00a0section is only available for\u00a0individual accounts, but since your account impacts the way others see your business, we&#8217;re including it. Use it to highlight your best work and showcase your expertise and thought leadership.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a great example of featured posts by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/akdefazio\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Akvile DeFazio<\/a>, president of Akvertise, Inc.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/linkedin-company-page-features-featured-posts-example.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"683\" alt=\"example of featured posts on linkedin profile\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You can either link to content you&#8217;ve created that&#8217;s already on the web,\u00a0or upload media like PDFs, slide decks, photos, etc.<\/p>\n<h3>How to add LinkedIn Featured Posts:<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Click on your profile page.<\/li>\n<li>On the \u201cfeatured\u201d tab, click the plus\u00a0icon.<\/li>\n<li>Choose the content type (posts, articles, links, media)<\/li>\n<li>Provide the required information.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-to-add-linkedin-featured-posts.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"376\" alt=\"screenshot of adding linkedin featured posts\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>There is no limit to how many featured posts you can add, and you can reorder\u00a0or delete them directly on your profile page.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Polls<\/h3>\n<p>LinkedIn polls are a great engagement tool where you can get quick feedback from your audience. Use it to find out the\u00a0type of content your audience would like to see more of, or to identify the latest trends in your market so you can make better-informed decisions.<\/p>\n<p>Below is an example from Drift, which uses LinkedIn polls to ask interesting, hypothetical questions that effectively get the audience involved:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/linkedin-company-page-poll-example.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"401\" alt=\"example of linkedin company page poll\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/sproutsocial.com\/insights\/linkedin-features\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>How to create polls on LinkedIn:<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to your feed page.<\/li>\n<li>Click the &#8220;+&#8221; icon to add a new post.<\/li>\n<li>Click that three-dot icon to view more options.<\/li>\n<li>Select &#8220;Create a poll.&#8221;\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/linkedin-company-page-how-to-create-polls.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"465\" alt=\"create poll tab for linkedin company page\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/li>\n<li>Next, add the question and answer options (max four options), and choose a duration for the poll (one day, three days, one week, or two weeks).\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/linkedin-company-page-features-create-a-poll.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"543\" alt=\"poll settings on linkedin\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/li>\n<li>Finally, click &#8220;Done&#8221; and share your poll as a regular post.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>4.

Name pronunciation<\/h3>\n<p>Name pronunciation allows you to record how your name is pronounced and display the audio clip on your profile so others can listen to it. Granted, this isn\u2019t necessarily for Linkedin Company pages, but it can be quite important.<\/p>\n<p>This feature promotes <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/5\/accessibility-inclusivity-advertising\">inclusivity<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0is helpful to use before speaking to\u00a0investors, potential customers, partners, and more.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/linkedin-company-page-features-name-pronounciation.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"283\" alt=\"name pronunciation feature for linkedin profile\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/beebom.com\/linkedin-display-name-pronuciation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>How to record your name on LinkedIn:<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to your profile page.<\/li>\n<li>Click on the &#8220;Edit&#8221; icon.<\/li>\n<li>Click &#8220;Add Name Pronunciation.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Next, tap the &#8220;Record&#8221; icon and record your name.<\/li>\n<li>If you want to re-record, simply click &#8220;Retake.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Once happy with your recording, click &#8220;Apply.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/linkedin-company-page-features-record-name.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"271\" alt=\"record name screen on linkedin\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>7. Reactions<\/h3>\n<p>With LinkedIn\u2019s new \u201cReactions\u201d feature, you no longer get a one-dimensional view of how users engage with your content. In addition to \u201cliking\u201d your post, they can now also:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Celebrate<\/li>\n<li>Show support<\/li>\n<li>Give some love<\/li>\n<li>Find it insightful<\/li>\n<li>Express their curiosity<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So for example, you may get the \u201cSupport\u201d reaction when you share news about your charitable efforts.

Organic \u201ccarousel\u201d posts<\/h3>\n<p>Before this new feature came around, whenever you wanted to share a series of images organically in a post, you had to upload it as a gallery, which was hard to navigate.<\/p>\n<p>Now, you can share a multi-page PDF document on the platform and it will display it as a scrollable carousel.<\/p>\n<p>This format makes it a lot easier to tell a coherent, engaging\u00a0story or set of tips.<\/p>\n<p>The example below shows a State of the Connected Customer report shared as a document by Salesforce, which previews in a convenient carousel format so people can easily scroll through it.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/linkedin-company-page-features-example-organic-carousel-posts.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"568\" alt=\"linkedin organic carousel post example\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/posts\/salesforce_4th-connected-customers-report-activity-6734618241097986048-qlew\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>How to create an organic carousel post on LinkedIn:<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Click on the option to create a new post.<\/li>\n<li>Select the document icon.<\/li>\n<li>Choose which document you want to share.<\/li>\n<li>Add a document title.<\/li>\n<li>To save and publish, click \u201cDone.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>9. LinkedIn Live<\/h3>\n<p>These days, live video is pivotal for<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/19\/social-media-for-small-business\"> social media marketing<\/a> and engagement. That&#8217;s why so many people greeted the new LinkedIn Live feature with enthusiasm.<\/p>\n<p>Compared to native videos on the platform, live videos from the same broadcasters receive up to <a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/marketing-solutions\/linkedin-live#:~:text=Live%20videos%20get%2C%20on%20average%207x%20more%20reactions%20and%2024x,of%20meaningful%20reach%20and%20engagement.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">7x <\/a>more reactions.
