Viewers lose interest over time. This wasn\u2019t a mind-blowing finding to me, but it was also clear that many businesses are making their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/10\/social-media-video-marketing\">marketing videos<\/a> WAY too long.<\/p>\n<p>Just take a look at the 1-minute video below. People start off pretty engaged, even re-watching sections of the video (in red), but as time goes-on viewers begin to drop-off midway, ending with far fewer viewers than in the first half of the video.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6961e2f8-2133-4d79-9fe7-ac6c223b2dad\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/video-engagement-visualization.png\" alt=\"optimizing video engagement\" width=\"512\" height=\"285\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Even more interesting, take a look at the graph below, which summarized millions of data points from 2009-2012:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c724555c-2517-4ce6-b314-4bd186e6baf8\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/video-length-versus-views.png\" alt=\"video length versus view completion\" width=\"580\" height=\"400\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>This proves that yes, video length matters.

Yet you\u2019ve suffered a laundry list of injuries, not to mention your car is totaled. You want justice, but you don\u2019t have a lawyer or any affordable referrals to fall back on so you\u2019ve found yourself on Google.<\/p>\n<p>Browsing text on website after website isn\u2019t giving you any idea of which direction to take until you find that video of the friendly lawyer with 20 years of experience, and a trusting and welcoming air about him. This sense of trust couldn\u2019t be achieved just by <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/08\/persuasive-landing-pages\">persuasive copy on a landing page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"59e540f2-05df-4df8-8039-a3f0671c8729\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/law-firm-marketing-video.png\" alt=\"video landing pages improve conversion rate\" width=\"520\" height=\"308\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>This technique isn\u2019t just useful for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/06\/29\/law-firm-marketing\">the law industry<\/a>. Remember, videos have been proven to increase conversion rates by 80%. Use video on your landing page to put a face to your business, help your leads trust you, and convert faster.<\/p>\n<h2>#5: Send Personalized Videos to Prospects<\/h2>\n<p>Another way to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/26\/sales-cycle\">speed up the sales process<\/a> and raise conversion rates is to send personalized videos to prospects over email. More often than not, salespeople spend half their day <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/16\/landing-a-big-ppc-account\">struggling to get leads on the phone<\/a>. They answer one email, perhaps agree to a call, but then: radio silence.<\/p>\n<p>How do you re-engage these leads that are mimicking the behavior of your flakiest friends?<\/p>\n<p>Video, duh. There are tons of companies out there that have successfully adapted video email messages, like this one from a Bamboo HR sales representative below (<a href=\"https:\/\/home.wistia.com\/medias\/m8wzbi1vdr\">click here to watch the video<\/a>):<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"dd946688-629b-41a5-9010-2fcdcb14ad3c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/personalized-video-email-2.png\" alt=\"personalized videos\" width=\"650\" height=\"527\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Not only does this create a more personalized and human sales experience, but it makes the lead feel like you actually care, in turn making it much more likely for them to be open to discussing your products or offerings with them.<\/p>\n<p>And Bamboo HR is not the only company that\u2019s had success with this strategy.

With these strategies, you can use video to actually grow your business.<\/p>\n<h2>#6: Leverage Video Viewership Knowledge with Marketing Automation<\/h2>\n<p>With the right tools it\u2019s possible to build lists and score leads based off of video viewership data. Pretty cool, huh? A lot of marketers out there are spending their days emerged in Marketo, HubSpot, and other marketing automation platforms, and as they\u2019re segmenting their audiences to send out targeted content and push leads down the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/07\/marketing-funnel\">marketing funnel<\/a>, they\u2019re also often ignoring a HUGE impact of the buying cycle: video.<\/p>\n<p>Wouldn\u2019t it be helpful to segment viewers based on those who have watched 75% &#8211; 100% of your video? Or to nudge viewers who have only watched 25% of your video to watch more? Or to up the score of a lead based on their viewership data? This is all possible if you\u2019re hosting your videos with a platform that integrates with your marketing automation system.<\/p>\n<p>Knowledge is power, especially in these situations. Don\u2019t let your leads slip away by not knowing enough about them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Did you know that smart use of video can dramatically increase your conversion rates?
