With countless deliverables to push out to keep your small business running, social media marketing can seem like a non-essential tactic that is easy to push to the wayside when things get hectic.<\/p>\n<p>But I wouldn\u2019t write social media off that quickly.<\/p>\n<p>We know that people are spending more and more time on their phones, and a lot of that time is spent on social media apps.

Even better, social media is also an effective platform for lead generation. You can create the content and resources that will provide added value to your prospects and customers, all the while nurturing their brand affinity. When users click on your content or offer, they are actively looking for it or opting in to receive updates by following your business. Because these people have already opted in, they\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/08\/brand-affinity-marketing\">likelier to convert<\/a> than a random person seeing an ad or offer unrelated to what they need.<\/p>\n<p>Social media is a free and easy tool for businesses to connect directly with people interested in their brand, and it\u2019s fun (c\u2019mon, we have gifs!).

Try to make your username or URL your business name (or as close to your business name as possible) so consumers can easily find you online. On platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, and YouTube, make sure to set yourself and any of your colleagues or business partners that would need access as admins. You can set different permissions for each person based on the work they will be doing in the account.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have set up each account, entered the necessary information about your business, and added in your logo as your account photo, you\u2019re ready to start sharing.<\/p>\n<p><em>Alright, now it&#8217;s time to get into your strategy for each of these platforms.

If you are looking to drive engagement on your Stories or would like feedback for a product or campaign, you can use a poll or ask an open-ended question for your followers to answer. You can also overlay music to instill a certain emotion, write a bunch of text for an announcement, take casual photos and videos, pop in a countdown, or tag a person or location. Stories are also a great way to show some behind-the-scenes content for your audience to get more acquainted with your business.
