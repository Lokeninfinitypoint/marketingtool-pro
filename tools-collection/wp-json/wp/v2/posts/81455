Through the lens of search engine optimization (SEO), keyword research is the practice of identifying keywords related to your products or services that people are actively searching for on Google, then optimizing your website for those keywords. This allows your site to show up higher than your competitors in the search engine results page (SERP).<\/p>\n<p>Sounds simple enough, right? And it is. But when we talk about keyword <em>mapping<\/em>, we\u2019re talking about something slightly different than keyword research, but equally as important.<\/p>\n<p>In this post, we\u2019re going to talk about exactly what keyword mapping is and how you can implement it in a way that drives quality traffic for your business. We\u2019ll also share a simple template you can use to get started on your keyword mapping efforts.<\/p>\n<h3>Table of contents<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#what-is-keyword-mapping\">What is keyword mapping?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#why-is-keyword-mapping-important\">Why is keyword mapping important?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#how-does-keyword-mapping-work\">How does keyword mapping work?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#how-to-do-keyword-mapping\">How to do keyword mapping<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#how-to-use-keyword-mapping-for-seo\">How to use keyword mapping for on-page SEO<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#keyword-mapping-template\">Keyword mapping template<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"what-is-keyword-mapping\"><\/div>\n<h2>What is keyword mapping?<\/h2>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re just getting started <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/seo-keyword\">researching keywords for your SEO strategy<\/a>, or you\u2019ve been doing it for a long time, chances are you\u2019ve come across two problems:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>You keep finding keywords that are related, or semi-related to one another, and you don\u2019t know whether they should be included on the same piece of content, or which keyword should be your \u201ctarget\u201d keyword.<\/li>\n<li>You already have pages on your site that align with some of the keywords you\u2019re finding, but they\u2019re not <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/seo-content-beginners-guide\">fully optimized for those keywords<\/a>, or don\u2019t include all of the keywords you\u2019re finding.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Keyword mapping is the natural solution to both of these very typical conundrums.<\/p>\n<p>Keyword mapping, in a nutshell, is the process of identifying cluster keywords that you can optimize for specific pages on your site. A cluster of keyword are keywords that are semantically similar to one another in meaning or intent, meaning that the person who is searching for one keyword might realistically be looking for information on another keyword in a given cluster.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd0e Need help finding the right keywords before getting started with keyword mapping?

But when you dig deeper into the keyword on your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/best-seo-tools\">SEO tool<\/a>, which, because it has the highest volume in this given cluster, we will call the \u201cparent keyword,\u201d you see that people who search for \u201cmetal roof cost\u201d are also searching for all kinds of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/27\/lsi-keywords\">semantically similar or related keywords<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/keyword-research-for-keyword-mapping.webp\" alt=\"keyword tool showing related keywords for keyword mapping\" width=\"820\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81472\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/keyword-research-for-keyword-mapping.webp 820w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/keyword-research-for-keyword-mapping-480x350.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 820px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Oof.

We also do a quick search on Google and see that blog posts optimized for \u201cmetal roof cost\u201d are also answering questions like \u201chow much does a metal roof cost,\u201d \u201caverage cost of metal roof,\u201d and \u201c1,500 sq ft metal roof cost.\u201d Furthermore, when we enter these queries into Google, we see that the search results contain the same posts as the search results for \u201cmetal roof cost.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/keyword-mapping-google-search.webp\" alt=\"google search for average cost of metal roof\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81473\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/keyword-mapping-google-search.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/keyword-mapping-google-search-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s great! Because there are no posts in this SERP targeting \u201caverage cost of metal roof\u201d as the primary keyword, we can safely assume that we should include it as a \u201csecondary\u201d or \u201cancillary\u201d keyword in our post targeting \u201cmetal roof cost.\u201d Ideally, because this keyword has strong search volume, we should include it as an H2, along with the other secondary keywords discussed above.<\/p>\n<p>Taking another look at our cluster, we see that \u201cmetal roof vs shingles cost\u201d also has great search volume (3.6K). Should we include this as a secondary keyword as well? Let\u2019s see what the search results tell us.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/keyword-mapping-search.webp\" alt=\"google search results for metal roof vs shingle roof search\" width=\"780\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81474\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/keyword-mapping-search.webp 780w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/keyword-mapping-search-480x369.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 780px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Clearly, Google has determined that people who are searching for this keyword get the most use out of an entire blog post on that specific topic, not a post of metal roofing costs that covers \u201cmetal roof vs shingles cost\u201d as a sub-topic. Therefore, this keyword deserves its own post.<\/p>\n<p>The same goes for a keyword, from our initial cluster list, like \u201cstanding seam metal roof cost.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/how-to-do-keyword-mapping-example.webp\" alt=\"google search for standing seam roof cost\" width=\"936\" height=\"465\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81476\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/how-to-do-keyword-mapping-example.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/how-to-do-keyword-mapping-example-480x238.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Enter this query into Google and you\u2019ll see that nearly all the top content is optimized for standing seam roofs specifically. That means that this keyword deserves its own post as well.<\/p>\n<p>Does that mean that you can\u2019t address standing seam roofs or shingles in your post targeting \u201cmetal roof cost?\u201d Absolutely not. Doing so provides more useful information for your reader and gives your post an opportunity to rank for a more diverse set of keywords. But it shouldn\u2019t be the focus of your post. And, if you want to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">drive as much traffic as possible<\/a>, you should spend more time crafting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/14\/google-e-e-a-t\">quality, unique content<\/a> around those other keywords.<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-use-keyword-mapping-for-seo\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to use keyword mapping for on-page SEO<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve talked at length in this post about \u201coptimizing\u201d content for a given keyword in your keyword map, but what exactly does that mean? After you\u2019ve done the hard work of breaking out your clusters (using the handy template we\u2019ll provide in a second), how do you actually rank for the keywords you\u2019re targeting with net new content?<\/p>\n<p>The key here is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/06\/on-page-seo\">on-page SEO<\/a>. In order to show up on page one of the search results for a given keyword, your post needs to follow a certain structure and adhere to certain rules that Google has defined as necessary to understand and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/09\/google-ranking-factors\">rank content<\/a>. The most critical components of on-page SEO when it comes to ranking for the keywords you\u2019ve mapped are the following:<\/p>\n<h3>Keyword optimization<\/h3>\n<p>As mentioned above, identifying a keyword is only half the battle. You need to make sure your keyword appears throughout your page: in your title tag, meta description, H1, H2s, and throughout the body content.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Including keywords throughout these different page elements tells Google that your page is relevant for a given search query.<\/p>\n<h3>Optimize meta tags<\/h3>\n<p>Your meta <a href=\"https:\/\/gannett-my.sharepoint.com\/:w:\/r\/personal\/ahoward_gannett_com\/Documents\/Aug%206th.docx?d=w74a63ac6878b4a64842c5ced46f1c3dd&amp;csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=0E8t0z\">title<\/a> should be under 60 characters to ensure it displays fully in the search engine. Your meta descriptions should be around 150-160 characters, and include an enticing call-to-action. Both <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/meta-tags\">meta tags<\/a> should contain your target keyword, and should be relevant and compelling.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/heading-tags-for-seo.webp\" alt=\"example of heading tags for seo\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81477\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/heading-tags-for-seo.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/heading-tags-for-seo-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Optimize URL structure<\/h3>\n<p>Create clean and descriptive URLs that provide a clear indication of the page\u2019s content. Avoid using long and complex URLs with unnecessary characters or numbers. Instead, use hyphens to separate words and keep the URL concise. We provided a couple examples of how to do this effectively in the image of our keyword mapping template below.<\/p>\n<p>There are other aspects of on-page SEO, but in terms of leveraging your keyword map to make sure the right pieces of content are showing up for the right keywords, these are the elements to which you need to pay the most attention.<\/p>\n<div id=\"keyword-mapping-template\"><\/div>\n<h2>Keyword mapping template<\/h2>\n<p>Now let\u2019s talk about the keyword mapping template we promised at the onset of this post. As you start grouping these keywords from your initial cluster by intent, you can and should add them to a template like this:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/keyword-mapping-template.webp\" alt=\"keyword mapping template from wordstream\" width=\"936\" height=\"275\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81478\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/keyword-mapping-template.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/keyword-mapping-template-480x141.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Want to use this same template?
