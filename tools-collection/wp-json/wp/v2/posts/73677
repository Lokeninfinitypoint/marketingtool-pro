The scale of your website, whether you deal with ecommerce, and the industry you\u2019re in can all impact website maintenance costs.<\/p>\n<p>Because of the many factors influencing website maintenance costs, estimates vary. Still, some experts estimate annual website costs at anywhere from <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/website\/how-much-website-cost#:~:text=The%20average%20cost%20of%20maintaining%20a%20website%20ranges%20from%20$400,in%20a%20major%20website%20redesign.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$400 to $60,000 every year<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the many factors in the cost of website maintenance, there are some common elements that you can prepare for, regardless of industry or platform.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Domain renewal: <\/strong>$10-100\/year<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/09\/what-is-an-ssl-certificate\">SSL certificate<\/a>: <\/strong>$0-200\/year<\/li>\n<li><strong>Premium plugins\/Extensions: <\/strong>Varies<\/li>\n<li><strong>Site redesign: <\/strong>$0-75,000<\/li>\n<li><strong>Secure email hosting: <\/strong>$2-25\/monthly per-person<\/li>\n<li><strong>IT specialist: <\/strong>~83,000\/year salary<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/website-maintenance-types-of-ssl-certificates.jpg\" alt=\"website maintenance cost - factor the type of ssl certificate you need\" width=\"895\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-73716\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/website-maintenance-types-of-ssl-certificates.jpg 895w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/website-maintenance-types-of-ssl-certificates-480x322.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 895px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Different types of SSL certificates<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind the above is by no means an exhaustive list.

And if you\u2019re in a heavily-regulated industry, like health or security, you will have added security certification costs, and so on.<\/p>\n<h3>Mastering website maintenance\u2014regardless of budget<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s no hiding the fact that a lot goes into website maintenance. And yes, maintenance can eat up a sizable budget. But it doesn\u2019t have to.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of the size of your organization, you\u2019ve gotten where you are because you have expertise. Leverage the resources you have and you can keep your site running safe and sound, all year round.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No\/limited IT team? <\/strong>Leverage tools and automation to counter IT limitations. Automate your backups through your provider or platform, streamline broken backlink hunting with tools, and set security updates to run automatically.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Limited design budget? <\/strong>Take advantage of the many design tools available online and utilize any templates they offer. If you can\u2019t afford an in-house designer, find a reputable freelancer who can tackle your major site overhauls and batches of content as needed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Lacking SEO or content expertise? <\/strong>While there\u2019s no substitute for true content specialists, there are ways to reap the site maintenance benefits of content even if you lack a team. Interview your subject matter experts and turn their transcripts into blogs, then hire a freelance editor to clean things up or use one of the many great <a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/blog\/14-essential-writing-and-editing-tools-to-polish-your-website-content\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online editing tools<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Ideally, you can clear out every item covered in this maintenance checklist. Even if you can\u2019t, use whatever internal resources you have, take your time, and stay organized while working through the list.<\/p>\n<h2>Getting the most out of a well-maintained website<\/h2>\n<p>Having a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/websites-landing-pages\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">well-maintained website<\/a> is no small feat.
