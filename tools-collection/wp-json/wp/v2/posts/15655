You\u2019ll have to work hard to meet Google\u2019s requirements even before you start to worry about keeping your reviews up.<\/p>\n<p>First, you have to get enough reviews for Google to automatically add these reviews to your ads. According to their <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/merchants\/answer\/190657?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">guidelines<\/a>, you\u2019ll need at least 150 to get started.<\/p>\n<p>On top of that, you\u2019ll need to ensure that the composite review\u00a0of all your reviews is at least 3.5 stars. If your whole site\u2019s average drops below this, then you\u2019ll lose your Google Shopping reviews entirely until they\u00a0gets back above that threshold.<\/p>\n<p>From there, you\u2019ll need to get at least 30+ reviews over a 12-month span to keep your Shopping reviews.<\/p>\n<p>If you meet all of these requirements, then your ads will always have customer reviews displayed prominently. And as we\u2019ve seen, this will help you sell.<\/p>\n<p>But how do you go about getting these reviews for your site and products?<\/p>\n<p>In years past, you had to undergo the difficult process to become a Trusted Store and link it to your Google Ads account. Thankfully, that\u2019s long behind us.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7222f77a-f70e-4a15-9b6b-ca56916d336f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-shopping-reviews-trusted-stores.jpg\" alt=\"Google shopping reviews trusted stores\" width=\"816\" height=\"219\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cpcstrategy.com\/blog\/2018\/08\/what-are-google-customer-reviews\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image Source<\/a><\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p>These days, Google pulls these reviews from at least five different areas:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/merchants\/answer\/7124018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Customer Reviews<\/a>, which is a free service that collects comments after a customer completes a purchase. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"http:\/\/stellaservice.com\/seller-ratings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">StellaPulse<\/a>, a third-party company that analyzes the overall quality of your service by collecting data from your current customers.<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Performance metrics from shopping research led by Google.<\/li>\n<li>The ratings you receive on Google Consumer Surveys, which collect info on certain brands.<\/li>\n<li>Shopping reviews left for your store domain from a list of 32 approved reviewing platforms.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When you combine all of these different sources, the bar to get 150 reviews seems quite a bit lower.

And one of the best is to use the Google Customer Reviews automation to help capture your rating immediately after purchase.<\/p>\n<p>But you shouldn\u2019t just rely on automation. To get the best reviews, you need to be proactive, which means you need to develop a strategy.<\/p>\n<p>To get started, you need to ask your customers for reviews. A study by Stanford <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gsb.stanford.edu\/insights\/francis-flynn-if-you-want-something-ask-it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">published in 2008<\/a> has long been the standard that many businesses ignore. The study found that the best way to get what you wanted from someone was to just ask.<\/p>\n<p>That sounds simple enough. But how do you ask? This is where the strategy comes into play.<\/p>\n<p>One of the best time-tested examples to get more reviews on any site or in any format is to simply send an email:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c8f7ab5e-02f0-41b7-9281-d78cc72a72fd\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-shopping-reviews-email.jpg\" alt=\"Google shopping reviews email example\" width=\"613\" height=\"566\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>You can also incentivize customer to review their purchases by offering discount codes or points, as in the Express example above.<\/p>\n<p>Or you can use a tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grade.us\/home\/labs\/google-review-link-generator\">Grade Us<\/a> to create shortened links to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/16\/get-more-google-reviews\">Google reviews<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"15a214c9-e264-4026-8d20-987762ed0f37\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-shopping-reviews-link-generator.jpg\" alt=\"Google shopping reviews link generator\" width=\"1008\" height=\"248\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>These can be\u00a0used to send to customers via an email, SMS message, or even over Facebook Messenger.
