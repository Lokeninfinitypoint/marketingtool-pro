Why leave your house to make money when you don\u2019t have to? No more commute, no more expensive lunches and inescapable coworkers. We have the best small business ideas that you can make happen right from the comfort of your home.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Childcare business<\/h3>\n<p>After entire families were stuck at home together for months on end, daycare providers are in high-demand for parents who transitioned to remote work. The best part? If you are a stay-at-home parent, you can offer daycare out of your home and take care of your kids at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>Average yearly salary: $29,000<\/p>\n<h3>2. Virtual fitness trainer<\/h3>\n<p>During and after the pandemic, gyms saw huge drops in membership numbers and influencers had a field day with\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/11\/at-home-diy-video\">DIY at-home videos<\/a>. People figured out that they don\u2019t need to go all the way into a gym to exercise. And the rise of video fitness trainers created an interest in a variety of exercise experiences. Which is a fancy way of saying that online fitness training, on YouTube, Instagram, via the MindBody app, and more, is a thriving business model.<\/p>\n<p>Salaries for trainers range from $30,000 &#8211; $70,000 per year, but the money you make online would be dependent on your pricing model.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/best-small-business-ideas-from-home-online-fitness-kayla.png\" alt=\"best-small-business-ideas-from-home-online-fitness-kayla\" width=\"720\" height=\"365\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52433 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/best-small-business-ideas-from-home-online-fitness-kayla.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/best-small-business-ideas-from-home-online-fitness-kayla-480x243.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/kaylaitsines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Fitness trainer or not, video is the way to go.

Web developer<\/h3>\n<p>Learning to be a web developer does require training and upfront schooling costs. However, there are plenty of boot camps that will get you up to speed. And the best thing about web development is that you can choose a plethora of specialities, from focusing on marketing websites to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigcommerce.com\/articles\/ecommerce-website-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ecommerce websites<\/a> to blogs&#8230;basically anything you can browse on the internet.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not looking to actually be a web developer, consider starting a small business to manage them. Freelance web development is in high demand!<\/p>\n<p>Web dev salaries are fairly high, starting around $60,000 per year and going up to $150,000 depending on your skillset and location.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Executive assistant<\/h3>\n<p>As the economy experiences massive growth through tech, there are plenty of up-and-coming c-suite executives who somehow never learned to schedule meetings (shots fired). But really, being an executive assistant can take place from the comfort of your home at a remote company, and if your executive is looking for part-time help, you can take on more than one. And there you have it, a burgeoning small business from home!<\/p>\n<p>Executive assistant salaries start around $60k.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Nonprofit Work<\/h3>\n<p>Starting a small business is a lot easier when you know you\u2019re <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/22\/cause-based-marketing\">contributing a net-good to your community<\/a>. Starting a nonprofit isn\u2019t easy, but it can be done remotely, particularly if you\u2019re looking to run this business yourself. Pick a cause that you feel passionately about and dive right in.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/best-small-businesses-from-home-nonprofit.png\" alt=\"best-small-businesses-from-home-nonprofit\" width=\"720\" height=\"475\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52435 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/best-small-businesses-from-home-nonprofit.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/best-small-businesses-from-home-nonprofit-480x317.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=K8oTxj_fEl0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"unique-small-business-ideas\"><\/div>\n<h2>Unique small business ideas<\/h2>\n<p>What do we mean by \u201cgood\u201d small businesses? We mean evergreen, stable businesses that provide a service people will always need. Anecdotally, my grandfather heard Hoover promise to put a chicken in everyone\u2019s pot. People will always eat chicken. So he started a chicken business. Don\u2019t worry, these small business ideas don\u2019t require plucking feathers.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Translator<\/h3>\n<p>As the world becomes more global, the need for translation services continues to rise. Some of that involves translating emails, documents, and content, but others are more service-oriented, like accompanying groups or business leaders on international trips. It\u2019s important to note that you\u2019ll not only need conversational translation skills but also grammatical and structural understanding of a language.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Tutor<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re an adult who has graduated from high school and\/or college, you likely have something to teach kids. If you have an affinity for teaching, try out tutoring first. Not only can you tutor multiple students, you can dabble in different subject matter, like SATs or remedial Spanish. The time commitment stays according to what you want and small tutoring businesses are in high-demand, even remotely.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Nanny<\/h3>\n<p>People just keep having babies!\u00a0If you love playing with kids, using your imagination and packing snacks, a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/childcare-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nanny business<\/a> might be for you. Depending on your level of commitment to one family, sometimes nannying positions offer food, board, and benefits, or you could be a part time nanny!<\/p>\n<h3>9. IT consulting<\/h3>\n<p>This is a small business that is always needed by other small businesses. If you know your way around an IT stack and know how to fix it when it breaks, make a website and start collecting payments because you\u2019re in high demand.<\/p>\n<p>IT professionals are well-compensated by job or by the hour.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/best-small-business-ideas-from-home-technology-consulting.jpeg\" alt=\"best-small-business-ideas-from-home-technology-consulting\" width=\"600\" height=\"427\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52438 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/best-small-business-ideas-from-home-technology-consulting.jpeg 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/best-small-business-ideas-from-home-technology-consulting-480x342.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wpamelia.com\/technology-consulting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>10. Online advertiser<\/h3>\n<p>At this point, to\u00a0say that digital marketing is an ever-growing industry is to say that the sky is blue. It&#8217;s a fact and businesses that want to survive must invest in <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/04\/best-marketing-strategies-2021\">online marketing strategies<\/a>, but small business owners wearing many hats don&#8217;t have time to learn or keep up with the ever-changing platforms.

Handyman<\/h3>\n<p>Jack of all trades, master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one. While I am in the process of renovating an old house, I have never appreciated handymen more. If you are handy around the house and like figuring out how to fix things, a handyman business could be for you.<\/p>\n<p>Payment for handymen varies based on the type and length of a job.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Related:<\/strong> <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/22\/advertising-benchmarks-home-services-2021\">Home Services Advertising Benchmarks<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>12. Event planner<\/h3>\n<p>This may fall into creative small businesses, but it is also a fairly steady job (despite the pandemic). People will always celebrate birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, holidays, and need help with planning the events. If you are hyper-organized, can herd cats with the best of them, and have attention to detail, consider planning events!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/small-profitable-business-ideas-event-planner.png\" alt=\"small-profitable-business-ideas-event-planner\" width=\"720\" height=\"332\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52439 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/small-profitable-business-ideas-event-planner.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/small-profitable-business-ideas-event-planner-480x221.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/vanessamvalerius\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>13. Transcriptionist<\/h3>\n<p>With<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/15\/video-content-marketing\"> video content<\/a> becoming more popular by the year, transcription services become even more important. In fact, I was desperately searching for transcriptions just last week. Now, I\u2019m referring to casual marketing video transcription but for a legal or court transcriptionist or medical, you\u2019ll need certifications that are fairly affordable to get.<\/p>\n<p>Transcriptionists make an average of $52,000 per year.<\/p>\n<h3>14. Movers<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019ve seen a rash of big moves the past few years with people exiting urban areas to purchase homes in the suburbs\u2014and some migration back to big cities as well. Moving isn\u2019t fun for anyone and small moving companies have made a fortune on this real estate boom. Get in on the action by starting a small moving business.<\/p>\n<p>Movers typically get paid per hour or per job, if it\u2019s a multi-day, out-of-state move.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/good-small-business-ideas-exela-movers.png\" alt=\"good-small-business-ideas-exela-movers\" width=\"720\" height=\"337\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52440 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/good-small-business-ideas-exela-movers.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/good-small-business-ideas-exela-movers-480x225.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/exelamovers.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>15. Antiquities renovation<\/h3>\n<p>Okay, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ve never heard of this one, and it likely mostly applies to people who live in historic areas. However, there is a niche market for people who are able to restore and reinstall original fixtures in old homes, from cabinet pulls to bricks and old window panes. In fact, I just bought 200 year old bricks specific to my town to place in the house I\u2019m renovating. So if vintage charm is your style, this small business may also be.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc95 <strong>Want more tips and ideas?<\/strong> We&#8217;ve got 130+ for you!

Short-term rental manager<\/h3>\n<p>Once upon a time, my parents rented out half of their house on AirBnb. They made a killing in their little hotel-less town with grandparents visiting family, families in between homes, and business people staying for a consulting project. Eventually they stopped Airbnb because it was too much work for my mom to clean and sanitize after every guest.<\/p>\n<p>Point of the story: rental managers are largely successful and becoming even more so with the rise of home rentals. Reach out to local Airbnb and VRBO hosts to see how you can help manage their rentals acting as a sort-of superintendent for guests.<\/p>\n<p>Rental manager salaries are dependent on where you are located, but most profitable in urban centers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/easy-small-business-ideas-airbnb-manager.png\" alt=\"easy-small-business-ideas-airbnb-manager\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52442 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/easy-small-business-ideas-airbnb-manager.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/easy-small-business-ideas-airbnb-manager-480x320.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=njqKbWaXgac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"easy-small-business-ideas-for-teens-or-adults\"><\/div>\n<h2>Easy small business ideas for teens or adults<\/h2>\n<p>Looking for a side hustle that doesn\u2019t take too much effort? Same. We found the easiest small businesses to start that will also be (we hope) fun too!<\/p>\n<h3>17. Pet care<\/h3>\n<p>Not to disregard the effort that goes into raising pets, taking care of pets can be the best job ever. You can be a dog walker, a cat sitter, check on chickens, feed horses, the list goes on and on. You can choose which jobs you want to take, what hours you want to work, and sometimes you\u2019ll get to house sit as an added bonus.<\/p>\n<p>Pet sitter businesses make between $10-$25 per hour, depending on the number of pets and your location.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/easy-small-business-ideas-pet-care-pebble.png\" alt=\"easy-small-business-ideas-pet-care-pebble\" width=\"720\" height=\"527\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52441 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/easy-small-business-ideas-pet-care-pebble.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/easy-small-business-ideas-pet-care-pebble-480x351.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/pebblenaturals.com\/pages\/about-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>18. Proofreading\/quality assurance<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019m pretty stoked on this one. Yes, being a proofreader and QA specialist are different&#8230;but also very similar. If you are a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/23\/self-editing-tips\">good writer <\/a>and have a knack for noticing tiny details, these jobs might be for you. They are always in high demand, because who has time to check their own work these days, and you can easily pick up work on UpWork or a number of other freelance sites until your portfolio is ready to launch your small business.<\/p>\n<p>Proofreaders and QA specialists can get paid up to $80,000 per year.<\/p>\n<h3>19. Notary<\/h3>\n<p>Ever need something notarized and don\u2019t know where to go? Luckily, I know some small business owners who have a notary on-call. Becoming a notary isn\u2019t the easiest process, but it isn\u2019t expensive. And once you\u2019re done, you too can be an on-call notary or offer your services to courthouses and small businesses full-time.<\/p>\n<p>Notary salaries have a broad range from $20,000-$52,000 per year. But being able to choose when to work (or not) while you have a high-demand certification will come in clutch.<\/p>\n<h3>20. Personal shopper<\/h3>\n<p>Being a personal shopper is the dream of so many fashion students. Imagine being able to shop for the perfect jewelry, clothing, furnishings, and not actually having to pay for any of it! With the expansion of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/11\/increase-online-store-sales\">online ecommerce stores<\/a>, most of this job can be done remotely. And personal shoppers are well-compensated, earning about $60,000 per year.<\/p>\n<div id=\"creative-small-business-ideas-for-women\"><\/div>\n<h2>Creative small business ideas for women<\/h2>\n<p>Want to start a small business to lean into your creative juices? Maybe you work in a corporate environment and excel sheets have dried up your brain. I\u2019m all for having a creative outlet, and if you can make money off of it, even better. Here are our creative small business ideas.<\/p>\n<h3>21. Landscaper<\/h3>\n<p>If I had leaned into the plant-mom craze, I might want to be a landscaper, but I hate gardening. However, if you\u2019re the type of person who gets stress relief from gardening, landscaping might be for you.<\/p>\n<p>This can be one of the most satisfying, creative jobs. You\u2019ll have the ability to transform properties into magic gardens\u2014or at least maintain green lawns, flower beds, ponds, and make people happy.<\/p>\n<p>Landscaper pay can be between $10-25\/hour, or you can price your services by project.<\/p>\n<h3>22. Gift kit creator<\/h3>\n<p>Ever receive a box in the mail full of customized snacks, wine, gadgets, and knick-knacks? I\u2019ve been loving the gift boxes I receive now that I\u2019m <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/16\/working-remotely\">working fully remote<\/a>. And you better believe I love working with gift kit creators, who search markets far and wide to curate the perfect batch for their audiences. Gift kit businesses don\u2019t require too much upfront, as you can ask the buyer to pay before purchasing and drop shipping any items.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/creative-small-business-ideas-gift-box-business.png\" alt=\"creative-small-business-ideas-gift-box-business\" width=\"720\" height=\"314\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52443 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/creative-small-business-ideas-gift-box-business.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/creative-small-business-ideas-gift-box-business-480x209.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/packedwithpurpose.gifts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>23. Travel planner<\/h3>\n<p>This is my dream job. Travel planners get perks galore, from discounted hotel rates to inside info about airlines and tour guides. It can be the most creative small business through planning trips in a niche&#8211;maybe your specialty is South America or Iceland trips for college kids or seniors! Even better, this business can be run from home&#8230;or anywhere in the world.<\/p>\n<p>Travel agents typically get paid between $35,000-$67,000 per year.<\/p>\n<h3>24. Influencer<\/h3>\n<p>While some people might not consider <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/23\/how-to-become-a-social-media-influencer\">being an influencer<\/a> a creative business, I certainly think the trendsetters of the world would differ.

Thrifting reseller<\/h3>\n<p>Thrifting, altering, and upselling vintage goods was the way NastyGal got their start\u2014and has now become somewhat of an online business. If you have an affinity for spotting diamonds in the rough, hit your local goodwill, grab some clothes, make an eBay account, and get selling. You can be your own boss, designer, brand, or whatever you please with this creative small business.<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-do-you-find-the-best-businesses-to-start\"><\/div>\n<h2>How do you\u00a0find the best business to start?<\/h2>\n<p>The most successful businesses solve a problem for a specific\u00a0group of people.
