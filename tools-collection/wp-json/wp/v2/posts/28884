They\u2019re there to stop you in your tracks, make you picture yourself owning whatever it is they\u2019re selling, and force you to cross the psychological threshold and walk into the store to buy it.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-ad-headlines-creepy-mannequins.jpg\" alt=\"PPC ad headlines creepy store window mannequins\" width=\"600\" height=\"390\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Of course, window dressing is one way to get prospective customers\u2019 attention, but online, this task falls to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/22\/google-ad-copy-mistakes\">your PPC ads<\/a>. Even if you have the best product or service since sliced bread (or Uber), it won\u2019t matter if you can\u2019t tempt prospects to click on your ads.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve written about the importance of compelling ad copy in the past, but in this post, I\u2019ll be focusing exclusively on how to craft great PPC ad headlines. Here are 21 tips to help you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/28\/facebook-ad-headlines\">write ad headlines your prospects simply won\u2019t be able to resist clicking<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Include keywords<\/h2>\n<p>This one might seem like a no-brainer, but I\u2019m consistently amazed by how many ads I see with vague, ambiguous headlines that don\u2019t feature the <a href=\"\/keyword\">keyword<\/a> I searched for \u2013 like the one below. The keyword I searched for was \u201csportcoats.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-ad-headlines-misleading-ad.png\" alt=\"PPC ad headlines misleading ad\" width=\"258\" height=\"120\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Yes, Lands\u2019 End make sportcoats, but this ad doesn\u2019t offer what I want, so why would I waste time clicking on it?<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t make your prospects guess what you sell. Make the connection between their search query and your ad crystal clear by including the keyword in the headline.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Ask questions<\/h2>\n<p>Leveraging user intent is crucial to increasing <a href=\"\/conversion-rate-optimization\">conversion rates<\/a>. One way to do this is by asking the searcher a question with your headline.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-ad-headlines-divorce-ad.jpg\" alt=\"PPC ad headlines divorce ad\" width=\"255\" height=\"98\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The example ad above is quite clever. Not only does it pose a question in the ad headline, it also uses very particular phrasing (\u201cProtecting your family\u201d) that implies solidarity and dependability \u2013 qualities that you could very well be looking for in a divorce attorney.<\/p>\n<p>This is also an exception to the \u201cinclude the keyword\u201d tip outlined above \u2013 although this ad headline doesn\u2019t include the keyword I searched for, it\u2019s still a much more compelling ad than the others I saw. If I were looking for a divorce attorney \u2013 which I\u2019m not, by the way! \u2013 this ad would get the click.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Solve prospects\u2019 problems<\/h2>\n<p>Perry Marshall, author of the world\u2019s best-selling book on Google AdWords, is always talking about the importance of solving prospects\u2019 problems in your ad copy. This technique is just as crucial when it comes to your ad headlines as it is in the body copy of your ad.<\/p>\n<p>People don\u2019t want to buy \u201cthings\u201d \u2013 they want to solve their problems.<\/p>\n<p>PPC ad headlines that create the perception that your product or service can help them do that are much more clickable than those that don\u2019t. To learn more about the problem-solving aspect of PPC ad copy, check out this article from PPC University about <a href=\"\/ad-text\">ad text<\/a>.<em><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AdWordsGrader_AWGrader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>\ud83d\udcb0<\/span><strong> Ready to hit the jackpot of ad copywriting tips?

Add a little humor<\/h2>\n<p>Advertisers often pay close attention to the types of ads their competitors are running. Unfortunately, prospects often don\u2019t \u2013 all they see are dozens of ads that all look and sound the same.<\/p>\n<p>Differentiating your ads from your competitors&#8217; is vital, and humor can be an excellent way to accomplish this. However, what\u2019s funny to one person might be deeply offensive to another, so if you opt to take this approach, be sure to A\/B test your ads to see if your prospects get the joke.<\/p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:<\/strong> If you want to poke a little fun at a competitor as a joke, that\u2019s probably fine. However, be careful about how you choose to do this. Making blatantly false accusations or claims could land you in hot water or lead to sanctions from Google or Bing, even if it\u2019s done in jest.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Include numbers or statistics<\/h2>\n<p>Many users respond well to empirical evidence. Hard data can be a trust signal, and it can plant the seed of trustworthiness in the mind of your prospect. This is why McDonald\u2019s uses its \u201cBillions and billions sold\u201d slogan on its signage.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-ad-headlines-translation-ad.png\" alt=\"PPC ad headlines translation ad\" width=\"281\" height=\"111\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This ad is particularly effective, as the ad headline tells me right upfront how much I can expect to pay (roughly) per page of translated copy. Obviously this could be subject to certain factors, such as the source and desired languages, but this was the only ad I was shown that used hard figures, putting it ahead of the rest by a fair country distance.<\/p>\n<p>It might not be as compelling as Perry\u2019s problem-solving technique, but it gets the point across succinctly (a must when you have so little space to work with), and can create a positive association between your offering and the prospect\u2019s desired outcome. Speaking of outcomes\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>6. Think carefully about user intent<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re not writing PPC ad headlines with user intent in mind, you could be missing out on countless opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>Many companies see PPC ads as a way to wax lyrical about their product\u2019s features. This is a mistake. Remember, nobody cares about you or your product \u2013 only how it can solve their problems. Of course, determining what those problems are means thinking about the search that displayed your ad to the prospect in the first place.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Use empathy<\/h2>\n<p>As well as wanting to solve their problems, people want to know that somebody else understands what they\u2019re going through. This is what makes empathy such a powerful technique in the best ad headlines. By sympathizing with your customer\u2019s problem, you\u2019re creating a bond between you, which can increase trust \u2013 or, at the very least, catch their eye.<\/p>\n<h2>8. Use simple language<\/h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/23\/marketing-buzzwords\">digital marketing industry has more buzzwords and jargon<\/a> than many of us care for, and I\u2019m sure you probably use some specialized terms in your industry, too. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you should cram your PPC ad headlines with enough jargon to confuse or deter your prospects.<\/p>\n<p>Use simple, easily understood language in your headlines. It makes them easier to read, more accessible, and more clickable. Don\u2019t put prospects off before you\u2019ve even started by overwhelming them with intimidating and often-useless buzzwords or acronyms.<\/p>\n<p>Note that simple language doesn&#8217;t have to be boring! There are plenty of simple <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/22\/power-words\">power words<\/a> that make for compelling yet easy-to-read ad copy.<\/p>\n<h2>9. Use social trends as inspiration<\/h2>\n<p>Look at what people are talking about in your industry through social media and use that to inspire your headlines.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-ad-headlines-twitter-trends.png\" alt=\"PPC ad headlines Twitter trends\" width=\"213\" height=\"227\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Twitter offers a helpful \u201cWhat\u2019s trending\u201d section to help you quickly identify trending topics based on your preferences, and hopping on a temporary bandwagon could help you capitalize on social trends to capture additional clicks. Be wary of the (very) fleeting nature of some social trends, though \u2013 this is definitely not a \u201cset it and forget it\u201d approach.<\/p>\n<h2>10. Make use of the character limit<\/h2>\n<p>Don\u2019t use unnecessary words or characters for its own sake, but make sure you take full advantage of the 25-character limit in your PPC ad headlines. Be as descriptive as you can, and make sure that your ads outline exactly what users can expect when they click on them. Speaking of expectations\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>11. Don\u2019t make false promises or bogus claims<\/h2>\n<p>Including blatantly false information is a quick way to have your ad disapproved by Google and Bing. If you make a claim in the headline of your ad, make sure either the ad copy or the landing page (preferably both) back it up with real data, customer testimonials, or some other verifiable evidence.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-ad-headlines-false-claims-ad.png\" alt=\"PPC ad headlines false claim ad example\" width=\"308\" height=\"97\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The example above serves as a good example of making claims that can\u2019t easily be verified. According to whom is this site the \u201cNo. 1\u201d online fishing tackle shop? This claim isn\u2019t just impossible to prove \u2013 it also wastes precious space that could have been used to promote something unique about the business.<\/p>\n<p>Failing to deliver on a promise is one of the fastest ways to harm your brand and lose prospective customers, so don\u2019t write checks your ads can\u2019t cash.<\/p>\n<h2>12. Be obsessive about punctuation, spelling, and grammar<\/h2>\n<p>Just because you only have 25 characters to work with in your PPC ad headlines doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t spend time making sure your ad is grammatically correct. Misspellings will make you and your business look foolish, so run everything through a spellchecker before submitting your ad for approval.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-ad-headlines-unclear-ad.png\" alt=\"PPC ad headlines unclear ad example\" width=\"275\" height=\"133\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Unfortunately for this business, the ad above is just terrible. First of all, I\u2019m not even sure if this is relevant to my search term (\u201ccremations\u201d). Secondly, I can\u2019t tell if they literally offer 1,310 simple cremation services, or if this means that a simple cremation service costs $1,310.<\/p>\n<p>If, like many businesses, you operate in foreign markets (such as Canada and the U.K.), consider using appropriate spellings for those countries. It might not seem like a big deal, but it could make a big difference.<\/p>\n<p>Punctuation is also tremendously important, and can have a profound impact on the meaning of a phrase.<\/p>\n<h2>13. Focus on the benefits\u2026<\/h2>\n<p>Similarly to writing PPC ad headlines with user intent in mind, remember that people want to know how choosing your product or service will benefit them. Sales professionals often keep a mantra in mind \u2013 \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d \u2013 when talking to prospects, and you should too when writing ad headlines.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-ad-headlines-honeymoon-ad.png\" alt=\"PPC ad headlines honeymoon ad example\" width=\"470\" height=\"75\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Resist the temptation to use your headlines to talk about how awesome you are. Instead, focus on how your product will make your customers\u2019 lives better, like the example above does.<\/p>\n<h2>14. \u2026Or focus on prospects\u2019 problems<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve lost your keys after a night out on the town. Even if you see three or four ads for locksmiths, you\u2019re probably going to be in quite the panic.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-ad-headlines-locksmith-ads.png\" alt=\"PPC ad headlines locksmith ads\" width=\"350\" height=\"550\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In the examples above, the first ad is the worst. I don\u2019t care if the business is family owned and operated, or one of thousands of franchises owned by Wal-Mart \u2013 I just want to get back in my house.<\/p>\n<p>The third ad isn\u2019t much better, as it\u2019s asking me to go to another site and enter my details to find a local locksmith \u2013 an unnecessary second step that I\u2019m unlikely to bother with.<\/p>\n<p>The other three ads, however, are exactly what I\u2019m looking for \u2013 phrasing that implies reliability, 24-hour service clearly stated, and some pricing information. I <em>am<\/em> a little curious what makes the fourth business \u201cextreme,\u201d though\u2026<\/p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2\/12:<\/strong> So here&#8217;s where things get a little tricky. Brett McMeninmon of The Flying Locksmiths left a comment (see below) saying that while he enjoyed the post, their ad in the example above was purposefully written to incorporate trust signals because of the prevalence of scams in the locksmith business. Apparently, according to Brett, all three of the ads I said were good examples are for less-than-scrupulous businesses. Read Brett&#8217;s full comment for the context.<\/p>\n<p>Now, Brett&#8217;s position is an interesting one &#8211; how do you differentiate yourself in an already crowded marketplace, especially one rife with scams, especially for services you might not even be actively interested in targeting? As I advised Brett in the comments section, the problem here is primarily one of gauging user intent. Even though I&#8217;m sure The Flying Locksmiths are more than capable of getting you back into your home after a night on the town, that&#8217;s not what Brett says his business is actively advertising for. With that in mind, one way Brett can avoid being lumped in with the scammers is by focusing on the services The Flying Locksmith <em>is<\/em> interested in, namely commercial security devices such as door kepad entry systems, card readers, and the like.<\/p>\n<p>If I were a property manager looking to upgrade my building&#8217;s physical security measures, I probably wouldn&#8217;t search for &#8220;locksmiths,&#8221; even though companies like The Flying Locksmith specialize in this kind of work. Similarly, many users actively searching for locksmiths are unlikely to be interested in door keypad entry systems or card readers &#8211; they probably just want to get back in their house.\u00a0Brett&#8217;s situation excellently illustrates the importance of really understanding user intent.<\/p>\n<h2>15. Use fear to your advantage<\/h2>\n<p>This is another tip Perry Marshall stands by. Leveraging strong emotional responses like fear, suspicion and doubt is an excellent way to get your prospects\u2019 attention and click on your ad.<\/p>\n<p>Check out this example of an <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/11\/09\/emotional-ads\">emotional ad<\/a> from Perry\u2019s book, \u201cThe Ultimate Guide to Google AdWords, 4th Edition,\u201d which shows this technique done extremely well:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-ad-headlines-revenge-ad.png\" alt=\"PPC ad headlines revenge ad\" width=\"249\" height=\"120\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Perhaps not the most ethical ad (or service, whatever it might entail), but there\u2019s no denying that this ad catches the eye and makes excellent use of emotional manipulation to tempt the user to click on it.<\/p>\n<h2>16. Emphasize your USP<\/h2>\n<p>Your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/07\/unique-selling-proposition\">unique selling proposition<\/a> is what sets your business apart from the competition. If possible, include this unique feature in your PPC ad headlines. This may not be as effective if your USP isn\u2019t genuinely remarkable, but it\u2019s still worth thinking about, especially if some of the other methods aren\u2019t working as well for you.<\/p>\n<h2>17. Think beyond dynamic keyword insertion<\/h2>\n<p>Dynamic keyword insertion, or DKI, is the process by which the keyword used in the search is dynamically inserted into your ad. DKI is a tempting proposition, especially if you\u2019re targeting lots of keywords across several large accounts, but don\u2019t rely on it exclusively.<\/p>\n<p>As Larry pointed out in his popular post on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/11\/average-click-through-rate\">how to triple click-through rates<\/a>, DKI can increase click-through rates, as you can see in the figure below:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-ad-headlines-dynamic-keyword-insertion.png\" alt=\"PPC ad headlines dynamic keyword insertion data\" width=\"837\" height=\"538\" \/><\/div>\n<p>However, you\u2019ll notice that in the top 5% of PPC ads \u2013 the unicorns \u2013 DKI doesn\u2019t make much of a difference, and ads utilizing DKI actually perform less effectively in comparison to ads without DKI the farther along the graph.<\/p>\n<p>DKI can be a useful tool, but you should also take the time to create genuine, unique PPC ad headlines that really speak to your prospects, too.<\/p>\n<h2>18. Include quotes or testimonials<\/h2>\n<p>If you have a loyal fan base or die-hard customers, put \u2018em to work for you and include some of their quotes and glowing testimonials in your PPC ad headlines. However, exercise caution when using quotes, as this can sometimes backfire.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-ad-headlines-diet-pill-ad.png\" alt=\"PPC ad headlines diet pill ad\" width=\"299\" height=\"108\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The example above tries to use this technique, but the results aren\u2019t exactly clear. In this content, it\u2019s not immediately obvious if the quoted headline is an actual quote, or whether it\u2019s a testimonial. It could even be interpreted as making fun of the notion that diet pills work. Forget the suspicious-looking URL \u2013 the quotation marks in this example clearly need some work.<\/p>\n<p>Use quotation marks to make it obvious that you\u2019re quoting someone, and make their quote or testimonial relevant to the ad. If the quote includes a direct benefit of using your product or service (such as \u201cI saved so much time!\u201d), all the better.<\/p>\n<h2>19. Make promises or guarantees<\/h2>\n<p>Making a firm commitment to your prospect with your PPC ads can signify confidence in your product or service, which can be a powerful motivator for the consumer. This is especially effective if your business is operating in a competitive or crowded market. If you can\u2019t fit promises like free shipping or a money-back guarantee in the headline, definitely consider adding it to the copy.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-ad-headlines-craftsman-ad.jpg\" alt=\"PPC ad headlines guarantee example\" width=\"487\" height=\"118\" \/><\/div>\n<p>However, if you decide to make a promise in your PPC ad headlines, you MUST be able to deliver. If you don\u2019t, you could do irreparable harm to your brand and credibility.<\/p>\n<h2>20. Be crystal clear about what you\u2019re offering<\/h2>\n<p>A lot of advertisers rely on trickery to convince you to click, but in many cases, this is the wrong approach. If a prospect is in the market for what you\u2019re selling, you don\u2019t need to trick them to buy from you \u2013 you just need to give them what they want.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-ad-headlines-sleep-aid-ad.png\" alt=\"PPC ad headlines sleep aid ad\" width=\"243\" height=\"94\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The headline of the ad above is pretty much as simple and straightforward as it could be. It also uses the first line of copy to emphasize the benefit of the product.<\/p>\n<p>Be clear and concise with your PPC ad headline copy. If the other tips aren\u2019t working for you, simplify your approach and make your headlines as simple and clear as possible. That way, you eliminate any possible confusion about what you\u2019re offering.<\/p>\n<h2>21. Spy on the competition and steal their ideas<\/h2>\n<p>Corporate espionage is great for business! Fortunately, you don\u2019t need to break into the corporate headquarters of your biggest rival or hack into their computer systems to see what kinds of ads are working for them.<\/p>\n<p>Tools such as SpyFu and SEMrush allow you to examine which <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/09\/competitor-keywords\">competitor keywords<\/a> are performing well for other companies in your sector, as well as gain valuable insight into other areas of their campaigns such as landing pages. I\u2019m not advocating for stealing ideas outright, but a little competitive intelligence could give you the edge you\u2019re looking for.<\/p>\n<p>For even more tips and ideas, head to our impressive collection of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/01\/headline-examples\">88 headline examples<\/a> (they&#8217;re total click magnets).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Great ad copy starts with a great headline.
