So sad! Here&#8217;s what you can do:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understand the\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/10\/modified-broad-match-going-away\">announcement about modified broad match going away.<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Try these\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/08\/how-to-win-google-ads-broad-match\">tips for using broad match in response to the change<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Learn how to use<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/08\/broad-match-audience-targeting-google-ads\"> broad match + audience targeting<\/a> as a solid workaround.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Almost every week a client asks me, \u201cWhat do those plus signs mean?\u201d and I am constantly reminded that even though this <a href=\"\/keyword-match-types\">keyword match type<\/a> is fairly common, there are still a lot of people who have no idea it exists.<\/p>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t caught on yet, this match type is known in Google Ads (formerly known as Google AdWords)\u00a0as the Broad Match Modifier, but it is more commonly and widely known as simply Modified Broad. People tend to shy away from using this match type because they don\u2019t understand what it means or how it works. It can also be a time-consuming task to add the plus signs to each of those <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/18\/adwords-keywords\">keywords<\/a> you want to switch, but in the long run, this match type can be a big help to your account.<\/p>\n<p>Essentially the idea is that whatever keyword you put the plus sign in front of is a \u201cmodifier\u201d to the broad match keyword. You can add a plus sign to only one or two words in the keyword or to all words in the keyword. So, whichever word(s) you end up putting a plus sign in front of, Google will recognize as a \u201cmodifier\u201d and <strong>will make sure that those words are always in the search query no matter what<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>As an example, if you sell furniture and you are bidding on the keyword \u201cred leather couch\u201d on a phrase match type (meaning, those words in that exact order must be in the search query), you could be missing out on relevant traffic \u2013 queries that have similar intent but different phrasing. On the other end of the spectrum, if you are bidding on the same keyword on a broad match type, you may be bringing in too much irrelevant traffic or too much traffic in general.<\/p>\n<p><strong>This is where modified broad comes in handy.<\/strong> If you put the plus sign in front of red, leather and couch, like so:<\/p>\n<p>+red +leather +couch<\/p>\n<p>you are telling Google, I want to make sure that my ad DOES NOT show up for any search queries unless all three words are in it, and it doesn\u2019t matter what order those keywords show up in. So someone searching for just \u201cleather couch\u201d you would not see your ad, because \u201cred\u201d was not in that search query, but if someone searches for \u201cLeather couch in red\u201d or \u201clooking for a leather couch in red\u201d you would show up, because all three words with a plus sign in front of them were in the search query.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/modified_broad_match_diagram-1.jpg\" alt=\"Broad Match Modifier Explained\" width=\"975\" height=\"655\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You also have the ability to put the plus sign in front of certain words instead of all words in the keyword. This is typically good for those branded terms you want to make sure always show up or for certain items that you sell. So, using the example from above, if you are bidding on the keyword \u201cred leather couch\u201d and you want to make sure that you always show up with search queries containing the words leather and couch, but you don\u2019t care if the word red is there, you can add a plus sign in front of leather and couch and leave red alone. Bidding on this keyword (red +leather +couch) will ensure that you show up for those searching for leather couches, but you can also show up for keywords associated with the word \u201cred\u201d; someone searching for \u201cleather couch in burgundy\u201d or \u201cin need of a crimson leather couch\u201d has the potential for your ad to show.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>It&#8217;s time to find out which keywords are killing your Google Ads budget. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Run our free Google Ads Performance Grader to get a personalized account audit<\/a>!<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>When to Use Modified Broad Match<\/h2>\n<p>So now you are probably thinking, this is all great information but when and why would I use this match type? There is no definitive answer to this question but there are several factors you can use to make that decision. I typically tell people, and those of you who have talked to me before have probably heard this, that if something needs to be in a certain order you want to stick with a phrase match type; modified broad match type may not be the best option for you. This is typical for those branded terms or certain phrasings that only make sense to keep in that order.<\/p>\n<p>For example: If you were to advertise for the Boston Police Department because they wanted to bring awareness to the upcoming civil service exam, you would most likely want to bid on the keyword \u201cCivil Service Exam\u201d on a phrase match type. This is because it would not make sense to show your ad for any other phrasing of those words. Examples like this are some reasons you would want to stay away from modified broad match types. If you don\u2019t care what order they show up in, as long as all the words in the keyword are there in the search query, then modified broad match type will be a great in-between for you going from a broad match type to something a little more restrictive. To me, phrase match is almost telling that searcher what they need to type in for you to show up, but especially with Google, you never know what people are going to search for, so modified broad will help you get that traffic but not restrict it so much that no one will see your ad.<\/p>\n<p>I may be a little biased because I typically think broad can be a bit more work in the upkeep department, which doesn\u2019t make it a bad match type to use but you need to be consistent about adding negatives and monitoring the performance of those keywords. Broad keywords are usually going to have high impressions and not always the most clicks, which will lead to low click-through rates. This would be another great example of why you may want to switch your match types. Going along with the theory of phrase vs. modified broad that I just talked about, this would be a situation where you may not want to restrict your keywords to phrase, so by switching to modified broad, you can cut out a lot of that irrelevant and unqualified traffic but still keep those keywords to a fairly broad match type. One thing to keep in mind, if you are used to the high amount of traffic broad match keywords bring in, you may be surprised with a drop in impressions, but this is not something to immediately worry about, those keywords will still bring in a good amount of traffic over time.<\/p>\n<p>There are definitely pros and cons to all the different match types and it can be confusing, but the more you know about them, the better off you and your account(s) will be. Take caution when changing your match types and make sure to remember that <strong>when you switch your match types, Google does consider this a new keyword<\/strong>. You may not see the metrics you are looking for right off the bat but keep in mind, Google Ads\u00a0is not a set it and forget it type of process, so keep track of your changes. Don\u2019t be afraid to revert anything or change any match type if you need to, because nothing in Google Ads\u00a0is permanent; most things are trial and error, so it\u2019s ok to make mistakes.<\/p>\n<p>If you would like to talk more about match types, please feel free to comment below or reach out to your Customer Success Rep, we are always happy to talk match types!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What are those plus signs on your keywords in AdWords?
