And a big part of regular ad optimization is testing your ads, usually through A\/B testing and ad rotation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But you may not have tried a technique known as copy testing<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>In this guide, we\u2019ll give you the full breakdown of what copy testing is, why it&#8217;s in a resurgence, and how you can get the most out of it to increase your advertising ROI and drive sales.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s get started.<\/p>\n<h2>What is copy testing?<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Copy testing is a form of market research that determines the likelihood of an advertisement&#8217;s success through consumer feedback. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Copy testing can be a crucial component of an ad campaign&#8217;s success, as it enables advertisers to anticipate whether an ad will be compelling before they pay to promote it online. However, in the past 15 years or so, <a href=\"https:\/\/adage.com\/article\/cmo-strategy\/speed-digital-putting-copy-testing-test\/300338\">copy testing has fallen out of favor<\/a>. Many advertisers see it as outdated. Their primary critiques are that copy testing takes too long, is too costly, and that it often results in bland campaigns (as research groups tend to err against originality).<\/p>\n<p><strong>But, with the introduction of automated copy testing in the past few years, copy testing is coming back.\u00a0<\/strong>Plus, you can now <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/14\/microsoft-ads-if-functions\">use Microsoft IF functions<\/a> to test different copy versions in\u00a0both your Bing ads and your Google Ads.<\/p>\n<h3>What is automated copy testing?<\/h3>\n<p>Automated copy testing is a newer model of copy testing that uses software to send variations of your business&#8217; ads to real people who have registered to give feedback. By crowdsourcing your ad campaign&#8217;s test, you cut down on both time and cost. And, with modern analytics built in, automated copy testing tools parse your data for you.<\/p>\n<p>For example, copy testing app <a href=\"https:\/\/www.qualtrics.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Qualtrics<\/a> compiles your market research group&#8217;s responses into easy-to-understand, actionable graphs.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/copy-testing-response-example.jpg\" alt=\"copy testing response examples\" width=\"799\" height=\"536\" \/><\/div>\n<p>To the creativity criticism, the fact of the matter is that (time and again) modern consumers reward creativity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Take a look at this ad, for instance. <\/strong><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/owGykVbfgUE?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>This ad is always worth a watch. Are we really concerned, then, that a modern copy testing research group won&#8217;t like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/02\/08\/seven-innovative-ads\">creativity<\/a>? This video has 56,600,000 views on YouTube (and it was a TV ad).<\/p>\n<h2>What about A\/B testing?<\/h2>\n<p>The more experienced digital advertisers out there may be thinking, &#8220;I&#8217;m already A\/B testing my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/13\/best-advertising-campaigns\">ad campaigns<\/a> and seeing fantastic results. Why would I spend money to show my ads to people who have no interest in buying from me?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The answer is simple: <strong>Pay more now to make more later.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;re familiar with ROI.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re all looking to maximize our return on investment. And A\/B testing helps with that\u2014but it&#8217;s missing one crucial component. <strong>You&#8217;re still paying for the losing variation.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Copy testing enables you to pay more upfront but make more down the line.<\/p>\n<p>And even if we ignore the cost, A\/B testing can be problematic. How many A\/B advertising tests do you run which don&#8217;t reach statistical significance? How many do you run where the winning ad design doesn&#8217;t actually match up with the rest of your website, so your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/22\/facebook-sales-funnel\">sales funnel<\/a> begins to look like a patchwork quilt? How many were false positives which, once implemented, actually <em>cost<\/em> your business money in the long run?<\/p>\n<p>The long and short of it is this: <a href=\"https:\/\/vwo.com\/blog\/cro-industry-insights\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Only 1 in every 7<\/a> A\/B tests results in a statistically-significant winner. And that&#8217;s a number taken from experienced advertisers. There are a lot more optimizers throwing A\/B tests out into the ether without fully implemented, full-funnel analytic tracking.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, A\/B testing may give you concrete data (and there&#8217;s nothing more seductive to a digital marketer than concrete data), but it can often be untrustworthy data.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Copy testing, on the other hand, gives you both concrete quantitative data <em>and<\/em> qualitative data\u2014insight from people like your prospective customers.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>But before we get into how to get the best quantitative and qualitative data out of your copy testing, let&#8217;s take a quick look at the factors that make an ad campaign successful in the first place.<\/p>\n<h2>Creative and targeting: crucial factors in ad campaign success<\/h2>\n<p>This section might as well be called &#8220;Things You Need to Get Right in Copy Testing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Essentially, it&#8217;s important that before you start copy testing, you identify the factors which affect your campaign&#8217;s success or failure.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s how <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nielsen.com\/us\/en\/insights\/article\/2017\/when-it-comes-to-advertising-effectiveness-what-is-key\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Nielsen<\/strong><\/a><strong> broke down different advertising elements by percent of sales contribution:<\/strong><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/copy-testing-advertising-element-graph.jpg\" alt=\"copy testing advertising elements graph\" width=\"700\" height=\"653\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nielsen.com\/us\/en\/insights\/article\/2017\/when-it-comes-to-advertising-effectiveness-what-is-key\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>In short, test your creative. <\/strong>Unsurprisingly, your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/09\/ad-design\">ad design<\/a> is still (far and away) the most impactful variable when it comes to the success or failure of a campaign.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Then test your targeting.<\/strong> This is especially important in copy testing because you&#8217;re selecting a small group of people to represent your larger audience.<\/p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t get insight from the right people, that insight will be useless down the line.<\/p>\n<p>Create multiple research groups to determine how each demographic grouping responds to your campaign&#8217;s creative, then (when making your ad go live), target that demographic.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you get targeting right, you&#8217;ll be ahead of more than half your competitors.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In the same Nielsen study as above, they determined that &#8220;less than half of fast-moving consumer goods brands today are doing a good job of reaching category or brand buyers.&#8221; And &#8220;when a campaign isn\u2019t delivered to a buyer target, the creative has to work even harder to drive sales.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Check it out.<\/strong><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/copy-testing-buyer-tester-bar-graph.jpg\" alt=\"copy testing bar graphs\" width=\"737\" height=\"686\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nielsen.com\/us\/en\/insights\/article\/2017\/when-it-comes-to-advertising-effectiveness-what-is-key\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Demographics and context: crucial factors for successful copy testing<\/h2>\n<p>Like with most ad testing, copy testing comes down to demographics and context.<\/p>\n<p>First and foremost, your market research group needs to be exclusively comprised of people within your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/18\/beginners-guide-to-target-markets\">target market<\/a>.

Imagine if you showed your ad campaign to your copy testing group on a projector screen\u2014out of context with no desktop or mobile newsfeed around it. Do you think the insight you get would be reliable? Or would it only be reliable if your target market (one the ad campaign was live) was also viewing your ad without context on a projector screen?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Don&#8217;t think that platform or context can have that much of an effect?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Consider that the conversion rate of desktop shoppers is more than 300% better than the conversion rate of mobile shoppers.<\/p>\n<p>Context is everything in advertising\u2014there&#8217;s a reason the average <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/05\/online-advertising-costs\">cost of an advertisement<\/a> on Google Ads is $2.32 and only $1.72 on Facebook, and that the conversion rate desktop shoppers is more than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/234884\/us-online-shopper-conversion-rate-by-device\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">300% higher<\/a> than the conversion rate of mobile shoppers.

It&#8217;s not a large group of people. Instead, it&#8217;s a small, targeted group of people giving you objective insight. And that&#8217;s a valuable thing only if those people match your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/23\/buyer-personas\">ideal consumers<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Qualtrics has a searchable and filter-able user base of over 10,000 prospective ad viewers for you to choose from\u2014each with a detailed profile.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/copy-testing-qualtrics-example.jpg\" alt=\"copy testing qualtrics screenshot\" width=\"764\" height=\"465\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Ask the right questions<\/h3>\n<p>What are you looking to learn from your research group? A copy test is, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Copy_testing\">historically<\/a>, run with two primary elements in mind:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Recall: <\/strong>How well does a prospective consumer remember the message of your ad? How well do they remember the brand, if not the message?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Persuasion: <\/strong>How well does your ad persuade prospective customers to engage?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And these are excellent places to start, <strong>especially recall. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not running a click-through campaign (for instance, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/05\/brand-awareness-campaigns\">brand awareness<\/a> campaign on Facebook), your campaign is only effective if it&#8217;s memorable. So make sure your ad audience gives their initial thoughts and, 48 hours later, gives you insight into how well they remember the details.<\/p>\n<p>Modern copy testing tools go much further than these two ideas. They enable you to ask every question under the sun\u2014but you don\u2019t want to do that. Remember to stay focused in your questions to get the best results.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here are a few questions we recommend:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Did this ad grab your eye?<\/li>\n<li>What words or phrases come to mind when you see this ad?<\/li>\n<li>What is something that might deter you from clicking\/engaging?<\/li>\n<li>What do you think would happen if you clicked on this ad?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of action \ud83c\udfac &#8230; <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Free guide! <\/strong><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download\" class=\"waffle-rich-text-link\">The 36 Best Call to Action Phrases (Ever)<\/a><\/strong><span> <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><\/div><\/div><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Make the data actionable<\/h3>\n<p>If you get qualitative feedback, like &#8220;what word or phrases come to mind when you see this ad,&#8221; can you make that actionable?<\/p>\n<p>If you get quantitative feedback, like &#8220;on a scale of 1-10, how much did this ad resonate with you,&#8221; can you make that actionable?<\/p>\n<p>Unlike <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/11\/copywriting-ab-tests\">A\/B testing<\/a>, copy testing requires you to interpret and translate data.

This one is worse.&#8221; Instead it says, &#8220;This one didn&#8217;t apply to me because you seem to think that single mothers are all exhausted, but I don&#8217;t feel that way.&#8221; And, from a conversion optimization standpoint, insights like that may be more valuable. Because you know what to do, and why you should do it.<\/p>\n<p>With A\/B testing results, you&#8217;re testing a hypothesis. <strong>But you&#8217;re not sure that the reason a variation wins is because your hypothesis was correct.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It could be something else entirely.
