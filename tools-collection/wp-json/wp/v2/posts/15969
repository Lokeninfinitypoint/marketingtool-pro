A few years ago, the Merriam Webster Dictionary defined the word \u201cliterally\u201d to mean figuratively. The next big craze was a Pumpkin Spice latte that apparently contains no pumpkins. And then a few weeks ago, we were told that the truth isn\u2019t truth.<\/p>\n<p>Definitions are changing over at Google too \u2013 yesterday they <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/9131274\">ann<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/9131274\">o<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/9131274\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">unced<\/a> that starting in October our \u201cexact match\u201d keywords will get less exact and match to even more keyword variants. Let\u2019s take a look at what this means.<\/p>\n<h2>What Exactly (Ahem) Is Google Changing?<\/h2>\n<p>Advertisers have always relied on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-match-types\">keyword match types<\/a> to control how their keywords match out to a user\u2019s search. For years, a staple of any <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">successful Google Ads account<\/a> was the use of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/exact-match\">exact match keywords<\/a>, which would only serve an ad when a user\u2019s search <em>exactly<\/em> matched the keyword. Exact match keywords prevented you from serving an ad if a user\u2019s search didn\u2019t exactly match your keyword.<\/p>\n<p>In recent years, Google has relaxed this definition of \u201cexact match.\u201d In 2014, Google began <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/15\/rip-exact-match\">automatically including misspellings, plurals, and other close grammatical variants<\/a> of exact and phrase match keywords. In 2017, Google again <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/20\/exact-match-keywords\">reinvented exact match keywords<\/a> by automatically serving ads to searches where the words of the keyword were out of order or included prepositions, conjunctions, or articles.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s most recent change is the third act of a play about the death of exact match keywords as we know them. Starting soon, your exact match keywords will begin matching to \u201cclose variants that share the same meaning of your keywords,\u201d including synonyms, paraphrases, and results with the same implied intent.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, if you were bidding on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/11\/exact-match-changes\">exact match<\/a> keyword [yosemite camping], you could now expect that traffic to match to someone searching for \u201cyosemite national park ca camping,\u201d \u201cYosemite campground\u201d or \u201ccampsites in yosemite,\u201d which is kind of broad matchy. In Google\u2019s eyes, the intent behind these searches is all the same \u2013 the searcher is looking to go camping in Yosemite.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a7283686-b92e-4721-8c60-97fe11ae7fc8\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/new-exact-match-keyword-rules-2018-1.png\" alt=\"new exact match keyword rules in 2018\" width=\"895\" height=\"377\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Google estimates that these changes will increase the reach of our exact match keywords by roughly 3%.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, when Google last updated their exact match keywords, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/12\/exact-match-keyword-change-data\">our customers saw a 10% increase in their clicks and 11% increase in their spend from their exact match keywords<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"46bb861d-2ca2-46e9-bb50-cccdc2c9538e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/exact-match-keyword-change-google-ads-effects.png\" alt=\"impact of exact match keyword changes in google ads\" width=\"1436\" height=\"808\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Who Benefits from this Change?<\/h2>\n<p>Per their own estimates, Google just increased ad clicks by 3%. But all advertisers are going to be affected in some way as their keywords start matching out to new search terms. Today for instance, 3.5 billion searches occurred on Google and even after nearly 2 decades of handling the world\u2019s searches \u2013 about 525 million of those searches have never been searched for before. And while 15% of the world\u2019s searches may seem new semantically, we aren\u2019t spending an eighth of our time online doing something that no one\u2019s ever searched for before. More of those 500+ million searches will find a match to your keywords.<\/p>\n<p>We might know that Eskimos have more than 50 words for \u201csnow,\u201d but Google data reveals that people search for deodorant in more than 150,000 unique ways. I work with over a hundred of the most dedicated paid search professionals in the world, but I can guarantee that even on our their busiest days, no one wants to build out literally thousands of different keywords for the same search. Your Google Ads account even prevents you from creating too many keywords \u2013 capping all users at 5 million keywords max.<\/p>\n<p>Small advertisers may benefit from this shift away from semantic search, particularly those who didn\u2019t have a lot of time to add new keywords frequently.<\/p>\n<p>If this change excites you and sounds like it will help your account serve to additional relevant searches, good! You might also benefit from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/03\/22\/modified-broad-match-for-beginners\">modified broad match keywords<\/a>, which effectively match out to a lot of the same traffic.<\/p>\n<h2>Who Does This Change Hurt?<\/h2>\n<p>Semantics isn\u2019t the exciting roundtable discussion you want to have with your creative team, but if the words in your keywords matter a lot to you, now\u2019s the time to prepare.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, advertisers in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-niche-finder\">niche industries<\/a> should be on high alert following this change, particularly if you\u2019re using <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/long-tail-keywords\">long tailed keywords<\/a> to qualify traffic. For instance, going back to Google\u2019s own example, the keyword [Yosemite camping] might not imply a match for the search <em>Yosemite National Park CA camping <\/em>if that search were coming from Yosemite, Kentucky or Yosemite, Australia. Likewise, if you\u2019re selling camping gear, the keyword [Yosemite camping] may perform appreciably better than the search terms <em>Yosemite campsite or Yosemite campground.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>5 Ways to Prepare for the New Exact Match Rules<\/h2>\n<p>Google\u2019s changes for exact match keywords don\u2019t all go into effect immediately. Per their announcement, the change will be rolling out in October to English keywords and other language keywords over the following months. Here\u2019s what you need to do before Google changes your exact match keywords.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Review your top exact match keywords<\/h3>\n<p>Look at your most popular exact match keywords. Are they more than one word keywords? Does their word order matter? Would changing a word within a keyword to a synonym or a similar word change the meaning of that search? What about adding a location? Or a preposition? If you answered yes to any of those, that keyword may be in trouble.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Preemptively add new negative keywords<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/negative-keywords\">Adding new negative keywords<\/a> is an important routine for every PPC manager. If after reviewing your exact match keywords you discover that they\u2019ll start serving traffic to irrelevant reordered search terms, you should preemptively add that search term as a negative keyword to prevent you from losing precious budget on that search term soon.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Consider adding other match types<\/h3>\n<p>If the idea of losing control over word order or not being able to control the addition or removal of function keywords sounds like a nightmare for you, consider relying more heavily on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/phrase-match\">phrase match keywords<\/a>. Google has confirmed that phrase match keywords will not be affected by this change.<\/p>\n<p>Conversely, if you\u2019re particularly excited about this change making your keyword management easier, consider adding more <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/03\/22\/modified-broad-match-for-beginners\">modified broad match keywords<\/a> to your account. Modified broad match keywords enjoy many of these same benefits such as disregarding word order or the addition of new words in a search query.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Remove any newly duplicate keywords<\/h3>\n<p>In 2017, after Google changed the rules for exact match keywords, a shocking 17% of exact match keywords now found themselves competing against one another simply because the word order within the keywords was shifted. This change, which includes both semantic additions and contextual changes to exact match, will likely have a noticeable effect on your duplicate keyword count!<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5f3134f1-396c-4e74-870c-673832b236e3\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/exact-match-keyword-duplicates-2018.png\" alt=\"exact match keyword changes duplicates\" width=\"532\" height=\"313\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>5. Revisit your Single Keyword Ad Groups<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/04\/18\/underused-ppc-strategies\">Some people love single-keyword ad groups<\/a> for the control that they give them in matching the perfect ad to the perfect keyword. While SKAGs may sometimes offer that control, if you\u2019re relying on exact match keywords in multiple single keyword ad groups, there may be a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/03\/the-case-against-skags\">bigger case against SKAGs<\/a> for the time being. As these keywords match out to even more search terms and compete more with each other, you\u2019re likely going to have much more work ahead of you trying to adjust to this change. If possible, now might be a good time to break up with SKAGs, even if only for your exact match keywords.<\/p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t the first time that Google has changed the way we control our keywords and I\u2019d be shocked if it were the last. Still, very few advertisers appear to be celebrating Google\u2019s recent announcement. We\u2019re all in for a lot of new traffic in October, and determining the value of that new traffic will require some diligence.<\/p>\n<h2>Update: How does the exact match update\u00a0impact your accounts?<\/h2>\n<p>I followed the results for more than 16,000 advertisers to see how this update impacts Google ads accounts.
