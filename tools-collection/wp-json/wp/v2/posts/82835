These new features include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The ability to add brand guidelines for colors, fonts, and imagery.<\/li>\n<li>Image editing is used to add and extend backgrounds, add objects, and alter image sizes to fit multiple ad placements (think of adding a plant and expanding the wall for a furniture ad).<\/li>\n<li>Auto-generation of ads from a product feed.<\/li>\n<li>Asset-level conversion metrics.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-marketing-live-2024-asset-generation.webp\" alt=\"Google Marketing Live - screenshot of PMax ad creation.\" width=\"852\" height=\"549\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82971 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-marketing-live-2024-asset-generation.webp 852w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-marketing-live-2024-asset-generation-480x309.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 852px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"AI-enhanced-Shopping-Ads\">\n<p>As slick as these ads look, they missed the mark for many marketers like <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/JonKagan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jon Kagan<\/a>, whose challenges revolve around the opacity of PMax ads, not producing more creative assets.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Google-marketing-live-wordstream-Jon.webp\" alt=\"Google Marketing Live - screenshot of a Tweet from Jon Kagan.\" width=\"841\" height=\"391\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83172 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Google-marketing-live-wordstream-Jon.webp 841w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Google-marketing-live-wordstream-Jon-480x223.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 841px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/JonKagan\/status\/1792962476419756507\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>4.

Beginning with men\u2019s and women\u2019s tops, users will be able to see how individual styles look on different body types.<\/p>\n<h4>3D product images<\/h4>\n<p>Using Adidas brand sneakers as an example, Google showed off new 360-degree shoe views that can be featured in ads. Google generates the 3D views using images provided by the seller.<\/p>\n<p>This may end up being a popular option for the narrow band of PPCers who can use it.

That\u2019s great news, but as <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/BorisBeceric\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Boris Beceric<\/a>, a Google Ads consultant and coach, pointed out, it could open the door to increased ad costs for the most profitable campaigns.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Google-marketing-live-wordstream-Boris.webp\" alt=\"Google Marketing Live - screenshot of a Tweet about Google using profit data to increase ad prices.\" width=\"825\" height=\"348\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83013 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Google-marketing-live-wordstream-Boris.webp 825w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Google-marketing-live-wordstream-Boris-480x202.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 825px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/BorisBeceric\/status\/1792959645591674926\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h2>What we didn\u2019t see at Google Marketing Live 2024<\/h2>\n<p>There was a lot for advertisers to be excited about in this year\u2019s GML keynote, but a couple of topics stood out by their absence.<\/p>\n<h3>No B2B-specific products or features<\/h3>\n<p>Once again, the 90-minute Google Marketing Live session focused on the rollout of products designed to help business-to-consumer brands generate more return from their Google Ads investments.<\/p>\n<p>There wasn\u2019t a single mention of a B2B company, example, or use case. For obvious reasons, we\u2019d have loved to see some.<\/p>\n<h3>No (or too few) small-business case studies<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vast majority of Google advertisers are small businesses. It didn\u2019t go unnoticed that just about every example, case study, and customer story featured big brands using Google\u2019s newest features to attract new customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Google-marketing-live-wordstream-Julian.webp\" alt=\"Google Marketing Live - screenshot of a Tweet about lack of smbs in GML.\" width=\"801\" height=\"587\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83011 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Google-marketing-live-wordstream-Julian.webp 801w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Google-marketing-live-wordstream-Julian-480x352.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 801px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/jlnphllp\/status\/1792972283738464371\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source<\/span><\/i><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The majority of example use cases for the new features announced at Google Marketing Live 2024 were for travel and ecommerce\u2013industries that typically thrive in the search ads environment. Meanwhile, the typical small business wouldn\u2019t be able to reap the same benefits from these new features.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our hope is that Google wants to use AI to make advertising easier for smaller businesses with smaller budgets too.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"what-it-all-means\"><\/div>\n<h2>What it all means<\/h2>\n<p>Google threw a lot of stuff at us in the 90-minute GML keynote. Some of it looked useful for most marketers&#8217; ultimate goal: to generate more revenue from Google Ads. But a lot of it felt like a spruced-up, AI-coated repeat from years past.<\/p>\n<h3>Shiny AI features don\u2019t address the biggest advertiser needs<\/h3>\n<p>Google has been moving toward more automation for years. So far, its new AI features look like the same car with a new paint job.<\/p>\n<p>As Julie Bacchini, President of <a href=\"https:\/\/neptunemoon.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Neptune Moon<\/a> and Managing Director of <a href=\"https:\/\/officialppcchat.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PPCChat<\/a>, tweeted, \u201cSo overall, it does not feel like anything really that impactful was announced. A whole lot of AI will be everywhere, but not much else.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Google-marketing-live-wordstream-julie.webp\" alt=\"Google Marketing Live - screenshot of a Tweet about GML not giving anything of substance.\" width=\"877\" height=\"459\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83012 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Google-marketing-live-wordstream-julie.webp 877w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Google-marketing-live-wordstream-julie-480x251.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 877px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/NeptuneMoon\/status\/1792970004306039278\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>What advertisers really want is more visibility and control over their ads. Which is why we heard the loudest cheers for new PMax controls and reporting. Ideally, Google should focus its AI more on helping advertisers manage ads and understand their performance and less on creative production that\u2019s only useful to large brands in a small number of industries.<\/p>\n<h3>The effectiveness of ads in AI Overviews remains to be seen<\/h3>\n<p>Marketers are rightfully concerned (see <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/2024\/05\/17\/google-openai-ai-generative-publishers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/search-engine-traffic-2026-prediction-437650\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>) about the effect AI Overviews will have on their organic search traffic. Google seems to be hoping the new AI Overview ad placements could help alleviate some of those concerns.<\/p>\n<p>However, we saw many questions about Overview Ads from PPC marketers. Are they too far down the page? How will they affect CPCs?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s always a bit concerning to me when Google takes liberties such as these,\u201d Cliff Sizemore, the Sr. Marketing Manager of Growth here at WordStream by LocaliQ, told us. \u201cJust from my experience in search, the queries and intent (close variants in particular) aren&#8217;t always in line with the keyword, and I have the same concern about this. I can see how it would be helpful to users to find what they&#8217;re looking\/shopping for, but AI isn&#8217;t perfect, so only time will tell when it comes to the impact on advertisers.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019ll also be interesting to see where Google places these ads. Most likely, Google will reduce risk to its primary source of profit by keeping highly commercial SERPs focused on traditional ads, not burying them in AI Overviews, for now.<\/p>\n<h3>New ad features may increase clicks but drive up CPLs<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s possible that all these new AI bells and whistles\u2014360-degree product views, in-ad videos, clickable stickers\u2014will make ads more clickable. But ultimately, a higher click-through rate isn\u2019t great if it doesn&#8217;t result in more conversions. Those extra clicks could drive up the cost per lead (CPL), which is the trend we\u2019ve been seeing, as outlined in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/2024-google-ads-benchmarks\">our most recent search advertising benchmarks report<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ll dig deeper into all these announcements and new AI features in an upcoming post, but for now, the takeaway is clear: Google is investing heavily in AI across the board. We get the feeling that not all users are quite as excited about AI as Google is, and regardless, there are bound to be some hiccups, as with any new technology. But we\u2019ll be here to help you all navigate the changes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google Marketing Live 2024 was packed full of announcements.
