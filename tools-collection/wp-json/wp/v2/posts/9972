After all, it is supposed to make an overall impression.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email20signature20marketing20trends20for20202120example201-1.png\" alt=\"email signature marketing trends for 2021 example 1\" width=\"800\" height=\"511\" \/><\/div>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email20signature20marketing20trends20for20202120example202-1.png\" alt=\"email signature marketing trends for 2021 example 2\" width=\"800\" height=\"511\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Serif fonts<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>2021 design trends state that the Serif fonts family is the best for most uses.

They calm the viewer\u2019s mind and create a feeling of chill. So, people are much more likely to pay attention to them instead of bright palettes, curiously enough.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email20signature20marketing20trends20for20202120example203-1.png\" alt=\"email signature marketing trends for 2021 example 3\" width=\"800\" height=\"511\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In your signature, limit the design to two colors only. For instance, make the main text dark grey and the additional dark green. If you don\u2019t have a brandbook, use your corporate colors, ask for a designers\u2019 advice or simply make use of online color palette generators to pick a perfect color combination.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email20signature20marketing20trends20for20202120palette20generator-1.png\" alt=\"email signature marketing trends for 2021 palette generator\" width=\"252\" height=\"470\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Geometric shapes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Try using squares, triangles, circles, etc. in your email signature banners.

Almost the same thing happened with most social media platforms. First, people started using them for personal purposes, and now they have become a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/19\/social-media-for-small-business\">powerful marketing and sales tool<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The interesting fact is that brands start incorporating their email signatures not just in their daily business correspondence, but also in their email newsletters and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/01\/automated-email-marketing\">automated email<\/a> sequences. It helps add a personal touch to automated messages. Especially if your email is about raw statistical data.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email20signature20marketing20trends20for20202120example208-1.png\" alt=\"email signature marketing trends for 2021 example 8\" width=\"800\" height=\"540\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">3.

In this regard, the best practice you can use in 2021 is to make one person responsible for everyone else\u2019s email signature design. This person should create an email signature template that will be used by the whole company (or by a department).<\/p>\n<p>In the next section, we will cover some of the email signature management platforms that allow teams to automate email signature creation and distribution.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email20signature20marketing20trends20for20202120example2011-1.png\" alt=\"email signature marketing trends for 2021 example 11\" width=\"800\" height=\"511\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">4. Automation<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The same research states that in 2020, 62% of professionals used their email signature generators for marketing regularly or occasionally. The growing need to automate signature marketing campaigns leads to the growth of the email signature software market.<\/p>\n<p>There are actually different email signature tools for different purposes. Let\u2019s take a look at some.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MySignature<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mysignature.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MySignature<\/a> concentrates on making email signatures <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/5\/accessibility-inclusivity-advertising\">accessible<\/a> for everyone. Their online editor best fits individuals or small businesses who want to make their signatures stand out.<\/p>\n<p>The variety of settings like adding CTA buttons, custom sign-offs, or changing the design of practically everything, make creating a truly unique signature easy. There\u2019s also a simple dashboard that allows you to copy any signature. So, you can create one and use it as a template for future ones.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Newoldstamp<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/newoldstamp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Newoldstamp\u2019s<\/a> email signature generator does have most of MySignature\u2019s features. However, this tool is created with large companies\u2019 needs in mind. These are, of course, the ability to create a template signature, integrate it with platforms like Microsoft 365 or G Suite, and then easily install all the employees\u2019 signatures in a couple of clicks.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HubSpot<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for a simpler solution to create a basic email signature, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/email-signature-generator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HubSpot\u2019s generator<\/a>.

Segmentation<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>With the adoption of email signature marketing platforms, companies are now able to target different email signature templates to different departments. Marketing managers can change signature elements and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/09\/call-to-action\">call-to-action buttons<\/a> according to the departments\u2019 goals.<\/p>\n<p>Organize signatures by departments.

Automated banner campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>One of the ways to convert an email sign-off into an additional <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/17\/small-business-marketing-tools\">marketing tool<\/a> is to use banner campaigns. In 2021 launching signature banner campaigns will become a huge trend due to the improvements in campaign automation.<\/p>\n<p>Some email signature marketing services offer features that allow you to easily update banners in all of the employees\u2019 signatures from the unique dashboard, set the campaign\u2019s start and end date, and track the CTR using built-in analytics.<\/p>\n<p>Consider email signature banner campaigns as a new way to run ads. You can use Facebook Ads, Google Ads, and banner campaigns together. The latter is only different by being the next funnel stage, as you already have the customer\u2019s email address.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Consider email signature banner campaigns as a new way to run ads.

Tracking analytics<\/h3>\n<p>Every marketing activity in the digital world can be measured. In 2021 brands will start to take data-driven decisions when it comes to business sign-offs as well. The primary <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/17\/content-marketing-kpis\">KPIs<\/a> when launching email signature marketing campaigns are emails sent, impressions, and clicks.<\/p>\n<p>The number of emails you have sent is the initial data that helps you evaluate possible outcomes. It works similarly to regular email campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>Impressions are the number of times your signatures have been seen. You can tell if your email was opened, and how many times, just by looking at impressions.<\/p>\n<p>Clicks (and CTR) are\u00a0undoubtedly\u00a0the most important <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/17\/content-marketing-kpis\">metric<\/a>. You can add links to a logo, a website, a CTA button, social icons, and a banner in your signature. Being able to tell which one works best is somewhat essential for any marketing campaign.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email20signature20marketing20trends20for20202120example2014-1.png\" alt=\"email signature marketing trends for 2021 example 14\" width=\"800\" height=\"431\" \/><\/div>\n<h2><strong>Email signature marketing is on the rise<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Email\u00a0will <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/29\/email-marketing-statistics\">stay among the most ROI-effective<\/a> and wide-spread way of business communication.
