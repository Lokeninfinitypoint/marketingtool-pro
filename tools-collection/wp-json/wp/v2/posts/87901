Whether you reach your destination is hit or miss and you\u2019re going to waste a lot of gas. A content plan keeps your efforts organized and intentional. It also ensures:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Business goal alignment.<\/strong> A content plan helps ensure that every piece of content <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/09\/04\/content-marketing-goal-alignment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contributes to your overall objectives<\/a>, such as lead generation, brand awareness, or customer retention.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Efficiency and consistency. <\/strong>It allows you to allocate resources (budget, staff, tools) properly, keep your team organized and on schedule, and maintain consistent messaging.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Maximized impact.<\/strong> Defining your audience ensures your content resonates best, and strategic planning gets content in front of the right people at the right time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"how-to-create-a-content-plan\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to create a content plan<\/h2>\n<p>I\u2019ve broken down content planning into six key steps. Let\u2019s take a look:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Start with the big picture<\/h3>\n<p>To create a content plan, you first need to lay down your foundation. This includes your goals and target audience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Goals:<\/strong> Make sure you have clear content marketing goals aligned with business objectives. For example, maybe you want to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/14\/increase-traffic-to-my-website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">increase organic traffic<\/a>, generate leads, or increase customer retention. For help with this, check out our posts on <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-plan-goals-objectives-for-small-businesses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing goals<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/long-term-business-goals-with-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">long-term business goals<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Target audience: <\/strong>This one is huge. I don&#8217;t necessarily mean the audience itself, either, but the importance of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">knowing your target audience<\/a>. You need to know who you want to reach with your content. Note also that your target audience with your content isn\u2019t just your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/23\/buyer-personas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">buyer personas<\/a>. It includes them, but it also includes complementary businesses and influencers who will amplify your content.<\/p>\n<p>For help finding your target audience, here are <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/target-audience\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">12 questions to ask<\/a> as well as some <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/target-market-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">target market examples<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Conduct a content audit<\/h3>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve gotten yourself oriented with step one, it\u2019s time to take an inventory of your existing content to gather information, find gaps, and identify opportunities. The level of effort required for this step will vary depending on how long you\u2019ve been in your role and how much content your business has produced. Luckily for you, I\u2019ve got a thorough walk-through of how to do a content audit that will cover any scenario. You can find it here, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/10\/content-audit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to Run a Content Audit: Full Guide + Free Templates<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/content-plan-audit-example.webp\" alt=\"content marketing plan - content audit template screenshot\" width=\"858\" height=\"444\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87908 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/content-plan-audit-example.webp 858w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/content-plan-audit-example-480x248.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 858px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have much content to begin with, it may be worth doing a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/competitive-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">competitive analysis <\/a>or even looking at some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/18\/content-marketing-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content marketing examples<\/a> just to get acquainted.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Establish your key themes<\/h3>\n<p>These are not your topics. That comes later in the tactical section. What I\u2019m talking about here are the core pillars you want to be covering every month. A good way to do this is to take a look at the categories that exist on your blog. Consolidate them into about 5-7 core pillars. These core pillars need to address all four of the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/10\/27\/brand-messaging\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">brand voice<\/a> and core values<\/li>\n<li>Stages of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/01\/content-marketing-funnel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content marketing funnel<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Your specific offerings<\/li>\n<li>Your reader personas<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Note that these pillars will not map 1:1 to your blog categories, nor should they. You should have more categories than pillars.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Outline the process<\/h3>\n<p>Now it\u2019s time to get tactical. As I said above, your content plan covers the what and how of your content strategy. Here are the two key elements:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Topic selection:<\/strong> Map out how you will come up with topics and titles. This should include a combination of strategies, including<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> keyword research<\/a>, current events, creative <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/03\/brainstorming-techniques\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">brainstorming<\/a>, social listening, competitive analysis, content performance analysis, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/03\/repurposing-content\">repurposing<\/a> content.

This includes writing, editing, and approving, as well as who is in charge of what and how long each piece will take. This may vary depending on the type of content (a blog post vs an ebook or webinar, for example). Check out the resources below for more help with the production aspect of your content plan.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/13\/content-creation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Content Creation: Absolutely Everything You Ever Need to Know<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/06\/content-marketing-tools\">Must-Try Marketing Tools<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/24\/editorial-calendar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to Create an Editorial Calendar (+Free Template!)<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/content-plan-calendar.webp\" alt=\"content plan - example content calendar\" width=\"789\" height=\"434\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87910 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/content-plan-calendar.webp 789w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/content-plan-calendar-480x264.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 789px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/monday.com\/blog\/project-management\/editorial-calendar-software\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udea8 Put your content on a schedule ASAP<\/strong> with our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/marketing-calendar?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2025MarketingCalendar_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free marketing calendar template<\/a> complete with year-round marketing tips and ideas, holidays to frame content around, and more!<\/p>\n<h3>5. Plan out the distribution<\/h3>\n<p>Now that you\u2019ve outlined your content themes and process, it\u2019s time to figure out how and where your content will be distributed. This means two things:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Channels<\/strong>: Popular marketing channels include your website, blog, social media, email, partners, and influencers. The best ones for your business depend on where your audience spends most of its time and how much bandwidth you have. It\u2019s important to diversify and tailor your content to each channel while maintaining your brand voice\u2014like using visuals for Instagram, thought leadership posts for LinkedIn, or short, engaging videos for TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>Some more resources to help you out here include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-channels\/\">Must-Have Marketing Channels to Try Now<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/brand-consistency\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reasons Why Brand Consistency Matters (+Ways To Build It)<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/11\/most-popular-social-media-platforms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Most Popular Social Media<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/11\/most-popular-social-media-platforms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Pl<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/11\/most-popular-social-media-platforms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">atforms<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/11\/most-popular-social-media-platforms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> 2025<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Frequency<\/strong>: How often you will publish content on each of your chosen channels? How often will you publish certain types of content? For example, you may do monthly webinars and ebooks, weekly blog posts, and daily social media posts. Your content frequency should align with your overall marketing goals and the resources you have available. A content calendar will be critical here to help you stay consistent and organized.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/marketing-channel-mix-wordstream-1024x791.webp\" alt=\"marketing channel mix\" width=\"1024\" height=\"791\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85428 size-large\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>6. Track and measure<\/h3>\n<p>This final step ensures that all your hard work is paying off and that you\u2019re continually optimizing your content strategy for better results. What I mean by track and measure is:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Have a content library<\/strong>: This should be a spreadsheet that lists all your content assets, with tabs for different content types, such as blogs, ebooks, webinars, case studies, and videos.<\/p>\n<p>Be sure to include relevant details like the last modified date, target audience, and product it supports. You don\u2019t need to include performance metrics here. The idea is to keep everything organized so that others can access the content and you can easily repurpose and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/03\/get-more-traffic-from-evergreen-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">update content<\/a> in the future.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Measure performance<\/strong>: Define the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-measure-brand-awareness\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">key metrics<\/a> that will determine the success of your content. These can include metrics such as website traffic, social media engagement, conversion rates, lead generation, and time spent on the page. Be sure to establish a regular cadence for reporting on these metrics, depending on your goals and the volume of content you produce. Some should be reported on weekly, others monthly, and others quarterly.<\/p>\n<p>Some resources to help you out here include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/social-media-metrics\/\">Essential Social Media Metrics to Track (+How to Do It)<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-metrics\/\">Key Need-to-Know Marketing Metrics for Every Strategy<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/17\/content-marketing-kpis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Content Marketing KPIs To Track (+Infographic)<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Based on the data you collect, make it a habit to review and adjust your content plan regularly. If a particular type of content is underperforming, brainstorm ways to improve or test new formats. And on the flip side, if something is working well, think about how you can double down on that strategy.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/content-plan-summary.webp\" alt=\"content plan - summary of content planning report example\" width=\"792\" height=\"408\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87909 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/content-plan-summary.webp 792w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/content-plan-summary-480x247.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 792px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"content-planning-template\"><\/div>\n<h2>Put it all together with this content planning template<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/11M9YzKYvuoSIaWWylMoga0Qd1fir0FDXXOqnLs5Wdb0\/copy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This content plan template<\/a> employs the tips and steps I\u2019ve illustrated above.
