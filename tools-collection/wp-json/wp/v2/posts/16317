The query \u201c___ to avoid\u201d has increased by 150%.<\/h2>\n<p>If there was a major \u201ctheme\u201d to Google Marketing Live 2018, it was that users increasingly expect more personalized online experiences. It\u2019s no secret that search queries have become more conversational, and that people rely more on their devices for information now than ever before; but Google\u2019s Senior VP of Ads Sridhar Ramaswamy laid bare just <em>how<\/em> research-obsessed users are today: <strong>The query \u201c___ to avoid\u201d has risen by 150%, and the query \u201cis ___ worth it\u201d has risen by 80%. <\/strong><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6be0d320-06ca-4660-8a1e-2dae406d069f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-marketing-live-queries.jpg\" alt=\"Google Marketing Live Statistics\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Sridhar Ramaswamy on-stage talking search habits.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Not only are users spending copious amounts of time searching for the best products and services to buy, but they\u2019re now using process of elimination to determine which products and services <em>not <\/em>to buy. For comparison\u2019s sake, that\u2019s like scrolling through the Drama section of On Demand, deciding on a movie to watch, then putting it on the backburner while you scroll through the rest of the section to cover all your bases. You\u2019re no longer directly searching for the best movie. You\u2019re indirectly searching for the best movie by making sure the rest of the catalogue isn\u2019t as good.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a new level of compulsion and thoroughness that demands increased attention to detail on behalf of advertisers. And with the introduction of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/28\/machine-learning-applications\">machine-learning<\/a>-inspired features like Smart Shopping and Smart Campaigns (more below), Google is looking to give advertisers the tools they need to succeed in that landscape.<\/p>\n<h2>2. 91% of smartphone users bought, or planned to buy something after seeing a relevant video ad.<\/h2>\n<p>The term \u201cmachine learning\u201d can become pretty vacuous the more you hear it, but it\u2019s really about understanding and adapting to user intent. And matching user search intent is about more than providing the right keyword, or the right bid; it\u2019s about presenting your targets with <strong>relevant<\/strong> ads.<\/p>\n<p>How big of a difference does relevance make? Quite a bit, according to Group Product Manager of Video Ads, Nicky Rettke: <strong>91% of smartphone owners have bought, or planned to buy something after seeing a video ad they described as relevant.<\/strong> They also pay <strong>3x more attention to relevant video ads. <\/strong><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"0cfac5d0-55cd-4b82-8c24-85a0e130a6fb\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-marketing-live-statistics-video-ads.jpg\" alt=\"Google Marketing Live Statistics Video Ads\" width=\"1024\" height=\"571\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Google\u2019s solution to an increased need for relevance? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/products\/youtube-trueview\/\">TrueView<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"b0a5691d-7c3b-4f57-bdef-d95402a4e23f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-marketing-live-2018-mobile_0.png\" alt=\"Google Marketing Live Statistics TruView\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>TrueView offers a three-faceted approach to YouTube video ads:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>TrueView for reach<\/strong>: Advertise to prospects who have recently searched for your products or services online with CPM (Cost-per-thousand impressions) bidding.<\/li>\n<li><strong>TrueView for action<\/strong>: Advertise to prospects who have recently searched for your products or services online with videos that emphasize prominent call-to-actions.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Maximize Lift bidding<\/strong>: Google\u2019s new Smart Bidding strategy, which automatically adjusts bids at auction time to maximize the impact of your video ads.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>TrueView is a full-funnel solution to video ads, and it offers relevance at every stage\u2014from first action, to conversion.<\/p>\n<h2>3. 50% of consumers have abandoned making a purchase because the site took too long to load.<\/h2>\n<p>This glorious nugget of statistical goodness came courtesy of Google Ads Product Management Director, Anthony Chavez: <strong>50% of consumers have abandoned making a purchase because the site took too long to load<\/strong>. Fittingly, Google announced the day prior to Marketing Live that the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/01\/22\/google-speed-update\">Speed Update<\/a>\u2014which launched in January, and which made mobile page speed a major ranking factor\u2014had officially rolled out to all users.

MLPSS scores landing page speed on a ten-point scale\u2014from \u201cvery slow\u201d to \u201cextremely fast\u201d\u2014and does so based on a number of factors. One of those factors is the relationship between page speed and potential conversion rate; and therein lies the major difference between the MLPSS and site speed measurement tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/speed\/pagespeed\/insights\/\">PageSpeed Insights<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/testmysite.thinkwithgoogle.com\/\">Test My Site<\/a>\u2014rather than scoring page speed independently, the MLPSS takes potential ad performance into account <em>in concert<\/em> with load speed itself.<\/p>\n<p>Throw in the fact that the MLPSS lives within the Google Ads UI, and is updated daily, and you have one heck of a page speed measurement tool for advertisers.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Nearly half of all small business owners in the United States don\u2019t have a website.<\/h2>\n<p>Google Ads is hard. It\u2019s no surprise that an overwhelming number of small business owners outsource their paid search workload to agencies, contractors, and admittedly epic <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/products\">PPC software<\/a> companies. But imagine this: <strong>half of all small business owners in the United States don\u2019t even have a <em>website. <\/em><\/strong>You can bet your ass that the small business owners among that 50% don\u2019t know how to run PPC campaigns; and in all likelihood, that they don\u2019t even know <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/ppc-free-trial\">what PPC is<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Google is now offering <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/outreach-initiatives\/small-business\/google-ads-helping-businesses\/\">Smart Campaigns<\/a> to the PPC-challenged among us. Smart Campaigns puts machine learning in the hands of small business owners, with dynamic campaigns that send search ads live in minutes. And for the website-less, Google will soon be launching brand new, totally awesome \u201cauto-optimized landing pages\u201d within Smart Campaigns.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"52daaaad-6aaf-4337-bf29-7995817316ad\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-marketing-live-statistics-website.jpg\" alt=\"Google Marketing Live Statistics Spalding\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Kim Spalding, GM and Product Management Director of Small Business Ads, dropping nuclear tech missiles.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Auto-optimized landing pages are, well, a lot like they sound\u2014machine learning technology pulls products and services directly from search ads in your Smart Campaigns onto dynamically created landing pages.

Much like TrueView\u2019s Maximize Lift bidding technology, the shiny new <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/technology\/ads\/machine-learning-hands-advertisers\/\">Smart Shopping<\/a> now supports automated bidding, too\u2014so your bids will automatically adjust to produce your desired outcomes. And speaking of desired outcomes: Shopping now supports two new ones\u2014store visits, and new customers.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s pretty much it, in terms of automation\u2026ha! Just kidding! Smart Shopping also automates the placement process across <em>millions of apps and websites<\/em>. Wherever your ads are likely to perform best, that\u2019s where Smart Shopping will aim to put them\u2014making smart adjustments along the way.<\/p>\n<h2>Just Statistics\u2026Don\u2019t Go Ballistics<\/h2>\n<p>Gosh, stats are exciting! They\u2019re concrete. They\u2019re trustworthy. They have math and stuff.<\/p>\n<p>Still: while it\u2019s totally fair to be head over heels with some of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/01\/new-google-ads-features-for-agencies\">new features available within Google Ads<\/a>, you should take each with a grain of salt. Machine learning has insane upside\u2014the ability to automate workflow while creating more personalized ad experiences is a tantalizing prospect. But at the end of the day, these are <em>machine-driven systems<\/em>. Give up too much campaign control in the name of \u201csmarts\u201d and convenience, and you risk glossing over the finer points of both your business and ad creation. And these are the points that can drive truly low CPAs.<\/p>\n<p>Happy experimenting!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>More Google Marketing Live content:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/14\/google-marketing-livestream-2021\">Google Marketing Livestream 2021: What You Really Need to Know<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/14\/google-marketing-live\">9 Massive Changes Coming to Google Ads #GoogleMarketingLive 2019<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/12\/google-marketing-live-statistics\">Mind-Blowing Statistics from Google Marketing Live 2018<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/23\/google-marketing-next\">11 Changes &amp; New Features Coming to AdWords: What You Need to Know (2017 GML)<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google just announced some seriously exciting new features coming to Google Ads; and it seemed like behind each new feature was a riveting, previously unknown statistic.
