It was a direct response to Facebook\u2019s then in-app publishing platform (Instant Articles), and Apple\u2019s iOS 9 news aggregation and discovery platform (Apple News).<\/p>\n<p>The AMP version of a product page, blog post, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/effective-landing-pages\">landing page<\/a> is meant to load instantly on mobile. It may also appear differently or in a card form in the mobile SERP.\u00a0The AMP lightning bolt symbol associated with a result lets users know that that particular page will load faster than other non-AMP pages around it.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/what20is20google20AMP20top20stories_1.png\" alt=\"what is google AMP top stories\" width=\"300\" height=\"485\" \/><\/div>\n<p>According to an early <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginewatch.com\/2019\/08\/22\/how-amp-technology-upgrade-emails\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study<\/a>, Google AMP pages load four times faster and use eight times less data than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/10\/mobile-landing-pages\">traditional mobile-optimized pages<\/a>. The initial idea was to provide an open-source framework that would make the mobile experience not just better, but faster.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>The initial idea was to provide an open-source framework that would make the mobile experience not just better, but faster.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>Is AMP essential?<\/h2>\n<p>Before we get into the pros and cons of Google AMP, it&#8217;s important to note that while AMP\u00a0can help your SEO, it is not necessarily <em>essential<\/em> for SEO in some cases, and\u00a0the\u00a0benefits are more applicable to some businesses than others. We will do a deeper dive into the\u00a0pros and cons of AMP next, but let\u2019s first just provide some key points that can help you orient yourself to AMP as it relates to your business:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>AMP is widely adopted by publisher sites that have a high volume of news articles or blog posts. If the majority of your website pages aren\u2019t articles, then AMP may not be necessary for your business.<\/li>\n<li>If you do publish a high volume of articles but are already using a CDN (content delivery network), these platforms often come with performance optimization features such as image hosting, file caching, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/08\/lazy-loading-seo\">lazy loading<\/a> (which means the text loads first, before the images).<\/li>\n<li>AMP pages are cleaner and simpler for readers, but often because certain JavaScript functions and plugins are deprioritized or suppressed. If you rely on third-party tools for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/17\/b2b-lead-generation\">lead capturing<\/a> and audience tracking, you\u2019ll want to test to make sure your AMP pages function and capture information the same as your regular pages.<\/li>\n<li>AMP itself is not a Google ranking factor. It can help improve aspects of your web pages that are factored into Google\u2019s algorithm (especially with <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/19\/core-web-vitals-google-page-experience-update\">Core Web Vitals <\/a>becoming a ranking factor in 2021), but it is not the only way to optimize your site\u2019s experience and performance.<\/li>\n<li>If you already have a mobile version of your site or mobile optimization measures in place (such as consolidated or minified CSS code), AMP may not be necessary and may even complicate performance and reporting.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote><p><strong>While AMP\u00a0can help your SEO, it\u00a0is not necessarily <em>essential<\/em> for SEO, and its benefits are more applicable to some businesses than others.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So the bottom line is, optimizing for page speed and mobile experience is essential for SEO, and Google AMP is just one way of achieving that. Read on to learn about how it works and whether it\u2019s the right solution for your business.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the\u00a0benefits of Google AMP?<\/h2>\n<p>Apart from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/01\/22\/google-speed-update\">faster loading speeds<\/a>\u00a0and a better\u00a0experience for content consumers, AMP offers several benefits to businesses with a content and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/08\/seo-during-covid-19\">SEO strategy<\/a>:<\/p>\n<h3>Increased website engagement<\/h3>\n<p>Lightweight AMP content meshes well with mobile users that have a less-than-stable internet connection. Additionally, the decrease in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/22\/google-page-speed\">page load time<\/a> improves the user experience in a way that increases the chances of visitors staying on your site longer.<\/p>\n<h3>Improved ranking and traffic<\/h3>\n<p>Also, with page load time being a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/09\/google-ranking-factors\">Google ranking factor<\/a>, AMPs are prioritized in Google\u2019s search algorithms, thus affecting <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/19\/get-on-first-page-google\">rankings<\/a>. Essentially, if two sites are neck-and-neck, the faster one wins out.<\/p>\n<h3>Lower bounce rates<\/h3>\n<p>With your pages loading faster, visitors usually stay onsite. A Google study once found that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/data\/mobile-site-abandonment-three-second-load\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">53% of website visits are abandoned <\/a>if a mobile site takes longer than 23 seconds to load. Additionally, publishers who implement AMP could potentially get a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ampproject.org\/latest\/blog\/amp-two-years-of-user-first-webpages\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2x increase<\/a> in time spent on a page.

It\u2019s linked in display with the AMP HTML link in the source code.

At its core, AMP HTML prioritizes efficiency over creativity, so if <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/09\/29\/data-visualization-tools\">engaging visuals<\/a> is a big part of your web experience, this may not be for you.<\/li>\n<li>In addition to limited images on your AMP pages, you&#8217;ll also only be allowed one advertisement per page. This limiting framework also doesn\u2019t support disruptive ads like expendables, while direct-sold ads can be difficult to implement.<\/li>\n<li>From a marketing perspective, it costs double the crawl for one piece of content, part of Google\u2019s thrust to ensure parity. For many publishers, it\u2019s been found to drive impressions but not necessarily engagement metrics. This is due to the Top Stories carousel that encourages users to read from other sources.<\/li>\n<li>In a similar vein, Google\u2019s AMP viewer tends to dilute <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/10\/brand-awareness\">brand identity<\/a> as a Google domain is shown in the address bar. While there is a fix to show the actual site on top of the AMP page, it takes up precious space above the fold.\u00a0You may also not achieve the same brand feel with a Google AMP page vs a standard page, as seen with the example below:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google20AMP20version20vs20regular20version.png\" alt=\"google AMP version vs regular version\" width=\"800\" height=\"422\" \/><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li>As well, AMP only works if users click on the AMP version of a webpage (instead of the canonical version). And while studies have found that the AMP library can reduce the number of\u00a0server requests to fetch a document by <a href=\"https:\/\/timkadlec.com\/remembers\/2018-03-19-how-fast-is-amp-really\/\">as much 77%<\/a>, the AMP version is not always served if it\u2019s not implemented correctly.<\/li>\n<li>While AMP has been around for four years, it\u2019s still relatively in its nascent stages.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here are some final details about Google AMP that must be considered when deciding whether to implement it\u00a0on your site.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You need to use a streamlined version of CSS.<\/li>\n<li>You\u2019re only allowed to use the JavaScript library that AMP provides, and because you\u2019re not in control, you could experience lazy loading (perhaps the only downside of AMP).<\/li>\n<li>AMP sites must be properly validated if they are to work every time.<\/li>\n<li>AMP plugin pages don\u2019t allow forms.<\/li>\n<li>Custom fonts need to be specially loaded for better experience.<\/li>\n<li>You need to declare image heights and widths.<\/li>\n<li>You need AMP-approved extensions if you want <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/03\/video-marketing-ideas\">video content<\/a> on your pages.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Finally, AMP prioritizes speed and readability, not shareability.

This allows you to build enough data to ensure that rolling out AMP sitewide is worth it.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>It can take a couple of days for Google to find, check, and index the AMP version of a page, and you should run your AMP\u00a0pages for\u00a0at least a month in order to gain meaningful data.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Step #3:\u00a0Track performance<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>As with anything in digital marketing, you need to <a href=\"\/conversion-tracking\">track the performance<\/a> of your AMP pages. Not just to see how you compare with your competitors, but also to see if your performance is aligned with your goals.<\/p>\n<p>You can use in-house tools to do this, such as Google Analytics,\u00a0or any of the various third-party <a href=\"https:\/\/shanebarker.com\/blog\/b2b-marketing-tools\/\">B2B tools<\/a>. There are a number of analytics vendors that provide built-in features for AMP analytics.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/what20is20AMP20how20to20track20AMP20in20Google20analytcs.png\" alt=\"what is AMP how to track AMP in Google analytcs\" width=\"800\" height=\"284\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/amp-reporting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Other important things to note include using canonical URLs and other variables to define what should be recorded. This is crucial for\u00a0identifying any <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/13\/organic-traffic-drops\">traffic fluctuations<\/a> caused by AMP.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, the extraUrlParams attribute in amp-analytics adds a query string parameter to the canonical URL (such as <em>\u201ctype=amp\u201d<\/em>). This makes it easier to differentiate AMP pages from normal web pages in analytics. This enables you to compare total traffic on pages before and after AMP launch.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Canonical URLs enable you to isolate AMP traffic in Google analytics for better tracking and optimizaiton.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Is AMP right for you?<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As you\u2019ve learned, AMP is a great way to speed up web pages, ultimately, providing better UX in your content delivery, particularly for mobile users.
