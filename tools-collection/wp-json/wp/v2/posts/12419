The likes on social and positive testimonials are easier to highlight\u2014those feel good!<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1b77e199-8dd8-41ad-9fa9-e8fb4d10898f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-feedback-intro.jpg\" alt=\"phone with likes and comment bubbles\" width=\"624\" height=\"416\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>But if you\u2019re not paying attention to all customer feedback, you may be missing on a huge chunk of knowledge. What your customers think about the business means a lot because they\u2019re the ones paying for it. But that\u2019s not the only reason.<\/p>\n<p>You can use customer feedback to make your business and marketing better. Feedback lets you get an outside perspective on your business as well as understand your customers on a deeper level.<\/p>\n<p>Here are six easy ways to incorporate customer feedback into your business strategy:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Measure performance<\/li>\n<li>Create a customer journey map<\/li>\n<li>Get proactive about public communication<\/li>\n<li>Use social proof in ads<\/li>\n<li>Boost your rank on Google<\/li>\n<li>Have customer-focused brainstorms<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get to it.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Measure performance<\/h2>\n<p>If you have already started measuring your business\u2019s performance, you know what a difference this makes. Knowing your LTV, ROI, and CPA is crucial for understanding whether you\u2019re really making money or need to be concerned.<\/p>\n<p>These stats are great for understanding the basics. If you want to advance even more with analytics, throw in CSAT and NPM into the mix.<\/p>\n<p>CSAT, the Customer Satisfaction Score shows how much are the customers loving your product. It\u2019s a simple survey that asks your client how happy they are with the product on a scale from 1 to 10. You can do it on your website with apps like HubSpot forms or send a Google Form to newsletter subscribers.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how a similar chart looks like:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3d61e7dd-ed97-4418-be97-1807ec661f66\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-feedback-measure-performance.jpg\" alt=\"customer feedback Hotjar example\" width=\"338\" height=\"229\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hotjar.com\/customers\/ryanair\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>If it\u2019s getting low, it would indicate the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/10\/cac-vs-clv\">customers lifetime value <\/a>will decrease, too. Good customer experience means that the customer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/08\/reduce-churn\">churn rate would be lower<\/a>, making you more money from each lead on average.<\/p>\n<p>NPS, or net promoter score, is a similar scale from 1 to 10 that shows how much a customer is likely to promote your product to their friends. While this stat is important for customer satisfaction, you probably already see the implications.<\/p>\n<p>If NPS high, it means you will be spending less money to attract leads as more will be coming in via word-of-mouth marketing.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Create a customer journey map<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/11\/21\/customer-journey-mapping\">Customer journey mapping<\/a> can also benefit from knowing the perspective of the customers. What most people get wrong when they\u2019re mapping out the customer journey is creating a journey they want to see, not the journey that exists.<\/p>\n<p>When you create a map of how customers interact with your business, it\u2019s important to record all interactions, positive or negative. Sometimes, a customer wants to make an action with your business, and they just don\u2019t succeed. The map should reflect that.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f8a66687-af02-45fe-ad61-76e870f6d130\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-feedback-customer-journey-mapping.jpg\" alt=\"customer journey examples\" width=\"624\" height=\"327\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mycustomer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/hotc_map.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It can hurt to admit poor user experience design on your part, but finding spots where you and the customer can\u2019t connect is key to improving your business.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s something you can\u2019t do without customer feedback. Unfortunately, people sometimes interact with your system not in the way you planned. The only way to learn about the problem you have is to gather customer feedback.<\/p>\n<p>Checking the most widespread complaints or doing personal interviews with a focus on what problems did a customer encounter would do the trick. If you\u2019re targeting a foreign audience, you can leverage one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/cooltechzone.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">opportunities of VPN<\/a> to get even deeper into it.<\/p>\n<p>Set the VPN to the country you\u2019re targeting and view your website. It may load slower or display an element in the wrong way. Take note of that.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Get proactive about public communication<\/h2>\n<p>PR is more than submitting\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/04\/how-to-write-a-press-release\">a press release\u00a0<\/a>to a news company.\u00a0In the highly digitized world that we live in, everything you do online is public communication. Every time you get a negative comment online, even on a website you don\u2019t know about, it\u2019s a public relations issue.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.inc.com\/craig-bloem\/84-percent-of-people-trust-online-reviews-as-much-.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">91% of people would read a review <\/a>online before making a purchase. If they come across a lot of negative reviews, you might not close the sale.<\/p>\n<p>There are two ways to solve this problem, neither of them involves trying to get that review deleted. Both do involve getting proactive about public communication. The first way is to inspire your clients to leave more reviews. The odds are the negative review won\u2019t look as impressive when there are so many good ones accompanying it.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s always good to increase the number of reviews you get, but there\u2019s another way. A way that\u2019s arguably more beneficial for your business.<\/p>\n<p>Receiving a negative review on a platform where you can communicate to the client presents a perfect PR opportunity. Answer the client. Apologize for causing them inconvenience, promise to work on that in the future, or offer a gift as a sign of apology.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"93f3d7ec-88c0-43b8-a8ae-78919b2ca4f4\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-feedback-reviews.jpg\" alt=\"example customer review\" width=\"486\" height=\"449\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/lokma-san-francisco\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>That will show anyone doing their product research you care about customers. Plus, it\u2019s an opportunity to turn a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/11\/20\/prioritizing-at-risk-clients\">client that\u2019s at risk<\/a> to a loyal one.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Use social proof in ads<\/h2>\n<p>People trust reviews just as much as they do their friends. If you have received quite a number of good reviews, you can use them in advertising. You\u2019ve probably seen it done on many websites.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"86b38f5e-2326-41a8-9b9e-ce2c4827c8cb\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-feedback-social-proof.jpg\" alt=\"customer feedback as social proof example\" width=\"624\" height=\"391\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mahergram.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Most ecommerce websites now have a section that contains testimonials. At least, that\u2019s considered good practice since having that section can <a href=\"https:\/\/vwo.com\/success-stories\/wikijob\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">increase your conversion rate\u00a0by 34%<\/a>. The problem is that most people are not using the full potential of customer reviews.<\/p>\n<p>To make it work, you have to make the reviews more personal. Add a photograph of the reviewer, mention their name, and make sure to add a link to their profile on social media or at least an Instagram handle.<\/p>\n<p>This will show that it\u2019s genuine and convince more people to make a purchase. Use real reviews on your website, newsletters, and ads to increase conversions.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Boost your rank on Google<\/h2>\n<p>These are not the only places where customer feedback can come in handy. Google has a review system of its own so it\u2019s only natural that they use it as a ranking factor. It\u2019s not clear whether Google reviews influence ranking on SERP, but it is a ranking signal for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/12\/13\/local-search-marketing\">local search<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Every time you search a local query on Google, you see the map with a list of businesses first.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"707c7511-c77a-4292-b961-cb79952b33f0\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-feedback-google-map.jpg\" alt=\"customer feedback used in Google map\" width=\"624\" height=\"744\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>How high your business will come up on this search depends on many factors like the proximity to the user and the number of quotes with the location address. User reviews are another important factor on this list.<\/p>\n<p>If you encourage your clients to leave positive reviews on your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/27\/google-my-business\">Google My Business page<\/a>, this small step could help your SEO efforts quite a bit. Print out a small card with an invitation to leave a review and a QR code that leads to your GMB page. Place it near the counter or at all tables if you run a restaurant.<\/p>\n<p>You can also leverage the power of social proof on the SERP. Include rich snippets to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/20\/schema-seo\">Schema markup<\/a>, and you may be the only website on the SERP that shows user reviews.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"18607363-0e82-4f5c-87f1-fe569add9742\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-feedback-google-search-ad.jpg\" alt=\"customer feedback in Google search ad\" width=\"624\" height=\"152\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>In this case, the website may start stealing traffic from your competitors, even if they rank higher.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re selling your products on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/16\/user-generated-images-google-shopping-reviews\">Google Shopping<\/a>, you absolutely need user reviews, too. Google Shopping attracts the audience that is ready to buy, and the only discerning factors are the price and the review score. Encourage clients to leave a review within a week of the purchase to get more reviews.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Have customer-focused brainstorms<\/h2>\n<p>The last tip may not be as practical as the first five, but it can be a lot more beneficial in the long run. You can fix productivity problems and improve conversions even without customer feedback, even though it would be much harder. This bit, you can\u2019t do without it.<\/p>\n<p>Reading through customer feedback, especially negative comments and suggestions, can be eye opening. It\u2019s not guaranteed to produce results every time, but every once in a while, you\u2019ll see a comment that will let you understand your customer base deeper.<\/p>\n<p>A customer explaining their feelings about the purchase will give you an idea of what emotions you should focus on in advertising. A customer telling about the problem they solved or failed to solve with your product will give you an idea of how to fix it or even create a new product.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, no customer will ever outline you a full path to greatness. But start your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/03\/brainstorming-techniques\">brainstorming<\/a> with customer feedback. The research, planning, and execution will still be a tough job. But your customers can let you know where to start, and in a world where fresh ideas make millions, that\u00a0can be enough.<\/p>\n<h2>Start using customer feedback in your marketing strategy<\/h2>\n<p>Customer feedback is essential to any business. Showcase the most flattering feedback, and you may be able to convince some leads to make a purchase. Encourage more clients to leave a review, and you\u2019ll improve Google ranking. Analyze it, and you\u2019ll be able to improve the problems you didn\u2019t think your business had.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the author<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Connie Benton is a chief content writer, guest contributor and enthusiastic blogger who helps B2B companies reach their audiences more effectively.
