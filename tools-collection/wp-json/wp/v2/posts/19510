But was it true?<\/p>\n<p>I had a little idea: What if we used data from our <a href=\"\/keywords\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a> to determine which keywords had the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/07\/18\/adwords-cost-per-click-too-high\">highest costs per click<\/a> (or CPC\u2019s) in Google AdWords, driving up <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/05\/online-advertising-costs\">online advertising costs<\/a>?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/articles\/most-expensive-keywords\">The infographic we created<\/a> based on that data is still one of our most popular and most linked to pages ever, but people often ask us for updated data.<\/p>\n<p>Those people, and curious people everywhere, are in luck! We\u2019ve completed a new, comprehensive analysis of keyword data for five different currencies in English-speaking countries (check out for the data for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/28\/most-expensive-keywords-uk-edition\">GBP<\/a>, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/10\/highest-cpc-keywords-canada\">CAD<\/a>, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/03\/most-expensive-keywords-australia-edition\">AUS<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/07\/most-expensive-keywords-south-africa\">ZAR<\/a> too!).<\/p>\n<p>This time around, we determined the top 25 most expensive keywords (meaning these niche markets are super-competitive) along with their average CPC \u2013 and six years later, the results are substantially different!<\/p>\n<p>Ready to see what the most expensive keywords are in 2017? Here we go:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/most-expensive-keywords_usd_web-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"most expensive keywords in google adwords\" width=\"800\" height=\"3500\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>About the data<\/h2>\n<p>Here\u2019s how we got the list: We pulled all the data collected from anonymous <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/08\/13\/adwords-report\">reports<\/a> across all industries between June 1, 2016 and June 12, 2017, then looked at the top 1000 most expensive keywords seen during that time period and categorized them by core intent.<\/p>\n<p>For example, we lumped the keywords \u201cbail bonds\u201d and \u201cbail bonds los angeles\u201d into a single category since the core intent is the same. Likewise, keywords involving different types of lawyers (such as \u201cmalpractice lawyer\u201d and \u201cinjury lawyer\u201d) or insurance were grouped together. We used a similar methodology last time so as to avoid featuring too many specific long-tail or local keywords that wouldn\u2019t have broad applicability to a large number of businesses. We separated distinct services (pest control vs. termites) as much as possible.<\/p>\n<p>We also filtered out keywords with less than 100 clicks from our data set. We only looked at advertisers bidding in USD, GBP, AUD, CAD, and ZAR, and analyzed different currencies separately. We also eliminated non-English ads and duplicates (where both the keyword and the CPC were exactly the same) from that set. The results you\u2019re reading about in this article are in USD.<\/p>\n<p>Shout out to everyone who helped compile, analyze, and illustrate the data: our data analyst Josh Brackett, our web team leader Meg Lister, and our designer Kate Lindsay.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the most expensive keywords in Google Ads?<\/h2>\n<p>The top 25 most expensive keywords in Google are as follows:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Top 25 Most Expensive Keywords<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Keyword<\/th>\n<th>Average CPC<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Business Services<\/td>\n<td>$58.64<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Bail Bonds<\/td>\n<td>$58.48<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Casino<\/td>\n<td>$55.48<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Lawyer<\/td>\n<td>$54.86<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Asset Management<\/td>\n<td>$49.86<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Insurance<\/td>\n<td>$48.41<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Cash Services &amp; Payday Loans<\/td>\n<td>$48.18<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Cleanup &amp; Restoration Services<\/td>\n<td>$47.61<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Degree<\/td>\n<td>$47.36<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Medical Coding Services<\/td>\n<td>$46.84<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Rehab<\/td>\n<td>$46.14<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Psychic<\/td>\n<td>$43.78<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Timeshare<\/td>\n<td>$42.13<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0HVAC<\/td>\n<td>$41.24<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Business Software<\/td>\n<td>$41.12<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Medical Needs<\/td>\n<td>$40.73<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Loans<\/td>\n<td>$40.69<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Plumber<\/td>\n<td>$39.19<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Termites<\/td>\n<td>$38.88<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Pest Control<\/td>\n<td>$38.84<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Mortgages<\/td>\n<td>$36.76<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Online Gambling<\/td>\n<td>$32.84<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Banking<\/td>\n<td>$31.43<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Hair Transplant<\/td>\n<td>$31.37<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0Google AdWords<\/td>\n<td>$30.06<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>What makes these keywords so expensive?<\/h2>\n<p>Generally, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/21\/how-much-does-adwords-cost\">AdWords keyword costs<\/a> get driven up in particular niches for one of the following reasons:<\/p>\n<h3>People have a bad problem they really need to fix <em>now<\/em><\/h3>\n<p>When people are desperate for help, they\u2019re willing to spend more on services or products to get that problem solved. That means the companies doing the advertising can charge more for those services, and they can often achieve strong ROI on their ad spend even with high costs per click.<\/p>\n<p>These spaces are also highly competitive, because people don\u2019t necessarily spend a long time deciding where they\u2019re going to shop \u2013 they want help NOW! For example, one of the top keywords in the \u201cmedical services\u201d category is \u201cemergency room near me.\u201d If the advertiser is in <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/23\/google-marketing-next\">the right place at the right time<\/a>, they can profit big. (Not that I think private companies should be profiting off people who need emergency care\u2026)<\/p>\n<p>Examples of keywords related to urgent problems include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cBail bonds\u201d at #2<\/li>\n<li>\u201cLawyer\u201d at #4<\/li>\n<li>\u201cCash services &amp; payday loans\u201d at #7<\/li>\n<li>\u201cRehab\u201d at #11<\/li>\n<li>\u201cPlumber\u201d at #18<\/li>\n<li>\u201cTermites\u201d at #19<\/li>\n<li>\u201cPest control\u201d at #20<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/termites-most-expensive-keywords.jpg\" alt=\"adwords expensive costs per click\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>High-priced items or services<\/h3>\n<p>Last time around, insurance-related keywords were at the very top of the list. According to our data, insurance is no longer king of the hill. That\u2019s good news for marketers trying to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/20\/insurance-marketing-tactics\">drive leads in the insurance industry<\/a>, right? (Sort of \u2013 they\u2019re still almost $50 per click on average. And there are outliers, like \u201cmalpractice insurance,\u201d that can cost over $300 per click!)<\/p>\n<p>Now, the most expensive keywords are in the category \u201cbusiness services\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/popular-keywords\/business-keywords\">business keywords<\/a> includes stuff like \u201cdata room\u201d and \u201cnetwork security monitoring\u201d \u2013 most likely because these services tend to be costly. Companies offering business services are willing to bid more per keyword because there\u2019s so much to gain when a prospect does convert, whether it\u2019s a single big purchase or a service with a high customer lifetime value.<\/p>\n<p>Our last infographic showed that finance-related keywords (like loans keywords and mortgage keywords) are some of the most costly. You can see similar trends this year \u2013 see \u201casset management\u201d at #5 ($49.86 per click) and \u201cbanking\u201d at #23.<\/p>\n<p>Law keywords are still way up there, and on average keywords related to legal services are even more expensive ($54.86 per click compared to $42.51 in 2011). This is part of why <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/06\/29\/law-firm-marketing\">marketing for law firms can be a challenge<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re in one of these expensive niches, consider expanding onto the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/18\/google-display-network-tips\">display network<\/a>.
