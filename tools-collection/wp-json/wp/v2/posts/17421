But photo quality isn\u2019t enough if you want to join the best of the best \u2013 you also need a killer caption. Great\u00a0Instagram captions push your post over the top. They make your audience laugh, cry, and above all, identify with your photo. But more importantly, they\u00a0help your account get found, so you can get more followers.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-captions-stop-trying-to-make-fetch-happen.jpeg\" alt=\"funny caption about two dogs being fetch\" width=\"700\" height=\"700\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Still, crafting a funny Instagram caption isn\u2019t as easy as it looks. Not only is it easy to second guess yourself, but if you second guess yourself over and over again, it\u2019s easy to lose confidence. And a lack of confidence can be enough to discourage posting altogether.<\/p>\n<p>Our solution? Look at the funniest users on the platform, and study how they craft their captions. We pulled the 33 best\u00a0captions from a handful of well-known Instagram users, and grouped them into four categories. Once internalized, you\u2019ll be able to easily adapt these categories to your own content\u2014and post witty and engaging blurbs at a moment\u2019s notice!<\/p>\n<p>Ready for 33 epic Instagram captions that will break your like-ometer? Let\u2019s dive in!\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/23\/memorial-day-instagram-captions\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Self-deprecating Instagram\u00a0captions<\/h2>\n<p>One of the best ways to come up with a funny\u00a0caption is to practice self-deprecation. People use self-deprecation to get away with posting pictures of themselves\u2014i.e., it can\u2019t be self-aggrandizing if you\u2019re poking fun at yourself. As a method, it\u2019s super easy\u2014simply pick out a detail about yourself, small or large, and poke fun at it. The key is to not take yourself too seriously. Let\u2019s start by looking at the king of not-taking-himself-too-seriously, Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson.<\/p>\n<h3>1. The Rock gets head-y<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-captions-the-rock-gym-caption-example.png\" alt=\"the rock self-deprecating instagram caption example\" width=\"808\" height=\"596\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-justify\"><em><strong>Caption: <\/strong>&#8220;<\/em>We&#8217;re all fatigued and tired. Long week.. I get it. But no matter how many days and nights you do it&#8230;you&#8217;re only as good as the last one you do. Grateful to grind. Let&#8217;s get to work. And my left knee looks like I&#8217;m smuggling a human head. #SaturdayNightFunk #WestCoastIronParadise&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Some people are self-conscious about their knees. Some people might hesitate before posting a gym picture of themselves wearing skin-tight leggings. If we asked The Rock, maybe he\u2019d count himself a member of both those groups. We\u2019ll never know\u2014because by posting anyway, and making fun of himself before anyone else has a chance, he redirects our attention to the intended message of the post: The Rock is an inspirational badass.<\/p>\n<h3>2. The Rock stays silly<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-captions-the-rock-caption-example-gym.png\" alt=\"the rock self-deprecating instagram caption example\" width=\"800\" height=\"511\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Caption:\u00a0<\/strong>&#8220;My warm up face is always different from my game face. Both are sexy &amp; effective. T-minus 15min &#8217;til game time. #ProjectRock #UnderArmour #ChaseGreatness&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Staying for a moment with the king of action thrillers and 4am workouts\u2014\u201cSexy and effective\u201d is probably not the first thing that comes to mind when you see the face The Rock is making here. You know what is sexy? Humor. Comfort in one\u2019s own skin. Those are what make this Instagram caption a winner.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Johnny Football is a polarizing dude. And he knows it.<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-captions-johnny-football-caption-example.png\" alt=\"johnny football self-deprecating instagram caption example\" width=\"925\" height=\"448\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Caption:\u00a0<\/strong>&#8220;What I look like after scrolling thru my comments for 5 minutes..&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Football fans across the country know Johnny Manziel. Many of us feel personally slighted that he\u2019s spoiled his God-given gifts and eschewed NFL stardom for a life of partying. What\u2019s disarming about this caption? It shows that Johnny Manziel also knows Johnny Manziel. The guy can\u2019t even post a #ComebackSZN photo in earnest these days for fear of getting cyber-eviscerated. So here he is, attempting to steer into the skid. We just hope he posted this from a gym, after working on his throwing motion.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Ryan Reynolds: humor suits him<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-captions-ryan-reynold-caption-example.png\" alt=\"ryan reynolds self-deprecating instagram caption example\" width=\"720\" height=\"444\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Caption:\u00a0<\/strong>&#8220;Bringing heavyweight drama to premier for the #LIFE movie&#8230; #SXSW. These guys are obviously wearing white tube socks under their suits.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Ryan Reynolds is a handsome man. I know it. You know it. The guy who pumps your gas knows it. He\u2019s <em>so<\/em> handsome, in fact, that it\u2019s almost rude, him throwing his handsomeness all up in our social feeds. How does Ryan Reynolds get away with posting his well-manicured mug on Instagram without drawing the ire of his followers? By reminding us that deep down, he\u2019s just another normal dude with deep-seated sock insecurities. As you were, Ryan.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Paul Bissonnette: bad at hockey, good at social media<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/paul-bissonnette-instagram-caption-example.png\" alt=\"paul bissonnette self-deprecating instagram caption example\" width=\"720\" height=\"345\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Caption:\u00a0<\/strong>&#8220;Congrats to @zkass09 on his new deal. Can always respect a guy who&#8217;s been through a lot. We never ended up fighting in my NHL career because he&#8217;d always tell me I sucked and the coach told him to not waste his time when I&#8217;d ask him. Although I hate to agree with him and his coach, he probably would have beat me up anyway. So congrats again and thanks for not beating me up. #WasThisPostAboutHimOrMe&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not a hockey gal or guy, here\u2019s an analogy to describe Paul Bissonnette: Paul Bissonnette is to professional hockey as <em>Cobra <\/em>is to 80s cult action flicks\u2014so bad, he\/it will never fall out of favor. Bissonnette revels in his role as a washed-up, skill-less scrapper, and has accrued hundreds of thousands of social media followers as a result. Here, he endears himself to his audience by belittling the one skill that allowed him to play professionally in the first place\u2014his ability to fight. The hashtag also shows great self-awareness. Yes, the post is about him. But he\u2019s self-deprecating, so it\u2019s cool.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Karlie Kloss: uber funny with the\u00a0captions<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-captions-karlie-kloss-uber-caption-example_0.png\" alt=\"karlie kloss self-deprecating instagram caption example\" width=\"720\" height=\"532\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Caption:\u00a0<\/strong>&#8220;Trying to find my uber like&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Ok. So Karlie Kloss doesn\u2019t go <em>too<\/em> hard on herself here. But who among us hasn\u2019t been a little rideshare-challenged? She gets high marks for this one.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Lena Dunham: postal worker<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-captions-lena-dunham-caption-example.png\" alt=\"lena dunham self-deprecating instagram caption example\" width=\"930\" height=\"596\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Caption:\u00a0<\/strong>&#8220;Facially Grace looks like a young Jared Leto &amp; I look like an\u00a0elderly postal worker who makes brooches for her close friends #sisters&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We can\u2019t say for sure what an elderly postal worker looks like, but we can imagine it\u2019s not good. Selfie quote strong. Selfie justified.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Coco haggles his way into some likes<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-captions-conan-obrien-caption-example.png\" alt=\"conan obrien self-deprecating instagram caption example\" width=\"720\" height=\"533\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Captions:\u00a0<\/strong>&#8220;Visited an Arab market and became an expert at haggling. If &#8216;haggling&#8217; means &#8216;paying full retail and then crying.&#8217; #ConanIsrael #Jerusalem?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As a late night host, Conan O\u2019Brien has a talent for (playfully) making light of his guests achievements. We love him because he rarely lets himself off the hook, either. Here, a strange man tails him as he haggles his way into some solid social engagement.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Kat Dennings puts cups on her eyes<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-captions-kat-dennings-caption-example.png\" alt=\"kat dennings self-deprecating instagram caption example\" width=\"720\" height=\"460\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Caption:\u00a0<\/strong>&#8220;I get a lot done at the gym&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>You might know Kat Dennings as one half of 2 Broke Girls. You might not know her as girl who throws cups on her eyes to prolong hitting the treadmill. And truly: we\u2019ve all spent an extra minute or two in the locker room to avoid hitting the weights. The best self-deprecating\u00a0captions are the ones we can all identify with.<\/p>\n<h2>\u201cImagine what they would say\u201d Instagram captions<\/h2>\n<p>On to our next category. If you\u2019re an avid user of the platform, you probably see several of these\u00a0per day. \u201cImagine what they would say\u201d is a technique by which\u2014you guessed it\u2014you imagine what a subject of your post would say if they had the ability to. This technique works best with babies and animals, but can also be applied quite effectively to grown human males and females. Let\u2019s check out some of the best Instagram has to offer.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Pup, inhibited by cone, gets caught in doggie door<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-captions-pup-stuck-doggy-door.jpeg\" alt=\"barstooolsports &quot;what they would say&quot; instagram caption examples\" width=\"720\" height=\"459\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Caption:\u00a0<\/strong>&#8220;Sharon, please just put down the phone and help me.&#8221; @icanteven<\/p>\n<p>Why are animals effective subjects for \u201cimagine what they would say\u201d\u00a0captions? Because animals are hilarious. Exhibit A: this beagle getting his head stuck in his doggie door. Without the caption, all we have is a beagle getting his head stuck in a doggie door\u2014funny, but also kind of sad. With the caption, with have a beagle that\u2019s probably a little embarrassed about getting his head stuck, and is demanding assistance. Definitely funnier, definitely less sad.<\/p>\n<h3>11. Golden has a nose for the ball<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-captions-dog-watching-celtics-caption.png\" alt=\"barstooolsports &quot;what they would say&quot; instagram caption example\" width=\"720\" height=\"461\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Caption:\u00a0<\/strong>&#8220;Put me in coach, I got a nose for the ball&#8221; @icanteven<\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-justify\">Continuing the theme of pups struggling to navigate human technology: here we have a very good boy showing very lackluster ball skills. That doesn\u2019t temper his enthusiasm, though\u2014and the caption reflects that.<\/p>\n<h3>12. Baby as physical specimen<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-captions-conor-mcgregor-caption-example.jpeg\" alt=\"conor mcgregor &quot;what they would say&quot; instagram caption example\" width=\"720\" height=\"463\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Caption:\u00a0<\/strong>&#8220;I love this footage with all my soul. Walking into the @ufcpi in Las Vegas with my son Conor Jr. in hand. Look at his neck and back muscles and his total body control. I&#8217;ve watched this too many times. He is a specimen. We are styling too&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Conor McGregor is notorious for his bravado. It\u2019s helped him earn deals, win fans, and probably, win fights. Is ascribing your very young son that same machismo a humorous social media tactic? For this writer, yes, very much so.<\/p>\n<h3>13. Armen Paul gets pensive<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-captions-armen-paul-pensive-caption-example.png\" alt=\"armen paul self-deprecating instagram caption example\" width=\"720\" height=\"516\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Caption:\u00a0<\/strong>&#8220;Do you think bears remember going into hibernation when they wake up or do they just wake up scared and confused like the morning after I go to a Lady Gaga concert&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Part-time comedian, full-time rising musician Armen Paul is always good for an online chuckle or two. This rarely-seen-but-effective tactic sees him substitute commentary for stream-of-consciousness monologue. Can\u2019t think of anything funny to say about a solo shot of yourself? Simply select any one of the outrageous thoughts that occur to you throughout the day.<\/p>\n<h3>14. Doggo does a thing<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-captions-doggo-caption-example.png\" alt=\"doggosdoingthings &quot;what they would say&quot; instagram caption example\" width=\"720\" height=\"459\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Caption:\u00a0<\/strong>&#8220;Doggorino meets the beak boy (pls teach me ur ways)&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a new dialect emerging on the internet.

And don\u2019t feel bad about using your pet for social validation. We all do it.<\/p>\n<h3>15. Doggo says \u201cthamk you\u201d<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/intagram-captions-dog-thamkyou.png\" alt=\"doggosdoingthings instagram caption example\" width=\"720\" height=\"463\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Click to watch.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Given that Doggo is not the easiest dialect to master, we figured we\u2019d give you another chance to see it in action. We saw this video spread to multiple accounts and news feeds, and get mounds of engagement along the way. If you can somehow situate your pet in a majestic wildlife predicament, and set the scene with a psychedelic keyboard number, get ready to see even more likes roll in.<\/p>\n<h3>16. Evil cat<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-captions-evil-cat-caption-example.png\" alt=\"evil cat instagram caption example\" width=\"720\" height=\"459\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Caption:\u00a0<\/strong>&#8220;I told her that she&#8217;s the only thing I cared about evacuating with. &#8216;My drink won&#8217;t refresh itself, peasant&#8217; she replied&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to play on the over-zealous and occasionally dim-witted demeanor of dogs for the sake of a good Instagram caption; but it might be even easier to play on the demeanor of cats. Evil cat\u2014conniving cat, jerk cat, what have you\u2014is always good for a laugh when you\u2019re posting a picture of your fuzzy calculating one. Just look at that face. That is an animal that will maul you in your sleep, then all but ruin the chiffarobe.<\/p>\n<h3>17. #DogSelfie<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-captions-dogg24-caption-example.png\" alt=\"dog selfie instagram caption example\" width=\"720\" height=\"526\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Caption:\u00a0<\/strong>&#8220;I leave my phone alone for 2 seconds&#8230; #DogSelfie #BeautyFilter&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This is less an \u201cimagine what they would say\u201d than a \u201cimagine what they would <em>do<\/em>,\u201d but the premise remains the same. You probably know Allison Williams from <em>Get Out <\/em>and <em>Girls. <\/em>You probably <em>didn\u2019t<\/em> know that her pup rarely misses an opportunity to hack her phone with a #DogSelfie. If you have a dog or a cat, the faux-selfie selfie quote \/ selfie caption is a guaranteed crowd favorite.<\/p>\n<h2>Wordplay Instagram captions<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve come to the category that\u2019s my personal favorite\u2014wordplay. Not only is wordplay funny, and not only is it obvious, but often, the more obvious it is, the funnier it is. So if you\u2019re apprehensive about sounding lame\u2014don\u2019t worry. In the world of wordplay, it\u2019s better to be lame than not.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s check out some examples of great wordplay captions.<\/p>\n<h3>18. Minne-snow-ta<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-captions-patriots-caption-example.png\" alt=\"patriots instagram caption example\" width=\"621\" height=\"785\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The New England Patriots were hard luck losers in the Super Bowl, but I think we can all agree they go home winners with this Instagram caption. \u201cMinne-snow-ta\u201d sounds like the punchline of the joke your Dad told at Thanksgiving.

That\u2019s right. Wordplay has the power to change one\u2019s own name into a social media movement. (Doesn\u2019t hurt being Shaquille O\u2019Neal either.)<\/p>\n<h3>22.

Chris Pratt gets wedged<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-captions-chris-pratt-caption-example.png\" alt=\"chris pratt &quot;call out a friend&quot; instagram caption example\" width=\"720\" height=\"400\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Caption:\u00a0<\/strong>&#8220;One more still from the @vanityfair photo shoot. I have to credit the brilliant photographer @markseliger who discovered me wedged between these two rocks. It took him all day to pull me out. I had been stuck there for hours. I had barely enough strength to stare pensively into the distance. I mean, it was bad. Anyways. I almost had to chew off the lower half of my body to get out. But I&#8217;m not flexible enough. Bottom line. I could have died. But thanks to the brilliant photographer @markseliger I&#8217;m alive to tell the story, which is currently being optioned for a movie.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This caption is pretty indicative of Chris Pratt\u2019s brand of humor\u2014ridiculous to the point of defying a category. We figured we\u2019d throw this one in \u201ccall out a friend\u201d because, hey, the description bears a striking resemblance to James Franco\u2019s <em>24 Hours. <\/em>But truly, what makes this caption effective is that it turns the subject from a guy who earnestly looks off into the distance into a guy who earnestly looks off into the distance but has a sense of humor about it. If you\u2019re ever looking for caption inspiration, Pratt\u2019s Instagram is a good place to start.<\/p>\n<h3>26. Sarah Silverman says a not nice thing<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-captions-sarah-silverman-caption-example.png\" alt=\"sarah silverman &quot;call out a friend&quot; instagram caption example\" width=\"720\" height=\"472\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Caption:\u00a0<\/strong>&#8220;Yo thanks to @antheaking @briandmagallones and the insufferable @micahmarcus for making me purty&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As far as pointed jokes go, Sarah Silverman has certainly done better. Still, if you\u2019re looking for a formula for how to call out a friend in an Instagram caption, you can do worse than this. Mention friend in post. Say not nice thing about said friend. Friend experiences embarrassment. Post experiences engagement.<\/p>\n<h3>27. You are\u2026not the father<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-captions-chrissy-teigan-caption-example.png\" alt=\"chrissy teigan &quot;call out a friend&quot; instagram caption example\" width=\"720\" height=\"459\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Caption:\u00a0<\/strong>&#8220;Stealing John&#8217;s photo haha she&#8217;s not even his anyway&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Who\u2019s safe from Chrissy Teigen\u2019s diabolical captions? No one. Not even her husband, John Legend. The \u201che\u2019s not the father\u201d is a favorite among celebrities\u2014you might have seen Blake Lively\u2019s dig at Ryan Reynolds\u2014and why not? Those guys get some pretty big egos. A little cage-rattle every now and again is totally healthy.<\/p>\n<h3>28. The \u201cageless\u201d Hugh Jackman<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-captions-hugh-jackman-caption-example.png\" alt=\"hugh jackman &quot;call out a friend&quot; instagram caption example\" width=\"720\" height=\"388\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Caption:\u00a0<\/strong>&#8220;Happy Birthday to the ageless, one and only @thehughjackman&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of Ryan Reynolds\u2014the guy just keeps bringing the Instagram caption heat. To wish Hugh Jackman a happy birthday, he paid homage to time Jackman weighed 130 pounds, lived in a one-bedroom apartment in the projects, and smoked $2 cigars. We\u2019re sure Hugh appreciated the sincerity.<\/p>\n<h3>29.\u00a0 Patton Oswalt and his runaway<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-captions-pattono-instagram-caption-example.png\" alt=\"patton oswalt &quot;call out a friend&quot; instagram caption example\" width=\"720\" height=\"459\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Caption:\u00a0<\/strong>&#8220;About to have dinner at Alimento with this 14 year-old runaway I picked up at the reservoir.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Pictured in this post is Patton Oswalt\u2019s wife, Meredith Salenger. A talented actress in her own right, Meredith is decidedly not 14. Still, for her age (47), she has a youthful complexion. This caption is a good example of the fact that you don\u2019t have to be totally facetious in your call out. You can be complimentary as well (even if that compliment is shrouded in sarcasm).<\/p>\n<h3>30. Chelsea Handler calls out unwillingly photobombing man<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-captions-chelsea-handler-caption-example.png\" alt=\"chelsea handler photobomb instagram caption example\" width=\"720\" height=\"464\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Caption:\u00a0<\/strong>&#8220;Skiing with my girlies. #whistler with a man in the back pretending there&#8217;s a game on.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There is an Instagram account out there devoted to men who have been forced to go shopping with their wives and girlfriends. We think there should be another devoted to men forced to take or be in pictures. Either there <em>was<\/em> a riveting game on, and this guy was too intrigued to notice Chelsea Handler\u2019s picture, or he simply didn\u2019t have the energy for a proper photobomb, and decided to feign interest in a faux-game to avoid having to get up. Whatever the case, he adds a funny element to the post, and good on Chelsea for having the wherewithal to call him out.<\/p>\n<h3>31. Ryan Reynolds wishes his mom a happy Mother\u2019s Day<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-captions-ryan-reynolds-mothers-day-caption-example.png\" alt=\"ryan reynolds mothers day instagram caption example\" width=\"720\" height=\"462\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Caption:\u00a0<\/strong>&#8220;Happy Mother&#8217;s Day, Mom. You gave birth to me an excruciating 468 weeks late. I was 9. We were both so happy to be free.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>You can\u2019t keep this guy off this list! Reynolds comes back here with a dynamite Mother\u2019s Day Instagram caption. Like Chris Pratt\u2019s earlier post, the humor here sort of defies a genre. Is it absurdist? Mother-ist? Difficult to say. What we can say for sure: it\u2019s eminently like-able.<\/p>\n<h3>32. Swardson &amp; Spade: big budget film guys<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-captions-nick-swardson-caption-example.png\" alt=\"nick swardson funny instagram caption example\" width=\"720\" height=\"462\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Caption:\u00a0<\/strong>&#8220;Happy birthday to my right hand man @davidspade this is us in a scene from Braveheart.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s definitely a tragic sort of bravery in <em>Benchwarmers, <\/em>but we can safely say it\u2019s of a different breed than that shown in <em>Braveheart. <\/em>We love this Instagram caption from Nick Swardson because it\u2019s self-aware. Also, because he calls out himself <em>as well as <\/em>a friend. He\u2019s not a big budget dramatic actor. Nor is David Spade. Thus, Swardson gives us the best of both worlds\u2014the friend call-out, as well as self-deprecation.<\/p>\n<h3>33. Spaghetti Western Ted Cruz<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-captions-clint-eastwood-caption-example.png\" alt=\"clint eastwood funny instagram caption example\" width=\"720\" height=\"484\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Caption:\u00a0<\/strong>&#8220;Still Love Ted Cruz&#8217;s work in FISTFUL OF DOLLARS.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Patton Oswalt takes a break from his wife in this post to focus on his other love interest: bashing the GOP. This is a variation on the \u201ccall out\u201d method we\u2019ll call, \u201ccall out your enemy.\u201d No, that is not in fact Ted Cruz at the end of this clip. But it\u2019s really, really funny to imagine that it is.<\/p>\n<h2>Use these\u00a0\u00a0examples and tips to become an Instagram caption pro<\/h2>\n<p>In this post, we\u2019ve outlined four different ways to approach Instagram captions on your next Instagram post. Internalize these categories, adapt them to fit your own life, and you\u2019ll be well on your way to becoming an Instagram caption pro. Most important of all, don\u2019t think too much about it.
