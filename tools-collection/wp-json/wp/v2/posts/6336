You\u2019ll get a different answer depending on who you ask. Proponents believe Quality Score is a good measure of the health of your account \u2013 high scores tend to correlate with lower costs and better results across the board. Detractors will say QS is a distraction and all that really matters is your cost per conversion, because that\u2019s how you determine your ROI.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/haters-gonna-hate-quality-score-1.jpg\" alt=\"Quality Score &amp; CPC\" width=\"576\" height=\"382\" \/><\/div>\n<p>So who\u2019s right? What should you focus on in your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/05\/29\/adwords-reporting\">PPC reporting<\/a>?<\/p>\n<h2>What Is Quality Score?<\/h2>\n<p>As a quick refresher, Quality Score is a metric Google uses to determine where advertisers rank on the SERP and how much they pay. Although <a href=\"\/articles\/what-is-google-adwords\">Google Ads functions as a kind of auction<\/a>, if the system was purely determined by bids, spammy companies with lousy, irrelevant ads could always bid their way to the top. Quality Score serves as a check against rule by budget alone, by requiring advertisers to prove their relevance.<\/p>\n<p>Better, more relevant ads generally get higher click-through rates (CTR), so CTR is one of the major components of Quality Score. Other factors that influence your QS include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The relevance of your keyword to its ad group.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/07\/11\/landing-page-conversion-rate-guide\">Landing page quality<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>The relevance of your <a href=\"\/ad-text\">ad text<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Your historical account performance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Every time one of your ads qualifies to be displayed on a SERP, based on what keywords you\u2019re bidding on and what <a href=\"http:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/adwordsmatchtypeguide.html\">match types<\/a> you\u2019re using, Google calculates a score between 1 and 10 for your ad on the fly. The higher your score, the better your ad rank will be \u2013 in fact a high Quality Score can qualify you to rank above people who are bidding more than you.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/quality-score-ad-rank-relationship-1.png\" alt=\"Quality Score &amp; Ad Rank\" width=\"875\" height=\"374\" \/><\/div>\n<p>But Quality Score doesn\u2019t just affect your ad position \u2013 it also has an enormous effect on how much you pay when someone clicks your ad.<\/p>\n<h2>How Quality Score Affects Cost Per Click<\/h2>\n<p>Your cost per click (CPC) is determined by the following formula: the ad rank of the advertiser below you, divided by your Quality Score, plus 1 cent. The chart below illustrates how this formula makes it possible to rank higher than advertisers who are actually paying more.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-quality-score-affects-cpc-1.png\" alt=\"quality score in adwords impact on cost per click\" width=\"771\" height=\"494\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This is all well-known. What\u2019s not so well-known is that Quality Score is even more valuable today than it used to be. I\u2019ll explain how in the next section.<\/p>\n<h2>The Changing Relationship Between CPC &amp; Quality Score<\/h2>\n<p>In 2009, Craig Danuloff at Click Equations published some charts that showed how much <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/21\/how-to-save-money-google-ads\">money you save in Google Ads<\/a> by raising your Quality Score. They looked like this:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/quality-score-google-1.png\" alt=\"Quality Score &amp; CPC\" width=\"783\" height=\"404\" \/><\/div>\n<p>At the high end, a QS of 10 provided a 30% discount on CPC compared to someone whose Quality Score was 7. At the low end, having a Quality Score of 1 forced you to pay 600% more. (Suckers.)<\/p>\n<p>Back in March, I decided to revisit these numbers. Craig originally used 7 as the neutral value because it was the mean Quality Score across most accounts at the time. The thing is, average Quality Scores have fallen over time. In 2013, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/03\/26\/google-quality-score\">impression-weighted average Quality Score in 2013 is closer to 5<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re thinking, \u201cSo what?,\u201d let me make it clear: <strong>That drop in the average Quality Score means that having a QS of 10 now saves you 50% over the average advertiser \u2013 66% more than it saved you four years ago.<\/strong> Even a meh QS of 6 saves you about 17% \u2013 in 2009, a 6 would have cost you. Here\u2019s what the savings look like given the new landscape:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-quality-score-2-1.png\" alt=\"The Impact of Quality Score on CPC in 2013\" width=\"752\" height=\"384\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Of course, some people will still tell you that Quality Score is overrated, because CPC savings are meaningless compared to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/11\/07\/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead-google-ads\">cost per conversion<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Optimizing for Quality Score and Optimizing for CPA Are the Same Thing<\/h2>\n<p>What those Quality Score detractors don\u2019t seem to realize is that <strong>QS is every bit as important in determining your cost per conversion<\/strong>, as well. Here\u2019s how I know:<\/p>\n<p>To quantify the relationship between cost per conversion and Quality Score, I manually compiled <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/29\/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks\">CPA data<\/a> from thousands of campaigns across several hundred WordStream client accounts, representing about $100 million in annualized spend.<\/p>\n<p>I then plotted the average cost-per-conversion versus the impression-weighted Quality Score for each campaign. Here\u2019s what it looked like:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/cost-per-conversion-vs-quality-score-graph-1.png\" alt=\"Quality Score &amp; Cost Per Conversion\" width=\"604\" height=\"412\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The data reveals that there <em>is<\/em> a very strong relationship between average cost per conversion and average Quality Score. Just as above, the higher your Quality Score is, the lower your CPA will be on average. <strong>So optimizing for Quality Score and optimizing for CPA are essentially the same thing.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The below table show how much you\u2019ll save on CPA (not CPC) if your Quality Score is higher than 5:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/impact-of-quality-score-on-cpa-1.png\" alt=\"Quality Score CPA\" width=\"278\" height=\"280\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Note that if your QS is below the average, you\u2019ll essentially pay a penalty \u2013 up to 64% more per action than your average competitor. In a nutshell, for every Quality Score point above the average 5\/10 score, your CPA will drop by 16% on average. Conversely, for every Quality Score point below the average of 5\/10, your CPA will rise by 16%.<\/p>\n<p>Michael Wiegand at Portent found similar results a few months back \u2013 that for each point that your QS goes up, there was an average CPA reduction of 22%. The main difference between his study and mine is that my data size is about 100x bigger.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s worth pointing out that I didn\u2019t see a big difference in average conversion rates vs. Quality Scores. I found that keywords with high Quality Scores converted only slightly better than low Quality Score keywords, meaning that <strong>lower CPAs are primarily driven by lower costs per click<\/strong> \u2014 which are a direct result of your Quality Score.<\/p>\n<p>(<strong>Note<\/strong>: <a href=\"http:\/\/searchengineland.com\/all-hail-quality-score-king-of-the-adwords-kpis-166542\">I wrote about my findings over at Search Engine Land last week<\/a> \u2013 there\u2019s some interesting discussion in the comments over there, so check it out if you want to dig into the data in more detail.)<\/p>\n<h2>4 Ways to Improve Your Quality Score<\/h2>\n<p>At the risk of repeating myself, I think these numbers show that optimizing for Quality Score and optimizing for cost are essentially the same thing. High Quality Scores give you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/17\/lower-cost-per-click\">lower costs per click<\/a>, and lower CPCs almost always translate into lower costs per conversion.<\/p>\n<p>So how do you get your Quality Scores up above the average? Here are four quick tips:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use ad extensions.<\/strong> <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/06\/03\/adwords-ad-extensions-cheat-sheet\">Google\u00a0ad extensions<\/a> and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/06\/18\/google-sitelinks\">Google sitelinks<\/a> make your ads bigger with more places to click, so they increase CTR (at no extra cost).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Write better ad text<\/strong>. We co-wrote a guide with PPC Hero that has <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/09\/06\/10-tips-writing-better-ppc-text-ads\">ten tricks for increasing CTR<\/a>, including no-brainer stuff like using symbols and exclamation points.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bid on <\/strong><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/03\/19\/why-bid-on-branded-terms-ppc\"><strong>brand terms<\/strong><\/a><strong>.<\/strong> Branded keywords tend to have really high click-through and conversion rates and they can bring up your whole account average.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Be more methodical about account organization<\/strong>. Don\u2019t just add new keywords to the same ad group until it\u2019s 200 large. Make sure each ad group is organized around a clear theme. If an ad group has 50+ keywords, try to break it down into smaller, tighter groups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So what do you think about these results? Let me know in the comments. Got problems with my data?
