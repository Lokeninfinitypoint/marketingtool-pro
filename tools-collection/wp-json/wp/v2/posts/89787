What are the benefits?<\/h2>\n<p>Creating topic clusters for local SEO has a few core benefits.<\/p>\n<h3>Increases your chances for ranking in search results<\/h3>\n<p>When you build a topic cluster around a core topic and page you increase the likelihood that the core page will rank. For instance, if you created a series of pages about Orlando roofing costs, Orlando roofing materials, related services, and surrounding towns and had all of those pages link back to your Orlando roofing page, that page will perform better for terms like \u201cOrlando roofing\u201d because you\u2019re indicating to Google that your site is a comprehensive resource on the subject, and those pages can all convey to Google that the Orlando roofing page is about that topic (more on this later).<\/p>\n<h3>Attracts more potential local customers<\/h3>\n<p>Additionally, you can attract more potential customers by creating specific content related to a core topic that you wouldn\u2019t have otherwise. Often those searchers are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/30\/commercial-intent-keywords\">higher intent<\/a> as well because their search terms are more specific, and the terms are within a cluster of terms that are relevant to your business.<\/p>\n<h3>Improves the user experience<\/h3>\n<p>Finally, creating content clusters and interlinking them strategically improves the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/29\/ux-conversion-rates\">user experience for your site\u2019s visitors<\/a> as you are able to answer more of their related questions (by covering the topic more thoroughly) and giving them the option to dive deeper on a core topic by offering links to related content.<\/p>\n<p>When implemented correctly, all of this leads to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more traffic<\/a>, leads, and revenue from local SEO.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 <strong>Search ads can also help you attract more local searchers.<\/strong> Want to learn more about search engine marketing on Google?

Let\u2019s walk through some examples of topic clusters in local SEO.<\/p>\n<h3>Service and area topic clusters<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re providing any type of local service\u2014from roofers to chiropractors\u2014you\u2019ll want to build out <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/multi-location-seo\/#:~:text=1.-,Create%20a%20web%20page%20for%20each%20location,-(with%20a%20unique\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">local service pages<\/a> targeting your service areas with town page + service. If you offer one service to a tight geography, this may be pretty straightforward with a structure like:<\/p>\n<p>Service Areas<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Windemere roofing<\/li>\n<li>Winter Garden roofing<\/li>\n<li>College Park roofing<\/li>\n<li>Lake Nona roofing<\/li>\n<li>Oviedo roofing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/topic-clusters-service-service-area-png.webp\" alt=\"topic cluster example for local roofing company service and service areas\" width=\"1026\" height=\"601\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-89791\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/topic-clusters-service-service-area-png.webp 1026w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/topic-clusters-service-service-area-980x574.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/topic-clusters-service-service-area-480x281.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1026px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you have a larger service area, you can cluster pages by geography, with batches of 10 or so towns.<\/p>\n<p>What if you have a situation like the image above where there are several services across multiple service areas?<\/p>\n<p>First, you need to determine how many pages you actually need. Unfortunately, to do this, you need to do some leg work and look at the actual search results in your area. Let\u2019s look at a few of the services offered in this region by the company above. First, roofing company:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/orlando-roofing-serp-png.webp\" alt=\"search results for orlando roofing company on google\" width=\"913\" height=\"1812\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-89792\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/orlando-roofing-serp-png.webp 913w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/orlando-roofing-serp-480x953.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 913px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And here is the SERP for Orlando leak detection:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/orlando-roof-leak-detection-serp-png.webp\" alt=\"search results for orlando leak detection on google\" width=\"787\" height=\"1976\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-89793\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/orlando-roof-leak-detection-serp-png.webp 787w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/orlando-roof-leak-detection-serp-480x1205.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 787px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>All of these results are service pages or entire sites specifically dedicated to leak detection, so if we want to rank, we\u2019ll need to create a new services page (and not just a sub-section on our roofing page).<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you look at \u201croof repair Orlando\u201d the results aren\u2019t exactly the same as \u201cOrlando roofing company,\u201d but there are a number of the same sites, and virtually every page is a general roofing page (not specific to repairs):<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/roof-repair-orlando-serp-png.webp\" alt=\"search results for orlando roof repair on google\" width=\"728\" height=\"1976\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-89794\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/roof-repair-orlando-serp-png.webp 728w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/roof-repair-orlando-serp-480x1303.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 728px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>So that term can likely be addressed on the roofing page.<\/p>\n<p>For sites that have a mix of multiple services and multiple service areas, the structure might look something like this:<\/p>\n<p>Service Areas<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Windemere roofing\n<ul>\n<li>Windemere roof leak detection<\/li>\n<li>Windemere commercial roofing<\/li>\n<li>Windemere tile roof repair<\/li>\n<li>Windemere solar panels<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Winter Garden roofing\n<ul>\n<li>Winter Garden roof leak detection<\/li>\n<li>Winter Garden commercial roofing<\/li>\n<li>Winter Garden tile roof repair<\/li>\n<li>Winter Garden solar panels<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>College Park roofing\n<ul>\n<li>College Park roof leak detection<\/li>\n<li>College Park commercial roofing<\/li>\n<li>College Park tile roof repair<\/li>\n<li>College Park solar panels<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Lake Nona roofing\n<ul>\n<li>Lake Nona roof leak detection<\/li>\n<li>Lake Nona

roofing<\/li>\n<li>Oviedo tile roof repair<\/li>\n<li>Oviedo solar panels<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So the Windemere roofing page would link down to its \u201cspoke\u201d pages, those pages would link back up and across to each other, and the Windemere page would have at least two links to and from the other location roofing \u201cspoke\u201d pages.<\/p>\n<h4>What to keep in mind when creating this type of topic cluster<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure that your most important services and most important service areas are covered (look at the SERPs to determine if you need a new page).<\/li>\n<li>Structure content in hub-and-spoke format with the main service pages linking to location-specific pages.<\/li>\n<li>Ensure each location page links back to the main service page and at least two other location pages.<\/li>\n<li>Group locations geographically when dealing with large service areas.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\ud83d\udd0e <strong>Need help finding the right keywords for your

pages\u2014particularly if you can invest in building simple cost calculators and in-depth data for specific areas\u2014can also get passive links from other sources as well.<\/p>\n<p>These can be linked to and from both within service + service area pages, and a broader \u201c{service} costs\u201d or \u201cstate {service} costs\u201d page that acts as a hub page and links down to the service area pages.<\/p>\n<h4>Tips for creating this type of topic cluster:<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Create area-specific <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/08\/landing-page-examples\">cost pages<\/a> for services with significant search volume.<\/li>\n<li>Develop interactive calculators to provide value and attract links.<\/li>\n<li>Link cost pages to relevant service area pages.<\/li>\n<li>Consider building a state-level cost hub page if you\u2019re building out a cluster of these pages.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Measurement and materials topic clusters<\/h3>\n<p>This is a cluster that depends on the service you\u2019re offering, but there are a lot of locally focused services where measurements and material estimates play a role. A potential customer may want to estimate things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The size of a roof, room, exterior of their house, etc. to help them understand the price of a service.<\/li>\n<li>The amount of materials (shingles, exterior lights, floor panels, etc.) they\u2019ll need for their specific job.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Providing tools and frameworks for customers to conduct these estimations can help build credibility and authority around a topic. Plus, if you build something like a free tool for your visitors, you can get links from other sites to help with your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/06\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google\">ranking<\/a> as well.<\/p>\n<h3>Frequency and maintenance topic clusters<\/h3>\n<p>If you have a recurring service, there are likely a lot of questions like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How often do I need to replace my windows?<\/li>\n<li>How often should a cleaner come?<\/li>\n<li>How often do you need to {perform specific maintenance activity}?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As with measurement terms, you want to get in front of these customers as they\u2019re researching whether they need something replaced or how often they need a recurring service:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/local-keyword-research-results-roofing-png.webp\" alt=\"wordstream free keyword tool results for roof replacement query\" width=\"1200\" height=\"606\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-89796\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/local-keyword-research-results-roofing-png.webp 1200w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/local-keyword-research-results-roofing-980x495.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/local-keyword-research-results-roofing-480x242.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>An underrated fact here is that these queries are often <strong>personalized based on location<\/strong>. You may think a search query like this will reach everyone across the country\u2014and if you rank well for the term it may\u2014but Google will also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/06\/personalized-marketing\">personalize these results<\/a> based on search history and location.

Again this is a great opportunity to get in front of your potential customers.<\/p>\n<p>The fundamental structure of these kinds of clusters would be the same&#8211;you don\u2019t need to build a separate page for each service area you have, just a cluster of related terms around replacement, maintenance, and frequency terms with the same hub and spoke approach.<\/p>\n<h4>Tips for creating these topic clusters<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus on location-specific maintenance schedules and requirements.<\/li>\n<li>Include tools for measuring materials and estimating project scope.<\/li>\n<li>Create content addressing \u201cfrequency of {service}\u201d questions.<\/li>\n<li>Link maintenance content to relevant service pages.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Informational and blog topic clusters<\/h3>\n<p>Not every local site needs a lot of informational content. If you\u2019re servicing an area that\u2019s low competition, and\/or you offer a service that\u2019s lower competition, you may want to focus on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/local-seo-in-2024\">local SEO best practices<\/a> like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/local-citations\">building local citations<\/a>, links, and service area pages rather than informational content.<\/p>\n<p>But the screenshot in the section above gives you an indication of how informational content helps you reach prospects. You can then <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/17\/retargeting-campaign-tips\">remarket<\/a> to those folks, have them see your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/03\/organic-traffic\">organic result<\/a>s or ads, and get more business down the line from these activities. More informational content also has a couple of additional advantages for local businesses:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/topical-authority\"><strong>Topical authority<\/strong><\/a>: Building out \u201chow to\u201d content (e.g., if you\u2019re a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/cleaning-services-advertising-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cleaning business<\/a>, a series of posts about how to clean various surfaces, rooms in the house, etc.) helps indicate to Google that your site is an authority on a topic. If you can localize this content, that\u2019s even better as it indicates to Google that you\u2019re an authority on both the topic and the area you service.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Passive links<\/strong>: If you start to rank for informational terms, you often get people doing research through Google who will then link to your resource. Those links are extremely valuable for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/12\/domain-authority\">improving the authority of your sit<\/a>e and having it rank better for queries in Google.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Again, these could be on a variety of topics, using the same hub and spoke model with the same linking recommendations outlined above. Some examples of informational content that could work for your locally focused site include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How to:<\/strong> How to perform specific maintenance tasks, DIY certain aspects of your service, etc. For a window replacement company, this may be tips for winterizing your windows or maintaining them (again particularly if those tips are specific to your service region).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Best tools\/products<\/strong>: For a salon, this may be hair care products, for someone offering golf lessons the best equipment for a variety of different golf-related tasks, etc.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pain points\/FAQs<\/strong>: Answering specific questions or <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/customer-pain-points\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pain points<\/a> your customers may have is another great way to build informational topical clusters. If you\u2019re a dentist, you can create a series of posts answering questions related to teeth whitening that people may be searching for.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Tips for creating these types of topic clusters<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Create how-to content specific to your service area.<\/li>\n<li>Develop best tools and product recommendations.<\/li>\n<li>Address common customer pain points and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/04\/24\/faq-page\">FAQs<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Focus on locally relevant topics that build authority.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Competitor comparison topic clusters<\/h3>\n<p>A lot of businesses don\u2019t want to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/competitive-insights\">talk about competitors<\/a>, but it\u2019s often the case that your prospects already know about your competitors, and being willing to mention them can be a way to get in front of more potential customers who are close to paying for your service.<\/p>\n<p>Just as with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/12\/paid-search-conquesting\">Google Ads \u201cconquesting\u201d campaigns<\/a> that target competitor names, you can potentially rank for some search terms related to your competitors by being willing to mention them and highlight where you\u2019re different.<\/p>\n<p>First, you can create a list of the businesses in your area. Again: this is a bit scary and something a lot of businesses want to stay away from, but it can be a great way to rank for terms that you couldn\u2019t otherwise. When a searcher looks for \u201croofing companies in Nashville\u201d they want a list, not just the site of a specific company.<\/p>\n<p>This organic result is mostly third-party sites like Yelp or the BBB, but the third organic result here is an individual roofing company that was willing to list competitors:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/roofing-companies-nashville-serp-png.webp\" alt=\"roofing companies in nashville search results on google\" width=\"890\" height=\"602\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-89799\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/roofing-companies-nashville-serp-png.webp 890w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/roofing-companies-nashville-serp-480x325.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 890px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>From there, you could go a step further and actually link to a page with your competitor\u2019s name, and do a comparison of what your strengths are versus the competitor. Obviously, you have to be careful not to say anything false or libelous about the competitor, but you can often rank well with these pages for search terms like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Competitor name + competitors<\/li>\n<li>Competitor name + alternatives<\/li>\n<li>Competitor name + reviews<\/li>\n<li>Competitor name + costs<\/li>\n<li>Competitor name + pricing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This is a fairly common practice in other industries but not well used with locally focused businesses.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of structure, you would use the &#8220;best of&#8221; list as the hub, and the competitor pages would each function as a spoke.<\/p>\n<h4>Tips for creating these topic clusters<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Create comprehensive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/03\/01\/business-directory-listings\">local business listings<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Develop alternative\/comparison pages for major competitors.<\/li>\n<li>Address competitor-specific searches like reviews and pricing.<\/li>\n<li>Maintain professional, factual comparisons.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f <strong>Want to know what your competitors are up to?<\/strong> Get the guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/how-to-spy-on-competitors?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_SpyOnCompetitors_Download\">How to Spy on Your Competitors: 7 Ways to Become a Competitive Supersleuth<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"key-takeaways-for-creating-topic-clusters\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to think about topic clusters for local SEO<\/h2>\n<p>Ultimately the most important \u201ctopic cluster\u201d for local SEO is making sure that you have coverage around service pages to target your core services and service areas.<\/p>\n<p>If you have additional resources and\/or are in a competitive market, a lot of these additional content types and topic clusters can both help you drive incremental traffic and leads and can help solidify your rankings on your core services and service areas.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the key takeaways to help you get better <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/seo-statistics\">SEO results<\/a> using topic clusters:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement a hub-and-spoke model with a clear <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/04\/internal-linking\">internal linking structure<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/competitive-analysis\">Assess competition levels<\/a> before investing in informational content.<\/li>\n<li>Ensure all content serves your target geography and audience.<\/li>\n<li>Focus on topics directly relevant to your services and local market.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Need help with any part of your SEO strategy? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/marketing-services?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Demo_Blog_Demo\">We can help<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Topic clusters can help local businesses build credibility and authority&#8211;along with a stronger online presence.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":228,"featured_media":89801,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[9],"tags":[],"dipi_cpt_category":[],"class_list":["post-89787","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-seo"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v25.8 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Topic Clusters for Local SEO: Types, Tips &amp; Examples | WordStream<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Topic clusters are related pages that are interlinked, typically for SEO benefit.
