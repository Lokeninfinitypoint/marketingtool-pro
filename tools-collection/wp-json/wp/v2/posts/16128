As you may imagine, our customer-facing teams at WordStream get a plethora of questions from marketers and business owners of varying paid marketing expertise. One question that comes up time and time again is, \u201cWhat is the deal with keywords marked \u2018low search volume\u2019 by Google?!\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a83e2ce8-faec-4e74-bf97-d3e37680203c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/low-search-volume-keywords.png\" alt=\"google-ads-low-search-volume\" width=\"359\" height=\"135\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>What is a \u201clow search volume\u201d keyword?<\/h2>\n<p>First off, we should address the obvious question. What is a \u201clow search volume\u201d keyword?<\/p>\n<p>You may notice when sifting through your keyword lists that certain keywords are marked as \u201cLimited Approval\u201d due to &#8220;Low search volume.&#8221; These terms are associated with very limited search traffic on Google \u2013 in other words, not very many people are searching on these terms. For this reason, Google temporarily makes these keywords inactive.<\/p>\n<p>To get confirmation as to how these keywords are truly defined, I spoke with some of WordStream\u2019s top paid search experts.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGenerally \u2018low search volume\u2019 keywords are just keywords that are not searched for as much as other keywords,\u201d says WordStream Customer Programs Manager Chris Pierce. \u201cIt could be a small niche.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This does not mean these keywords will disappear from your account though, so how should you deal with them? Stay tuned for this answer, but first, let\u2019s discuss how Google makes these determinations\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>How does Google determine if a keyword has low search volume?<\/h2>\n<p>According to Chris, \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/26\/low-volume-keywords\">Low search volume keywords<\/a> are associated with very little search traffic on Google, an indication that they&#8217;re not very relevant to most customers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There can be a variety of reasons that Google makes this determination, including\u2026<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your keywords are not relevant to the majority of your customers\u2019 searches<\/li>\n<li>Your keyword are too specific, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/07\/long-tail-keyword-myth\">long-tailed<\/a>, or obscure<\/li>\n<li>Your keywords are seasonal (and you\u2019re bidding during the wrong season)<\/li>\n<li>Your match types are too restrictive<\/li>\n<li>You\u2019re bidding on branded terms<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These are things to consider when looking at your \u201clow search volume\u201d keywords since they\u2019ll help with the next question. For instance, if your keyword is an exact match keyword, try making it phrase or broad and see if that changes the keyword status.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s still important to consider if these keywords are worth keeping in your account, which brings us to the next Q&amp;A.<\/p>\n<h2>Should I still bid on these low volume keywords?<\/h2>\n<p>While I\u2019d recommend making this decisions on a keyword to keyword basis, Chris believes that these keywords are often worth hanging onto. \u201cThey can still bring qualitative leads and conversions to the website,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>Chris has a point. According to Google, \u201cIf the number of search queries for these keywords increases even a small amount, they&#8217;ll be reactivated and will start triggering your ads to show again. Our system checks and updates this status regularly.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As stated above, sometimes making changes like opening up the match types can help. \u201cIf your low <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/23\/keyword-search-volume\">search volume<\/a> term is phrase or exact, you can try adjusting the match type to broad or modified broad to cast a wider net and pull in search volume,\u201d says Zina Kayyali, WordStream Director of Customer Programs. \u201cIf you are using modified broad on a super long-tail term, you can try removing some modifiers.\u00a0In reality, if your keyword string has 3+ words and each of them has a modifier, you may as well be using phrase match.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Will it hurt my account if I attempt to bid on these keywords?<\/h2>\n<p>Ok, so there is still hope that these keywords could get popular at a later date. But what about your account\u2019s Quality Score? No one wants to be on Google\u2019s bad side, so it\u2019s important to consider if these keywords will hurt the way Google views you.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"629941fa-0f7d-4510-9cb3-42c6f4a03760\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/low-search-volume-keywords-quality-score.png\" alt=\"google-quality-score-low-search-volume-keywords\" width=\"504\" height=\"126\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>According to Chris, these \u201clow search keywords\u201d should not have a negative impact on your AdWords account. \u201cLeaving \u2018low search volume\u2019 keywords in your account will not necessarily have a negative effect,\u201d says Chris. \u00a0\u201cThese keywords could be important depending on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/29\/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks\">your industry<\/a> and what you offer.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you\u2019ve had these terms in your account for quite some time, and you are seeing little to no interaction with them, it may be time to say goodbye. \u201cOften, low search volume terms in your account are just terms that are sadly not being queried. If no one is searching for these keywords, it may be time to toss those guys out,\u201d says Zina.<\/p>\n<p>You might be wondering what else can be done to get these poor keywords some traction. Well, luckily there is still hope\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>Should I pursue other opportunities with these unpopular keywords?<\/h2>\n<p>So, you have keywords marked \u201clow search volume\u201d by Google\u2019s search network that you had high hopes for. While this might feel disappointing, I\u2019ve got some good news for your poor unpopular keywords. There is much more you can do then just hope that your customers will start searching for these words!<\/p>\n<p>Zina recommends paring low volume keywords with campaigns outside of the search networks. For example, have you considered how these keywords will perform on other search engines?<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/13\/cross-network-advertising-brand-search-lift\">Cross-network searchers<\/a> can have a big impact for advertisers!\u00a0Starting with Bing as an example,\u201d says Zina. \u201cAdvertisers who advertise on Bing don\u2019t just reach new people searching on Bing, they will also see, on average,\u00a0a 26% increase in searches for their brand on Google!\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f652cea8-286e-454f-87b1-0bfb70ee6ba2\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/low-search-volume-keywords-cross-network-ads.png\" alt=\"cross-network-ads-low-search-volume-keywords\" width=\"762\" height=\"585\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>You also might consider taking your efforts outside of the search network. Zina encourages testing these keywords out in your ads on the Google Display Network. \u201cAlthough CTRs are lower than search, we see a <strong>31% increases in brand searches on Google <\/strong>which is amazing\u2014especially given the fact that Display clicks tend to be much cheaper and the Display network is far-reaching (the GDN reaches up to 90% of internet users).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Last, but certainly not least, consider making use of these terms on social media platforms. \u201cSocial ads are arguably the most effective way to boost branded searches, and advertising on Facebook will tend to increase the number of branded searches AdWords advertisers see by an average of 34%,\u201d says Zina. Although Facebook ads don\u2019t target based on keywords, you can still try using these long-tail terms in your Facebook ad messaging too see if it resonates with your audiences there.<\/p>\n<p>Are you still unsure how to deal with these \u201clow search volume\u201d keywords?
