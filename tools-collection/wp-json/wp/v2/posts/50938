According to the announcement, here are the benefits:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Simplify your audience targeting and optimization.<\/li>\n<li>Work across different networks and audience types.<\/li>\n<li>Find additional opportunities to expand your reach.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Optimized targeting looks at indicators like keywords on your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/29\/google-ads-creative-studio\">rich media assets<\/a> or on your landing pages, then finds additional folks you can show to that would help to meet your campaign goals.<\/p>\n<p>You can also manually add additional signals for optimized targeting to build off of like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/06\/new-adwords-demographics-targeting\">demographics you\u2019d like to target<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/10\/google-display-network-targeting\">content keywords<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>With an end goal of helping to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/22\/conversion-rate-optimizations\"> increase conversions<\/a>, this <strong>automatically applied <\/strong>branch of targeting could sound like music to advertisers\u2019 ears.<\/p>\n<h2>How does optimized targeting work?<\/h2>\n<p>Once it rolls out on your account, you\u2019ll see performance metrics show under your Totals in the bottom of your<strong> <\/strong>Audiences<strong> <\/strong>or<strong> <\/strong>Keywords view on your Display, Discovery or video campaigns. <strong>What this means is that aside from your audience alone, you\u2019ll be pulling in impressions, clicks and even conversions from people outside of your targeting parameters.<\/strong><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/optimized-targeting-performance-view.png\" width=\"561\" height=\"390\" alt=\"google ads audience tab with expansion and optimized targeting\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Optimized targeting works by looking for additional conversions through targeting people its algorithm deems most likely to convert based on the signals your setup indicates. This is based on real-time conversion data. For example, it looks at what people who recently converted are now searching for.<\/p>\n<h2>Wait, isn\u2019t this the same as audience expansion?<\/h2>\n<p>Optimized targeting does sound very similar to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/14\/google-marketing-live\">audience expansion rolled out in 2019<\/a>.

Here are a few scenarios where leaving on optimized targeting is the right choice for you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You haven\u2019t seen positive results with audience expansion alone.<\/li>\n<li>Your current targeting methods have been slow with results, or you\u2019re working with a small audience.<\/li>\n<li>You\u2019re looking to scale a Display, video, or Discovery campaign.<\/li>\n<li>You want to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/conversion-rate-optimization\">increase your conversion rate<\/a> without raising your bids or budget.<\/li>\n<li>You want to acquire new customers, or identify new people who are receptive to your campaign.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If none of those sound like you, then don\u2019t worry!
