The strategy includes using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/20\/social-listening\">social listening<\/a> to know what topics are important to prospects and then joining or generating conversations to build relationships with them.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you work for a commercial contractor. Someone on X (formerly Twitter) talks about expanding their business in your area and has a question about building codes. You give an answer with some helpful links. You&#8217;re at the top of the list when they ask for a bid to upgrade their new building.<\/p>\n<p>Notice that social selling focuses on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/12\/how-to-generate-leads\">generating new leads<\/a> rather than quick conversions. You want to build trust through genuine connection, not complete an impersonal transaction.<\/p>\n<p>The best part of social selling is that it\u2019s like a free, always-on networking event you don\u2019t have to fly to. You get to generate and nurture 1:1 relationships at a scale you never could with in-person networking or cold calls.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 Want more oomph in your outreach?

Traditional selling often takes place in person or via cold calls.<\/p>\n<p>With social selling, you directly target product users or decision-makers. Traditional sales strategies usually start with engaging a gatekeeper before you speak with the person writing the checks.<\/p>\n<p>Social selling uses warm introductions and personalized conversations to engage with targeted prospects. Traditional sales tactics rely on generic scripts and shotgun outreach.<\/p>\n<h3>Social selling vs. social media marketing<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/social-media-marketing#:~:text=Social%20media%20marketing%20is%20a,%2C%20you%27re%20missing%20out!\">Social media marketing<\/a> is usually a one-to-many broadcast. In contrast, social selling is more about building relationships with one-to-one conversations.<\/p>\n<p>Social media marketing can also be conversion-focused and even include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/25\/social-shopping\">social shopping<\/a>, where people can buy right from the social media platform. With social selling, you\u2019re meeting and interacting with prospects, but the conversion happens outside the social network.<\/p>\n<p>While they have differences, social media marketing and social selling do support each other. You may write some generally <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/03\/social-media-copy\">helpful social media posts<\/a> as part of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/01\/09\/social-media-marketing-strategies\">social media marketing strategy<\/a>, but when a prospect comments, they move into your social selling funnel.<\/p>\n<div id=\"Who-is-social-selling-for\"><\/div>\n<h2>Who is social selling for?<\/h2>\n<p>Social selling is for any company that sells products to people who spend time on social media.

People go to those networks more often for professional conversations. Plus, those platforms have some great tools to make creating a sales network easier.<\/p>\n<h3>LinkedIn<\/h3>\n<p>LinkedIn is the best platform for B2B social selling. Not only does the platform have more than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.demandsage.com\/linkedin-statistics\/\">1 billion<\/a> users, but most of them are also there to talk shop. That means your conversations about professional topics will fit right in.<\/p>\n<p>LinkedIn makes it really easy to grow your professional network. You can use the search bar at the top of the page to look for specific job titles or people working for a company. Then, you can refine the list to only show people connected with your current network. Hello, warm introductions!<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s also a really powerful tool called <a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/sales-solutions\/sales-navigator\">LinkedIn Sales Navigator<\/a>. Use it to prioritize your prospects, find advocates who\u2019ll help you connect, and even surface accounts showing high buying intent.<\/p>\n<p>And the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e8sistance is LinkedIn\u2019s social selling index (SSI).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/social-selling-wordstream-SSI.webp\" alt=\"Social selling - LinkedIn SSI dashboard\" width=\"740\" height=\"564\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-80612 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/social-selling-wordstream-SSI.webp 740w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/social-selling-wordstream-SSI-480x366.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 740px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/sales\/ssi?src=or-search&amp;veh=www.google.com%7Cor-search\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>The SSI is a metric from LinkedIn that measures your success against the four pillars of social selling.

You\u2019ll get an overall score and see how you fare against others in your industry.<\/p>\n<h3>X (formerly Twitter)<\/h3>\n<p>X is built for public discussions, which makes it a perfect place to jump into conversations and establish your brand\u2019s expertise.<\/p>\n<p>Finding those conversations is easy since many users add <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/02\/twitter-hashtags\">hashtags to their tweets<\/a>. Search for hashtags using the bar at the top or click a hashtag from someone you already follow and see who else is using it.<\/p>\n<p>Say one of your customers uses the hashtag #HRIssues on their Tweets. Click it, and you\u2019ll likely find a host of other prospects who need your human resources software.<\/p>\n<p>But what\u2019s really cool about X is the List feature.

Or create your own private lists to keep tabs on competitors or customers.<\/p>\n<h3>Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram<\/h3>\n<p>Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram are popular social marketing platforms. But they\u2019re less hospitable to social selling since people gravitate to them to get away from work. You can still see some benefits there, depending on what you sell.<\/p>\n<h4>Social selling on Facebook<\/h4>\n<p>The challenge with Facebook is that its privacy controls make it more difficult to engage with new people. Unless someone has made their post public, you won\u2019t be able to interact with it. One potential workaround is Facebook groups. Look for existing groups that align with what you do, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/16\/create-facebook-group\">build your own Facebook group<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/social-selling-wordstream-groups.webp\" alt=\"Social selling - A group on Facebook\" width=\"584\" height=\"595\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-80614 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/social-selling-wordstream-groups.webp 584w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/social-selling-wordstream-groups-480x489.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 584px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019re in the group, remember to be friendly and helpful.

Download our latest <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteFBBenchmarks.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_FBBenchmarks_Download\">Facebook ads benchmarks<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h4>Social selling on TikTok<\/h4>\n<p>TikTok is growing as a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/content-marketing-trends-2024\">sales channel<\/a> because more people now <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/b2b-marketing-trends-2024\">use it to find new products<\/a> and services. But it\u2019s a very visual platform that kind of buries comments. So, it\u2019s not ideal for generating conversations.<\/p>\n<p>Your best bet is to post entertaining videos that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/14\/tiktok-trend-discovery\">follow trends on TikTok<\/a> and build awareness of your brand.<\/p>\n<h4>Social selling on Instagram<\/h4>\n<p>It isn\u2019t easy to find individuals to connect with on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/instagram-advertising\">Instagram<\/a> unless they\u2019re a celebrity or you know their handle. Plus, starting an organic conversation there is hard, especially since it\u2019s such a visual platform.<\/p>\n<p>Like TikTok, your social selling play here is to post helpful content that attracts people who would eventually use what you sell. You could also try following complementary brands (think of cosmetics companies if you\u2019re a fashion brand) and reply to the comments you see there. Just don\u2019t go too hard. No brand wants another company harassing its followers.<\/p>\n<div id=\"9-tips-to-become-a-pro-level-social-seller\"><\/div>\n<h2>9 tips to become a pro-level social seller<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve got the pillars down and seen how they work on different social media platforms.

Before you ask for something like scheduling a demo or booking an appointment, give something first to keep the scales even.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Be an active social listener<\/h3>\n<p>Social listening gives you the superpower of knowing what people are talking about online. That way, you can get in on the conversation and engage with prospects organically.<\/p>\n<p>On LinkedIn, you can set alerts to notify you when an account posts. Over on X, you can be notified anytime someone uses a specific hashtag.<\/p>\n<p>For more robust social listening, use a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/01\/17\/best-free-social-media-management-tools\">social media management tool<\/a>.

Optimize your profiles<\/h3>\n<ol start=\"3\"><\/ol>\n<p>What\u2019s the first thing people do when they see your social media account pop up for the first time? Many of them head right to your profile.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why a professional and complete profile is critical.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/social-selling-wordstream-Jabil.webp\" alt=\"Social selling - Jabil LinkedIn profile.\" width=\"855\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-80618 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/social-selling-wordstream-Jabil.webp 855w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/social-selling-wordstream-Jabil-480x337.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 855px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/jabil\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Each social network has different profile styles, but in general:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use professional <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/social-media-image-sizes\">profile and banner images<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Write a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/instagram-bio-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bio<\/a> that quickly explains what you do and for whom<\/li>\n<li>Fill out all available fields<\/li>\n<li>Add a website <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/get-more-instagram-followers#bio\">link to your bio<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/10\/social-proof-guide\">social proof<\/a> if possible<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you\u2019re connecting through your personal LinkedIn account, gather some recommendations. In fact, it\u2019s a good practice to trade LinkedIn recommendations with people you work with.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Personalize connection requests<\/h3>\n<p>After you\u2019ve built a rapport by sharing content and conversing in the comments section, it\u2019s time to formalize the relationship with a connection request. The best <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/introduction-email\">introduction messages<\/a> are specific and relevant to the recipient. That\u2019s true in social selling since you\u2019ve done so much to create a personal connection.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few ways to personalize your connection requests:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mention people you\u2019re both connected with<\/li>\n<li>Call back to a recent interaction you\u2019ve had<\/li>\n<li>Provide something of additional value (like a link to a relevant article)<\/li>\n<li>Use their name and reference their company or job title<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>5. Continuously grow your network<\/h3>\n<ol start=\"5\"><\/ol>\n<p>Social selling isn\u2019t a one-and-done strategy. It\u2019s a long-term play that gains steam over time. Set weekly goals for the number of posts, comments, and replies you publish. Block out time dedicated only to tending to your social media network.<\/p>\n<p>And most of all, don\u2019t rush it. Many of your new connections won\u2019t need what you sell right now. But they will eventually. And even if they don\u2019t, they could offer a warm introduction to other people in the future.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Be active in comments and replies<\/h3>\n<p>This is a foundational tactic of social selling. A well-timed, relevant comment is your first foot in the door with a new prospect. You are adding to the conversation, and your engagement helps boost the post with the platform\u2019s algorithm.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t forget to listen out for people who\u2019ve already bought, too.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/social-selling-wordstream-away.webp\" alt=\"Social selling - Post reply from Away brand.\" width=\"456\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-80620 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/social-selling-wordstream-away.webp 456w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/social-selling-wordstream-away-228x300.webp 228w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/away\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Jumping in to save the day is the ultimate social selling tactic.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Strike up conversations in your posts<\/h3>\n<p>You don\u2019t always have to seek out people to converse with on social media. You can bring them to your posts with questions and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/04\/instagram-story-ads-polls\">polls<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/social-selling-wordstream-Charles.webp\" alt=\"Social selling - LinkedIn post with a poll\" width=\"485\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-80621 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/social-selling-wordstream-Charles.webp 485w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/social-selling-wordstream-Charles-480x594.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 485px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/charles-almond\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Whether they\u2019re funny or serious, questions get people talking.

Engage with influencers<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/26\/influencer-marketing\">Influencers<\/a> in your industry can be beneficial allies in your social selling campaign.
