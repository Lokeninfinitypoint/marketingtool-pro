Post with intent.<\/h2>\n<p>According to Christina Hager, head of social media strategy and distribution at media company Overflow Storytelling Lab, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/30\/cost-effective-ad-types\">s<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/30\/cost-effective-ad-types\">mall businesses<\/a> need to be more mindful about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/19\/social-media-for-small-business\">how they communicate with their audiences<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201c<\/strong>You can&#8217;t just throw things onto Facebook and hope someone sees them,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need to post with intention and then decide what you are going to do with that post\u201d\u2014in other words, whether you are going to boost it with budget.<\/p>\n<p>To do so, Vicki Anzmann, chief creative officer at marketing agency Creativation Marketing, said to use <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/24\/facebook-insights\">Facebook Insights<\/a> to help determine a good posting rhythm and content mix.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Try to blend in.<\/h2>\n<p>\u201cFind ways to convey your brand by being funny, out-of-the-box, informational or unique,\u201d said Eric Johnson, SEO specialist and digital marketer at web design, SEO and marketing firm FeedbackWrench. \u201cDo that, and you&#8217;ll be sure to reach a large crowd on Facebook.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Look at grocery chain Meijer.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/bad-facebook-ad-for-small-business.jpg\" alt=\"facebook ad for small business\" width=\"650\" height=\"941\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Per Johnson, this post shows below average results because both the design element and the copy strongly suggest a promotional angle.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen coupled with a link to buy the product, Facebook&#8217;s algorithm was likely able to easily determine the overtly promotional approach that this post took on,\u201d he said. \u201cDue to this, the post was, overall, a failed effort.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Meijer\u2019s other sunscreen post, however, had more than 15 times the interaction because it exists purely for the entertainment value of reminiscing.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ad-tips-for-small-businesses.jpg\" alt=\"native facebook ad\" width=\"650\" height=\"922\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cSince there was no overtly promotional angle here, the post reached a much larger audience and garnered tons of engagements that got the Meijer brand noticed a lot more effectively than a direct sales approach,\u201d Johnson added.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Don\u2019t post without a content calendar.<\/h2>\n<p>In order to plan effectively, implement a content calendar.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-content-calendar.jpg\" alt=\"content calendar for facebook marketing\" width=\"1029\" height=\"687\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Via <a href=\"https:\/\/www.falcon.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Falcon.io<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cA content calendar is the most effective way to maximize your efforts while minimizing the time spent on Facebook marketing,\u201d said Dan Towers, senior manager of digital marketing at marketing and advertising firm Arcane.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou can plan out content at one time and by using a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/01\/17\/best-free-social-media-management-tools\">scheduling program<\/a>, like Buffer or Sprout Social, you are able set it and forget it,\u201d he added. \u201cBut don&#8217;t actually forget it\u2014still monitor your posts and focus on community management. Your customers will appreciate it.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>4. Optimize your profile page.<\/h2>\n<p>Because tabs serve as the navigation bar for your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/16\/facebook-business-page\">Facebook business page<\/a>, it is important to make sure they are well organized and improve the audience\u2019s ability to find information. By optimizing tabs, restructuring their hierarchy and including or removing important tabs, you provide the user with a smoother experience, said Mackenzie Maher, social media account manager at digital marketing agency Power Digital Marketing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you are a service-based business, make sure your review tab is turned on. If you add tabs that link to your other social pages, make sure these are all grouped together. If you\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/04\/25\/event-marketing\">promoting an event<\/a> or hiring for a new position, make sure these tabs are also turned on and advertise your information here,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-page-tabs.png\" alt=\"facebook business page tabs\" width=\"650\" height=\"275\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Via <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/blog\/tabid\/6307\/bid\/26330\/how-to-create-custom-tabs-for-facebook-business-pages.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HubSpot<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is simple, yet seemingly obvious tweaks like these that are often overlooked but can make or break the user\u2019s experience. They should never have to look that hard to find the information they need.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>5. Establish a community page.<\/h2>\n<p>Ben Taylor, founder of freelance advice portal HomeWorkingClub.com, said community pages tend to give more organic reach than commercial business pages on Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you make the page invitation-only it makes customers feel special\u00a0and is a good place to maintain relationships with them, one on one,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>Taylor said he got the idea from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/nichehacksprivate\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NicheHacks private mastermind group<\/a>, which discusses affiliate marketing, and then set up <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/1788671481183210\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">his own advice group<\/a> for HomeWorkingClub.com, which gains about 25 to 40 new members per week.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-community-for-small-business.jpg\" alt=\"how to start a facebook community\" width=\"520\" height=\"296\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cWhen people sign up to my email list, they\u2019re invited to join the group,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Create a Facebook group.<\/h2>\n<p>Maria Mora, content director at digital marketing agency Big Sea, said to create a Facebook Group, not for promotional purposes, but to allow for an exchange of information related to a given business.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor example, if you sell essential oils, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/16\/create-facebook-group\">create a Facebook group<\/a> specifically about pet owners trying aromatherapy,\u201d she said. \u201cThe key is to find a niche within your customers&#8217; interests and give them a space to connect. As that group grows, you can sparingly share your content, such as relevant articles or whitepapers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She pointed to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/1439045379672902\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ethical Aromatherapy<\/a>\u00a0group, which is moderated by essential oil retailer Stillpoint Aromatics, and has more than 13,000 members. Mora said it was created as a resource for consumers to discuss where essential oils are sourced and how to use them safely and it grew organically through members inviting their friends.<\/p>\n<p>However, she warned not to use the group to promote sales or calls to action.\u00a0The Ethical Aromatherapy page, for example, allows discussion and recommendation of other essential oil importers.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Be strategic about your group name.<\/h2>\n<p>When creating a group, marketing consultant Ron Stefanski recommended naming it after something people will actually search for in Facebook to increase the odds users will find it. He used this tactic when creating a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/bengalcatclub\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook group<\/a> for his website, BengalCatClub.com, which has since gained over 10,000 followers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI personally think this tactic could work for any business in any area\/industry\u2014Facebook groups do really well to further the awareness of the brand,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like it&#8217;s a good idea that most people aren&#8217;t using.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>8. Keep adding to your Facebook story.<\/h2>\n<p>According to Bernie Clark, founder of digital marketing and advertising agency <a href=\"https:\/\/www.majux.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Majux Marketing<\/a>, Facebook Stories make posting often to Facebook much more casual.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cStories don\u2019t even necessarily have to pertain to company-specific news, they could be anything from fun questions to interesting links, anything to keep your audience engaged and cause a higher likelihood for a click on your profile,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-stories-tips-for-small-businesses.jpg\" alt=\"small business facebook stories marketing\" width=\"964\" height=\"783\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"BG\">Nedelina Payaneva, digital<span lang=\"BG\">\u00a0marketing specialist at translation services firm Asian Absolute agreed, adding Facebook Stories don\u2019t require slick production value either.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"BG\">\u201cThis type of content has a casual, on-the-go feel,\u201d she said. \u201cUsers feel like they are behind the scenes and that works. Similarly, Live feeds are increasing in popularity. From makeup tutorials to studio tours, brands can go live and interact with fans. These can be saved and shared, and have value on the replay side, too.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>9. Don\u2019t obsess over vanity metrics.<\/h2>\n<p>Per Tommy Baykov, marketing manager at WordPress hosting services WPX Hosting, small businesses tend to have more limited marketing budgets, which is why they should focus on the things that make a difference to their bottom lines\u2014and not the ones that make them temporarily feel good, like likes.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ads-average-click-through-rate-graphic.png\" width=\"1000\" height=\"866\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cDepending on your business and strategy, CTR, 50% video views [and] messages received are just some of the much more meaningful and actionable metrics,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<h2>10. Use Facebook for customer service.<\/h2>\n<p>Rafi Bitchakdjian, head of social media at marketing firm Cue Marketing, said smaller brands can lean on Facebook to help them deal with any customer service issues that arise much as corporations use bots to communicate with clients online.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAudiences expect replies within minutes and Facebook is the ideal on-the-go platform to use when wanting to solve an issue or even just thank a customer for their positive review,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<h2>11. Post with a (small) budget.<\/h2>\n<p>Underwood recommends adding a paid budget\u2014even a small one\u2014to ensure reach.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTry experimenting with different types of content, messaging, imagery and times of day, and use Facebook&#8217;s built-in A\/B testing system to see what can help stretch your ad dollars to the max,\u201d he said. \u201cPosting without a paid budget is now officially a waste of time\u2014you\u2019re much better off posting just occasionally with a small budget to ensure that content gets in front of your valuable customers and prospects.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Underwood said one national restaurant chain client has a per-post reach of 1.06% of its total likes on Facebook over the past several weeks\u2014and another Midwest-based food client has seen its per-post reach drop to less than 7% in the last several weeks.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBoth of these are representative of what we&#8217;re seeing across all of our client pages recently,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>Keri Lindenmuth, marketing manager at web design and software development firm KDG, agreed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/26\/how-to-create-facebook-ads\">Facebook ads\u00a0<\/a>are effective because they allow you to custom-tailor the audience by location, age and more. There&#8217;s also the store traffic objective that allows <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/08\/facebook-local-advertising\">local businesses to advertise on Facebook<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes it is best if these ads look and sound no different than a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/06\/10\/facebook-post-engagement\">regular Facebook post<\/a>,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have found that promoted video and image posts work best.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>RELATED: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/10\/facebook-post-ideas\">62 Creative, Practical &amp; Engaging Facebook Post Ideas\u00a0<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>12. Narrow your audience.<\/h2>\n<p>George Schildge, CEO\u00a0of\u00a0digital marketing agency Matrix Marketing Group, said the objective is to narrow down audiences and test to see which will produce the most results for a given objective.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThink about it as if we were running TV ads and testing in different cities,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>So, for example, for small batch coffee roaster EspressoLuv.com, he narrowed down Facebook users to those who like roaster Blue Bottle Coffee. From there, he can research what else these demographics like.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/targeting-facebook-tips-small-business.jpg\" alt=\"facebook targeting strategies small business\" width=\"868\" height=\"275\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cI&#8217;ll do this until I have about 30 other pages to begin narrowing my target audience before I start testing my ad creative,\u201d Schildge added.<\/p>\n<h2>13. Consider boosted posts.<\/h2>\n<p>Per Greg Bullock, marketing manager at migraine relief company TheraSpecs, Facebook\u2019s boost post (or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/15\/facebook-sponsored-posts\">sponsored post<\/a>) feature allows users to expand the audience for their posts exponentially and target highly engaged and relevant prospects\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/16\/facebook-ad-costs\">with very little budget<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNot only can it help you recoup lost organic reach from ongoing algorithmic changes, but it can increase visibility that ultimately generates traffic to your content and\/or purchases for your product or service,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, we have seen our most popular posts generate thousands of clicks for literally two or three pennies per click.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And while Bullock noted there is tremendous value to setting up a larger campaign in Ads Manager, \u201csometimes you really only want a few clicks to get going. With boosted posts, you just set your target audience, your budget and you\u2019re off and running.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He pointed to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TheraSpecs\/posts\/1380943002016426\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this boosted post<\/a> from TheraSpecs, which received nearly 1600 paid clicks at $0.02 per click.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/migraine-memes-fb-boosted-post.jpg\" alt=\"facebook boosted posts\" width=\"900\" height=\"852\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Tommy Burns, marketing specialist at digital agency Bluehouse Group, however, warned that small businesses have to be even more careful about how they spend their budgets and boosted posts have less targeting, bidding and pricing options.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUltimately, that means you&#8217;re getting less bang for your buck on each advertisement placement,\u201d he said. \u201cSmall businesses use boosted posts because they&#8217;re quick and they&#8217;re busy. Unfortunately, they are giving up control over the advertisements their audience sees.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>14. Use boosted posts to optimize ads.<\/h2>\n<p>For his part, Kevin Namaky, founder of marketing education company Gurulocity, suggested using Facebook ads and boosted posts in sequence.<\/p>\n<p>By creating two ads and giving both a small boost of around $50 to drive initial engagement, small businesses can see which ad generates the most engagement, such as likes, shares and comments. Then, Namaky said, advertisers can create a Facebook ad in Ads Manager with their conversion goal, but instead of recreating the ad, they can reuse the exact boosted post as their creative, complete with likes and shares already on the post.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis will help your ad convert better than if you ran a new cold piece of creative with no likes or shares on it to begin with,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>To run the exact same post with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/10\/social-proof-guide\">the social proof<\/a>, go to your business page, scroll to find the boosted post and click on the date and time at the top of the post. The URL has a unique post number, which you can copy and paste when creating the ad by clicking on \u2018use existing post\u2019 and entering the ID under Creative,\u201d Namaky added.<\/p>\n<h2>15. Learn how to use Facebook\u2019s Power Editor tool.<\/h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re serious about Facebook advertising, Burns suggested learning Facebook\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/adsmanager\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Power Editor tool<\/a>\u00a0to promote posts.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt allows you to set up A\/B test campaigns, create <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/12\/11\/facebook-custom-audience-strategy\">custom audiences<\/a> based on conversion pixels and use advanced bidding models,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<h2>16. Use Facebook\u2019s product catalog ads.<\/h2>\n<p>Kevin Simonson, CEO of performance\u00a0marketing\u00a0agency Metric Digital, called not using Facebook\u2019s product catalog ads a \u201cwasted opportunity.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis template is a surefire way to create a rich browsing experience for shoppers, encouraging greater product discovery and engagement,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also the perfect tool for implementing dynamic retargeting. Not to mention, it allows you to connect an existing catalog from another platform, such as Google.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/13\/facebook-ecommerce-tips\">ecommerce client saw sales from Facebook<\/a> remarketing increase by about 300% after implementing Facebook\u2019s product catalog.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTheir ROAS went from 600 to 3000% and their CPA dropped from $45 to $9,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<h2>17. Structure your pixel strategically.<\/h2>\n<p>Scott Selenow, president of marketing agency Immerse Agency, said the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/11\/facebook-conversion-tracking\">Facebook pixel<\/a> collects data about who is visiting your website and allows you to retarget those consumers later.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook also has a lookalike feature, which allows you to target people who have similar online habits as your site visitors.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe next ad campaign you set up can be all that more successful if you are able to specifically target folks you know have a propensity to interact with your campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cThis pixel can help you maximize that intelligent targeting.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>However, if your Facebook pixel is poorly executed, you\u2019ll lose because you\u2019re not getting the data you need, Simonson added.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-conversion-tracking-time-spent-on-site-audience.png\" alt=\"Facebook conversion tracking Time Spent on Site audience\" width=\"640\" height=\"416\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cSmart brands do everything it takes to make conversion tracking, optimization and remarketing easier. Pixel is the perfect tool for doing so,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what helps you find new customers who are similar to your website visitors. And, shockingly, many of the companies we audit don\u2019t have it set up.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A small business client was able to turn Facebook\u00a0into a channel that drove eight figures in spend, which is more than any of its other paid channels.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWithout having their pixel in order, that never would have happened,\u201d Simonson added.<\/p>\n<h2>18. Use Facebook Custom Audiences to retarget users who have watched your videos.<\/h2>\n<p>Per Andrew Schutt, founder of internet marketing firm Elevated Web Marketing, one of the most consistently effective strategies is using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/25\/facebook-video-ads\">video ads<\/a> to retarget warm audiences.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the great things about the Facebook Ads Manager is the ability to create custom audiences for your ads based on how long people watch your videos,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, a dentist might run a video advertisement to a cold audience talking about how important teeth cleanings are. After the teeth cleaning video has been running for a few days, we could then set up a retargeting ad that offers a discounted teeth cleaning to new patients.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But, Schutt said, that dentist can choose to show the ad only to people who have watched over 50% of the teeth cleaning video.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat way, we know they\u2019re interested in teeth cleanings already, so our ad is going to be much more relevant and effective,\u201d he added. \u201cWhereas if we were to just serve that discount teeth cleaning ad to a cold audience, the engagement rate on the offer would be much lower.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Schutt said he\u2019s used this strategy with a solar panel installation company and a chiropractor to help generate leads.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat makes this strategy so effective is that we only show that free offer to people who watched over 75% of the first video. So we know they&#8217;re interested in the benefits of chiropractic\u2014we\u2019ve already prequalified them, to a degree,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a single week, with minimal ad spend, we generated 18 leads for [a] free [chiropractic adjustment].\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>19. Create saved audiences.<\/h2>\n<p>Unlike Custom Audiences, Saved Audiences are those you configure through the standard Facebook Ads targeting options. But instead of configuring your audience each time you create an ad or want to boost a post, you can create saved audiences that you can use each time you start an ad campaign, said Chris\u00a0Smith, co-founder of digital marketing and sales coaching company Curaytor.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-saved-audiences.png\" alt=\"facebook saved audience\" width=\"619\" height=\"583\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Via <a href=\"https:\/\/ask.udonis.co\/facebook-saved-audience\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Udonis<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a great option to use if you plan on targeting similar audiences each time you create specific ads or boost posts from your page,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially when you start creating ads in mass quantity and boost posts regularly, it will save you a lot of time and money.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>20. Test different bidding strategies.<\/h2>\n<p>Stacy Caprio, founder of marketing firm Accelerated Growth Marketing, said her #1 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/10\/facebook-advertising-tips-for-small-business\">Facebook tip<\/a> is to test different bidding strategies, including amount of bid and type.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou can create four or five different ad groups for an identical ad with different bid amounts and types, let it run for a week or two, then kill off the underperforming ad sets and let the best bid results continue to run,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Simonson said Metric Digital has audited more than 1000 small businesses since 2013 and has noticed some companies use conversion bidding, but don\u2019t have enough events tracked to optimize.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFacebook\u00a0insists that an ad set needs to generate 15 to 25 conversions per week at minimum to provide enough data to be successful,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, this could be difficult to reach if your company has just started advertising and your budget is small. In our audits, we will often see conversion bidding used on ad sets that are getting far less than this number of conversions. Meaning, if your ad sets can\u2019t hit 25 purchases per week, you can try setting your conversion event to add-to-carts, or another event closer to the top of the funnel.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>21. Don\u2019t forget to test ad placements.<\/h2>\n<p>Try both the Newsfeed and right-hand-side ads to see what performs best. That\u2019s according to Namrata Arya, head of digital marketing for domain portfolio registry Radix, who added, \u201cThe right-hand side ads, while cheaper than newsfeed ads, may not get you the desired amount of clicks or conversions.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>22. Capitalize on link retargeting.<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re using Facebook retargeting ads to boost conversions and attract visitors to your website, you should use link retargeting, too. That\u2019s according to Louisa McGrath, content manager at link management tool Rebrandly, who said this allows you to build out your retargeting lists and reach audiences that haven\u2019t visited your website before, but which have been influenced by your brand on social media.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBasically link retargeting allows you to add Facebook retargeting pixels to your short link when sharing curated content. Anyone who clicks on this content can be retargeted with relevant ads,\u201d she said. \u201cSo you can retarget people who&#8217;ve clicked on media coverage, reviews or industry news related to your business, even if the link led to a third-party website.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/rebrandly-link-retargeting-facebook.jpg\" alt=\"link retargeting for facebook marketing\" width=\"650\" height=\"576\" \/><\/div>\n<p>McGrath said Rebrandly is using this tactic to promote a Meetup in Dublin.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe event page is hosted on a third-party site\u2014Meetup.com\u2014but\u00a0because the short link includes a Facebook retargeting pixel,\u00a0anyone who clicks on the link or types it into their browser is added to our Facebook retargeting list,\u201d she said. \u201cThey&#8217;ll be presented with one of our banner ads on Facebook.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Still not satisfied?
