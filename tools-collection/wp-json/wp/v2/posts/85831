The Float team hired an SEO agency to identify keywords from the studies related to the core challenges they solve for customers. Stella said that resulted in over 10 SEO articles \u201cbased entirely on our customer stories.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Then, they updated existing articles with mentions of the case studies and embedded YouTube videos in others. That means they bolstered dozens of existing assets with social proof in just a few minutes!<\/p>\n<p>Next up was social media. \u201cWe created a plan that would guide us in repurposing the case studies into carousels, text posts, video posts, and quote posts on LinkedIn,\u201d Stella said. \u201cSince January, we\u2019ve created over 70 LinkedIn assets from the case studies alone.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And finally, they posted customer stories to their Slack community. \u201cThese posts caught the attention of three customers who requested a case study interview.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know many businesses that get more mileage from their case studies than Stella and Float. The best part is that none of these tactics are out of reach for most marketers. You can post videos to YouTube and slice them up to LinkedIn for free. If you have access to an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/online-seo-tools\">SEO tool<\/a>, you can pull out a few keywords from the conversations.

At least two experts in the space turned the key components of the piece into carousels on LinkedIn.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/content-repurposing-wordstream-convert.webp\" alt=\"Content repurposing - Influencer post sharing content on LinkedIn.\" width=\"505\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85873 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/content-repurposing-wordstream-convert.webp 505w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/content-repurposing-wordstream-convert-480x570.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 505px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/posts\/daphnetideman_low-traffic-alternative-test-methods-activity-7224050908664377345-2K2U?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Influencer posts<\/em><\/a><em> promoting Convert\u2019s guide to A\/B testing generated a lot of engagement.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Collectively, those carousels generated hundreds of reactions and comments\u2014a much better result than if the brand had just shared the content themselves. \u201cThe same blog post, when shared on Convert\u2019s LinkedIn company page, didn&#8217;t get as many likes,\u201d Sneh said. \u201cThe content was great. People who were tagged commented on it. But the algorithm still didn&#8217;t pick it up.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sneh also said the post format matters. \u201cRepurposing blog posts into carousels for LinkedIn is a great way to get more distribution,\u201d she explained. \u201cCarousels work much better for this purpose, based on my own research.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The trick is getting expert influencers to do the repurposing for you. Here are a few ways to make it happen:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pay them:<\/strong> Find someone in your niche with a sizable, engaged following and offer a partnership. Even if they don\u2019t consider themselves an influencer, they may be willing to share your best content for a small fee.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Trade with them:<\/strong> Look for people who regularly write guest posts for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/10\/link-building-secrets\">backlinks<\/a>. If you have a well-visited blog, you could trade links in your content for social shares.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Feature them (my favorite):<\/strong> Ask experts to share their knowledge for a blog post, give them a citation and backlink in the piece, and ask them to share snippets of it on their social feeds.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here\u2019s one final bit of repurposing wisdom from Sneh: don\u2019t make it all about the original piece of content. \u201cFocus on delivering value natively instead of \u2018hey go read this thing I wrote.\u2019 And zero in on the unique angle, main POV, or ideas you want to distribute instead of breaking up the blog post into sections exactly as they\u2019re laid out and posting those on social. Distribute ideas, not blog posts.\u201d<\/p>\n<div id=\"turn-quest-appearances-into-blog-and-social-content\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. Turn guest appearances into blog and social content<\/h3>\n<p>I like this content repurposing idea from freelance fintech writer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/annabyang\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anna Burgess Yang<\/a> because it draws on a source of ideas most people aren\u2019t leveraging yet.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Part of my marketing strategy includes guest appearances on podcasts,\u201d Anna said. \u201cWhile the hosts will usually send me clips to share on social media, there&#8217;s so much more I can do with that content.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Along with being a writer, Anna also <a href=\"https:\/\/start.annabyang.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">advises solopreneurs and small businesses<\/a> on workflow and automation tactics. She\u2019s created a slick way to make repurposing content even easier. \u201cOnce the episode has aired, I feed the transcript to ChatGPT to pull out my main ideas so I can turn them into future social media posts or even an outline for a future blog post.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Repurposing is a great <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-in-marketing\">use of AI<\/a> because it extracts ideas from something you\u2019ve created instead of trying to generate novel ideas from the tool.<\/p>\n<p>Try using Anna\u2019s technique for any speaking engagement you or your team take part in. That could include webinars, in-person talks, interviews, etc.<\/p>\n<div id=\"lead-with-seo\"><\/div>\n<h3>8. Lead with SEO<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/colby-flood\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Colby Flood<\/a>, founder at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brighterclick.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brighter Click<\/a>, has an interesting take on repurposing content. Instead of looking for potential SEO blog post ideas from an existing asset, he creates a repurposing system that starts with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/seo-keyword\">SEO keywords<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt Brighter Click, we\u2019ve crafted a content pipeline allowing thought leaders to invest minimal time in creating video content that gets re-purposed into various mediums,\u201d he said. \u201cWe leverage SEO keyword research to craft interview questions for a podcast episode. This interview is then transcribed and turned into multiple blog articles.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>SEO keywords aren\u2019t just useful for helping your content get found on Google. They can also be a consciousness bellwether, telling you which topics your audience wants to understand better. Building your repurposing plan around keywords means you\u2019ll share ideas people are interested in.<\/p>\n<p>Once the blog posts are up, Colby and his team continue to slice and dice the ideas into other formats for more exposure. \u201cThe podcast video and blog articles are re-purposed into social media posts across various channels,\u201d he said. \u201cFinally, we create a LinkedIn and email newsletter. This content pipeline allows us to generate 3-4 weeks of content from one 45-minute interview.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t want to start with very basic 101 keywords here. It\u2019ll be hard to find an interesting angle on \u201chow do I take a screenshot.\u201d But if you look through your<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\"> keyword research<\/a> docs, you\u2019ll find some niche-specific options open to spicy takes.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd0e <strong>Need help finding the right keywords?<\/strong> Try our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h2>Content repurposing is your marketing lever<\/h2>\n<p>A lever is a simple machine that amplifies your ability to lift large loads with minimal effort. Content repurposing works much the same way.
