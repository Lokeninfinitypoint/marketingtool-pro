But let\u2019s go one layer deeper into why this practice is so good for SEO:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Identify linking opportunities:<\/strong> Just as important as eliminating harmful links is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/link-building\">building beneficial links<\/a>. A backlink audit can help you identify sites that might be worth reaching out to for a more intentional initiative. You can also audit another site\u2019s backlink profile to find broken or toxic links and offer your link as a replacement.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Troubleshoot traffic anomalies:<\/strong> Spikes and dips in traffic performance can happen for many reasons, and one of them is backlinks. You\u2019d be surprised at how much traffic comes from a small subset of backlinks\u2014like a specific region of the globe or even a particular site. Algorithmic, policy, and privacy changes can impact these backlink sources and cause large fluctuations in your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/14\/increase-traffic-to-my-website\">website traffic<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Avoid Google penalties: <\/strong>In the name of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/14\/google-e-e-a-t\">EEAT<\/a>, Google has ways of detecting unnatural backlinks obtained through black hat SEO practices. Even if you\u2019re not engaging in any of these intentionally, website and comment spam does happen, so a backlink audit can keep you out of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/30\/google-penalty\">Google penalty<\/a> box.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Prevent missed traffic opportunities:<\/strong> A backlink audit will reveal broken backlinks to your site and therefore traffic you\u2019re missing to your site.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Eliminate harmful links: <\/strong>When a site links to you, Google builds an association between you and that site. A backlink audit will show you all your toxic backlinks\u2014those links from spammy, suspicious or low credibility sites that you\u2019ll want to remove or disavow.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/backlink-audit-eliminate-toxic-links.webp\" alt=\"why do a backlink audit - eliminate toxic links to bring down toxicity score\" width=\"834\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-78987\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/backlink-audit-eliminate-toxic-links.webp 834w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/backlink-audit-eliminate-toxic-links-480x345.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 834px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-do-a-backlink-audit\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to do a backlink audit in 5 steps<\/h2>\n<p>Here\u2019s an easy five-step process you can use to assess the backlinks on your website.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Choose your tool<\/h3>\n<p>There are two main ways to do a backlink audit for your site. The first is through Google Search Console. This method is free, but since it does not provide granular details, it\u2019s best for just a basic overview or for carrying out a specific objective for a smaller site.<\/p>\n<p>The second is through an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/14\/seo-tools\">SEO tool<\/a> like Ahrefs or Semrush. Though these tools are paid, you\u2019ll get the granular insights you need to fix mistakes, harness opportunities, troubleshoot anomalies, and optimize for the results you want. I\u2019ll share the process for both of these methods later in the post.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd0e Speaking of helpful tools&#8230;have you tried our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a>?<\/p>\n<h3>2. Know your metrics<\/h3>\n<p>Without an understanding of backlink lingo, even the most basic of audit reports will put your head in a spin. Here are some of the key data points to look for in a backlink audit:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Number of backlinks:<\/strong> Quality is more important than quantity, but it\u2019s still helpful to see where you stand in relation to competitors.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Number of referring domains:<\/strong> This number will always be less than the number of backlinks, since one domain can link to your site multiple times.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Authority Score: <\/strong>Also known as <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-domain-authority\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Domain Authority<\/a>, this is a measure of a site\u2019s credibility, based on many EEAT factors (including backlinks!). You can view the Authority Score of the sites linking to yours, as well as your own Authority Score.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/backlink-audit-authority-score.webp\" alt=\"how to do a backlink audit - authority score\" width=\"936\" height=\"392\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-78986\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/backlink-audit-authority-score.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/backlink-audit-authority-score-480x201.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Top linked pages:<\/strong> The pages on your site with the most backlinks.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Top linking domains: <\/strong>The websites that link to you the most.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Link velocity: <\/strong>How many new backlinks you\u2019re gaining each week.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Link toxicity:<\/strong> A measure of how many harmful links you have pointing to your site, aka links from low authority, harmful, or spammy sites.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/how-to-do-a-backlink-audit-link-toxicity.webp\" alt=\"how to do a backlink audit - take stock of toxicity score\" width=\"936\" height=\"448\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-78997\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/how-to-do-a-backlink-audit-link-toxicity.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/how-to-do-a-backlink-audit-link-toxicity-480x230.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<ul><\/ul>\n<h3>3. Assess<\/h3>\n<p>A healthy backlink profile has a mix of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/anchor-text\">anchor text<\/a> types (branded and non-branded, keyword and non-keyword, for example) and a mix of Authority Scores from referring domains. This indicates that you\u2019ve earned these links ethically and naturally over time. And despite your best efforts, the internet is a wild, wild world\u2014so you need to go in and assess the quality of your links to make sure they are a reflection of your efforts and trustworthiness.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/how-to-do-a-backlink-audit-assess.webp\" alt=\"how to do a backlink audit - assess your current state from your reports\" width=\"936\" height=\"475\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-78995\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/how-to-do-a-backlink-audit-assess.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/how-to-do-a-backlink-audit-assess-480x244.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>4.
