We\u2019ve all been there: people start taking vacations, stop answering their phones, and your sales team starts getting antsy for more SQLs. Oh, and\u00a0<span lang=\"EN\">there&#8217;s also the whole cookieless internet thing, where first-party data collection on websites is more important than ever.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">It\u2019s prime time to set up some fresh, new lead magnets!<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/lead-magnet-ideas-business-magnet-1.png\" alt=\"magnet attracting leads to a funnel\" width=\"717\" height=\"219\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Read on so you can:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Learn what a lead magnet is.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Get inspired by 25\u00a0lead magnet ideas and examples.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Understand what you&#8217;ll need in order to create lead magnets for your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>With these tips and examples, you&#8217;ll be well on your way to attracting more people to your business that you can convert into customers.<\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">What is a lead magnet?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>First, let\u2019s define exactly what a lead magnet is.<\/p>\n<p>Lead magnets are an incentivized marketing tool for increasing\u00a0form fills. Typically, a business offers something free, but valuable, that\u00a0target <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/26\/prospecting-strategies-ppc-agencies\">prospects<\/a> will be willing to obtain in exchange for their information so that you can continue building the relationship. Plus, that information is all <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/12\/first-party-data\">first-party data<\/a>, which is becoming crucial in a cookieless world.<\/p>\n<p>Lead magnets are often associated with the top of the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/07\/marketing-funnel\">funnel<\/a>, but they can actually be used at every stage. After all, new prospects\u00a0can slide into your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/marketing-funnel\">funnel<\/a> at any point. Or if they are entering in\u00a0at the top, you&#8217;ll need a way to keep them engaged and moving along through. So consider lead magnets to be offers that both <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/02\/22\/quick-lead-generation\">attract leads <\/a>to your funnel and keep them there.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/lead-magnet-ideas-full-marketing-funnel-1.png\" alt=\"marketing funnel for lead magnets\" width=\"300\" height=\"347\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Some of the core categories of lead magnets include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Educational materials<\/li>\n<li>Proprietary data<\/li>\n<li>Prize-based incentives<\/li>\n<li>Time-sensitive information<\/li>\n<li>Free consultations and trials<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As you can see, lead magnets can come in all sorts of flavors, and as marketers, it\u2019s our job to pick the right type to attract, engage, and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/04\/nurture-marketing\">convert our prospects<\/a>. So let&#8217;s look at some examples and ideas.<\/p>\n<h2>Quick note on these lead magnet ideas<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve categorized the ideas by stage of funnel, but I also know that every business has a different funnel and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/11\/21\/customer-journey-mapping\">customer journey,<\/a> so adapt these ideas accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>Also, many of the\u00a0content-based\u00a0lead magnets are versatile. For example, a downloadable checklist could be used at the top of the funnel (wedding planning checklist) and in the middle (questions to ask before choosing a wedding planner).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/blog-posts-content-marketing-funnel-example.png\" alt=\"blog posts across the content marketing funnel\" width=\"636\" height=\"515\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-63250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/blog-posts-content-marketing-funnel-example.png 636w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/blog-posts-content-marketing-funnel-example-480x389.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 636px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/01\/content-marketing-funnel\"><em>Learn more in our post on the content marketing funnel.<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The image below is top-of-funnel checklist from a process management software company: &#8220;Effective Onboarding in 31 Steps.&#8221; A mid-funnel checklist for this same company might be something like &#8220;10 Features to Look for in an SOP Automation Software Provider.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/lead-magnet-ideas-top-funnel-onboardiing-checklist-1.png\" alt=\"lead magnet example\u2014free checkliist\" width=\"300\" height=\"773\" \/><\/div>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">Top-of-funnel lead magnet ideas<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Lead magnets are the most fun at the top of the funnel. This gives you the most <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/12\/marketing-ideas\">creative<\/a> leeway to come up with fun ideas to entice your target audience while showing off a fun side of your brand.<\/p>\n<p>These lead magnets can be topically broad compared to your product or service\u2014but related in some sense. Remember, this is the awareness stage of your funnel. Your prospects may not even know you exist!<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll definitely want to put these leads through a nurture flow so that the ones that reach sales reps have <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/30\/commercial-intent-keywords\">intent<\/a> to buy.<\/p>\n<p>For\u00a0top-of-funnel lead magnets, you don\u2019t need a form requiring\u00a0details. Just first name, last name, and email will do. Make sure that each lead magnet is properly tagged with a lead source so you can track the ROI down the road.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Giveaways<\/h3>\n<p>First up, giveaways. There is plenty of finesse that goes into planning and executing a giveaway, but we won\u2019t go into all that here. What you need to know is that giveaways are great lead magnets!<\/p>\n<p>Get your prospects in the door with a variety of giveaway options, from free NBA tickets to a discounted annual subscription to your product. Keep in mind that the quality of your leads will vary depending on how relevant your offering is to your product or service.<\/p>\n<p>While <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/11\/instagram-giveaways\">Instagram giveaways<\/a> are a great way to expand your reach and brand awareness, you&#8217;re not going to get any leads\u00a0unless you have entrants DM you with their email addresses. Instead, create a landing page on your website for the giveaway, and then share that link in your social media posts.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/lead-magnet-ideas-giveaway-1.png\" alt=\"landing page for a giveaway, as a top of funnel lead magnet example\" width=\"450\" height=\"480\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>2. Face-to-face field marketing<\/h3>\n<p>Field marketers interact directly with potential customers, such as at trade shows, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/25\/networking-strategies\">networking <\/a>events, and conferences. They employ a mix of sales and marketing expertise to educate, inform, and persuade prospects to engage with your brand. Have your field marketers collect emails to keep in touch! You&#8217;re not likely to get a high volume of leads in this manner, but the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/08\/lead-quality\">quality of the leads<\/a> will be excellent.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Influencer collaborations<\/h3>\n<p>Seems like everyone and their mom is trying to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/23\/how-to-become-a-social-media-influencer\">be an influencer<\/a> these days. Who can blame them, with all the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/11\/advertising-on-tiktok\">TikTok<\/a> and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/20\/youtube-marketing\">YouTube<\/a> fame being tossed around? This is the perfect time to test out <a href=\"https:\/\/influencers.heepsy.com\/instagram-influencers\/\">lead generation through micro-influencers<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/06\/21\/social-media-influence\">Find an influencer in your niche<\/a>, sponsor a couple posts, and collect your leads. Remember to tag them properly, especially if you choose to pay influencers on a commission or per-lead basis.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Blog post downloads<\/h3>\n<p>Visitors coming to your blog are most likely in the awareness and information-gathering stage, so focus on free and easy offers here. Free and easy for you too! Simply offer\u00a0to send the post (or an abridged version) to their inbox so they can read later. All they need to do is fill out their email address.

Whoah.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">Mid-funnel lead magnet ideas<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Okay, this is when lead magnets get a little more serious. Prospects entering into the middle of your funnel are aware of and interested in your business.\u00a0Mid-funnel lead magnets should be at least slightly related to your product or brand, but if you&#8217;re at the mid-to-top level, you can still\u00a0dance around it a little bit more.<\/p>\n<p>For mid-funnel lead magnets, you may want to ask for more information than just email address.\u00a0This may include name, company name, email, and whatever qualifiers will help you. For example, I like to ask my prospects to select with compliance framework they are interested in. This informs the content I send their way down the line and helps my sales team pitch more accurately.<\/p>\n<p>And make sure you continue nurturing these leads!\u00a0Your sales team might be eager to get on the phone with these more <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/08\/lead-quality\">qualified leads<\/a>, but tag them\u00a0and place them into a nurture stream where they belong. Don\u2019t scare them off with heavy-handed sales tactics.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Webinars<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/05\/webinar-marketing\">Webinars<\/a> are all the rage these days. I\u2019m a big fan of virtual lunch-and-learns, particularly featuring how-tos or trending topics. Even better, any webinar can be recorded and reused, or emailed out as part of a nurture campaign.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/top-of-funnel-lead-magnet-ideas-website-pop-up-1.png\" alt=\"top-of-funnel lead magnet ideas\u2014webinar popup\" width=\"720\" height=\"477\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If you\u2019re <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/03\/marketing-webinars\">hosting a webinar<\/a>, make sure to ask your participants what questions they\u2019d like answered during the session&#8211;you can glean more engagement and information from leads that way.<\/p>\n<h3>11. Checklists<\/h3>\n<p>If your product helps streamline a solution or gives your team intimate knowledge into a niche process, checklists give you a high-level, low-effort way to share that know-how. Hot tip: downloadable checklists typically perform well in Google ad campaigns.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/middle-of-funnel-lead-magnet-ideas-checklist-2-1.png\" alt=\"middle-of-funnel lead magnet ideas\u2014checklist\" width=\"720\" height=\"308\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>12. Free templates<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019m a sucker for resume templates. I can\u2019t help it; every time I am editing a resume, I need to find a new design. And as a result, a crazy amount of companies hawking resume templates have my email address.<\/p>\n<p>Offer a template for something that you would consider yourself an expert on. For example, how to design a project management flow. Or a notion.io content marketing calendar (I\u2019m in the market for one!).<\/p>\n<p>Templates are more mid-funnel compared to examples, since the prospect is not just looking for ideas anymore, but ready to put pen to paper and get down to it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>More mid-funnel lead magnet ideas<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>13. Original data reports<\/p>\n<p>14.\u00a0Product comparisons<\/p>\n<p>15.\u00a0Email courses<\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">Bottom-of-funnel lead magnet ideas<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>These lead magnet ideas are for the cream-of-the-crop prospects. They might already know your brand and trust your content. This is the opportunity to show that your product is right for them.<\/p>\n<h3>16. Case studies<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/03\/how-to-write-a-case-study\">Case studies<\/a> can be a snoozefest. It\u2019s easy to go wrong with these, but if you add a little extra \u2018oomph\u2019 to the content, you could have a great download on your hands.<\/p>\n<p>While most companies will share a case study with a title like, \u201cX company helped Y company increase revenue by 50%! See how we did it.\u201d And there is nothing wrong with that. But if you take the time to insert actionable data and insights into your case study, it\u2019ll make it worth an email submission.<\/p>\n<h3>17. Product picker<\/h3>\n<p>This might be my favorite type of lead magnet. I know, you probably thought I was going to say whitepapers were my bread-and-butter but WHEW. I love quizzes.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/bottom-of-funnel-lead-magnet-ideas-quiz-1.png\" alt=\"bottom-of-funnel lead magnet ideas\u2014quiz\" width=\"720\" height=\"391\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Why are they so great? It\u2019s the best time to show off your authority on a niche topic in an engaging way. This is great for leads who are ready to buy, but don&#8217;t know what exactly they want. My company, Laika, has a quiz to see which compliance framework is right for your business.<\/p>\n<h3>18. Partner referral discounts<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll likely need to get any type of discount cleared with your department heads and sales teams. But discounts are powerful hooks; everyone loves to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/11\/facebook-ab-testing\">save money<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I recommend reaching out to your partners to let them know that anyone who submits their information with a specific code or through a certain page will receive a percent off the purchase of your product.<\/p>\n<p>You can also do this with customers who have had a good experience! <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/06\/referral-marketing\">Referrals<\/a> are like <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">good reviews<\/a>, they hold a lot of weight with prospects doing investigation into a new company.<\/p>\n<h3>19. Event tickets<\/h3>\n<p>Everyone loves free stuff. I had some coworkers who created email addresses specifically to enter contests to win concert tickets. While I hope your prospects won\u2019t do the same, you could\u00a0run a promotion where those who sign up for a free demo\u00a0or consultation will be entered into a random drawing for\u00a0free tickets to a conference.<\/p>\n<p>You decide the\u00a0event, and let the leads pour in.<\/p>\n<h3>20. Early access<\/h3>\n<p>Releasing a new feature? <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/11\/25\/copy-testing\">Testing new copy<\/a> or UX? Advertise it to prospects. You can learn about their behaviors while shaping your offering to their exact tastes.<\/p>\n<p>Plenty of mobile games and apps already utilize beta versions and early access. If you offer an app in the Google Play Store or the Apple Store, you can enter it onto a list for users to access in beta. Even Disneyland has extended early hours for visitors to get early access to the rides!<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/bottom-of-funnel-lead-magnet-ideas-early-access-1.png\" alt=\"bottom-of-funnel lead magnet ideas\u2014early access invitation\" width=\"720\" height=\"556\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>21.
