Some social platforms will imitate or partner with it<\/h3>\n<p>Six-year-old TikTok is one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/11\/most-popular-social-media-platforms\">most popular social media platforms<\/a> in the world with more than one billion monthly active users. It\u2019s especially popular with consumers born between 1997 and 2012, who are collectively known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/09\/gen-z-stats\">Gen Z<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As this generation grows in spending power, other social platforms are scrambling to keep up\u2014and to stay relevant.<\/p>\n<p>Their most likely tactic in 2023 is imitation.<\/p>\n<p>For her part, Tetiana Sira, senior digital marketing executive at <a href=\"http:\/\/energycasino.com\/\">Energy Casino<\/a>, noted social media platforms have already responded by either copying TikTok outright, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/16\/tiktok-vs-instagram-reels-ads\">Instagram with Reels<\/a>, or by implementing more vertical videos, like Pinterest and Twitter.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/2023-digital-marketing-trends-pinterest-tiktok.png\" alt=\"2023 digital marketing trends - pinterest becoming more tiktok-like\" width=\"720\" height=\"457\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69693 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/2023-digital-marketing-trends-pinterest-tiktok.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/2023-digital-marketing-trends-pinterest-tiktok-480x305.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/20\/pinterest-gets-more-tiktok-like-with-a-watch-tab-for-videos-announces-20m-in-creator-rewards\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere&#8217;s clearly a much higher effort put into video consumption and trying to make it as seamless as possible,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Shahnawaz Sadique, a blogger at <a href=\"https:\/\/commonstupidman.com\/\">CommonStupidMan.com<\/a>, however, noted social platforms may also partner with TikTok to gain access to its content and users\u2014or even acquire TikTok or similar platforms outright.<\/p>\n<p>But, according to Carly Campbell, a blogger at <a href=\"https:\/\/mommyonpurpose.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mommy On Purpose<\/a>, there\u2019s more to TikTok\u2019s success than just short-form videos. It also has an easy-to-navigate interface and \u201cintense focus\u201d on user-generated content. These elements have helped the platform stand out and allowed it to create an engaged community.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTo effectively challenge TikTok, other social platforms will need to mimic the same user experience that has made it so popular,\u201d she added.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Others will distinguish themselves<\/h3>\n<p>That being said, there are several ways social platforms could also distinguish themselves from TikTok in 2023.<\/p>\n<p>One is by focusing on other types of content, such as long-form videos or live streaming, Sadique said.<\/p>\n<p>Another is investing in AI to improve video capabilities and generate more engaging content, added Jessica Shee, manager at <a href=\"https:\/\/iboysoft.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">iBoysoft<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Campbell pointed to Snapchat, which is focusing on messaging.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSimilarly, Facebook is focusing heavily on its gaming and group features, which can also be seen as a way to set itself apart,\u201d she added.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, Averi Melcher, owner of <a href=\"http:\/\/averimelcher.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OSO Content<\/a>, said platforms may re-evaluate their creator monetization strategies to better compete with the TikTok Creator Fund, which compensates users who generate <em>at least 100,000 authentic video views monthly,<\/em> to encourage creators to stay on their platforms as well.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are seeing this with Instagram subscriptions, Facebook Reels, Pinterest&#8217;s beta program, and YouTube Shorts,\u201d Melcher said. \u201cIf these platforms are able to incentivize and better reward creators, I think they will successfully gain back some market share.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/digital-marketing-trends-2023-instagram-subscriptions.png\" alt=\"2023 digital marketing trends - instagram subscribe feature\" width=\"230\" height=\"458\" class=\" wp-image-69689 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/digital-marketing-trends-2023-instagram-subscriptions.png 450w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/digital-marketing-trends-2023-instagram-subscriptions-151x300.png 151w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/creators.instagram.com\/earn-money\/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>In addition, Melcher said it\u2019s possible social platforms may improve their creator campaign attribution models or even build out native communities to connect people with brands\u2014and therefore better ways to monetize their content.<br \/>\n<a id=\"ai\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Will AI content generation help or hurt content marketing?<\/h2>\n<p>If you have a finely tuned <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/01\/content-marketing-funnel\">content marketing funnel<\/a>, you&#8217;ll want to tune into the perspectives on this 2023 digital marketing trend.<\/p>\n<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\ud83d\udce3 <strong>Free guide<\/strong> &gt;&gt; <\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite30BestWaysToPromote.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Marketing_The30BestWaysToPromoteYourBusiness_Download\" class=\"waffle-rich-text-link\">The 30 Best Ways to Promote Your Business (With or Without Money)<\/a><\/strong><span><\/div><\/div><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>3.

More transparent data practices<\/h3>\n<p>Meanwhile, privacy-friendly reporting dictates marketers must embrace a more transparent approach to data in which users give explicit consent\u2014and, as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.homegrounds.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Home Grounds<\/a> CEO Alex Mastin noted, they must strike the right balance between personalization and privacy.<\/p>\n<p>To do so, marketers must clearly communicate their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/11\/22\/customer-data-privacy\">privacy practices<\/a> to clients and stakeholders and be transparent about the data they are collecting and how it is being used.<\/p>\n<p>They should also use consent management systems and provide clear opt-outs.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/2023-digital-marketing-trends-consent-management.png\" alt=\"2023 digital marketing trends - consent management\" width=\"720\" height=\"317\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69697 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/2023-digital-marketing-trends-consent-management.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/2023-digital-marketing-trends-consent-management-480x211.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>12.
