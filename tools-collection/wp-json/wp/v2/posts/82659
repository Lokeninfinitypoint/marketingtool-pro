It analyzes thousands of signals to determine which videos belong on your FYP. Let\u2019s look at a few of the most influential ranking factors.<\/p>\n<h3>Factors TikTok uses to rank content<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019ll probably never know what every <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/tiktok-ads-bidding\">TikTok<\/a> ranking factor is, but thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.tiktok.com\/en-us\/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this post from TikTok<\/a> itself, we do have an idea of a few ranking categories.<\/p>\n<h4>User interactions<\/h4>\n<p>Your behavior in the TikTok app is the most influential signal for the algorithm. Whenever you like a video or follow a particular account, TikTok uses that to understand your preferences further.<\/p>\n<p>These are some of the user interaction signals TikTok will track:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Watching full videos<\/li>\n<li>Following or hiding accounts<\/li>\n<li>Liking or sharing videos<\/li>\n<li>Commenting<\/li>\n<li>Reporting a video as inappropriate<\/li>\n<li>Adding videos to favorites<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>TikTok also uses what you say you are and aren\u2019t interested in when you first join the app to guide its suggestions.<\/p>\n<p>Other users\u2019 interactions on a video can also determine whether you get it on your feed. If many people who share your interests watch and like a post, there\u2019s a bigger chance you\u2019ll see it, too.<\/p>\n<h4>Video information<\/h4>\n<p>On the flip side of the equation, TikTok reviews certain characteristics of the videos you\u2019ve interacted with to see how they match your preferences. That\u2019s important for creators to know since these are the things we have the most control over.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few of the video and post characteristics the algorithm looks for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hashtags<\/li>\n<li>Sounds<\/li>\n<li>Captions<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I\u2019ll go into how to optimize your videos for <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/tiktok-marketing-for-small-businesses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TikTok marketing<\/a> using these characteristics in a bit.<\/p>\n<h4>Device and settings<\/h4>\n<p>Device and settings are also user-specific actions the algorithm uses to recommend content. If you\u2019re registered as a US user, you\u2019ll see a lot more content made in the USA. But unlike user interactions, these are one-time signals that don\u2019t typically change over time.<\/p>\n<p>A few device and setting signals that may nudge the TikTok algorithm include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Language setting<\/li>\n<li>Country setting<\/li>\n<li>Device type<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>TikTok factor weighting<\/h4>\n<p>TikTok\u2019s algorithm weights ranking factors based on how directly they indicate viewer preferences. Direct user actions, like watching a full video, carry much more influence than geographic location.<\/p>\n<p>This means that while it\u2019s good to be aware of all the ranking factors, your focus should be on posting content that your audience will want to watch and share.<\/p>\n<h3>Factors that don\u2019t help (and could hurt) your content ranking<\/h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.tiktok.com\/en-us\/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">its post<\/a>, TikTok says it won\u2019t give creators a boost based on past performance. Someone with a high follower count and previously viral videos won\u2019t get preferential rankings over a smaller account with more relevant content.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, there are some types of content that TikTok will de-rank (show less or not at all) in your FYP. These include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Videos you\u2019ve already seen<\/li>\n<li>Content that\u2019s considered spam<\/li>\n<li>Duplicated content (like a second post of the same video)<\/li>\n<li>Videos with restricted content (like graphic medical procedures)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To be clear, some of this content will still be available if you search for it. It just won\u2019t pop on your FYP.<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-do-you-reset-the-tiktok-algorithm\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to reset the TikTok algorithm<\/h2>\n<p>TikTok\u2019s algorithm finds the type of content you\u2019ll love based mainly on what you\u2019ve enjoyed in the past.

The other half is publishing <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/engaging-posts-on-social-media\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">engaging content<\/a> that makes it easy for TikTok to find, categorize, and suggest your posts.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Hook viewers quickly<\/h3>\n<p>You have a fleeting second or two to grab a viewer\u2019s attention and convince them to watch your video. Keep their thumbs from scrolling by adding an attention-grabbing hook that\u2019s relevant to your audience.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-hook.webp\" alt=\"Tiktok algorithm - Tiktok with a hook in the video cover.\" width=\"383\" height=\"582\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82663 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-hook.webp 383w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-hook-197x300.webp 197w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A great hook should give the viewer just enough information to make them want more. Try these tactics for your video hooks:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make a bold claim<\/li>\n<li>Ask a question<\/li>\n<li>Share a surprising fact<\/li>\n<li>Hint at a secret<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Make sure each hook is relevant to your audience, and use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/03\/emotional-marketing-copy\">emotional words<\/a> to catch their attention.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Create niche content<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to gain footing with very popular topics on TikTok since many creators are already fighting for precious FYP placement. However, you can use the algorithm to your benefit by finding <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/28\/niche-marketing\">niche<\/a> topics to post about.<\/p>\n<p>For example, cooking is a super popular topic on TikTok. There are plenty of accounts dedicated to whipping up the best dishes. But Bobby Hicks of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@retrorecipeskitchen?lang=en-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@theretrorecipekitchen<\/a> uses his account to trial dishes from days of old. Many of the recipes he tests look tasty, while others look like\u2026a veggie gelatin stack?<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-niche.webp\" alt=\"Tiktok algorithm - Screenshot of a TikTok recipe video.\" width=\"414\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82664 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-niche.webp 414w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-niche-207x300.webp 207w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It may seem a little odd, but by focusing on one corner of a popular topic, Hicks has grown his account to over 150k followers.<\/p>\n<p>Review the topics you\u2019d like to use, and if they seem a little crowded, find a subtopic your audience would appreciate. That\u2019ll leave you with fewer competitors in the race for the FYP. It\u2019ll also make your content more relevant to a specific audience, which the algorithm loves.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Use TikTok SEO<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/seo\">Search engine optimization<\/a> isn\u2019t just for Google. Pretty much any time there\u2019s a search function, you can optimize your content for it, and TikTok is no exception. Plus, even <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/07\/12\/google-exec-suggests-instagram-and-tiktok-are-eating-into-googles-core-products-search-and-maps\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google admits<\/a> that TikTok is becoming a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-competitors\">popular search engine<\/a> in its own right.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the other tips in this guide, you\u2019ll want to use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/articles\/keyword-research-for-social-media-guide\">keyword research<\/a> to boost your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/tiktok-seo\">TikTok SEO<\/a>. Like on search engines, people use specific words and phrases in the search bar to find content on the app. Your job is to figure out what those words are.<\/p>\n<p>Keyword research is easy on TikTok. Make a list of things your audience might search for that are relevant to your business. If you\u2019re an esthetician, \u201cskin care\u201d might be one of them. Then, enter those words into the TikTok search bar and see what it auto-fills.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-keywords.webp\" alt=\"Tiktok algorithm - TikTok search bar with autofill.\" width=\"579\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82665 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-keywords.webp 579w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-keywords-480x497.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 579px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll see options like \u201cskin care for men\u201d and \u201cskin care routine.\u201d Once you\u2019ve gathered a list of keywords, plan out your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-calendar\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content calendar<\/a> to cover each term. Don\u2019t forget to add keywords to your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/tiktok-bio-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TikTok bio<\/a>, too.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Tailor content to the platform<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s smart to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/03\/repurposing-content#:~:text=Repurposing%20content%20(aka%20finding%20new,Some%20choose%20podcasts%20over%20ebooks.\">repurpose content<\/a> for multiple platforms. But when it\u2019s time to post it on TikTok, make sure it fits the app\u2019s best practices.<\/p>\n<p>First, produce and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-edit-tiktok-videos\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">edit<\/a> full-screen, vertical videos with a 9:16 ratio. That will fill the entire mobile screen while matching how most people view TikTok content.<\/p>\n<p>Second, keep most of your videos short. While there\u2019s no ideal duration for every video, in 2021, TikTok suggested that the optimal length should be <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stokel\/status\/1459171303227904000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">24 to 31 seconds<\/a>. The platform has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/tiktok-wants-longer-videos-like-not\/?utm_brand=wired-uk&amp;utm_campaign=onsite-share&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_social-type=earned&amp;utm_source=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pushed for longer content<\/a>, but many viewers find videos longer than one minute to be stressful, so it&#8217;s safer to keep them under 60 seconds.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, for the best chance of your TikTok videos going viral, keep them positive in tone. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/blog\/hooks-of-viral-tiktoks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Semrush evaluated<\/a> a large collection of viral TikTok videos and found that those with a positive, funny, or happy vibe did best.<\/p>\n<p>Follow these best practices to get more early engagement, which the algorithm will use as a signal that your video belongs on more FYPs.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Post at the right time and frequency<\/h3>\n<p>The TikTok algorithm doesn\u2019t really care what time or how often you post\u2014at least not directly. But it does look at how much engagement an individual video gets. Knowing when and how frequently to post can give your videos a little engagement boost.<\/p>\n<h4>The right time<\/h4>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/09\/best-time-to-post-on-tiktok\">best time to post on TikTok<\/a> depends on when most of your audience will be on the app. The goal is to publish content a little before the peak potential viewing time to get them indexed and ready for your followers.<\/p>\n<p>You can find that information in your TikTok analytics.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-when-to-post.webp\" alt=\"Tiktok algorithm - Graph shown when an audience is on TikTok.\" width=\"821\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82666 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-when-to-post.webp 821w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-when-to-post-480x351.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 821px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>The right frequency<\/h4>\n<p>Consistency is essential for success on any <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/11\/most-popular-social-media-platforms\">social media platform<\/a>. You don\u2019t want followers to forget about you, and you want more chances to reach new viewers. But how do you quantify \u201cconsistency?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Just like timing, learning <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/20\/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok\">how often you should post on TikTok<\/a> will take some trial and error. TikTok says you should post up to four times per day (of course they do). More realistically, most brands post content to TikTok around two to four times per week (depending on which study you follow).<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few tips to find your perfect TikTok schedule:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Consider your creative capacity:<\/strong> Posting more often is great, but not at the expense of quality.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Review other creators:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/competitors-ads\">Spy on your competition<\/a> to see how often successful accounts in your niche post content.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Watch your analytics:<\/strong> Vary your posting frequency over several weeks and see how it affects your views and engagement.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>6. Incorporate hashtags<\/h3>\n<p>Using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/04\/07\/tiktok-hashtags\">hashtags on TikTok<\/a> can help you succeed in two ways. First, hashtags help the TikTok algorithm understand your content so it can better match it to user preferences.<\/p>\n<p>Second, TikTok users use hashtags to search for content, so when your video is tagged, it may show up in their search. As we know, when more people see your content, the algorithm will show it to more people with similar interests.<\/p>\n<p>You can find which hashtags are trending in TikTok\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/login?redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2Fcreator-center&amp;enter_method=redirect&amp;enter_from=creator-center\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Creative Center<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-hashtags.webp\" alt=\"TikTok algorithm - TikTok's Creative Center.\" width=\"881\" height=\"478\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82667 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-hashtags.webp 881w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-hashtags-480x260.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 881px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here are a few tips for using hashtags on TikTok:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t use too many:<\/strong> One to four hashtags will usually do the trick without making your post look spammy.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use different types:<\/strong> Combine branded, topical, popular, and niche hashtags for the best mix of reach and relevance.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Include seasonal and holiday hashtags:<\/strong> Adding <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/holiday-hashtags-instagram-post-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">seasonal hashtags<\/a> like #hellospring and #Holloweenscares lets you ride the wave of attention during peak times of the year.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>7. Add popular audio clips<\/h3>\n<p>Audio clips work similarly to hashtags on TikTok. If an audio clip gets popular, and you like videos that use that clip, there\u2019s a greater chance you\u2019ll get more videos with that audio in your FYP.<\/p>\n<p>Head back to the Creative Center to find trending songs.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-audio.webp\" alt=\"TikTok algorithem - TikTok's Creative Center.\" width=\"870\" height=\"470\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82668 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-audio.webp 870w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-audio-480x259.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 870px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Look in the Popular tab to see which tunes are already getting a lot of play. Then, check out the Breakout tab to catch the next audio wave early.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Add captions<\/h3>\n<p>Many people don&#8217;t watch videos with the sound on. Adding captions to your posts lets those people follow along. But captions don\u2019t just help you appeal to a broader audience. TikTok\u2019s algorithm can learn more about your videos from the text of its caption.<\/p>\n<p>TikTok makes it easy to add captions. Tap the Captions icon, and the app will automatically generate them.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-.webp\" alt=\"TikTok algorithem - TikTok's caption manager.\" width=\"318\" height=\"568\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82669 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-.webp 318w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream--168x300.webp 168w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Make sure you use the keywords you dug up in your video script. The algorithm will read those in the captions and know who should see your videos.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Jump on trends<\/h3>\n<p>One of the best ways to leverage the algorithm to get views is by following <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/14\/tiktok-trend-discovery\">TikTok trends<\/a>. A trend is a theme, idea, or trait of a video that already has mass appeal. That might be a common song or a dance.<\/p>\n<p>Trends can also be challenges, like this one where one person holds another so they look like they\u2019re in the iconic scene from the movie Titanic.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-trends.webp\" alt=\"TikTok algorithem - Screenshot of a TikTok video showing the Titanic trend.\" width=\"356\" height=\"578\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82670 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-trends.webp 356w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-trends-185x300.webp 185w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When viewers get hooked on a trend, TikTok sends them more videos to view. If you&#8217;ve jumped on the trend, the algorithm will put your video in that mix.<\/p>\n<h2>Work with the TikTok algorithm to go viral<\/h2>\n<p>The trick to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/social-media-marketing\">social media marketing<\/a> is remembering that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/facebook-algorithm\">social platform algorithms<\/a> want you to succeed. If people love the content you post, they\u2019ll spend more time on the app\u2014which is a win-win for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>The key is learning how the TikTok algorithm (and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/instagram-algorithm\">Instagram algorithm<\/a>, for that matter) works to make it your partner in success. Instead of fighting against the algorithm, find ways to leverage it, and you\u2019ll leap-frog ahead of all the accounts trying to trick or hack it. And of course, consider using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/tiktok-ads-bidding\">TikTok ads<\/a> to bypass the algorithm altogether.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a recap of nine ways you can use TikTok\u2019s algorithm to your advantage:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Hook viewers quickly<\/li>\n<li>Create niche content<\/li>\n<li>Use TikTok SEO<\/li>\n<li>Tailor content to the platform<\/li>\n<li>Post at the right time and frequency<\/li>\n<li>Incorporate hashtags<\/li>\n<li>Add popular audio clips<\/li>\n<li>Add captions<\/li>\n<li>Jump on trends<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learn how to use the TikTok algorithm to your advantage so your videos get more views and
