Use the right keywords in the right places<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/youtube-seo\">Optimizing your YouTube channel<\/a> and videos for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/30\/seo-basics\">SEO<\/a> is a non-negotiable tactic if you want viewers to find them. It\u2019s free, completely scalable, and, if you do it effectively, can have massive implications for your visibility and reach.<\/p>\n<p>Just like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-seo-guide\">Google SEO<\/a>, you want to start by conducting some thorough <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">keyword research<\/a> to find keywords relevant to your niche, products, and services. Tools like Google Keyword Planner, Ahrefs, Moz, SEMrush, and WordStream\u2019s own <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a> are all great tools to help here.<\/p>\n<p>Another tactic to consider here is entering some queries related to your topic into YouTube\u2019s search bar. Autocomplete will give you a good idea of what people are searching for and how to optimize your video for relevant keywords.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-youtube-search.webp\" alt=\"How to promote your YouTube channel - screenshot of YouTube search.\" width=\"882\" height=\"529\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86079 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-youtube-search.webp 882w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-youtube-search-480x288.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 882px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Create a list of relevant keywords for your business. Then, identify the keywords on the list with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/23\/keyword-search-volume\">high search volume<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>From there, you\u2019ll want to work these keywords strategically (and naturally!) into your videos\u2019 <strong>titles, descriptions, and tags<\/strong> to improve your search rankings.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 <strong>Want more?<\/strong> Download <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/big-easy-guide-to-kw-research?cid=Web_Any_Homepage_PPC_BigEasyKeyword_Download\">The Big Easy Guide to Keyword Research for Businesses<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"boost-ctr-with-engaging-titles-and-thumbnails\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Boost CTR with engaging titles and thumbnails<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/click-through-rate\">Click-through rate<\/a> (CTR) will also have a huge impact on your search rankings. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/15\/youtube-algorithm\">YouTube\u2019s algorithm<\/a> automatically gives preference to videos that users engage with more frequently. If you want to increase your CTR, you <strong>need <\/strong>to make sure your titles are engaging, informative, and clickable, and include your primary keyword.<\/p>\n<p>Showing people how to bake a cake? Don\u2019t make your title &#8220;How to Bake a Cake.&#8221; Make it &#8220;Here\u2019s How to Bake the Most Delicious Chocolate Cake You\u2019ve Ever Tasted.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Finally, consider the impact that a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/07\/youtube-thumbnail\">super appealing thumbnail<\/a> can have on CTR. Thumbnails are typically the first visual impression users have of your video. Don\u2019t make them bland. Use bright colors, readable text, and compelling, high-definition images that accurately represent your content, and you\u2019ll be sure to increase click-through rate and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-rank-for-a-keyword\">search rankings<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"develop-a-consistent-content-schedule\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Develop a consistent content schedule<\/h3>\n<p>Like so many things in life, shooting for perfection when creating YouTube videos is the kiss of death. You never want to pump out mediocre content just for the sake of consistency, but you need to play the volume game.<\/p>\n<p>Focus on quality above all, but once you\u2019ve nailed down a formula for engaging content, you need to develop a consistent posting cadence. This will keep the flywheel of engagement spinning, keep your subscribers engaged, and keep your audience ever-growing.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-schedule.webp\" alt=\"How to promote your YouTube channel - YouTube's scheduling dashboard.\" width=\"558\" height=\"590\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86081 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-schedule.webp 558w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-schedule-480x508.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 558px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Leveraging YouTube\u2019s scheduling feature is a great way to keep the flywheel spinning.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Start by determining a realistic schedule you can adhere to (whether it&#8217;s multiple times per week, weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly). Consistency is the name of the game, so choose a schedule that fits your capacity to create quality content without burnout. Communicate this schedule to your audience by mentioning it in your videos, channel description, and across your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/social-media-marketing\">social platforms<\/a>. This level of transparency sets expectations and builds anticipation.<\/p>\n<div id=\"post-content-in-advance-and-at-the-right-times\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Post content in advance and at the right times<\/h3>\n<p>Want to streamline? Try batch filming and scheduling your videos in advance to ensure you always have the content in reserve ready to deploy. Tools like YouTube&#8217;s scheduling feature, pictured above, can help you do just that.<\/p>\n<p>Consistency is one thing, but what about timeliness? Like any social platform, the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/08\/best-time-to-post-on-youtube\"> time of day and week you post to YouTube<\/a> significantly impacts your video&#8217;s performance.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/image7.webp\" alt=\"How to promote your YouTube channel - Graphic of the best times to post on YouTube.\" width=\"936\" height=\"304\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86082 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/image7.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/image7-480x156.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here are some general insights:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Thursdays and Fridays:<\/strong> These are prime days to upload videos. Viewer engagement tends to increase towards the end of the workweek as people start looking for content to watch during their downtime.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Saturdays and Sundays:<\/strong> These days see high viewer activity. Posting in the morning (between 9 and 11 AM) can capture viewers who are relaxing and have more time to watch videos.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Weekday evenings (5 PM to 9 PM):<\/strong> During the week, viewers are more active during the evening after work or school. Posting during this time can increase the likelihood of your video being seen soon after it&#8217;s published.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>When in doubt, leverage <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/20\/youtube-studio-reports\">YouTube\u2019s Analytics and reporting suite<\/a>, specifically the &#8220;When your viewers are on YouTube&#8221; report, to understand when your specific audience is most active.<\/p>\n<div id=\"engage-with-your-audience\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Engage with your audience<\/h3>\n<p>Alright, so now you\u2019ve optimized your videos for SEO. You\u2019ve developed a consistent and timely posting schedule. Job done, right?<\/p>\n<p>Not quite. Because while compelling content is great, engaging with your audience is really the cornerstone of building a successful YouTube channel. Nothing creates community, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/brand-loyalty\">fosters loyalty<\/a>, and encourages repeat engagement <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/how-to-get-subscribers-on-youtube\">among your subscribers<\/a> better than showing them that you are actively invested in the culture you are building around your YouTube channel.<\/p>\n<p>Start by responding to comments on your videos. Whether you answer questions, acknowledge feedback, or simply thank viewers for their input, engaging in the comment section shows that you value your audience&#8217;s opinions.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-reply.webp\" alt=\"How to promote your YouTube channel - Screenshot of YouTube replies.\" width=\"869\" height=\"505\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86083 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-reply.webp 869w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-reply-480x279.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 869px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This will inevitably lead to higher engagement rates, as viewers are way more likely to comment when they know they will receive a response.<\/p>\n<div id=\"leave-viewers-with-a-question-to-encourage-comments\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. Leave viewers with a question to encourage comments<\/h3>\n<p>Want more comments? Encourage viewers to leave them by asking questions or prompting discussions at the end of your videos. You can also utilize YouTube\u2019s Community Tab to post updates, polls, behind-the-scenes content, or even shout-outs to loyal subscribers. This is an excellent way to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/30\/social-media-engagement\">keep your channel active and engaging<\/a>, even when you&#8217;re not posting new videos.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/27\/youtube-live\">live streaming<\/a> is a great tool for real-time interaction. Hosting Q&amp;A sessions, live tutorials, or casual hangouts can significantly enhance your connection with viewers.<\/p>\n<div id=\"collaborate-with-like-minded-creators\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. Collaborate with like-minded creators<\/h3>\n<p>We know how it is. You put so much effort into your<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/15\/youtube-algorithm\"> YouTube videos<\/a> that you\u2019d like to believe they\u2019ll gain traction on their own merit. You want to believe what you say or offer is unique and compelling enough to post and promote in a vacuum and get all the engagement you\u2019ll ever need.<\/p>\n<p>Listen: self-reliance isn\u2019t a bad thing. But you\u2019re severely handicapping your growth if you think you\u2019ll max out your potential by going it alone.<\/p>\n<p>Collaborating with other creators is a fundamental part of growing any YouTube channel. When you partner with fellow YouTubers in your niche or who serve a similar audience, you immediately gain access to a completely new set of qualified potential subscribers and customers.<\/p>\n<p>Consider this partnership HelloFresh created with YouTube influencer Lee Williams.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-influencer.webp\" alt=\"How to promote your YouTube channel - Influencer video for HelloFresh.\" width=\"357\" height=\"586\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86084 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-influencer.webp 357w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-influencer-183x300.webp 183w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/youtube.com\/shorts\/_sDClBReMe0?si=lNC5i8-R6gM8S_0l\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>By soliciting Lee to do an unboxing of one of its subscription food deliveries, HelloFresh gained instantaneous access to her 155k+ subscriber base. They also gained credibility by being associated with Lee\u2019s lifestyle, which her audience loves. You don\u2019t necessarily have to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/21\/social-media-influencers\">partner with influencers<\/a>; you can simply partner with another brand or creator. But creating this kind of partnership can give you a similar level of unprecedented access to audience growth.<\/p>\n<div id=\"host-new-guests-and-get-featured-on-like-minded\"><\/div>\n<h3>8. Host new guests and get featured on like-minded channels<\/h3>\n<p>Want to increase your reach even more? Get featured on other channels! You need to expose yourself to new audiences as much as possible to buoy your growth, and making guest appearances on like-minded creators\u2019 channels is a surefire way to do just that. The same goes for featuring that guest on your channel.<\/p>\n<div id=\"leverage-email-marketing\"><\/div>\n<h3>9. Leverage email marketing<\/h3>\n<p>We know what you\u2019re thinking. What on earth does YouTube have to do with email? Aren\u2019t my other social platforms the best avenue to promote my videos?<\/p>\n<p>While you should absolutely be promoting your YouTube videos on Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), and the like, leveraging <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/01\/email-marketing-tips\">email marketing<\/a> is an equally powerful strategy to get engagement. Here&#8217;s a five-step primer on using email marketing to boost your channel&#8217;s visibility:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Build your list: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/11\/how-to-build-an-email-list\">Build an email list<\/a> of your subscribers and viewers who have opted in to receive updates from you.
