Worse, I need to find a new dentist. Long story short: I\u2019ve spent a lot of time looking through dentist websites over the last two weeks, and truth be told, I&#8217;d be lying if I denied being one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/16\/website-design-trends\">94%<\/a> of people whose first impression is design-related.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/website-examples-stats.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"404\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62789\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/website-examples-stats.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/website-examples-stats-480x269.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>While I\u2019ve been Googling ranking lists and skimming websites, I&#8217;ve noticed some of the same elements making me want to learn more about a practice. So here are 11 dentist website examples that you can use as inspiration or models for your own.<\/p>\n<p>You know the drill. (Too much?) Before we jump into the examples, let\u2019s talk about why a website is quite possibly the most important tool for your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/industries\/healthcare\/\">dentist marketing strategy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Why is your dentist website an important marketing tool?<\/h2>\n<p>Your website is an important <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/dental-marketing-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dental marketing<\/a> tool because it allows you to communicate your practice\u2019s offerings, ethos, and unique value proposition\u2014and it can even attract and convert potential new clients. According to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/new-survey-reveals-americans-choose-dentists-based-on-online-reviews-proximity-and-rank-in-the-search-results-300907676.html\">2019 survey<\/a>, most people choose a dentist office based on online reviews, proximity, and search engine rank.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/dentist-website-stats.png\" alt=\"survey results on why people pick dentists from results on google\" width=\"720\" height=\"381\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-63992\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/dentist-website-stats.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/dentist-website-stats-480x254.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Even though it&#8217;s not the top deciding factor, the appearance of a dentist&#8217;s website is still <em>a<\/em> deciding factor for people seeking out a dentist. Even more importantly, your website also plays a big role in your search engine rankings, and your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/17\/increase-online-presence\">online presence<\/a> contributes to the quality and quantity of your reviews.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, when you filter the data by age, the percentage of respondents who select the best-looking website increases to 6.7% for 18 to 34-year-olds, and this increases even more when you narrow in further to 18-24 year-olds. For younger people, the quality of your website becomes increasingly influential in their decision to make an appointment or not.<\/p>\n<p>The takeaway: Your website is an important tool for attracting new patients and converting word-of-mouth referrals to your dental practice\u2014one worth investing some time in to make sure you\u2019re getting the most out of it.<\/p>\n<h2>Dentist website examples<\/h2>\n<p>Now that we\u2019re clear on why your website is important for growing your dental practice, let\u2019s take a look at how you can improve it. Here are 11<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/14\/website-examples\"> awesome website examples<\/a> from real dentists so you can get ideas and inspiration. Brace yourself (had to) and let\u2019s go through them.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Tend<\/h3>\n<p>After I searched for dentist offices in Boston once or twice, I started getting targeted Instagram ads from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hellotend.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tend<\/a>. The ads were trendy and engaging, so of course I visited the dentist\u2019s website.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/dentist-website-example-tend.png\" alt=\"best dentist website examples - tend's homepage\" width=\"720\" height=\"361\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-63990\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/dentist-website-example-tend.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/dentist-website-example-tend-480x241.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The <strong>navigation is straightforward<\/strong> to new and existing patients alike, which communicates to me that Tend meets its promise to streamline visits to the dentist from the outset.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, the <strong>video on the homepage<\/strong> gives me a clear idea of what to expect with Tend. Finally, the Nantes font in muted tones, as well as the storefront pictured prominently in the hero section, are modern and inviting.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Dntl bar<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dntlbar.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dntl Bar <\/a>is another dentist office promising a newer, modern experience\u2014this time in NYC, and with a different focus for its website.<\/p>\n<p><em> <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/dentist-website-example-dntl-bar.png\" alt=\"best dentist website examples - dntl bar's homepage\" width=\"720\" height=\"364\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-63989\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/dentist-website-example-dntl-bar.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/dentist-website-example-dntl-bar-480x243.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/em><\/p>\n<p><em> <\/em><\/p>\n<p>Dntl bar has a<strong> clean, lux<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/03\/website-color-scheme\"> website color scheme<\/a><\/strong>\u2014cream, black, and a muted gold. The <strong>video in the hero section<\/strong> continues this color palette, including pops of green with the Perrier bottles and well-appointed office furnishings.<\/p>\n<p>Now, the sparkling water might seem like it has little to do with a dentist office (besides the fact that it might lead to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.colgate.com\/en-us\/oral-health\/tooth-sensitivity\/is-sparkling-water-bad-for-your-teeth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cavities<\/a>). But the video captures a patient walking into the office for a visit and grabbing a drink while filling out paperwork on a tablet. This showcases the patient-centered Dntl Bar experience that the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/21\/advertising-slogans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tagline<\/a> promises.<\/p>\n<h3><em> <\/em><br \/>\n3. The Smilist<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s crucial to have compelling design, but that\u2019s not the only thing you\u2019ll need to impress your patients. Take a look at this dentist website example from <a href=\"https:\/\/thesmilist.com\/smithtown-dentist\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Smilist<\/a> located in Smithtown, NY.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/dentist-website-example-smilist.png\" alt=\"best dentist website examples - the smilist\" width=\"720\" height=\"358\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-63987\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/dentist-website-example-smilist.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/dentist-website-example-smilist-480x239.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This hero section <strong>outlines the procedures and types of care<\/strong> that the office offers, which is an excellent choice: In 2019, over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dentaleconomics.com\/practice\/article\/16386253\/new-year-new-social-media-strategy-where-to-connect-with-patients-in-2019\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">64%<\/a> of people reported that they tried to self-diagnose before making an appointment.<\/p>\n<p>This suggests that plenty of your potential new patients are looking for specific services\u2014not just a cleaning, but a filling for a cavity or a consultation for periodontics. Having your services clearly outlined on your website makes it clear to these searchers that you can help them. (Plus, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/06\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells\">clear copy is copy that sells<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Also noteworthy: Like Tend, The Smilist Smithtown gives the <strong>option to book online or via phone<\/strong>, making it easy for your potential client to get in touch with you however they prefer. This ease of booking should be standard in dentist websites.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Smilebar<\/h3>\n<p>Your potential clients want to know what your current patients are saying. In fact,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.softwareadvice.com\/resources\/how-patients-use-online-reviews\/#1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> 71%<\/a> of people looking for a new dentist check online reviews to help them decide which practice to choose.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilebar.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Smilebar<\/a> knows this, so they <strong>feature<\/strong> <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/03\/testimonial-advertising\">customer testimonials<\/a> <\/strong>on their website.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/dentist-website-example-smilebar.png\" alt=\"best dentist website examples - the smilebar's website with a review\" width=\"720\" height=\"364\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-63994\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/dentist-website-example-smilebar.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/dentist-website-example-smilebar-480x243.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Putting the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">reviews<\/a> front and center so that anyone considering your practice sees them is an excellent call, especially when they can highlight a unique selling point for your practice.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Maine Dentistry<\/h3>\n<p>When you\u2019re highlighting your dentist office on your website, you want to feature your services, client reviews, and a quick, easy way to contact you.

Inspire answers your questions and quashes your concerns before you even have to consider scheduling an appointment\u2014making it clear you won\u2019t have to play phone tag (or pick up the phone at all) to get your next cleaning.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Pearl Dental NYC<\/h3>\n<p>So far, the dentist website examples have included sleek branding, warm videos, compelling copy, and easy contact methods. Lots of admin and people, not a lot of dentistry. I\u2019m not recommending including before and after pictures or anything like that. To be honest, teeth are kind of gross. Probably best to avoid photos on the homepage.<\/p>\n<p>But you do still want to <strong>make your services clear<\/strong>. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pearldentalnyc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pearl Dental NYC<\/a> does a great job of using <strong>graphics<\/strong> to represent its expertise (without including any real mouths).<\/p>\n<p>Take a look.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/dentist-website-example-pearl-white.png\" alt=\"best dentist website examples - pearl's homepage\" width=\"720\" height=\"358\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-63986\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/dentist-website-example-pearl-white.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/dentist-website-example-pearl-white-480x239.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In addition to graphics like the mouth model above, Pearl uses context clues in its photos to emphasize its biomimetic focus. For instance, the typical light, the headpiece, and the perspective of the dentist in the photo below.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/dentist-website-example-pearl.png\" alt=\"best dentist website examples - pearl\" width=\"720\" height=\"358\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-63995\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/dentist-website-example-pearl.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/dentist-website-example-pearl-480x239.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is a great way to highlight your practice\u2019s work and dental expertise without getting graphic.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Concord Dental Associates<\/h3>\n<p>Patient reviews are so important, but it\u2019s essential that the reviews are trustworthy as well as compelling. That\u2019s why it can be better to direct your website visitors to <strong>unsolicited, unbiased testimonials collected by an online review platform<\/strong> like Yelp or your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/16\/get-more-google-reviews\">Google Business Profile<\/a>. There\u2019s no denying that your patients are honest about their five-star experiences in that case.<\/p>\n<p>But you don\u2019t necessarily have to direct your potential patients away from your website. You can embed these reviews just like <a href=\"https:\/\/concorddentalgroup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Concord Dental Associates<\/a> does below.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/dentist-website-example-concord-dental-associates.png\" alt=\"best dentist website examples - concord dental associates' homepage\" width=\"720\" height=\"358\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-63991\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/dentist-website-example-concord-dental-associates.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/dentist-website-example-concord-dental-associates-480x239.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Two other things jump out at me here: A <strong>button to translate the page<\/strong> and the highlighted \u201cCOVID Safety.\u201d The translation option not only means that this dentist <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/15\/website-accessibility\">website is accessible<\/a>, but that Concord Dental Associates is, too. The fact that the COVID precautions are first in the nav bar and highlights tells me this practice knows its patients are conscientious. Both of these are encouraging for making an appointment.<\/p>\n<h3>11. Dental Care Seattle<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019ve gone through a lot of dentist website examples and identified the images, the designs, the buttons, and the reviews that work well. Something we haven\u2019t talked too much about? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/15\/website-copy\">Website copy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For dentist marketing, you want to ensure that your copy is accurate, but this doesn\u2019t mean it has to be boring or bland. One way to avoid that is using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/22\/power-words\">interesting power words<\/a> like these.<\/p>\n<p>Another way to avoid that is to <strong>stress the impact of your dental care<\/strong> or your practice\u2019s approach, or the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/21\/features-vs-benefits\">benefit instead of the feature<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dentalcareseattle.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dental Care Seattle<\/a> gets this right.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/dentist-website-example-dental-care-seattle.png\" alt=\"best dentist website examples - dental care seattle's homepage\" width=\"720\" height=\"358\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-63993\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/dentist-website-example-dental-care-seattle.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/dentist-website-example-dental-care-seattle-480x239.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Having exceptional teeth is more than a semi-annual cleaning and cavity check\u2014it\u2019s confidence-boosting.
