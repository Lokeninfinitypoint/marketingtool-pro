Keyword research is the best way to find new, relevant keywords to expand your paid and organic search marketing campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>Keyword research can be conducted through a variety of tools that we&#8217;ll discuss in more detail below, but the main goal is to find the right search terms that have intent aligned with your business\u2019s content and offerings, along with decent search volume.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to search volume, other keyword metrics may be helpful when conducting research and prioritizing which keywords to target, such as<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Cost-per-click (CPC)<\/li>\n<li>Competition (how difficult it is to rank for that keyword)<\/li>\n<li>Your own site authority.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Why is keyword research important?<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"\/keywords\" data-cke-saved-href=\"\/keywords\">Keywords<\/a> are the building blocks of not only\u00a0your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/17\/increase-online-presence\" data-cke-saved-href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/17\/increase-online-presence\">online presence<\/a>, but your business growth.\u00a0Businesses that cannot be found online will not succeed!\u00a0But Google processes over <a href=\"http:\/\/searchengineland.com\/google-now-handles-2-999-trillion-searches-per-year-250247\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http:\/\/searchengineland.com\/google-now-handles-2-999-trillion-searches-per-year-250247\">5.5 billion<\/a>\u00a0search queries each day. That&#8217;s a lot of keywords! But you can&#8217;t just target any keyword. You need to do your research to find the most fruitful ones for your business.<\/p>\n<p>If your content isn&#8217;t targeting the terms and topics your audience is interested in, it&#8217;s essentially useless. But there&#8217;s an art and science to it.<\/p>\n<p>If your keyword\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/23\/keyword-search-volume\" data-cke-saved-href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/23\/keyword-search-volume\">search volume<\/a> is too low, leads won\u2019t be able to discover your ads or organic listings, visit your website, and turn into paying customers.\u00a0\u00a0But if the keywords you\u2019re trying to rank for or bid on are <em><a href=\"\/popular-keywords\/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"\/popular-keywords\/\">too <\/a><\/em><a href=\"\/popular-keywords\/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"\/popular-keywords\/\">popular<\/a>, you might not get on the SERP at all\u00a0or end up overpaying for your ad clicks.<\/p>\n<p>Without the right balance of quality keywords, your search marketing campaigns (paid and organic) will be completely misguided.<\/p>\n<h2>When do you need keyword research?<\/h2>\n<p>For digital marketers, these are the <strong>three areas where keyword research is most critical<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<h3>#1: For SEO<\/h3>\n<p>The first and most obvious reason we need keyword research is to optimize for organic search. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/30\/seo-basics\">Search engine optimization (SEO)<\/a> helps Google bots crawl and index our websites to rank organically on the search engine results pages (SERPs). One of the primary ways that search engines decide what to rank is by crawling for keywords that show relevance between the user\u2019s search query and the content on your website.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/keyword-research-guide-google-search.png\" alt=\"guide to keyword research google search page autosuggest\" width=\"800\" height=\"474\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>While Google is frequently changing their algorithms, keywords are likely never going to lose importance.<\/p>\n<h3>#2: To fuel your content strategy<\/h3>\n<p>We all know that <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/01\/17\/seo-content-beginners-guide\">SEO and content<\/a> go hand-in-hand. Without content on your website, strong SEO will not follow.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEffective content strategies start with keyword research,\u201d says <a href=\"http:\/\/searchengineland.com\/3-reasons-seo-belongs-beginning-project-not-end-278905\">Search Engine Land<\/a> columnist Nate Dame. \u201cModern keyword research provides significant insight into what audiences want and need.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Every single piece of content on your site, whether it be a 300-word blog post or 5,000-word guide, should be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/12\/03\/seo-copywriting\">written with SEO in mind<\/a>. That is, focused around a keyword that strikes the right balance between high search volume and competition.<\/p>\n<h3>#3: For paid campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>Marketers often think about SEO and content when referring to keyword research, but all of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/11\/21\/ppc-keyword-research-guide\">paid campaigns should also be keyword-focused<\/a>. Whether it be your paid search ads, display ads, remarketing, or social media campaigns, all of these strategies need to be keyword-focused.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/keyword-level-last-account-structure-guide-1.png\" alt=\"keyword research for ppc\" width=\"489\" height=\"436\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>For example, with paid search you\u2019re literally bidding on individual keywords. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/02\/adwords-account-structure-guide\">Keywords make up your ad groups, which make up your campaigns<\/a>. If these keywords have low search volume, then your ads are going to get little or no traction. Also, if your keywords do not pertain to your target audience, you\u2019re going to get the wrong people clicking on your ads, which wastes your precious budget.<\/p>\n<p>The bottom line is that keyword research is key in all search marketing campaigns!<\/p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/x_mpi9jQ2tc?autoplay=0&amp;start=3&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2>How to do keyword research: focus on INTENT!<\/h2>\n<p>Before we get into the logistics of how to conduct keyword research, it\u2019s critical to mention the importance of keyword intent. WordStream\u2019s Content Manager, Elisa Gabbert, recently wrote a thorough post on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/26\/intent-marketing\">intent marketing<\/a>, which she defined as \u201c<strong>any kind of marketing that aims to meet an end-user or prospect\u2019s intent \u2013 that is, what they really want or need in the moment<\/strong>.\u201d<br \/>\nYou can see why this would be important for keyword research, right? If you\u2019re unable to understand the true intent of your keywords or if the keywords you\u2019re targeting have the wrong intent that isn\u2019t aligned with your business goals, then they are essentially useless.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take paid search as an example. The keywords \u201cwedding cake\u201d or \u201cwedding cake ideas\u201d show very different intent than \u201cbuy wedding cake in Boston\u201d or even \u201cwedding cake shops near me.\u201d These two latter options have much <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/30\/commercial-intent-keywords\">higher commercial intent<\/a>, meaning they indicate that the goal is to find a store and purchase a cake.<\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/04\/keyword-intent-four-types.png\" alt=\"the four types of keyword intent\" width=\"720\" height=\"441\" class=\"size-full wp-image-61610 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/04\/keyword-intent-four-types.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/04\/keyword-intent-four-types-480x294.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>People searching those keywords are closer to the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/01\/bottom-funnel-conversions\">bottom of the funnel<\/a>, the point of purchase.<\/p>\n<p>So while it makes sense to target commercial keywords with <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/23\/shopping-campaign-optimization\">shopping ads,<\/a> conversion-optimized landing pages, and other content that makes it <strong>easy to buy\u2014<\/strong>the intent of higher-funnel, less commercial keywords might be better met with a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/09\/how-to-write-a-blog-post\">blog post <\/a>full of wedding cake ideas.<\/p>\n<p>Being able to truly understand your prospects\u2019 intent is critical to being successful at keyword research and search marketing in general.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p><strong>\ud83d\udd0d Find the best keywords for your business with our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">easy Free Keyword Tool<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h2>How to do keyword research: getting\u00a0started<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you understand the importance of keyword research, where do you start? Here are two easy steps to get you off to a productive start!<\/p>\n<h3>Step #1: Brainstorm a list\u00a0of broad topics related to your business<\/h3>\n<p>Start thinking of the different categories and topics that pertain to your business. Start broad, and don\u2019t worry about getting too specific right away.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you\u2019re a bakery you might break down your topics by the types of baked goods you sell, like cakes, quiches, croissants, cupcakes, brownies, cookies, etc. It can help to use a Google document or excel spreadsheet and create tabs for each of these main topics you\u2019ve brainstormed.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/brainstorm-topic-ideas-for-keyword-research.png\" alt=\"keyword research brainstorm\" width=\"500\" height=\"231\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Step #2: Use keyword tools to find specific keywords within each topic<\/h3>\n<p>Alright, this is where the fun begins! You really need to put yourself in the shoes of your customer, and think how you would go about discovering your business if you were them. If you\u2019re a marketer with little customer-facing interaction it can help to speak with your sales team to see the language that new leads typically use.<\/p>\n<p>You can start with a simple brainstorm. Let\u2019s go back to our bakery example for this one, focusing in on the \u201ccakes\u201d category. Since you make cakes for special occasions you might write down some keywords like \u201cwedding cakes,\u201d \u201caffordable wedding cakes,\u201d \u201cstylish wedding cakes,\u201d \u201csummer wedding cakes,\u201d etc. Then you may focus in on other occasions that you sell cakes for like birthdays or anniversaries. You\u2019ll then recall that people often search for specific flavors like \u201cred velvet\u201d and \u201cmarble.\u201d Oh, and location is important! You should add the keyword \u201cnear me\u201d to the end of these searches to help you show up in local results, like \u201caffordable wedding cakes near me.\u201d (Learn more about <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/local-keyword-research\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how to do local keyword research<\/a> here!)<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/keyword-research-google-doc.png\" alt=\"how to do keyword research\" width=\"258\" height=\"328\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Should you stop there? NO! Instinct will only get you so far \u2013 it\u2019s easy to miss whole pockets of relevant keywords that you should be targeting, or you may find that the keywords you <em>think<\/em> would drive traffic are so low-volume that they won\u2019t get you anywhere. You need to use keyword tools to make sure you\u2019re surfacing all the relevant keywords that should be in your content plan and search campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>Type each of your main topics (\u201ccakes,\u201d \u201ccookies,\u201d etc.) into a keyword tool to get a list of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/27\/lsi-keywords\">related keywords<\/a>, their associated search volume, and other data. You can also type in any specific keywords from your brainstorm session to see what kind of volume they get.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, if they\u2019re far-fetched or too specific, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/20\/cross-platform-keyword-research-tools\">keyword research tools<\/a> will reveal that your keywords are not worth focusing on. On the other end of the spectrum, your keywords might be too broad, and result in super high search volume or a high level of competition. If you\u2019re a small, local bakery, you wouldn\u2019t want to compete with a global cookie company. Rather, your keywords should be more <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/12\/local-seo\">targeted around your location<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Keyword research tools will help you discover which keywords are worth investing in.

Get a sense of the competitive landscape. Ask yourself questions like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the SERP highly commercial \u2013 i.e., are there lots of ads? Does it make more sense to enter the <a href=\"\/articles\/what-is-google-adwords\">ad auction<\/a> with an ad than try to rank organically?<\/li>\n<li>Are the top-ranking sites much larger than you? (It\u2019s hard to compete with the likes of the New York Times and Buzzfeed.)<\/li>\n<li>Do the current results meet the intent of the keyword? If not, you could swoop in and beat them with a better answer to the question!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You should also look for SERP features like the \u201cPeople also ask\u201d box and related searches at the bottom of the SERP. Including these additional related keywords in your content can help you meet the searcher\u2019s intent and help your content rank!<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/searches-related-to-wedding-cakes.jpg\" alt=\"google for keyword research\" width=\"579\" height=\"272\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>How to do keyword research for competitor keywords<\/h2>\n<p>Don\u2019t forget to put your spy gear on when conducting keyword research!

In order to spend it wisely, and actually see an ROI from the keywords you bid on, keep these four tips in mind when conducting keyword research for paid campaigns.<\/p>\n<h3>#1: Research the associated costs for each keyword<\/h3>\n<p>All of the keyword tools outlined in this post typically include metrics around the cost-per-click (CPC) associated with each word. Keeping cost in mind will help you determine if certain keywords are in or out of budget for your upcoming campaigns.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/top-5-most-expensive-keywords1-2.jpg\" alt=\"most expensive keywords 2017\" width=\"1200\" height=\"628\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You want to ensure you\u2019re able to bid high enough to rank in the first 0-3 slots on Google, but not so high that you\u2019re <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/27\/most-expensive-keywords\">paying an absurd amount<\/a> for one single click. Pay attention to these metrics when researching and deciding on keywords for your ad groups.<\/p>\n<h3>#2: Make sure to do negative keyword research<\/h3>\n<p>Conducting <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/04\/negative-keyword-list\">negative keyword research<\/a> is just as important as regular keyword research when it comes to PPC, because if you\u2019re not excluding irrelevant words you could be wasting money on irrelevant clicks. You\u2019d be amazed how much money you can waste this way. This is especially important when using <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/29\/succeed-with-google-ads-broad-match\">broad<\/a> or even phrase match types.<\/p>\n<p>Also, just typing your keyword into Google and seeing what appears as suggestions to search for can help you identify negative keyword terms. For instance, if you&#8217;re selling cakes, you&#8217;re probably not interested in showing up for any \u201crecipe\u201d queries, since I\u2019d have to pay for those low-intent clicks.<\/p>\n<h3>#3: Bid highest on commercial intent keywords<\/h3>\n<p>Your goal in <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/20\/how-to-use-google-adwords\">advertising on Google<\/a> is likely not <em>just<\/em> to drive clicks. If it is, well then ignore this tip!<\/p>\n<p>However, if you\u2019re actually looking to target the most interested and qualified searchers, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/03\/increase-sales-online\">driving more conversions and sales<\/a>, you should focus most of your budget on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/30\/commercial-intent-keywords\">commercial intent keywords<\/a> \u2013 such as those containing words like \u201cbuy now,\u201d \u201cdiscount,\u201d \u201cfree shipping,\u201d brand names, and any other terms that demonstrate the searcher is ready to make a purchase.<\/p>\n<p>While you may still need to target keywords outside of this bucket, I\u2019d recommend allocating a higher budget to keywords with high commercial intent since they\u2019re the most likely to have the highest return.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/keyword-research-guide-commercial-intent-keywords.png\" alt=\"keyword research guide examples of commercial intent keywords\" width=\"800\" height=\"408\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.seoclarity.net\/blog\/map-keywords-different-stages-audiences-buying-cycle-14971\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Find more tips on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/09\/14\/adwords-budget-guide\">how to allocate your Google Ads\u00a0budget to different keyword types here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>#4: Group your keywords properly<\/h3>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve identified your high-intent, commercial, appropriately priced keywords, you need to group them in order to configure your campaign.
