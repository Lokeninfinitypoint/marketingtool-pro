Yet, if you don\u2019t know who views your profile or sees your ads, how your posts are performing, how <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/06\/instagram-story-highlights\">engaging your stories are<\/a>, and what value your account is actually driving, then spending time posting on the platform could be a waste.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not evaluating your Instagram analytics on a regular basis, then you could be:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Targeting the wrong audience.<\/li>\n<li>Posting too frequently (or not frequently enough).<\/li>\n<li>Driving irrelevant visitors to your website.<\/li>\n<li>Driving calls from an ad type that you only used once!<\/li>\n<li>Ignoring mentions that could be leading to future partnerships.<\/li>\n<li>Posting during non-optimal hours of the day or days of the week.<\/li>\n<li>Missing opportunities for brand engagement in your comments or stories.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This is just a short list of the things you could be doing better if you were diving into the data in Instagram more regularly. The information that you glean from the data is going to help improve the way you use the platform so you get more value for your business, which could make Instagram an even more critical component of your online marketing strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Without further ado, let\u2019s dig into the data!<\/p>\n<h2>Instagram Profile Analytics<\/h2>\n<p>Your profile analytics are the ones you access directly through the \u201cMy Profile\u201d page where your posts live.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-analytics-example-business-account.jpg\" alt=\"Instagram analytics example business account\" width=\"332\" height=\"571\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This page shows you insights for a week of time. You may have looked at your profile insights before, but perhaps you haven\u2019t dug into the metrics. Let\u2019s review what you can access here:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Impressions<\/strong>: The number of times your posts have been seen during the time frame.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Interactions<\/strong>: The number of actions taken on your account.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reach<\/strong>: The number of unique accounts that have seen any of your posts.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Profile Visits<\/strong>: The total number of profile views over the week.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Website Clicks<\/strong>: The number of times visitors have clicked the link to your website from your profile page.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Call\/email clicks<\/strong>: the number of times visitors have clicked the call\/email button from your profile page.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mentions<\/strong>: the number of times your account\u2019s handle has been mentioned by other users.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Instagram Audience Analytics<\/h2>\n<p>Who is your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/18\/beginners-guide-to-target-markets\">target audience<\/a>? I\u2019d bet you have an ideal demographic of followers you are pursuing. But does that align with the individuals who are seeing and interacting with your Instagram posts? Luckily, there\u2019s an entire section of your Instagram analytics dedicated to informing you about your audience.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the main factors to pay attention to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Top locations<\/strong>: This information allows you to see the top five cities and countries where your followers are located.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Age range<\/strong>: How old are your followers? This is an easy way to find out. Instagram breaks it down with the following ranges: 13-17, 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65+.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Gender<\/strong>: The distribution of your followers separated by men and women.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-analytics-audience-statistics_0.jpg\" alt=\"Instagram analytics audience insights\" width=\"375\" height=\"526\" \/><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Follower hours<\/strong>: A very helpful statistic to see the average time of day your followers are on Instagram.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Follower days<\/strong>: Similarly helpful, this section shows the days of the week your followers are most active.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-analytics-audience-followers_0.jpg\" alt=\"Instagram analytics follower stats\" width=\"600\" height=\"442\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>Individual Post Analytics<\/h2>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve established your profile is getting action from the right audience, you\u2019ll want to dive into individual post analytics to see how a certain message is resonating with your audience. This is a helpful way to see if your content is working well with your audience.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the statistics available for individual posts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Interactions<\/strong>: These are actions that were taken directly from your post. Whether that\u2019s visiting your profile, a hyperlink, or using the call\/email button in your post, these items are tracked and recorded here.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Discovery: <\/strong>Anyone who is as addicted to Instagram as I am has likely used the discovery feature before. This allows you to find new content from accounts you may not currently be following \u2013 and yes, your business account is eligible to appear on this page. Instagram will then inform you of the number of accounts reached through discovery who are not currently following you.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Follows: <\/strong>How many new followers you received from a post.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reach<\/strong>: How many unique accounts the post reached.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Impressions<\/strong>: The total number of times your post was viewed. Instagram also breaks this down by category to see where on the platform the post was viewed \u00e0 from home, from hashtags, from profile, from other.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Saves<\/strong>: The number of unique accounts that saved your post to their personal saved folder.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Comments<\/strong>: The number of comments on your post.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-analytics-post-insights.jpg\" alt=\"Instagram analytics post insights\" width=\"338\" height=\"601\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>Instagram Stories Analytics<\/h2>\n<p>Last but not least, we have Instagram stories. If you are not posting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/07\/instagram-story-ads\">Instagram stories<\/a>, you are missing out on a substantial opportunity. This Snapchat-like feature of Instagram continues to grow in popularity, and it gives you another opportunity to get your brand in front of more people or increase the exposure of your current audience.<\/p>\n<p>Once your story has gained traction, here are the statistics you can track:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Impressions<\/strong>: The number of times your story has been viewed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reach<\/strong>: The number of unique accounts that viewed your story.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Exits:<\/strong> The number of times someone exited your story mid-way through.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Replies<\/strong>: The total number of replies to a video or picture on your story.<\/li>\n<li><strong>People insights<\/strong>: This will list the accounts that have seen a particular component of your story.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What Data Should You Track?<\/h2>\n<p>OK, that is a lot of information about your Instagram analytics! To help you feel less overwhelmed by the sheer volume of statistics available, below are some tips for what you should focus on.<\/p>\n<p>Before you start analyzing data, it is critical to be aware of your overarching goal for the platform. Is your strategy to drive more website visitors? Perhaps your Instagram was created as a community for customers to share ideas. Or maybe you\u2019ve created an Instagram presence to raise brand awareness among your target audience. It is even possible that you have varying goals for your account. Some posts might be set up to drive awareness, while others might be trying to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/15\/selling-on-instagram\">drive sales<\/a>. You need to know what you\u2019re looking for in order to use Instagram analytics to your advantage.<\/p>\n<p>Here are three common goals with the three main metrics to track under each one.<\/p>\n<h3>#1: Build brand awareness<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re a new company looking to make a name for yourself or an established business trying to enter a new market or launch a new product, then Instagram might be the best place to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/05\/brand-awareness-campaigns\">build your brand awareness<\/a>. This is a great goal for this platform, because it\u2019s more than likely that your target audience is on Instagram somewhere.<\/p>\n<p>These are the metrics you\u2019ll want to focus on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Follower count<\/strong>: A growth in followers corresponds to a growth in brand awareness (and brand enjoyment!). If you\u2019re seeing an increase in new accounts following yours, then this is a sign that your brand is resonating on Instagram. Some helpful ways to grow your followers is by running ads with this objective, partnering with relevant brands on joint campaigns, and holding contests where you encourage individuals to follow your account and like your post to enter.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Impressions<\/strong>: The more people who see your posts and stories, the better! If you\u2019re looking to grow brand awareness, then you should make sure your post, story, and account impressions are growing, as well.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reach<\/strong>: Reach also tracks the number of views for your posts, stories, and account. The difference between reach and impressions is that reach refers to unique accounts (not the same account viewing your Instagram post multiple times). When it comes to brand awareness, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/18\/instagram-growth\">growing your Instagram reach<\/a> is critical.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>#2: Generate leads\/sales<\/h3>\n<p>This is a very common goal among marketers. Who doesn\u2019t want more sales? There are multiple strategies you can use to drive sales through Instagram, including running targeted ads and posting special offers for followers. But how can you evaluate their success?<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-analytics-ecommerce-ad.jpg\" alt=\"Instagram analytics ad for ecommerce\" width=\"375\" height=\"667\" \/><\/div>\n<p>There are the top three metrics to track:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Website clicks<\/strong>: In your ads, posts, and stories, you are likely encouraging viewers to go make a purchase or fill out a form on your website. Tracking how many individuals actually do this will help you figure out if your efforts are paying off.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Call clicks\/email clicks<\/strong>: Phone calls and emails are great indicators that conversions are coming. An increase in these touchpoints is a sign in the right lead-converting direction.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Follower hours\/days<\/strong>: Paying attention to <em>when<\/em> your audience is more engaged will help you improve your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/09\/instagram-marketing-strategy\">Instagram strategy<\/a>. You can plan to run your ads when your audience members are most active, in turn <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/27\/how-to-increase-instagram-engagement\">increasing engagement<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>#3: Build a community<\/h3>\n<p>With so much fun, visually engaging content on Instagram, there couldn\u2019t be a better place to build an interactive community. If this is your main goal, then you need to be continuously monitoring, responding, and evaluating the following metrics:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Comments<\/strong>: A community talks. What better way to do this than by having a conversation on your posts? This will also give you the opportunity to respond and engage with community members. As a rule of thumb, do not ever ignore comments, even if you just like them.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Story Replies<\/strong>: This is another great way to evaluate how active your community is. Stories are a great tool to use if you\u2019re trying to engage with followers to create a community. If your story viewers are taking the time to reply, this is a great sign.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Engagement<\/strong>: Lastly, engagement is critical when it comes to community building. Tracking the engagement of your ads, posts, profile, and stories will ensure your working towards your goal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>The Top 5 Best Instagram Analytics Tools<\/h2>\n<p>We are all busy, and sometimes digging through Instagram Insights in various locations across the platform can feel time-consuming and frustrating.
