Here are some strategies to try.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Optimize for featured snippets and knowledge panels<\/h3>\n<p>Google favors clear, structured content that directly answers user queries, so optimizing for these features is all about making your information easy to extract and display.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/10\/13\/google-answer-box\">Featured snippets<\/a> often take the form of paragraphs, lists, tables, steps, definitions, and comparisons, depending on the type of query.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Paragraph snippets<\/strong> work best for definitions and direct answers. Aim for 40-60 words, as <a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/hub\/seo\/featured-snippets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Backlinko\u2019s research<\/a> suggests this is the optimal length for snippet selection.<\/li>\n<li><strong>List snippets<\/strong> (bulleted or numbered) are ideal for step-by-step guides, ranking-based content, or &#8220;best of&#8221; lists.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Table snippets<\/strong> help organize data for easy comparison, making them great for pricing, feature breakdowns, and statistical content.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Comparison snippets<\/strong> perform well when contrasting two or more products, services, or concepts in a structured way.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/featured-snippet-example-dog-brushing-png.webp\" alt=\"featured snippet example for how often to brush dogs teeth query\" width=\"1758\" height=\"728\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-90176\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/featured-snippet-example-dog-brushing-png.webp 1758w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/featured-snippet-example-dog-brushing-1280x530.webp 1280w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/featured-snippet-example-dog-brushing-980x406.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/featured-snippet-example-dog-brushing-480x199.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1758px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>By structuring your content with these formats in mind (and placing the most relevant information early in a section), you increase the likelihood of being featured in search results and capturing valuable visibility.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Focus on good content structuring and sound technical SEO techniques<\/h3>\n<p>By combining structured content with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/28\/technical-seo\">strong technical SEO<\/a>, you can increase your likelihood of being featured in zero-click searches and staying visible. Here are some tips to keep in mind.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Create question-based content<\/strong>: Google often pulls snippet content from answers to common user questions. Structuring content around \u201cwhat,\u201d \u201chow,\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d questions improves your chances of ranking in these prime SERP spots.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Implement structured data: <\/strong>Implementing structured data with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/15\/what-is-schema-markup\">schema markup<\/a> (such as FAQ, HowTo, and Article schema) helps Google better understand and categorize your content, increasing the chances of appearing in SERP features like rich snippets, knowledge panels, and carousels.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Format for maximum visibility<\/strong>: Clear headings, bullet points, tables, and concise paragraphs make it easier for Google to extract information for featured snippets. A direct, well-structured answer at the start of a section improves your chances of ranking.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/content-structure-example-university-of-portland-png.webp\" alt=\"content structure example search result and content\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-90179\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/content-structure-example-university-of-portland-png.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/content-structure-example-university-of-portland-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Optimize for mobile<\/strong>: Since most zero-click searches happen on mobile, ensuring fast load times, responsive design, and easy navigation improves search performance.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Prioritize page speed and user experience<\/strong>: A slow site can hurt rankings and visibility. Optimizing images, reducing unnecessary scripts, and improving <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/02\/improve-core-web-vitals\">Core Web Vitals<\/a> ensure your content is more likely to appear in high-ranking search features.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>3.
