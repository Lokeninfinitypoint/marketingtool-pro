Within Threads, users can share posts up to 500 characters long. Posts can also include links, photos, and videos up to 5 minutes in length. Users can respond to posts\u2014creating a \u201cthread.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Threads is currently only available to Instagram users with access to iOS or Android in 100 countries. However, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dexerto.com\/tech\/threads-vs-twitter-2208723\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">that may change<\/a> as Threads could expand to desktop web browsers and more.<\/p>\n<p>To help understand how Threads works, many people have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2023\/07\/21\/instagram-threads-lures-creators-and-metas-challenge-is-to-keep-them.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">compared it to Twitter<\/a>, which is set up similarly.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/instagram-threads-announcement-image.jpg\" alt=\"instagram threads - overview of instagram threads\" width=\"780\" height=\"456\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-74594 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/instagram-threads-announcement-image.jpg 780w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/instagram-threads-announcement-image-480x281.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 780px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/about.instagram.com\/blog\/announcements\/threads-instagram-text-feature\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Meta even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2023\/07\/25\/tech\/meta-threads-following-feed\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recently released<\/a> a \u201cfollowing feed,\u201d similar to the one on Twitter (<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/07\/25\/twitter-changes-its-official-handle-to-x\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">now named X<\/a>) so users can see posts only from those they follow.<\/p>\n<div id=\"why\"><\/div>\n<h2>Why is Instagram Threads important?<\/h2>\n<p>With so many staple <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/11\/most-popular-social-media-platforms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media platforms<\/a> dominating the industry already, it\u2019s rare to see a new app emerge in popularity. Let\u2019s discuss the context as to why Meta, the parent brand of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/04\/10\/instagram-vs-facebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram and Facebook<\/a>, created Threads.<\/p>\n<p>Threads is different from Instagram in that it\u2019s primarily for text-based posts. However, since each Thread reply is added to the original thread, it allows users to have a conversation more fluidly than Instagram\u2019s standard comment section.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/instagram-threads-conversation-example.jpg\" alt=\"instagram threads - example of instagram threads conversation\" width=\"793\" height=\"517\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-74593 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/instagram-threads-conversation-example.jpg 793w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/instagram-threads-conversation-example-480x313.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 793px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/about.instagram.com\/blog\/announcements\/threads-instagram-text-feature\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<div id=\"twitter\"><\/div>\n<h3>Threads vs. Twitter<\/h3>\n<p>Threads wasn\u2019t created solely to build out Instagram\u2019s offerings&#8211;it\u2019s been speculated that Threads is meant to directly compete with Twitter. For example, Instagram Threads has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2023\/7\/7\/23787334\/instagram-threads-news-politics-adam-mosseri-meta-facebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">openly pointed out<\/a> that it&#8217;s meant to be used more for entertainment purposes, rather than news or politics like on Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter has gone through a tumultuous rebranding after Elon Musk acquired the platform. This opened the door for the social space to become more competitive (TikTok also <a href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/tiktok-twitter-text-elon-musk-0e7276e4c9fb2b3592c4f7eaf9395bc8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recently announced<\/a> their own text-based features). In fact, Twitter\u2019s usage has declined by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2023\/05\/17\/twitters-top-users-are-posting-less-since-musk-acquisition-pew-shows.html#:~:text=A%20new%20survey%20from%20Pew,acquisition%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20survey%20indicated.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">25%<\/a> since Musk has taken over, and even Twitter\u2019s most active users are tweeting less overall. On top of this, traffic to Twitter has decreased by almost <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/twitter-traffic-falls-under-elon-musk-threads-mastodon-bluesky-competition\/#:~:text=Overall%20traffic%20on%20the%20platform,83%20million%2C%20or%205.5%25.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">6%<\/a> from January 2023 to June 2023. Additionally, in the US alone, Twitter has lost roughly five million users, going from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/twitter-traffic-falls-under-elon-musk-threads-mastodon-bluesky-competition\/#:~:text=Overall%20traffic%20on%20the%20platform,83%20million%2C%20or%205.5%25.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">88 million<\/a> down to 83 million. Although, Twitter still has about <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/07\/21\/threads-in-decline-dont-count-out-instagrams-new-twitter-rival-yet\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">200 million<\/a> active users globally.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Threads reached 100 million users within a few days after its launch\u2014which is one of the fastest growth rates for a social media app ever recorded. However, that number declined just as rapidly as the app has seen a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/07\/21\/threads-in-decline-dont-count-out-instagrams-new-twitter-rival-yet\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">70%<\/a> decline in daily active users since then. This indicates that Instagram users are likely trying out Threads, then deciding to opt out and delete their accounts shortly after.<\/p>\n<p>In short, it\u2019s too soon to tell the longevity of Threads in comparison with Twitter\u2014especially with Twitter continuing to throw changes at us by the minute, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/money\/2023\/07\/25\/twitter-rebrand-new-logo-faqs\/70465203007\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the recent rebrand of Twitter into \u201cX<\/a>.\u201d However, keeping in mind the key similarities and differences between the two can help your business stay ahead of the game.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/instagram-threads-twitter-x.jpg\" alt=\"instagram threads - twitter x transformation screenshot\" width=\"731\" height=\"443\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-74595 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/instagram-threads-twitter-x.jpg 731w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/instagram-threads-twitter-x-480x291.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 731px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"business\"><\/div>\n<h2>Should your business be on Instagram Threads?<\/h2>\n<p>So, if the Instagram Threads user base continues to ebb and flow, should your business even be on there?<\/p>\n<p>The short answer is yes.

Solidify your business\u2019s Instagram presence<\/h3>\n<p>If your business\u2019s Instagram account isn\u2019t fully optimized, you\u2019re probably not ready to take on Threads just yet. First, you want to ensure you\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/brand-consistency\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">maintaining brand consistency<\/a> in your Instagram profile details. That way, setting up your Instagram Threads will be easier because your profile information and settings will carry over.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, your Instagram followers can be notified to follow you on Threads. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/05\/promote-instagram-account-free\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stronger your Instagram presence<\/a>, the more successful your Threads launch will be. Not only that, but you can reshare your Threads to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/01\/instagram-story-ideas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram Stories<\/a> or posts to encourage potential customers to find you on the new platform.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/instagram-threads-shared-to-instagram-1.jpg\" alt=\"instagram threads - example of sharing threads to instagram\" width=\"383\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-74600 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/instagram-threads-shared-to-instagram-1.jpg 383w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/instagram-threads-shared-to-instagram-1-192x300.jpg 192w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>2. Check out your competition<\/h3>\n<p>Assessing your competition is always a good idea when trying out a new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/26\/marketing-channels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing channel<\/a> like Instagram Threads. Search for competitors in your industry on Instagram Threads to see what their approach might be. That way, you can identify <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-make-your-business-stand-out\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">opportunities for your business to stand out<\/a> on Threads ahead of time.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Set goals<\/h3>\n<p>Your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/social-media-goals\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media goals<\/a> can be a guiding light when you first get started on Instagram Threads. Think about what you\u2019re looking to achieve on Threads\u2014whether it be brand awareness, engagement, or even moving customers down your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/social-media-marketing-funnel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media funnel<\/a>. You\u2019ll want a way you can track the success of your Threads initiatives, and setting goals using the SMART method (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound) can be a great start.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/instagram-threads-smart-goals-e1690401697427.jpg\" alt=\"instagram threads - setting goals for threads using smart goals\" width=\"785\" height=\"429\" class=\"wp-image-74598 size-full aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/instagram-threads-smart-goals-e1690401697427.jpg 785w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/instagram-threads-smart-goals-e1690401697427-480x270.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 785px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>4. Be active and join conversations<\/h3>\n<p>Once your Instagram Threads profile is live, don\u2019t just let it hang out without any activity. You want to show your audience you\u2019re active within the Threads community and worthy of a follow. This means you\u2019ll want to get comfortable both responding to a thread as well as starting your own.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Promote your Instagram Threads account on other channels<\/h3>\n<p>Aside from promoting your new Threads account on your Instagram, you\u2019ll want to take a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/22\/cross-channel-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cross-channel approach to marketing<\/a> your Threads account. For example, you might link to your Threads account on your website or encourage your followers on LinkedIn and Twitter to find you on Threads, too.<\/p>\n<h2>Get ahead of the curve with Instagram Threads<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re ready to switch up your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/01\/09\/social-media-marketing-strategies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media strategy<\/a> and foster meaningful conversations with your audience, get on Threads!
