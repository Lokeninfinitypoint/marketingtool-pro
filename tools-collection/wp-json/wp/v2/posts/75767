That said, it\u2019s been found that your typical Hulu video ad costs anywhere from <a href=\"https:\/\/saaspartners.io\/how-much-does-it-cost-to-advertise-on-hulu\/#:~:text=The%20cost%20of%20advertising%20on,Hulu%20is%20a%20great%20option.\">$10 to $30<\/a> per one thousand impressions.<\/p>\n<div id=\"types\"><\/div>\n<h2>Types of Hulu ads<\/h2>\n<p>All Hulu ads are video-based and between 15 to 30 seconds long.

Follow video creative best practices<\/h3>\n<p>To increase your chances of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/23\/google-ads-disapprovals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">getting your ads approved<\/a>, you\u2019ll of course want to abide by all the technical requirements and specifications Hulu outlines for its ads.<\/p>\n<p>For example, all Hulu ads should be between 15 and 30 seconds long and come in the form of a .mov or .mp4 file. Additionally, your ad file size can\u2019t exceed 10 GB.<\/p>\n<p>You can find a complete outline of <a href=\"https:\/\/home.admanager.hulu.com\/tech-specs-for-video-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">technical specs from Hulu here<\/a>, but aside from what\u2019s required, there are some recommended creative best practices for your Hulu ads as well:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Get your point across quickly. <\/strong>Since you won\u2019t have a lot of time to convey your message to your audience, you\u2019ll want to ensure that the main points of your ads shine through in both the imagery and the script.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Keep your branding consistent.<\/strong> You\u2019ll want your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-make-your-business-stand-out\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">business to stand out<\/a> as your audience is watching your Hulu advertising. For example, including your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/small-business-logo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">small business logo<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/12\/color-psychology-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">brand colors <\/a>across all your video frames can help reinforce your brand. In fact, Hulu found that the top-performing 15-second ads were also <a href=\"https:\/\/home.admanager.hulu.com\/insights\/how-small-businesses-can-create-impactful-streaming-tv-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">12 times<\/a> more likely to include branding throughout the ad.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/hulu-advertising-branding-statistics.jpg\" alt=\"hulu advertising - stats on branding\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75790 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/hulu-advertising-branding-statistics.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/hulu-advertising-branding-statistics-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/home.admanager.hulu.com\/insights\/how-small-businesses-can-create-impactful-streaming-tv-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Data source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>2. Regularly measure your Hulu ad performance<\/h3>\n<p>With at least $500 on the line, you don\u2019t want to just set and forget your Hulu ads. Luckily, Hulu makes it easy to track performance right from within the Hulu Ad Manager. Simply log in and, on the ad manager homepage, you\u2019ll get a breakdown of all your campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>To help keep track of your success, be sure to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/15\/marketing-objectives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">set measurable goals <\/a>to track your campaigns against. You\u2019ll likely want to benchmark your progress along the way. You could even refer to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/15\/google-ads-benchmarks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">industry benchmarks<\/a> of other top ad platforms to see how your Hulu ads compare to channels like Google Ads.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>Use our<a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteGoogleAdsBenchmarks2023.html?cid=Web_WS_incontent_guide_2023benchmarks_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incontent_links\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> latest Google Ads benchmarks report<\/a> to see how your Hulu ad costs compare to average PPC costs in your industry.<\/div><\/div>\n<h3>3. Frequently upload fresh ads<\/h3>\n<p>We can all probably recall a commercial we\u2019ve sadly seen far too many times. Hulu subscribers tend to stream on the platform in large chunks\u2014which means it&#8217;s more likely that your audience could see your ad multiple times. The last thing you want to do is overtire your audience with a repetitive ad!<\/p>\n<p>Avoid this by refreshing and reuploading your ads regularly. However, it&#8217;s a best practice to let any sort of marketing campaign run for at least a month before you judge its efficacy. So, instead of stressing to refresh your ads weekly, try revisiting them monthly or quarterly. That way, you can make data-backed decisions on how you might want to tweak them.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re short on ideas to keep your ads fresh, try leaning into seasonal themes. For example, you could use a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/resources\/2023-marketing-calendar\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing calendar<\/a> (like the one below from our friends at LocaliQ) to pre-plan your Hulu ad video content. That way, you&#8217;re always prepared to change up your ad as needed.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/hulu-advertising-ad-planning-calendar.jpg\" alt=\"hulu advertising - example calendar for video content planning\" width=\"736\" height=\"559\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75791 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/hulu-advertising-ad-planning-calendar.jpg 736w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/hulu-advertising-ad-planning-calendar-480x365.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 736px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Get started with Hulu advertising ASAP<\/h2>\n<p>The best part about Hulu advertising?
