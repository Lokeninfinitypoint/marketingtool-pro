The former deals with what you can do on your own site to increase your rankings, while the latter deals with what you can do outside your site (on <em>other<\/em> sites, hence, off-page) to raise your rankings.<\/p>\n<p>Both are equally vital to making sure that your site gets found in search, but we\u2019re only going to deal with off-page tactics in this guide.<\/p>\n<p>Optimizing your site for off-page SEO means you\u2019ll have to improve the way\u00a0that both users and search engines see your site in terms of credibility, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/12\/google-e-a-t\">authority<\/a>, popularity and relevance, just to name a few factors. A broad simplification of this is that other sites on the web (ideally, respectable ones) will link to your content to essentially promote or vouch for it, which, circling back now, has major benefits for your site\u2019s reputation.<\/p>\n<h2>On-Page vs. Off-Page SEO<\/h2>\n<p>Here\u2019s a quick refresher on the difference between on- and off-page <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/01\/seo-case-study\">SEO<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>On-page SEO generally includes factors like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Page titles and headings<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/08\/image-seo\">Images<\/a><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/meta-description\">Meta descriptions<\/a> and tags<\/span><\/li>\n<li>URL<\/li>\n<li>Fast-loading pages<\/li>\n<li>High-quality and regularly updated content<\/li>\n<li>Internal linking<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/on-page-seo-checklist-template-scaled-1.png\" alt=\"on-page seo checklist template\" width=\"720\" height=\"491\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-59444\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/on-page-seo-checklist-template-scaled-1.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/on-page-seo-checklist-template-scaled-1-480x327.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>From our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/06\/on-page-seo\">on-page SEO checklist<\/a> post.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Off-page SEO really comes down to one major factor, which is high-quality backlinks to your site.

The process can be quite involved, but it pays off if you do it diligently.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at each of the four main ways to get backlinks to your site for off-page SEO purposes.<\/p>\n<h2>Guest Posting or Blogging<\/h2>\n<p>Before social and influencer marketing\u2026there was blogging. One of the earliest marketing strategies on the web, blogging stands the test of time by still delivering results today. According to the data:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blogging is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.socialmediaexaminer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Industry-Report-2018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the second-most important type of content<\/a> for marketers<\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.socialmediaexaminer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Industry-Report-2018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">60% of marketers<\/a> use blogging in their social-media content<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Websites featuring blogs get <a href=\"http:\/\/www.techclient.com\/blogging-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">434% more indexed pages<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It\u2019s precisely because of this popularity and effectiveness that landing guest posts on blogs is such a solid influencer-marketing strategy. When you publish a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/06\/21\/guest-posting-dos-donts\">guest post<\/a> on an influential (and highly ranked) blog, you can usually get a backlink to your site, either in the article itself or in your author bio.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d17e6da4-82c3-4d22-a98b-2834c7cabba8\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/off-page-seo-importance-of-blogging.jpg\" alt=\"guest blogging for off page seo\" width=\"776\" height=\"580\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Here are some actionable tips on landing guest posts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you write your introductory <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/01\/19\/outreach-marketing-techniques\">outreach email<\/a> to the blog\u2019s editor, make it personal to establish a <em>human<\/em> connection<\/li>\n<li>Understand the industry of the blog you want to write on<\/li>\n<li>Pitch topics that are in line with what the blog is looking for<\/li>\n<li>Include some links to your best published work on the web<\/li>\n<li>Tell the blog editor how his or her readers can benefit from your piece<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The goal is to repeat this strategy from one highly ranked blog to the next, using your growing list of successfully published guest posts as part of your pitch.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that the whole tactic behind off-page <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/17\/amazon-seo\">SEO <\/a>is to get backlinks from <em>highly ranked<\/em> sites pointing to your site. This all goes back to a site\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/12\/domain-authority\">domain authority<\/a>, which is defined as:<\/p>\n<p>A ranking score for search engines that predicts how highly a site is going to rank on search engine results pages. The score goes from one to 100; the closer the score gets to 100, the more authoritative it is.<\/p>\n<p>Be sure to figure in this score when choosing the blogs to pitch your guest posts to. Use a tool like Moz\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/researchtools\/ose\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Open Site Explorer<\/a> to help you figure out any site\u2019s domain authority.<\/p>\n<h2>Social Media<\/h2>\n<p>For the longest time, there\u2019s been a correlation between the social shares a piece of content gets and how well its corresponding site or page does in search rankings.<\/p>\n<p>Recent research and analysis from our own Larry Kim suggests that it\u2019s not just the number of social shares, but <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/relationship-between-organic-rankings-and-social-shares\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the engagement rate of social content<\/a> that strongly correlates with higher organic rankings. That would be things like comments, likes, click-throughs on images, etc.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"9e57e8fc-f355-4cb3-b849-c0b200246373\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/off-page-seo-social-activity.png\" alt=\"social engagement for off page seo\" width=\"1028\" height=\"644\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>This brings me to the next strategic piece of increasing your off-page SEO results: social media. The more that people on social share your content\u2014and the greater its engagement rate\u2014the more backlinks for that specific piece of content you\u2019ll probably get. Social media is essentially a way to get a lot of free exposure, assuming your content is worth sharing.<\/p>\n<p>Think of it this way: Let\u2019s say you create an extremely helpful and eye-opening infographic that talks about all the little-known foods that Americans should stop eating. Mercola.com has done just that with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mercola.com\/infographics\/10-banned-foods.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an impressive infographic on banned foods that has amassed almost 700,000 social shares<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"fc73ee6e-f02a-4edd-9c49-b12ed6201707\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/banned-foods-infographic-off-page-seo.jpg\" alt=\"what is off page seo\" width=\"600\" height=\"521\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>According to Moz\u2019s Open Site Explorer, this infographic has earned 50 backlinks, and when I search for \u201cbanned foods\u201d on Google, it ranked at #2.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c0abd01b-feb0-4b2f-8b74-768f3f1c0bb9\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/site-explorer-inbound-links-off-page-seo.png\" alt=\"off page seo link metrics\" width=\"975\" height=\"385\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>This is just one example of how getting a lot of social shares and social engagement can be a very effective way of using off-page SEO to increase your search rankings.<\/p>\n<h2>Influencer Marketing<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/26\/influencer-marketing\">Influencer marketing<\/a> is a strategy where businesses and brands work together with popular (read: <em>influential<\/em>) bloggers and\/or social-media users to promote their products or services. Because these influencers enjoy huge audiences and carry sway with them, businesses want to tap into that audience by having their products or services plugged or at least mentioned in some way by these influencers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>To be sure, influencer marketing includes both paid and non-paid arrangements. The former is when businesses pay influencers or at least give them a free product in exchange for their promotion. The latter is when the relationship is organic, when both the business and influencer enter into a mutually beneficial relationship.<\/p>\n<p>While it\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesagencycouncil\/2018\/06\/01\/influencer-marketing-is-under-attack-six-reasons-it-still-works\/#2d7a19f06058\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">come under attack recently<\/a> for having the potential to sometimes be inauthentic, the truth is that research confirms it\u2019s very helpful to your off-page SEO efforts, with influencers having the potential <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketingprofs.com\/chirp\/2018\/33333\/the-influencer-marketing-revolution-macro-versus-micro-influencers-infographic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">to generate 11 times the ROI of traditional advertising<\/a>.

Quote them, or mention their brand. Then, reach out to them on social or by email to let them know that you\u2019ve featured them. Since people naturally love being recognized, chances are they\u2019ll link back to your content if you ask them to.<\/li>\n<li>Work side-by-side with an influencer to create an in-depth guide, video or other piece of valuable content. In this scenario, you\u2019ll get backlinks when you co-promote your content on different channels to each other\u2019s respective audiences.<\/li>\n<li>Get your social fans to act as micro-influencers for your brand. If you notice that people are already organically taking pictures of themselves with your product and posting it to their social feeds, invite them to do the same for your official social account. The result is a multiplying effect of the promotion of your brand\u2026to all of their followers.
