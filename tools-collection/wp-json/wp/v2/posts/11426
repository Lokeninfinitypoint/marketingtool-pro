However, its call to action\u2014for businesses to pause their Facebook ads for July\u2014creates a challenging situation for small businesses in the midst of economic hardship brought on by the pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>In this post, we\u2019re going to cover what the #StopHateForProfit movement is, how to assess the extent to which your business can participate, as well as various ways to support the Facebook ad boycott depending on your circumstances.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"9a6795e8-cdfa-4108-9a01-0d04cc0ee101\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ads-boycott-intro.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook ads boycott social media post\" width=\"748\" height=\"477\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>What is the #StopHateforProfit movement?<\/h2>\n<p>The #StopHateForProfit campaign began on Wednesday, June 17, by Color of Change, the largest online racial justice organization in the U.S. Together with the NAACP, ADL, Sleeping Giants, Free Press, and Common Sense Media, the organization began calling on Facebook advertisers to halt their ad spending for July 2020.<\/p>\n<p>This Facebook advertising boycott originates from the fact that 99% of Facebook\u2019s $70 billion yearly revenue comes from ads. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/colorofchange.org\/stop-hate-for-profit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Color of Change\u2019s campaign announcement<\/a>, the hope is that \u201closing ad revenue for one month may cause Facebook to reconsider how it has ignored the demands of Black users and civil rights organizations.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Since its inception, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/06\/26\/business\/media\/Facebook-advertising-boycott.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;amp;pgtype=Article\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">over 100 advertisers<\/a> have joined the Facebook ad boycott, including large brands like Adidas, Best Buy, Starbucks, Coca-Cola, Clorox, and more.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"330a3a47-1759-44f6-bbb3-7ea99425afe6\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ads-boycott-coca-cola-statement.jpg\" alt=\"Coca Cola's Facebook boycott statement\" width=\"671\" height=\"367\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The lost ad spend from these large brands has had an almost immediate impact: Facebook\u2019s market value has dropped <a href=\"https:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/facebook-stock-price-reaction-advertisers-halt-social-media-spending-2020-6-1029350644\">$60 billion in just two days<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Who can participate in the #StopHateForProfit Facebook ad boycott?<\/h2>\n<p>The short answer? Any business. And with the recent momentum of the Black Lives Matter movement and antiracism activism, many businesses want to jump on any opportunity to help spark change. However, being also in the midst of an economic crisis due to the pandemic, this puts businesses, especially small businesses and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/10\/nonprofit-marketing-tactics\">nonprofits<\/a>, in a tough spot.<\/p>\n<p>Our Senior SEO Manager Gordon Donnelly explains that for large companies, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adl.org\/news\/letters\/an-open-letter-to-the-companies-that-advertise-on-facebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">participating in\u00a0#StopHateForProfit<\/a> is more feasible:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor enterprises and public companies with sky-high budgets, numerous stakeholders, and huge customer bases\/public visibility, the story is different. Boycotting Facebook could mean lost revenue in the near term but a higher upside in the long run. These companies have higher margins for error. The promise of solidifying existing customer loyalty combined with the potential to woo new customers that share your values outweighs the risk of losing some dough in the near term. Plus, there\u2019s the added bonus of actually influencing some change.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"44612b7b-8699-4093-b6ec-af8f288c3bf6\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ads-boycott-starbucks-example.jpg\" alt=\"Starbucks participating in the Facebook ads boycott\" width=\"726\" height=\"526\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>For small businesses, on the other hand, the movement puts them in a difficult position. Donnelly goes on to say:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSmall businesses rely on Facebook advertising to generate invaluable brand awareness and lead volume. Plus, Facebook ads feed display remarketing, organic and direct conversion volume, paid conversions on brand terms, and much more. So for the overwhelming majority of these businesses, boycotting Facebook would mean losing a solid chunk of revenue and disrupting their marketing flywheel across all channels. And with most of these businesses already struggling to generate revenue during the pandemic, reducing or pausing Facebook spend could be risky.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stophateforprofit.org\/hit-pause-on-hate\">#StopHateForProfit <\/a>website also addresses the bind that nonprofits might be in: \u201cMany nonprofits rely on paid ads on Facebook to get their message out, especially as Facebook has increasingly limited the ability of organizations to organically reach audiences.\u201d For this reason, the recommendation for nonprofits is to make the best decision for their needs.<\/p>\n<h2>Tips for determining how to participate in the #StopHateForProfit Facebook boycott<\/h2>\n<p>Should you participate in the Facebook advertising boycott? Our experts here at WordStream provide some tips on determining the most effective way for your business respond to the #StopHateForProfit movement:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Understand your goals with respect to Facebook advertising <\/strong><br \/>\nWordStream Lead Acquisition Manager <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/kristina-simonson-3721\">Kristina Simonson<\/a> suggests that you ask yourself:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can your business afford the potential loss in lead\/customer generation?<\/li>\n<li>How does pausing spend for a month impact your ability to ramp back up?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Look out to see what your competitors are doing<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Simonson also points out that it\u2019s important to keep track of what other companies in your industry are doing. You can do this by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Looking at statements on competitors\u2019 websites and social media channels.<\/li>\n<li>Browsing the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ads\/library\">Facebook Ad library<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"0001ce9e-4324-4c27-bea8-fa4718ff315c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ads-boycott-facebook-ad-library.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook's ad library search page\" width=\"784\" height=\"371\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>Understand the sentiment in your industry<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Holly Niemiec, senior account manager and one of PPC Hero\u2019s Top 50 Most Influential PPC Experts, strongly encourages monitoring your social media channels.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhether you\u2019re enterprise or SMB,\u201d she says, \u201cmonitor the comments on your Facebook ads. Monitor your organic comments. Monitor your DMs and Twitter replies. If you\u2019re seeing enough vitriol, especially to the point where performance dips, it might make sense to reduce spend.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Facebook advertising alternatives during the #StopHateForProfit movement<\/h2>\n<p>Pausing Facebook ads for a month could mean damaging revenue losses, especially for small businesses. However, businesses who wish to participate in the Facebook ad boycott can reallocate their Facebook ad budget toward alternative but effective efforts. Here are a few options.<\/p>\n<h3>Run local news ads<\/h3>\n<p>Rather than switching your ad budget over to other social platforms like TikTok or Snapchat, you can put your advertising dollars into local news ads. This way you can participate in the movement while mitigating some of that revenue loss.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3e952f57-add0-48bf-a7d4-5beece1d7b8b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ads-boycott-local-news-ads.jpg\" alt=\"example of a local news ad\" width=\"791\" height=\"495\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Consider advertising on news sites for your local community.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In addition, WordStream\u2019s <span lang=\"EN\">Senior Vice President of Marketing Laura Taylor says \u201cThis is a great way to support the local news sources that bring injustice to light, and where so many eyeballs are focused during the pandemic as people look for guidance within their community.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Google Display Network<\/h3>\n<p>While Facebook ads are ideal for prospecting, custom intent and in-market audiences have improved the GDN\u2019s targeting capabilities, making it a substantial alternative. In addition, with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/09\/google-discovery-ads\">Discovery ads now available to all advertisers<\/a>, you can prioritize lead quality.<\/p>\n<h3>YouTube advertising<\/h3>\n<p>If you have video ads that you run on Facebook and Instagram, consider running those on YouTube instead, or starting a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/29\/youtube-display-ads\">YouTube display ad campaign<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Donate the money to antiracist initiatives<\/h3>\n<p>If you can afford to pause your Facebook ads for July and not reallocate your budget toward another ad platform, consider donating that money to programs that support black empowerment and antiracist initiatives, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vans.com\/empower\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vans has done<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"047c2e92-f8ae-4da7-b64f-ffc56fa075cf\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ads-boycott-vans-tweet.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook advertising boycott tweet from Vans\" width=\"483\" height=\"272\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Vans is reinvesting all of their Instagram and Facebook ad dollars for the month of July.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>And remember, the call to action is to pause ad spend on Facebook. Many of these businesses are still planning to post organically, so you can still share your donation outcome or strategy with your audience.<\/p>\n<h3>Fund for matching employee donations<\/h3>\n<p>Another way to reallocate your Facebook ads budget is to reinvest it into a fund for matching employee <a href=\"https:\/\/nymag.com\/strategist\/article\/where-to-donate-for-black-lives-matter.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">donations to antiracist organizations<\/a>.

Here are some alternative ways to participate for those businesses that can\u2019t afford to pause their ads.<\/p>\n<h3>Pause your Facebook ads briefly<\/h3>\n<p>If you, your customers, and\/or your employees feel strongly about the Facebook advertising boycott, if you can handle the revenue loss, or if Facebook hasn\u2019t been a revenue-generator for you in the past, then you may want to consider actually pausing your Facebook ad campaigns\u2014even if just for some part of July.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"97331d9a-eeee-4a0a-ae32-2e00ce6621e9\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ads-boycott-example-post.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook advertising boycott for 7 days example\" width=\"795\" height=\"356\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Donate a percentage of your Facebook ad profits<\/h3>\n<p>If you can\u2019t afford to pause your ads, you could propose to donate a certain percentage of your profits from Facebook ads to a civil rights organization of your choice.<\/p>\n<h3>Run an influencer collaboration<\/h3>\n<p>If you can\u2019t afford to boycott Facebook ads or donate to an organization, try an influencer collaboration. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/21\/social-media-influencers\">Influencers<\/a> are like mini-celebrities within a particular niche that have a wide following on their social media accounts and blogs.
