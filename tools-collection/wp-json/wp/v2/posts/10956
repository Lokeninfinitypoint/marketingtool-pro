Why? Because folks who attempt to run ads in Facebook\u2019s Business Manager are often overwhelmed by the number of options and the surprising complexity of the platform. However, there is a Facebook ad campaign type that specifically allows local businesses to run ads in their general area, and\u00a0rather easily. Previously labelled \u201clocal awareness,\u201d the &#8220;store traffic&#8221; campaign objective in Facebook Ads Manager can attract ideal customers to your business, increase local brand awareness, and help you\u00a0meet your sales targets.<\/span><br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-40668\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/facebook-local-awareness-ad-examples.png\" alt=\"examples of facebook local awareness ads\" width=\"720\" height=\"341\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/facebook-local-awareness-ad-examples.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/facebook-local-awareness-ad-examples-480x227.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\n<span lang=\"EN\">In this post I will be discussing how to:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Set up Facebook ads with the &#8220;store traffic&#8221; (formerly known as the &#8220;local awareness&#8221;) objective.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Create ad variations to identify what attracts your local customers.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Optimize your Facebook local ad campaigns by using metrics and budget settings.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">How to set\u00a0up your local Facebook ads<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/03\/how-to-advertise-on-facebook\">To advertise on Facebook<\/a>, you&#8217;ll need to choose your objective, set up your campaign, selecct your budget optimization method, configure your Ad Set, define your targeting and parameters, and choose placements; so let&#8217;s walk through those steps for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/04\/optimize-google-local-advertising\">local ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">1. Choose the store traffic\u00a0objective<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Facebook has a plethora of advertising <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/26\/facebook-objectives\">campaign objectives<\/a> and options. This is due to the fact that all kinds of businesses use the platform to market their products and services and each of them has specific goals and nuances as to what they\u2019re looking to achieve from advertising. There are strategies to leverage these different campaign types in various ways, but for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/24\/local-marketing-tips\">local business\u00a0just looking to drive awareness<\/a>, there is one campaign type you should focus on to start: store traffic.<\/span><br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-40669\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/facebook-local-awareness-ad-campaign-objective.png\" alt=\"facebook store traffic campaign objective\" width=\"400\" height=\"455\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/facebook-local-awareness-ad-campaign-objective.png 400w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/facebook-local-awareness-ad-campaign-objective-264x300.png 264w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/facebook-local-awareness-ad-campaign-objective-88x100.png 88w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/facebook-local-awareness-ad-campaign-objective-176x200.png 176w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><br \/>\n<span lang=\"EN\">Previously called \u201clocal awareness,\u201d the &#8220;store traffic&#8221; campaign objective affects not only how your ads are served but also how they look to the user when they are delivered across Facebook&#8217;s digital landscapes. The primary purpose of this objective is to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/12\/local-seo\">showcase your local business to individuals within a desired proximity<\/a> to its physical location(s). The advantage here is that it gives you a lot more options in terms of targeting and reach than something like traditional print advertising would give you. There is also more flexibility with your ad\u2019s call to action, which I will touch upon later in the post.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Free guide<\/strong><span>\u00a0&gt;&gt;\u00a0<\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLFBFundamentals.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FacebookFundamentals_Download\">7 Fundamental Facebook Advertising Tips<\/a><\/strong><span>\u00a0every advertiser should know.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">2. Set up your local ad campaign<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">To get your Facebook<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/21\/local-business-advertising\"> local ad campaign<\/a> up and running, you\u2019ll want to select the \u201c+Create\u201d button in your Facebook Ads Manager campaign tab. From there, you\u2019ll want to select the \u201cstore traffic\u201d campaign objective from the list as shown below. You will then be prompted to name your campaign.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Facebook20local20awareness20ads20create20ad.png\" alt=\"Facebook local awareness ads create ad\" width=\"800\" height=\"359\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">3. Set your budget optimization type<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Next, you&#8217;ll be asked to choose whether you want the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/27\/facebook-campaign-budget-optimization\">budget optimization <\/a>to be controlled at the campaign level or the ad set level. For simplicity&#8217;s sake\u00a0I suggest setting the budget optimization at the campaign level. By choosing this, you simply tell Facebook how much you want to spend on your ads per day. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Facebook20local20awareness20ads20campaign20budget20optimization.png\" alt=\"Facebook local awareness ads campaign budget optimization\" width=\"600\" height=\"312\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">You also have the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/19\/facebook-ads-daily-vs-lifetime-budgets\"> ability to select a lifetime budget <\/a>for your ads, but you will have to specify the window of time that you want them to run. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span lang=\"EN\">4. Configure your Ad Set<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">After inputting your desired budget, proceed to the Ad Set configuration step by selecting \u201cnext\u201d at the bottom of the screen. The Ad Set layer of a campaign is where you<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/27\/facebook-ad-targeting-options-infographic\"> control all the targeting <\/a>and basic settings of your campaign. At this level, you\u2019ll want to select your business page and the physical \u201cstore\u201d location:<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Facebook20local20awareness20ads20choose20page.png\" alt=\"Facebook local awareness ads choose page\" width=\"600\" height=\"358\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If your store location does not auto-populate, or if you want to add multiple locations, select \u201cCreate a New Store Set.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Facebook20local20awareness20ads20choose20store20set.png\" alt=\"Facebook local awareness ads choose store set\" width=\"600\" height=\"541\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><strong><span lang=\"EN\">5. Define your local targeting parameters<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">After establishing the locations of your brick-and-mortar business(s), you can then begin to build out the specifics of your targeting. By scrolling down the page you can select a start date (and end date if you choose to do so). You also have the option to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/21\/facebook-offer-ads\">create an offer.<\/a> By choosing this option, you will be prompted to create the offer within the UI:<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Facebook20local20awareness20ads20create20offer_0.png\" alt=\"Facebook local awareness ads create offer\" width=\"800\" height=\"607\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><strong><span lang=\"EN\">6. Define your demographic targeting<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">You will then want to scroll down to the demographic targeting area. This is where the true power of Facebook comes into play. You have the ability to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/01\/facebook-audiences\">refine your audience<\/a> by age, gender, and a plethora of interest and behavioral components. For example, let&#8217;s say you own a dance school and wish to target parents of young children who would likely be interested in signing up. You would do so by simply searching and selecting the parameters you are looking for, as shown below:<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook20local20awareness20ads20detailed20targeting.png\" alt=\"facebook local awareness ads detailed targeting\" width=\"600\" height=\"394\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">You have the ability to narrow this audience further, but keep in mind that this may make your audience very small. You want to avoid making your audience too small for a variety of reasons, the primary one being that the store traffic campaign objective serves ads by default on a \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/14\/facebook-advertising-cost\">daily unique reach<\/a>\u201d basis. What this means is that Facebook will deliver your ads to individuals within your specified audience once per day. If your audience is too small it will be unlikely that your campaign will serve efficiently or reach the desired budget threshold. Some businesses have the ability to optimize the delivery of their campaigns for \u201cstore visits\u201d but according to Facebook, only a small number of advertisers currently have been selected to have this capability. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span lang=\"EN\">7. Choose your placements<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Another detail to take note of is that\u00a0some placements were temporarily\u00a0unavailable for store traffic objective ads due to COVID-19\u2014they were\u00a0only appearing in the Facebook News Feed.\u00a0This restriction may or may not still be in place, depending on the time of your reading this post. If it is still in place, it\u00a0means that you may not have the ability to serve your ads across <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/01\/08\/facebook-ad-placement-optimization\">Facebook\u2019s other placements <\/a>such as the right column, instant articles, etc. For that reason, selecting \u201cautomatic placements\u201d should be sufficient.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">How to create your local Facebook ad variations<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">After defining your targeting parameters, it will be time to start actually creating your local ads. Ideally you\u2019ll want to create 3-4 ad variations and no more than 5 for a given Ad Set. This is because of the way that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/20\/facebook-newsfeed-algorithm\">Facebook\u2019s algorithm<\/a> delivers, learns, and optimizes for performance. Get started by giving your ad a name and selecting your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-promote-your-facebook-page-for-free\/\">Facebook business page<\/a> and Instagram business profile if you have one. You have the option to choose the primary page, or if you have multiple locations you can choose to have the local pages represented in the ads:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook20local20awareness20ads20choose20local20page.png\" alt=\"facebook local awareness ads choose local page\" width=\"400\" height=\"390\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">You then have the ability to choose the ad format \u2014whether it be a single image, video, carousel, or collection. If you need guidance here, we have a post that takes an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/29\/facebook-ad-sizes\">in-depth look at the different Facebook ad creative types and specs<\/a>. What\u2019s great about the carousel option for store traffic is that you have the option to include a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/02\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps\">map<\/a> card showing your businesses location:<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook20local20awareness20ads20map.png\" alt=\"facebook local awareness ads map\" width=\"600\" height=\"564\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">When it comes to store traffic ads, the primary differentiator from a creative perspective is the ability to use calls to action\u00a0unavailable in other campaign types:<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook20local20awareness20ads20call20to20action.png\" alt=\"facebook local awareness ads call to action\" width=\"600\" height=\"436\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Having the ability to create \u201ccall now\u201d, \u201cget directions\u201d, and \u201csend message\u201d calls to action\u00a0within a single campaign is rather unique to the store traffic objective.

However, digital paid advertising is far from a \u201cset it and forget it\u201d course of action. Ensuring that your ads are performing to the best of their ability takes consistent observation, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/24\/google-ads-optimization\">optimization<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/27\/facebook-ad-copy-tests\">testing<\/a>. Let\u2019s run through some of the key areas you should focus on while running ads in order to make the most out of your budget:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Daily Spend:<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> Due to the physical limitations of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/06\/local-marketing-ideas\">targeting people locally<\/a>, you\u2019ll want to ensure that your campaign is spending the amount you have specified within the settings per day. If the campaign is understanding or struggling to reach the daily limit then it may be an indication that the audience is too small or the spend limit is too high.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Ad Fatigue: <\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">When <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/06\/facebook-ads-account-audit\">assessing the performance of your ads<\/a> over time, there are two primary metrics you can observe in order to gauge whether or not your ads need to be refreshed. The first being <em>frequency<\/em> over a period of time and the second being <em>volume<\/em> of link clicks over time. Both of these<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/11\/12\/facebook-ad-benchmarks\"> Facebook ad metrics<\/a> can be viewed when selecting the \u201ccolumns\u201d button and then subsequently selecting \u201cperformance and clicks\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook20local20awareness20ads20performance20and20clicks_0.png\" alt=\"facebook local awareness ads performance and clicks\" width=\"400\" height=\"442\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Frequency represents how many times your ads have been served to an individual user over a period of time and link clicks represent how many users have clicked through. If you are experiencing a high level of frequency after having run your ads for days or weeks in addition to witnessing link clicks decreasing over that same period, it may be time to refresh your ad creative to that audience.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">Generate local awareness through Facebook ads<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Running paid ads on Facebook may be intimidating for many local businesses, but once you familiarize yourself with the platform, you will find that it&#8217;s rather easy to use. The more you practice running ads to drive traffic to your business, the better at it you will inevitably become. Most of what drives success on digital platforms is derived from the experience you gain from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/14\/facebook-split-testing\">testing different ad copy<\/a> and creative variations over time.
