Distinctly different from lead generation, demand generation is a much more involved process \u2013 which makes it all the more challenging for new brands.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/demand-generation-header.png\" alt=\"Demand generation\" width=\"558\" height=\"383\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In this post, we\u2019ll be covering what demand generation is, how it differs from \u201ctraditional\u201d lead generation, and going over nine demand generation strategies for new brands. By the end of this post, you\u2019ll know exactly what you need to do to get people excited about your products and keep those (qualified) leads rolling in, so let\u2019s get started.<\/p>\n<h2>What Is Demand Generation?<\/h2>\n<p>At its simplest, demand generation can be defined as \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 the generation of demand for a business\u2019 products or services. This is accomplished through a gradual, comprehensive, and holistic process that often spans entire marketing departments.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/demand-generation-funnel.png\" alt=\"Demand generation funnel\" width=\"717\" height=\"476\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via neilpatel.com<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Demand generation, like <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/13\/tracking-conversions-in-adwords\">conversion paths<\/a>, can (and should) be thought of as a funnel. Demand generation begins by identifying audiences that are likely to be receptive to the marketing messaging of a brand, before shepherding prospects through a funnel that addresses every stage of the conversion process. However, unlike <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/23\/inbound-lead-generation\">inbound marketing<\/a> or traditional conversion paths (both of which play a part in the process), demand generation aligns marketing closely with sales to accomplish these goals.<\/p>\n<p>Think of demand generation as a long-term relationship between a brand\u2019s marketing and sales teams, and prospective customers. Demand generation starts by identifying and qualifying prospective customers through content and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/05\/inbound-marketing-examples\">inbound marketing<\/a>, direct response and email campaigns, and events, before passing these leads to a nurturing team. This team then further qualifies these prospects through scoring systems depending on the stage at which the prospect is in the conversion funnel, before passing these highly qualified, nurtured leads onto the sales team.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/demand-generation-diagram.gif\" alt=\"Demand generation diagram\" width=\"668\" height=\"231\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via leadsmarketer.net<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Demand Generation vs. Lead Generation<\/h2>\n<p>Although demand generation and traditional <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/09\/23\/get-more-leads-with-ppc\">lead generation<\/a> might seem very similar, there\u2019s actually an important distinction between the two.<\/p>\n<p>Some businesses are indiscriminate when it comes to leads and what qualifies a prospect as a lead. Someone who merely visits a website, for example, might be considered a lead to some companies. This is especially true of businesses that rely on high-volume cold-calling to generate new businesses \u2013 think those annoying companies that call you up to try and sell you steak knives.<\/p>\n<p>However, demand generation identifies potential prospects based on their initial actions and takes them through a (oftentimes lengthy) nurturing process to provide sales teams with much higher quality, genuinely qualified leads. This results in better conversations between sales reps and prospects, and \u2013 of course \u2013 higher conversion rates and more sales.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/demand-generation-lead-nurturing.png\" alt=\"Demand generation lead nurturing\" width=\"450\" height=\"300\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Essentially, the greatest difference between demand generation and lead generation is that demand gen is a significantly more comprehensive process that takes place over a much greater span of time than lead generation, involves close collaboration and communication between sales and marketing departments, and incorporates elements of inbound, direct, and email marketing to nurture prospects while offering them the material they need to learn more about how you can solve their problems.<\/p>\n<h2>9 Demand Generation Strategies for New Brands<\/h2>\n<p>So, now we have a better idea of what demand generation is, how can you, as a new or smaller brand, go about implementing it? Here are nine demand generation strategies you can start using right now.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Give Away Your Best Stuff<\/h3>\n<p>Whether it\u2019s a content download, a free offer, or another promotional campaign, be sure to only give away your very best stuff. Although this might seem counterintuitive, consistently offering giveaways of real value has several benefits.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/demand-generation-give-away-your-best-stuff.png\" alt=\"Demand generation HubSpot infographic content download\" width=\"1043\" height=\"518\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>One of HubSpot\u2019s most successful content downloads,<br \/>\nwhich has been downloaded thousands of times.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Firstly, it creates <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/05\/customer-testimonials\">a sense of trust<\/a> between your audience and your brand, which means they\u2019re more likely to come back to your content or your website. Secondly, it reflects well on your brand \u2013 so much so that enthusiastic prospects may take things one step further and advocate for your brand on your behalf, becoming the elusive \u201cbrand ambassadors\u201d companies are always talking about. Lastly, by offering something of real value, your visitors are much more likely to part with whatever information you need to begin qualifying them as a viable lead, the first stage in the demand generation process.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Provide a Free Tool, App, or Resource<\/h3>\n<p>One of the most effective ways to create a successful demand generation campaign as a new brand is by offering a free tool or resource.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/demand-generation-adwords-performance-grader.png\" alt=\"Demand generation AdWords Performance Grader\" width=\"1220\" height=\"812\" \/><\/div>\n<p>WordStream implemented this strategy back in 2011 when we launched the <a href=\"\/google-adwords?camplink=ProductsGraders&amp;campname=APG\">AdWords Performance Grader<\/a>. This completely free tool has not only proven a remarkably strong demand generation tool, but also helped thousands of advertisers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/pay-per-click-audit\">audit their PPC accounts<\/a> and take action to improve the strength of their campaigns. This reinforces our first strategy of giving away your best stuff, and makes WordStream a valuable resource for advertisers.<\/p>\n<p>Over the years, we\u2019ve graded billions of dollars in AdWords spend (<a href=\"\/bing-ads?camplink=ProductsGraders&amp;campname=BPG\">and now Bing Ads, too<\/a>), which has helped us strengthen and solidify our position as one of the PPC industry\u2019s most trusted go-to resources for PPC help, advice, and news.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, developing a free tool (or app) isn\u2019t cheap, and there are overheads you\u2019ll have to consider, such as development budgets. However, we\u2019ve found that these overheads pale in comparison to the value the AdWords Performance Grader has offered advertisers, and its place in our own demand generation strategy.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Use Lookalike Audiences on Facebook<\/h3>\n<p>For our third demand generation strategy, I\u2019m going to assume that you\u2019re already <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/10\/14\/advertising-on-facebook\">advertising on Facebook<\/a> (and if you aren\u2019t, it really is time to reevaluate that) and instead recommend one of the most powerful targeting strategies on the platform, which is <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/28\/facebook-ad-targeting\">lookalike audiences<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/demand-generation-facebook-lookalike-audiences.png\" alt=\"Demand generation Facebook lookalike audiences\" width=\"543\" height=\"416\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As their name suggests, lookalike audiences are custom audiences that closely resemble users that have already expressed an interest in your products, services, or content, based on demographic and behavioral similarities. Facebook allows you to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/08\/05\/effective-facebook-ads-for-lead-generation\">upload custom audiences<\/a> created using data you\u2019ve already gathered from your actual users, and create lookalike audiences that share many of the same characteristics.<\/p>\n<p>One of the key advantages of lookalike audiences is that it allows you to essentially double the potential reach of your Facebook advertising campaigns by leveraging the vast wealth of data that Facebook has on its users. The larger the custom audience you upload, the more widely you can cast your net using lookalikes. Given how much time people spend on Facebook, this targeting feature is one of your most powerful demand generation strategies, and one we recommend you start using right away.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Partner with Industry Superstars on Webinars<\/h3>\n<p>Some brands (again, particularly tech companies and startups) phone it in when it comes to webinars. Sure, they\u2019re relatively easy to produce and don\u2019t have much of a production overhead, but if you don\u2019t give webinars your all, why would anyone pay attention to them?<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/demand-generation-webinar-partners.jpg\" alt=\"Demand generation webinar partners\" width=\"638\" height=\"479\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Larry has worked with some of the biggest names in digital marketing on his webinars.<br \/>\nCheck out the slide deck from this webinar with Rand Fishkin on <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/WordStream\/wordstream-moz-present-how-content-marketing-really-works-webinar\"><em>content remarketing here<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/26\/how-to-do-a-webinar\">webinars<\/a> are going to be a part of your demand generation strategy, you need to go all in, and only partner with the superstars of your industry on webinars. Doing so will increase your standing in your industry, forge valuable connections with <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/26\/influencer-marketing\">key influencers<\/a>, and boost your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/10\/brand-awareness\">brand awareness<\/a> \u2013 all crucial elements of an ongoing demand generation strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, partnering with industry rock stars isn\u2019t as easy as simply emailing Guy Kawasaki and asking him to join your next webinar. Establishing relationships takes time and effort, and initially, it might not be possible to snag the speakers you want. However, when planning and producing webinars, you should strive to feature the most respected, well-known guests you can, and \u2013 see our first point \u2013 give away your best tips, advice, and strategies during the webinars themselves.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Use Managed Placements in Display Campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>These days, display advertising sometimes gets a bad rap. Display certainly has its limitations (and unique advantages), but many advertisers overlook the power of Managed Placements in their <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/18\/google-display-network-tips\">Display Network<\/a> campaigns.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/demand-generation-managed-placements.png\" alt=\"Demand generation Google Managed Placements\" width=\"644\" height=\"233\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via Google<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not familiar with them, <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adwords\/answer\/2470108\">Managed Placements<\/a> allow advertisers to control the audience their display ads are shown to more effectively by specifying where their ads appear, limiting their reach to individuals who are more likely to respond positively to them. Think of them as a more targeted approach to display, rather than the somewhat scattershot approach of regular display ads.<\/p>\n<p>As the primary purpose of display campaigns is to raise brand awareness, display can be a highly effective part of a wider demand generation campaign. You\u2019re not necessarily looking for conversions from display (though it\u2019s always nice), but rather increasing mindshare and promoting your brand, both of which are strengths of display campaigns. With Managed Placements, you get these benefits combined with additional control over who sees your ads, which can make this ad type even more effective.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Leverage the Power of Display Remarketing to Build Brand Awareness<\/h3>\n<p>To many marketers, remarketing is a powerful strategy for increasing conversion rates. While you should be remarketing with a view to increasing conversions, remarketing is also a remarkably powerful brand awareness-building tool.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/demand-generation-display-remarketing.jpg\" alt=\"Demand generation Display remarketing\" width=\"514\" height=\"282\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via Google<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Larry outlined this principle in <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/10\/01\/remarketing-facts\">a recent post about remarketing<\/a>, and provided an example from WordStream\u2019s traffic that excellently illustrates the power of this technique. As Larry explains, a few years ago, we discovered that while we were doing a great job of attracting new traffic to the site, we weren\u2019t doing so well when it came to retaining or converting this traffic. In fact, Larry says that most of WordStream\u2019s traffic came to the site through non-branded organic search and didn\u2019t convert. Most users visited the site just once before leaving, never to return. That\u2019s when we started using display remarketing.<\/p>\n<p>As you can see in the figure below, once we implemented display remarketing as a brand awareness-building strategy, we dramatically increased conversion rates over time:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/demand-generation-display-remarketing-graph.png\" alt=\"Demand generation display remarketing graph\" width=\"1015\" height=\"479\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Using direct traffic as a proxy for branded search terms, we found that after implementing display remarketing to promote the AdWords Performance Grader (see demand generation strategy number 2), we managed to increase repeat visitors by 50%, increased conversion rates by 51%, and increased our average time-on-site by an amazing 300%!<\/p>\n<h3>7. Invest (More) in Content Creation<\/h3>\n<p>Inbound marketing is a huge part of a successful demand generation strategy, and content creation has never been more important.<\/p>\n<p>A solid content strategy for demand generation purposes incorporates elements of some of our previous recommendations, including giving away only your very best stuff and providing your audience with an invaluable go-to resource. Similarly, content is most definitely a long-term investment, just like demand generation itself. Success requires consistent effort \u2013 something that many businesses fail to do when it comes to content.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/demand-generation-quality-content.png\" alt=\"Demand generation quality content\" width=\"469\" height=\"159\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>\u2026 And counting. Check out the live count <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldometers.info\/blogs\/\"><em>here<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re already publishing blog posts regularly, think about how you can make them even more valuable. Do they incorporate original data or research, or just regurgitate what everyone else has already said? Do they provide timely insight into emerging trends, or are your posts always late to the party? Essentially, ask yourself some hard questions about <em>why<\/em> someone should spend their precious time reading <em>your<\/em> content, compared to that of your competitors.<\/p>\n<p>At WordStream, we\u2019ve invested a great deal of time, money, and effort in our content, but success didn\u2019t happen overnight. It took several years of hard work before our efforts really started to pay off, and we\u2019ve continued to invest in content as a crucial element in our demand generation strategy. Don\u2019t phone it in when it comes to content \u2013 double down and only publish the very best content you possibly can.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Optimize Your Email Marketing Strategies<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/12\/is-email-marketing-effective\">Email marketing<\/a> can be an incredibly powerful component of your demand generation campaigns, but far too many advertisers misuse it or fail to harness its potential.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/demand-generation-optimize-email-campaigns.png\" alt=\"Demand generation optimize email campaigns\" width=\"1031\" height=\"775\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via Optimizely<\/em><\/p>\n<p>When it comes to email marketing, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/06\/16\/ab-testing-tips\">A\/B testing<\/a> is essential, and the adage that \u201cLess is more\u201d most definitely applies. If you resort to carpet-bombing your email list on a regular basis, you risk turning prospective customers off and harming your brand. Rather than blasting your lists all the time, work smarter, not harder.<\/p>\n<p>Everything about your email campaigns can (and should) be A\/B tested to ensure your emails are performing as strongly as they possibly can. Everything from headline length and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/31\/email-subject-lines\">subject line copy<\/a> to linking strategies and offer placements should be tested so that you can make informed decisions about your email campaigns based on hard data rather than assumptions.<\/p>\n<p>You should also incorporate demand generation strategy number one \u2013 only give away your best stuff \u2013 when it comes to email marketing. Constantly spamming your database with low-value offers is a surefire way to drive your subscribers crazy (and tempt them to click \u201cunsubscribe\u201d), but if you offer your list your very best tools, resources, and offers in your emails, you\u2019ll soon have your prospects looking forward to hearing from you.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Consider Implementing a Lead Scoring System<\/h3>\n<p>Demand generation isn\u2019t just about increasing the quantity of leads for your brand, but also raising the <em>quality<\/em> of those leads. Lead scoring is one of the best ways to ascertain whether your leads are of the quality your sales team needs to close more deals.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/demand-generation-lead-scoring.jpeg\" alt=\"Demand generation lead scoring diagram\" width=\"700\" height=\"210\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Lead scoring evaluates the historical behavior of your prospects and the actions they\u2019ve taken while interacting with your brand to determine whether the individual prospect demonstrates sufficient interest to be considered a \u201chot\u201d lead for your sales team. This is accomplished by examining the actions taken at various touchpoints with your brand, such as whether they viewed a specific page on your site that suggests purchase intent, whether they\u2019ve expressed interest in a demonstration of your product or used your free tools, or the stage at which the prospect happens to be in the funnel (such as discovery vs. consideration). Lead scoring can also evaluate the strength of the lead by assessing the individual\u2019s role in an organization, such as their level of decision-making responsibility and seniority in the company.<\/p>\n<p>However, while lead scoring can be tempting, it may not necessarily be right for your brand. For example, if you\u2019re struggling to generate enough leads for your sales team in the first place, it\u2019s probably a little premature to be worrying about scoring the leads you do have. However, for brands hoping to take their demand generation strategies to the next level, lead scoring may be worth considering.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Demand generation is crucial for companies of all sizes, especially new brands and startups.
