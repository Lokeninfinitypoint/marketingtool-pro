Like a character in a movie, surrounded by a softly glowing wall of CCTV monitors, we can see the minutia of our contacts\u2019 lives while offering very little \u2013 if anything \u2013 in return.<\/p>\n<p>Although the stereotype of the \u201coversharing\u201d Facebook user remains prevalent (and we all know at least one person like that), it\u2019s not as common as you might think. In fact, many people share original content or updates of their own infrequently.<\/p>\n<p>Data from Pew Research Center indicates that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only 10% of Facebook users update their status once per day<\/li>\n<li>Only 4% of Facebook users update their status more than once per day<\/li>\n<li>Approximately 25% of Facebook users either never or rarely change their status<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So what does this mean? Well, it depends on the personality type of the user in question.<\/p>\n<h3>5 Major Personality Traits of Facebook Users<\/h3>\n<p>With more than 1.5 billion monthly active users, Facebook is the largest social network in the world by a fair country distance. With such a broad global audience, you could be forgiven for assuming that there would be dozens (or more) of different psychological profiles among Facebook\u2019s user base. While this may be true, there are just five predominant personality traits evident in the behavior of Facebook users, traits known in psychology circles as the fundamental dimensions of personality. They are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Agreeableness<\/li>\n<li>Conscientiousness<\/li>\n<li>Extraversion<\/li>\n<li>Openness<\/li>\n<li>Neuroticism<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>Note: Use of \u201cextraversion\u201d above is intentional, and not a typo. For more on the fascinating (if you\u2019re a word nerd) etymology of \u201cextraversion\u201d versus the more common and traditional \u201cextroversion,\u201d read <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.scientificamerican.com\/beautiful-minds\/the-difference-between-extraversion-and-extroversion\/\"><em>this article at Scientific American<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Obviously, even the most boring person has a multidimensional personality. Nobody is limited to just one or two of the above traits \u2013 they\u2019re evident in all of us to some degree, and this often changes depending on the situation. However, whichever of these traits is the most dominant in a person\u2019s personality can and does influence how they will behave on Facebook.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5be9b18f-3556-45be-a825-41928db2c1fe\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/psychology-of-facebook-ads-compulsive-checking.jpg\" alt=\"Psychology of Facebook ads compulsive checking\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>By examining Facebook status updates through the lens of the five major personality traits, researchers at Brunel University in England were able to identify, with reasonable accuracy, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0191886915003025\">the types of updates that people post depending on their personality type<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Agreeable<\/strong> people tend to be more helpful, cooperative, and have better interpersonal relationships. As such, agreeable people often use Facebook to maintain genuine relationships on Facebook, with an emphasis on authentic, genuine interactions and maintaining communication with people they value. In addition, agreeable people were the least likely to speak badly of others on Facebook.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Conscientious<\/strong> people are often responsible, have a strong work ethic, and are often highly organized. Conscientious people typically use Facebook less frequently than less conscientious people, but when they do use it, they tend to be more discrete and steer clear of controversial topics. Conscientious people also tend to avoid badmouthing others on Facebook.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Extraverts<\/strong>, unsurprisingly, post and update their Facebook status the most frequently. These upbeat, talkative, generally positive people make use of Facebook features that encourage frequent updates and communication (such as Messenger), and update their status more often as a means of socializing with their often-large social networks.<\/li>\n<li>People who exhibit high levels of <strong>openness <\/strong>also update their status on Facebook and share content frequently. However, unlike extraverts, people with strongly open personalities tend to prefer the exploration of new intellectual ideas through Facebook rather than casual socializing. This type of user also uses Facebook (and other social media platforms) to find and learn new information.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Neurotics<\/strong> tend to display traits and behaviors that are perceived negatively, such as low self-esteem and, in more extreme cases, heightened paranoia. Neurotic users are more likely to post updates about their romantic relationships to preemptively offset perceptions that their relationships are weak, or to seek affirmation and attention. Neurotic individuals are also more likely to go off on personal rants on Facebook, as neuroticism is closely correlated with anxiety and greater sensitivity to perceived threats.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Based on this research, we can see predictable (and likely familiar, if you use Facebook) patterns beginning to emerge from even the most rudimentary analysis of Facebook user behavior. It\u2019s no surprise that extraverts are more likely to exhibit narcissistic tendencies than agreeable individuals, or that neurotics are more likely to seek validation from their social networks to overcome their perceived shortcomings.<\/p>\n<p>However, there\u2019s another entirely separate psychological mechanism that also has a strong influence on how people use Facebook \u2013 reward.<\/p>\n<h3>The Psychological Rewards of Using Facebook<\/h3>\n<p>We don\u2019t just use Facebook to keep tabs on ancient nemeses from high school or rant about the latest atrocities from the campaign trail \u2013 we use it because it\u2019s rewarding, and we get a tangible sense of accomplishment from using it.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a98ed3cb-f6df-4047-af9e-c70d045b57d3\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/psychology-of-facebook-ads-rat-maze-cheese.jpg\" alt=\"Psychology of Facebook ads rat in a maze\" width=\"1000\" height=\"787\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Like rats hunting for food pellets in a maze, we use Facebook because we develop a reward system over time; a system that our brain adapts to and begins to crave.<\/p>\n<p>Researchers in Germany explored this reward relationship in <a href=\"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fnhum.2013.00439\/full\">a landmark study published in 2013<\/a> that used imagery of participants\u2019 brains to identify \u2013 and predict \u2013 behaviors observed among Facebook users.<\/p>\n<p>Published in the scientific journal <em>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience<\/em>, the paper examined responses in a specific part of the brain known as the <em>nucleus accumbens, <\/em>a region of the brain that processes feelings of reward associated with food, sex, money, and social status.

Virtually any product you can think of has been positioned in a way that makes us want something because of the perceived status that product or service confers upon us. Even something as mundane as breakfast cereal is often positioned in an aspirational way. Whenever you see people on TV eating breakfast cereal, chances are they\u2019re sitting in an immaculately clean, airy kitchen in a large house, leisurely indulging in a bowl of oatmeal or whatever. They\u2019re definitely <em>not<\/em> trying to get the kids to cooperate in time for the school bus, or sitting in a cramped, dingy kitchen in a crowded one-bedroom apartment surrounded by dirty dishes.<\/p>\n<p>We want the kind of life in which we can take our time to enjoy a delicious, well-balanced breakfast before we start our day, and so that cereal becomes part of the wider lifestyle we want to buy, making it considerably more appealing.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"86647fbd-0f25-4833-b946-657b41a5d9d4\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/psychology-of-facebook-ads-idealized-family-breakfast.jpg\" alt=\"Psychology of Facebook ads idealized family breakfast\" width=\"600\" height=\"411\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>\u201cEVERY morning is like this at our house!\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Even \u201cquirky\u201d ads that try to make us laugh or intrigue us with their weirdness (think of those awful State Farm ads with the late-night calls to the guy in the khakis, for example) share these aspirational qualities. The houses in these ads are all the same \u2013 perfectly clean show homes with enormous rooms and Restoration Hardware furniture, perfectly manicured lawns flanked by brand-new cars at the end of paved, heated driveways, and attractive, successful neighbors we\u2019d actually want to invite over for margaritas on a Saturday afternoon.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, it\u2019s all bullshit \u2013 but we buy into it anyway, whether we\u2019re consciously aware of it or not. Even if we <em>know<\/em> it\u2019s bullshit, we\u2019re complicit in the acknowledgement that the lifestyles we see in TV ads are considered the \u201cideal\u201d, even if these artificial lifestyles bear no resemblance to our actual lives.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s kind of depressing, if you think about it.<\/p>\n<h2>The Psychology of Advertising: 4 Ways to Get Inside Your Customers\u2019 Head<\/h2>\n<p>So, now we know how predictably emotionally malleable we are in the hands of modern advertising, let\u2019s take a look at some examples of how psychological triggers can be used to great effect in social media advertising.<\/p>\n<h3>Strike Terror into the Heart of Your Audience<\/h3>\n<p>In many situations, it\u2019s much easier to provoke a visceral reaction to something in a person by manipulating negative emotions, and fear can be among the most powerful.<\/p>\n<p>The ad example below, for a snoring\/sleep apnea product, is a great example:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"56c25c68-f846-4083-805f-bf06618b5123\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/psychology-of-facebook-ads-fear-example.png\" alt=\"Psychology of Facebook ads fear example\" width=\"554\" height=\"455\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Although I can\u2019t speak for the quality of the actual product being sold here, the ad is pretty effective. For one, it likely blends in well with the kind of organic content your friends and family share in their News Feed \u2013 you know, the alarmist tabloid headlines, the forgettable clickbait from BuzzFeed. However, what really makes this ad eye-catching is the juxtaposition of the imagery with the language.<\/p>\n<p>The hero image \u2013 a man lying in bed, securing a ventilation mask to his face with straps \u2013 is pretty powerful. This guy\u2019s bedtime routine looks a lot different than mine, and not in a good way. However, we\u2019re told that \u201cSnoring and sleep apnea can be fatal.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Most people don\u2019t have sleep apnea, but snoring? That\u2019s another thing entirely, <em>and now it can kill you?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>At the very least, I\u2019m intrigued, at least for a couple of moments. That said, I pretty much lost interest when the copy led with \u201cResearchers say\u2026\u201d As you may have heard, a lot of scientific papers <a href=\"http:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/349\/6251\/aac4716\">are actually bullshit<\/a> \u2013 especially psychological studies \u2013 or at the very least <a href=\"http:\/\/gizmodo.com\/john-oliver-explains-why-so-many-scientific-studies-see-1775481925\">feel like bullshit<\/a>, so I\u2019m never particularly keen to indulge this kind of informercial-style advertising.

For starters, this is exactly the kind of clickbait article that gets shared thousands of times (especially on Facebook), but it doesn\u2019t take long to get to the real motivator of the ad, which is the fear that you could be accidentally exposed to a blood disease in these 13 weird places.<\/p>\n<p>Some argue that the effectiveness of clickbait is diminishing, and they\u2019re right. Audiences are becoming a lot savvier when it comes to clickbait, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2014\/03\/the-curiosity-gap-is-closing-says-upworthy\/359541\/\">the so-called \u201ccuriosity gap\u201d is closing<\/a>, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not still an extraordinarily powerful technique if you can get under your audience\u2019s skin (bad pun most definitely intended). I\u2019d love to see the stats on this ad.<\/p>\n<p>However, one of the best examples of using fear in a Facebook ad campaign came courtesy of our own Erin Sagin, who sent me a link to this ad:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d38a6524-f937-4bdf-bd9e-601000863f1d\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/psychology-of-facebook-ads-fear-example-3.png\" alt=\"Psychology of Facebook ads fear example\" width=\"417\" height=\"582\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>What\u2019s most interesting to me about this ad is the way in which it appeared to Erin in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>Erin told me that she had recently booked a trip to Panama, and that she had also been conducting a great deal of online research into the Zika virus, a potentially deadly infection that can cause terrible birth defects in children that has been a major public health concern in Panama. It was only after this research that Erin began to see this ad in her News Feed.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, there\u2019s no mention of the Zika virus anywhere in this ad, but the implications are there \u2013 Zika\u2019s primary transmission vector is mosquito bites. For Erin, the result (and the timing) was quite powerful. It\u2019s also a great example of how ad campaigns can be subtly tied to ongoing current events to create powerful ads that reflect public concerns and anxieties.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RELATED:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/23\/influence-buyers-marketing-psychology\">7 Easy Marketing Psychology Tactics to Influence Customers<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Enraged, Outraged, Engaged: Harnessing Anger<\/h3>\n<p>Polls, quizzes, and other interactive elements seem to do really well on Facebook, not least those that provoke an angry response from \u201carmchair activists\u201d \u2013 you know, those people on Facebook who are always posting updates about climate change, shrinking ice caps, endangered animals, and similarly polarizing environmental and social issues.<\/p>\n<p>Although appealing to this demographic can be challenging (and may not necessarily be relevant to your business), the examples below expertly demonstrate how leveraging outrage and anger can be a powerful motivator in Facebook ads. Let\u2019s take a look at this example from Greenpeace:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3ca23534-8138-4ae3-af8f-b9c153152aec\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/psychology-of-facebook-ads-outrage-example.png\" alt=\"Psychology of Facebook ads outrage\" width=\"530\" height=\"514\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>This ad wins on several levels. Firstly, it\u2019s highly timely, focusing on a specific item of legislation that was being considered by President Obama (spoiler alert: Obama suspended plans to drill most of the Arctic waters, but not all of them), making it a tempting way for Facebook users to show their friends how environmentally conscious they are.<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, the CTA is bold, and superimposed upon a strong hero image of Greenpeace activists in action. The copy singles out Shell Oil by name, setting the stage for the conflict that drives these kinds of news stories and engaging the viewer in a wider struggle, as well as creating urgency by selectively using uppercase copy to highlight the imminent threat posed by the proposed drilling.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s another ad that flirts with controversy and leverages a hot-button issue, from Planned Parenthood:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"719a2afe-8128-4b60-b058-fc502e9a9ae4\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/psychology-of-facebook-ads-outrage-example-2.png\" alt=\"Psychology of Facebook ads outrage example\" width=\"591\" height=\"481\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Few political talking points are as controversial or inflammatory as women\u2019s access to healthcare, and the manufactured scandal surrounding Planned Parenthood was one of the most widely covered events of last year. This ad urges the viewer to take action and voice their opposition to plans to defund Planned Parenthood, and aligns closely with the type of news content often seen in Facebook News Feeds.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, it\u2019s a simple ad, but the advertiser is relying on people already having strong opinions on the matter to make an impact with minimal copy and a simple hero image. Regardless, this ad is a great example of how you can motivate people to take action with minimal cues and raise awareness of important issues in a timely manner.<\/p>\n<h3>Make Your Audience Feel Warm and Fuzzy (Then Make Them Feel Bad)<\/h3>\n<p>So far, the examples (and their associated emotional triggers) that we\u2019ve focused on have been for negative emotional responses. However, while these levers can be extraordinarily powerful, so too is the ability to make your audience feel all warm and fuzzy inside.<\/p>\n<p>Take a look at this ad from Natural Dog Health and Wellness:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"38364544-1942-42ae-9e70-c6b3f52d506f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/psychology-of-facebook-ads-dog-example.png\" alt=\"Psychology of Facebook ads dog ad example\" width=\"531\" height=\"520\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The hero image of this ad, with the morose-looking dog, is powerfully effective. Even if you\u2019re not a dog person, it\u2019s hard not to empathize with this poor old dog. If you do have a dog \u2013 and a dog with arthritis \u2013 I\u2019d imagine this ad would be extraordinarily compelling.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I can\u2019t speak to the effectiveness or reliability of the business or the product, but an example of how to tug on your audience\u2019s heart strings, it\u2019s pretty damned great \u2013 as those impressive engagement metrics indicate.<\/p>\n<p>This same psychological technique can be exploited in another way too, though. Check out this ad for animal rights advocacy website Care2:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"e375a106-2331-43af-93a6-92eb306ca3aa\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/psychology-of-facebook-ads-sadness-example.png\" alt=\"Psychology of Facebook ads sadness example\" width=\"589\" height=\"558\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>This ad is not messing around. The copy that precedes the hero image doesn\u2019t pull its punches, and uses extremely provocative language to grab your attention and start pushing those buttons. The image itself is heartbreaking \u2013 who could stand idly by while this sweet animal suffers? \u2013 and even the closing copy is powerfully direct.<\/p>\n<h3>Help Your Audience Visualize Themselves As Their Ideal Self<\/h3>\n<p>We talked about the importance of aspirational messaging earlier in the post, but it bears repeating \u2013 helping your audience see themselves (and their lives) as better than they really are is one of the most effective psychological techniques you can use when advertising on Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>Check out this ad for Virgin America:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"aba9bf9a-7299-4567-80f5-4ec1a8ae6736\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/psychology-of-facebook-ads-aspirational-virgin-america-ad.png\" alt=\"Psychology of Facebook ads aspirational example\" width=\"520\" height=\"481\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>This ad, for Virgin America\u2019s First Class seats, leverages aspirational messaging to great effect. For one, these seats almost look like something you\u2019d expect to see in the VIP section of an exclusive nightclub. Who wouldn\u2019t want to envision themselves as a glamorous, international jet-setter? This ad appeals directly to people\u2019s desire to make aspirational purchases and highlights just how swank Virgin America\u2019s First Class cabins really are \u2013 clever.<\/p>\n<p>This type of aspirational messaging is especially prevalent in the automotive industry \u2013 and not just for selling the latest model of high-end SUV. Take a look at this ad from car rental company Zipcar:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"96bc63be-8a39-4909-8c90-7e159472fce8\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/psychology-of-facebook-ads-zipcar-example.png\" alt=\"Psychology of Facebook ads Zipcar example\" width=\"592\" height=\"284\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Obviously, this ad isn\u2019t perfect. There\u2019s a lot of wasted space in this ad, and the copy has been truncated in one section. The intact copy highlights the ease of using Zipcar as a service, as well as the benefits of membership. However, what\u2019s really clever is the image used, and the associated copy.<\/p>\n<p>Personally, I don\u2019t think going to the grocery store is much of an adventure (unless you count trying to survive Rhode Island\u2019s terrible drivers), and I never laugh as much as the people in the image when I\u2019m driving (unless one of the aforementioned terrible drivers gets pulled over). That said, Zipcar has leveraged aspirational messaging and an idealized view of motoring to convey that Zipcar isn\u2019t just a car rental service \u2013 it\u2019s a lifestyle business. Aesthetically, the ad is light, breezy, fun, and very compelling \u2013 pretty much everything driving isn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<h2>As Part of a Balanced, Aspirational Lifestyle<\/h2>\n<p>Hopefully, this post has given you some food for thought about what you can do to improve your own Facebook ad campaigns by thinking carefully about user psychology. Once you start thinking about how to leverage emotional and psychological triggers in your campaigns, you can start preparing for the increased interest in your business.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Leveraging psychological and emotional triggers can make your Facebook campaigns really stand out.
