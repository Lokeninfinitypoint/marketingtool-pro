These <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/12\/11\/core-values\">core values<\/a>, Ralph explained, were important for establishing standards as the company was rapidly growing:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>These values are the essence of our company. These are not just words on paper, but something we will strive hard to live by, and we expect you to hold us accountable to them.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Accountability was key here. The exercise could easily have been finished and filed away\u2014instead, we\u2019re still talking about these values years later, while making decisions for the product, while interviewing new hires, while on client calls.<\/p>\n<p>With the inception of the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/09\/company-core-values\">core values<\/a> came the employee recognition program, a venue to call out peers for exceptional work or exemplary portrayals of a particular value. Back then, this venue was a bulletin board with public notes:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"61854200-c550-4505-ba7e-1a4fffc0db46\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/core-values-examples-2.png\" alt=\"Core Values Story\" width=\"552\" height=\"350\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>WordStream has grown significantly since 2013, so the bulletin board system doesn\u2019t quite work anymore. But peer-based nominations have remained a big part of core value recognition. Our marketing team meetings always start off with a quick round of off-the-cuff core value recognitions. Each month, employees nominate each other for core value recognition in the company-wide meeting.<\/p>\n<p>And this year, WordStream held its first annual Core Value Awards.<\/p>\n<p>(Notice that\u2019s \u201cfirst annual\u201d already? More on that later.)<\/p>\n<h2>Recognizing exceptional employees<\/h2>\n<p>The goal of WordStream\u2019s Core Value Awards was simple: to celebrate exceptional employees.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere are different successes that we want to recognize and celebrate at WordStream,\u201d CEO Howard Kogan explains. \u201cSome of those things are business metrics. We recognize and celebrate someone retaining customers or making sales. We also celebrate customer-oriented wins, whether that\u2019s a customer\u2019s success or an outstanding customer relationship. But these core value awards are about celebrating employees, not for business metrics or customer wins, but for embodying the values of great teammates.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Naturally, then, the nominations were peer-based, too.<\/p>\n<p>With an anonymous, peer-driven nomination process, these awards wouldn\u2019t just be managers or execs recognizing the same visible, vocal high-performers. \u201cYou can be the quietest person in the room,\u201d Howard said, \u201cbut if you\u2019re a great teammate who embodies our values, your peers will acknowledge you and you can feel empowered to acknowledge them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And plenty of people took the opportunity to acknowledge their coworkers. <strong>The nominations amounted to over 41,000 words of praise and recognition.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Howard read through all of the nominations to select the winners, and he noticed clear patterns. Names submitted by multiple employees throughout departments and recurring themes in their nominations made selecting the award winners easy. And the best part? This was made clear during the award ceremony: \u201cThe moment after the winner\u2019s name was announced,\u201d Howard said. \u201cWhen people erupt and cheer\u2014not politely golf clapping, but yelling out, \u2018Yes!\u2019 or \u2018She deserves it!\u2019 That was the best part of the Core Value Awards.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And speaking of the awards&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>Some of the winners<\/h2>\n<p>The Core Value Awards recognized employee who embody each of WordStream\u2019s core values:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Authenticity<\/li>\n<li>Be great<\/li>\n<li>Take action<\/li>\n<li>Transparency<\/li>\n<li>Thought leadership<\/li>\n<li>Winning together<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There were also a few new categories, including new employees, teams, and an employee of the year.
