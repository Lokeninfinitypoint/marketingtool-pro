They can understand changing contexts and make decisions on their own to achieve a goal.<\/p>\n<p>You may be familiar with simple <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/chatbots\">AI chatbots<\/a>. AI agents can work similarly but with one distinct difference that sets them apart. An AI agent doesn\u2019t just reply to a query. It can learn from each interaction to improve its performance. As you\u2019ll see, that ability to adapt lets them take on very complex tasks.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/localiq-dash-ai-agent.webp\" alt=\"localiq ai agent\" width=\"976\" height=\"890\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-89271\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/localiq-dash-ai-agent.webp 976w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/localiq-dash-ai-agent-480x438.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 976px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/ai-lead-management\/?itm_source=localiq&amp;itm_medium=homepage\">LocaliQ\u2019s AI agent<\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span>helps business owners market to, manage, and respond to leads.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\ude80 <strong>How else can AI help your business?<\/strong> Get the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/emergency-ai-guide?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_AIMarketing_Download\">Emergency Guide to AI in Marketing<\/a> and find out.<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-do-ai-agents-work\"><\/div>\n<h2>How do AI agents work?<\/h2>\n<p>There are hundreds of unique AI agents, and each works a little differently. But at the most basic level, they follow four similar procedures.<\/p>\n<h3>Setting goals<\/h3>\n<p>AI agents are designed to achieve specific goals like scheduling appointments, optimizing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/10\/facebook-post-ideas\">social media content<\/a>, or managing the environmental controls of an office building. The first thing an agent will do is determine a goal.<\/p>\n<p>Goals can be provided by a user, or an AI agent can set its own goals that lead to a larger objective.<\/p>\n<h3>Collecting and understanding data<\/h3>\n<p>AI agents make decisions and provide an output based on the data they receive. Often, that means starting with an initial training data set (like a year\u2019s worth of customer service tickets). Then, the agent will continually collect more information through new interactions.<\/p>\n<p>Data can come from any number of sources. Some agents review <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/engaging-posts-on-social-media\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media posts<\/a>, news reports, customer transaction histories, and so on. The more recent and robust the data set, the better output you\u2019ll get from an AI agent.<\/p>\n<h3>Making decisions and predicting outcomes<\/h3>\n<p>Here\u2019s where the magic starts to happen. AI agents use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/tiktok-algorithm\">algorithms<\/a> and machine learning to make decisions and predictions based on all that data.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if your pizza restaurant used an autonomous delivery robot, it could:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Evaluate all the possible delivery routes available.<\/li>\n<li>Learn from each delivery to reduce time and risk.<\/li>\n<li>Adjust its actions based on past experience and current information (like maneuvering around a construction site or pausing for pedestrians).<\/li>\n<li>Predict potential outcomes like if it takes longer to deliver a pizza on three consecutive Monday evenings, it will predict a delay on future Monday evenings.<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/AI-agents-wordstream-customer-pizza.webp\" alt=\"AI agents - Pizza delivery robot.\" width=\"887\" height=\"553\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89254 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/AI-agents-wordstream-customer-pizza.webp 887w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/AI-agents-wordstream-customer-pizza-480x299.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 887px, 100vw\" \/><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/foodondemand.com\/09282023\/marcos-pizza-tests-self-driving-delivery-bots\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Pizza delivery robots<\/em><\/a><em> are powered by AI agents that have to make lots of decisions on the fly.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Learning autonomously<\/h3>\n<p>AI agents learn autonomously (without direct human intervention) and improve their performance after each interaction.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example. Say you launch a customer service AI agent on your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/08\/how-to-build-an-ecommerce-website\">ecommerce website<\/a>. You\u2019ve given it the goal of resolving customer inquiries satisfactorily and fed it some scripted responses to common questions.<\/p>\n<p>At first, the agent provides generic responses. After the initial interactions, it tracks customer satisfaction scores, resolution rates, and message sentiment. The agent identifies which responses led to the best results and refines its language and problem-solving approaches.<\/p>\n<div id=\"what-are-the-benefits-of-ai-agents\"><\/div>\n<h2>What are the benefits of using AI agents for your business?<\/h2>\n<p>AI agents can reason and self-check, making them capable of taking on more complex tasks at a scale humans can\u2019t. Here are a few of the biggest benefits you can get from these capabilities.<\/p>\n<h3>Save time and increase efficiency<\/h3>\n<p>With an AI agent, you can automate repetitive tasks and free up time for high-level work like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/07\/best-marketing-strategies\">creating strategies<\/a> or improving your products and services.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine if you tasked an AI agent with keeping track of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-lead-generation\">incoming leads<\/a>. It could summarize phone call transcripts, categorize leads by things like the service they want or location, and automatically create follow-up reminders for high-priority leads. That\u2019s hours of organizational work off your plate.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/AI-agents-wordstream-customer-Dash2.webp\" alt=\"AI agents - screenshot of Dash.\" width=\"713\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-89253\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/AI-agents-wordstream-customer-Dash2.webp 713w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/AI-agents-wordstream-customer-Dash2-480x404.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 713px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/ai-lead-management\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI agents<\/a> can learn about your business and reply to customers instantly, improving their experience.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Improve accuracy and consistency<\/h3>\n<p>Customers crave consistency. They want to get a reliable answer whenever they need it. AI agents can provide that level of consistency in a few ways. First, they can pull from a vast amount of data and process new data faster than humans without the fear of manual data entry mistakes.<\/p>\n<p>Second, AI agents can standardize and repeat a process identically every time. They remove some of the human variability from the equation.<\/p>\n<p>And third, an AI agent can track results in real time and flag inconsistencies quickly. They can even adjust workflows to reduce the chance of those inconsistencies happening again.<\/p>\n<p>They can do all this while operating 24\/7 so your customers get better answers without waiting until your business opens.<\/p>\n<h3>Give a competitive advantage<\/h3>\n<p>AI agents can collect and react to vast amounts of real-time data.

They\u2019re each suited for different purposes.<\/p>\n<h3>Simple reflex AI agents<\/h3>\n<p>As the name suggested, simple reflex agents are the most basic of the AI agent bunch. They operate on a simple \u201cif-this-then-that\u201d decision-making architecture.<\/p>\n<p>A smart thermostat that adjusts the environment in your shop is a good example of a reflex agent. It senses that the room temperature has dropped and starts the heater in response.<\/p>\n<h3>Model-based AI agents<\/h3>\n<p>Model-based AI agents are more complex. They not only respond to immediate inputs, but they also create a model of their environments and track changes as they happen. This additional capability allows model agents to predict potential outcomes before taking action.<\/p>\n<p>Think about that pizza delivery robot as a model-based agent. It doesn\u2019t just react to immediate inputs like a \u201cdon\u2019t walk\u201d sign. It remembers road rules, tracks how pedestrians act, and builds models from them\u2014all of which help it decide the best route to deliver fresh, hot pizza.<\/p>\n<h3>Goal-based AI agents<\/h3>\n<p>Goal-based AI agents are often even more advanced. They have the capability to consider existing conditions and multiple potential future conditions to decide which action will achieve a goal. Goal-based agents use reasoning to adapt to a new strategy if one is not working.<\/p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/16\/grow-your-digital-marketing-agency\">digital marketing agency<\/a> could use a goal-based agent to assess and prioritize potential client leads. The AI agent would:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Review website inquiries.<\/li>\n<li>Score them based on need fit and potential to close.<\/li>\n<li>Send an initial communication to each lead.<\/li>\n<li>Assign each lead based on their urgency and score.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/AI-agents-wordstream-customer-leadtalk.webp\" alt=\"AI agents - LeadTalk screenshot.\" width=\"687\" height=\"543\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89257 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/AI-agents-wordstream-customer-leadtalk.webp 687w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/AI-agents-wordstream-customer-leadtalk-480x379.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 687px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/leadtalk.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i>Source<\/i><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Utility-based AI agents<\/h3>\n<p>Utility-based AI agents are designed to handle situations with multiple competing outcomes. They assign a numerical score to each outcome and choose actions that maximize the overall benefit or reduce the overall harm.<\/p>\n<p>An inventory management system for a small business is an example of a utility-based AI agent. It has three competing goals:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prevent stock outages<\/li>\n<li>Maintain a high stock turnover<\/li>\n<li>Reduce the overall cost of goods<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The agent would learn from sales patterns and monitor changing vendor prices to buy each product at the optimal time and quantity to balance these objectives.<\/p>\n<h3>Learning-based AI agents<\/h3>\n<p>A learning-based AI agent is built to improve its performance through experience.

It even acts like a hiring coach by helping to prioritize the best candidates and seeking out prospects from pools of previous applicants or current employees.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/AI-agents-wordstream-workday-1.webp\" alt=\"AI agents - HiredScore AI screenshot.\" width=\"869\" height=\"566\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89263 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/AI-agents-wordstream-workday-1.webp 869w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/AI-agents-wordstream-workday-1-480x313.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 869px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.workday.com\/en-us\/products\/talent-management\/ai-recruiting.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>HR is an ideal use case for AI agents because it requires lots of repetitive paperwork and processes. Plus, AI agents are great at performing tasks without human error or variation, which makes the hiring and onboarding process more consistent for every applicant.<\/p>\n<div id=\"4-tips-for-ai-agents\"><\/div>\n<h2>4 tips for finding and using AI agents<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve reviewed lots of ways AI agents help businesses and shared several examples. The next step is to find the best AI agents for your business and get the most out of them.<\/p>\n<h3>Consider your needs<\/h3>\n<p>Step one is to review where you need help managing or <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-create-a-small-business-marketing-plan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing your business<\/a>. Ask questions like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where do I spend time on repetitive processes?<\/li>\n<li>How could an AI agent improve my customer\u2019s experience?<\/li>\n<li>What skillset do I not have access to?<\/li>\n<li>Where does my business lose money?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>With that list in hand, begin searching for AI agents that help solve those challenges.<\/p>\n<h3>Use free trials<\/h3>\n<p>Many AI agent plans include either a free tier or a free trial. Even if they don\u2019t, you could always ask the sales team if you can try their product for a month.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure you\u2019re ready to put some time into the trial. You don\u2019t want to use up three weeks of a 30-day trial before getting into the platform.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also a good idea to go in with a list of goals and experiments. For example, if you\u2019re trialing an accounting AI agent, you may want to know if it can accept payments from all the ways your customers pay.<\/p>\n<h3>Include human intervention<\/h3>\n<p>AI agents have come a long way, but they\u2019re not flawless. Once your tool is up and running, decide how and when you\u2019ll have a human review it. Test it out like your customers would review the output, and make sure it\u2019s still on track.<\/p>\n<h3>Create an AI use policy<\/h3>\n<p>Hopefully, your employees will embrace the AI agents you bring into your business. You want to make sure they\u2019re using it correctly and responsibly\u2014and that they\u2019re not using unapproved AI agents that aren\u2019t trained in your data.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why you\u2019ll want to create an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-policy\">AI use policy<\/a> upfront. You can keep it simple to start and add to it as new situations arise.<\/p>\n<h3>Set goals and measure progress<\/h3>\n<p>Don\u2019t forget you invested in an AI agent for a specific <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/15\/marketing-objectives\">objective<\/a>. Is it achieving it?<\/p>\n<p>The best way to know is to go into the process with a specific goal, like reducing customer support response time by 20%. Then, measure how you\u2019ve progressed against that goal.<\/p>\n<h2>Is your business ready for AI agents?<\/h2>\n<p>AI agents can seem a little science fiction-y. But they\u2019re not futuristic; they\u2019re here now and can make your business more efficient and profitable.<\/p>\n<p>Take a minute and think about where you would add an employee if money was no restraint, and look to see if an AI agent exists to handle that work. If not, wait about six months and check again. At the rate we\u2019re progressing, there\u2019ll likely be one soon. And if you\u2019re ready to close more leads faster,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/marketing-services?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Demo_Blog_Demo\"> contact us<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>AI agents are handy tools to help businesses grow.
