This sequence typically consists of multiple emails sent at strategic intervals, each with a specific <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/purpose-driven-marketing\">purpose<\/a> in guiding the lead toward your desired action.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/11\/03\/lead-nurturing\">lead nurture campaign<\/a> sequence typically works:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Trigger<\/strong>: Your prospective customer takes a specific action, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/11\/call-to-action-examples-for-email-newsletter-signups\">signing up for your email newsletter<\/a> or leaving your website without purchasing.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Segmentation<\/strong>: Email subscribers are categorized based on their characteristics, behaviors, or interests. These segments can then be used to deliver relevant content.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Automated delivery<\/strong>: Emails are sent automatically at predetermined intervals or in response to specific actions taken by the lead.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Progressive engagement<\/strong>: Each email in the sequence builds upon the previous one, providing relevant information to move the lead closer to conversion if the last email didn&#8217;t result in conversion.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Conversion opportunities<\/strong>: Every email includes a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/call-to-action-phrases\">call to action (CTA)<\/a> to take the desired action, whether making a purchase, downloading an app, starting a trial, or booking an appointment.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ongoing nurturing<\/strong>: Even after a conversion, you can continue nurturing customers to encourage them to return for another purchase.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/email-nurture-sequence-example.webp\" alt=\"email nurture sequence example\" width=\"377\" height=\"579\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87329\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/email-nurture-sequence-example.webp 377w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/email-nurture-sequence-example-195x300.webp 195w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 377px) 100vw, 377px\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"benefits-of-lead-nurturing-emails\"><\/div>\n<h2>Benefits of lead nurturing emails<\/h2>\n<p>Lead nurturing emails replace the &#8220;spray and pray&#8221; approach with personalized, relevant content that resonates with subscribers based on their interests and stage in the buying process.

Implement these best practices to develop lead nurture emails that build meaningful relationships with your prospects, ultimately leading to more conversions.<\/p>\n<h3>Segment your audience<\/h3>\n<p>One of the most powerful ways to improve the effectiveness of your lead-nurturing emails is through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.attentive.com\/blog\/email-marketing-segmentation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">audience segmentation<\/a>. By dividing your email list up based on specific criteria, your emails can be more relevant and personalized content for each subscriber.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few ways you can try segmenting your audience:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Demographics<\/strong>: Group subscribers based on characteristics like age, gender, location, or job title. These will be most effective if relevant to how different demographics interact with your business. For example, a gym could segment its mailing list by various age groups to promote tailored fitness programs\u2014like high-intensity workouts for younger adults and low-impact classes for seniors.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Behavior<\/strong>: Segment based on actions taken on your website, such as pages viewed, services and products browsed, or abandoned carts. This allows you to target leads based on the interests or intentions they&#8217;ve demonstrated through their interaction with your business. For instance, a bookstore could segment subscribers based on events they&#8217;ve booked attendance for and then send emails with relevant books to buy.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Purchase history<\/strong>: Categorize customers based on specific products or services they&#8217;ve bought or buying frequency. Then you can offer similar products and services in the future. For example, a hair salon could send <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-email-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">targeted emails<\/a> to clients who regularly book coloring services about new hair color trends to inspire their next visit. Or they can send clients a reminder to schedule their next appointment around when they usually book one.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Interests or preferences<\/strong>: Use data from surveys, quizzes, or <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-build-an-email-list\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">signup forms<\/a> to group subscribers based on their interests or needs. Then, you can send targeted content based on what they care about most. For example, a nutritionist can ask new email subscribers about their dietary goals (e.g., weight management, food allergies, sports nutrition, etc.). Then, they can send relevant content\u2014like how to discover food allergies\u2014that might ultimately lead potential customers to book a nutrition session.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/buyer-personas-example-definition.webp\" alt=\"buyer personas example - definition and benefits\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-74381\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/buyer-personas-example-definition.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/buyer-personas-example-definition-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Creating <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/25\/buyer-persona-examples\">buyer personas<\/a> can also help you segment your nurture campaigns.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Continue refining your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/11\/how-to-build-an-email-list\">email list segmentation<\/a> as you learn more about your customers to increase the likelihood of engagement and conversion.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f <strong>Want to understand who you should be targeting with your marketing?<\/strong> Download the guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteTargetAudience.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_TargetAudineceGuide_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\">How to Find Your Target Audience [Simple Steps!]<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Automate emails based on audience behavior<\/h3>\n<p>According to Klaviyo, automated email flows generate up to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.klaviyo.com\/marketing-resources\/email-benchmarks-by-industry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">30X<\/a> more revenue per recipient than one-time email marketing campaigns.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/01\/automated-email-marketing\">Automating your lead nurturing strategy<\/a> allows you to send timely, relevant emails based on your subscribers&#8217; specific actions.

Before the class, the bakery can send a confirmation email and a reminder a few days before the class with what to expect to ramp up excitement. After the class, they can send a follow-up email with at-home decorating tips based on what they learned and information about another relevant class to sign up for.<\/p>\n<h3>Craft compelling emails<\/h3>\n<p>Creating compelling lead-nurturing emails is crucial for engaging your audience and moving them toward conversion.<\/p>\n<p>Consider these key elements when creating your emails:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Design and layout<\/strong>: Create visually appealing emails that are easy to read and navigate. Use a clean, mobile-responsive design with a clear hierarchy of information.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Email copy<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/30\/business-email-templates\">Write concise, engaging copy<\/a> that speaks directly to your audience&#8217;s needs and interests. Use a conversational tone that feels appropriate for your brand and focus on the benefits to the reader.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Clickable subject lines<\/strong>: Craft attention-grabbing <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/email-subject-lines-for-sales\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">subject lines<\/a> that make recipients want to open your emails. Keep them short, clear, and relevant to the email content. Avoid clickbait\u2014not meeting a lead&#8217;s expectations could annoy them and harm your relationship.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Personalization<\/strong>: Go beyond using the recipient&#8217;s name. Personalize content based on their preferences, behavior, or purchase history to make your emails more relevant.<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/personalized-marketing-example-sephora.webp\" alt=\"personalize email lead nurture sequence\" width=\"823\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87332\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/personalized-marketing-example-sephora.webp 823w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/personalized-marketing-example-sephora-480x350.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 823px, 100vw\" \/><\/li>\n<li><strong>CTA<\/strong>: Include a single, clear CTA in each email to guide recipients toward the desired action. Giving them too many choices could result in no action at all.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Provide value, don&#8217;t just promote<\/strong>: Focus on delivering valuable content that helps your audience solve problems or learn something new. This builds trust and positions your brand as a valuable resource, not just a seller. Just keep it relevant to your business.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you remember one thing, it&#8217;s this: Create emails your subscribers would look forward to receiving, not just more promotional messages in their inbox.<\/p>\n<h3>Measure and optimize every element of your email nurture campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>To maximize the performance of your lead nurturing emails, you&#8217;ll want to continuously measure their performance and optimize based on the data you collect.<\/p>\n<p>Start by tracking key <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/email-marketing-kpis\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">email marketing metrics<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Engagement metrics<\/strong>: Monitor <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/19\/subject-line-mistakes\">open rates<\/a>, click-through rates, and unsubscribe rates to gauge how well your emails resonate with your audience.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Conversion metrics<\/strong>: Track actions taken after a subscriber clicks on your link, such as purchases made or appointments booked, to determine how effective your emails are at reaching your goals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Look for patterns in what <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/types-of-marketing-emails\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">types of emails<\/a>, subject lines, or content perform best. In your email sequences, identify any drop-off points where engagement decreases to determine if you need to update a specific email to make it more engaging or shorten the overall sequence.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/19\/conversion-rate-benchmarks\">conversion rate<\/a> is arguably the most important metric to optimize for. A high open rate doesn&#8217;t mean much if it doesn&#8217;t translate into purchases.<\/p>\n<p>Hypothesize what might improve performance in your emails, then run <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/11\/copywriting-ab-tests\">A\/B tests<\/a> to experiment with each element one at a time to see what works best.<\/p>\n<p>Test elements like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Copy variations<\/li>\n<li>Imagery<\/li>\n<li>Email layout<\/li>\n<li>Subject line alternatives<\/li>\n<li>Different offers or incentives<\/li>\n<li>CTA placement or wording<\/li>\n<li>Sending times<\/li>\n<li>Number of emails in a sequence<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Optimization will be an ongoing process.

These emails typically remind customers about what they left behind and sometimes include an incentive to buy or additional helpful information.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.republicoftea.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Republic of Tea<\/a> includes shipping information in their cart abandonment email:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/cart-abandonment-emails.webp\" alt=\"cart abandonment nurture email\" width=\"736\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87315\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/cart-abandonment-emails.webp 736w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/cart-abandonment-emails-480x390.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 736px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Effective abandonment emails have a few things in common. They:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/best-time-to-send-email-campaign\">Optimize email timing<\/a> so that the customer is still excited to buy, usually within a few hours\u2014use your A\/B tests to figure out the timing that gets you the most conversions!<\/li>\n<li>Use personalized content to surface the products and services your lead clicked on.<\/li>\n<li>Offer helpful information to address possible reasons why the lead didn&#8217;t purchase right away, like product reviews, FAQs, or shipping information.<\/li>\n<li>Always include a clear call to action to return to where the subscriber left off.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>By implementing abandonment email flows, you can recover potentially lost sales and provide a helpful reminder to customers who may have become distracted.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Replenishment reminder emails<\/h3>\n<p>Remember: Your existing customers are also leads. You need to continue building those relationships to bring first-time buyers back.<\/p>\n<p>Replenishment reminder emails are great for products that shoppers buy frequently, like coffee or hair products. These emails remind customers when it&#8217;s time to reorder their favorite products.<\/p>\n<p>The key to effective replenishment reminders is timing. You want to send the email when the customer is likely running low on the product but before they&#8217;ve had to go without or seek alternatives. You can use purchase history to estimate when customers typically need to repurchase a product.<\/p>\n<p>This replenishment reminder from skincare brand <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stratiaskin.com\/?srsltid=AfmBOopO3_kQKldtxxUKBPvQXqBFox3znml3FNOVqSeIj35tAwxvurc_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stratia<\/a> makes it easy for customers to head right to checkout with the last item they purchased:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/replinishment-nurture-email.webp\" alt=\"example of replinishment nurture email\" width=\"538\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87316\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/replinishment-nurture-email.webp 538w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/replinishment-nurture-email-480x534.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 538px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>4. Appointment reminder emails<\/h3>\n<p>Appointment reminder emails are similar to replenishment reminders but for service brands.<\/p>\n<p>Businesses like dental offices or auto shops, where customers constantly come back for another appointment, greatly benefit from these emails.<\/p>\n<p>Remind them when it&#8217;s time for their next appointment instead of waiting for them to book, which could result in less frequent appointments.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/missionvalleypetclinic.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mission Valley Pet Clinic<\/a> reminds pet owners when it&#8217;s time for a follow-up appointment:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/appointment-reminder-nurture-email.webp\" alt=\"appointment reminder nurture email from vet\" width=\"512\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87321\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/appointment-reminder-nurture-email.webp 512w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/appointment-reminder-nurture-email-480x563.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 512px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The email summarizes the last services and has a bold CTA button to book an appointment.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Post-purchase emails<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/post-purchase-emails\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Post-purchase emails<\/a> are essential for nurturing customer relationships, encouraging repeat business, and reducing buyer&#8217;s remorse (and returns). These emails can take various forms, each serving a specific purpose in the customer journey:<\/p>\n<h4>Order confirmation<\/h4>\n<p>Immediately after purchase or appointment booking, send an email thanking the customer and confirming the details.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.augustchiropractic.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">August Chiropractic<\/a> includes appointment details, cancellation policy, and clinic location:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/order-confirmation-nurture-email.webp\" alt=\"order confirmation nurture email\" width=\"590\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87322\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/order-confirmation-nurture-email.webp 590w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/order-confirmation-nurture-email-480x488.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 590px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Shipping and delivery confirmation<\/h4>\n<p>For physical products, keep customers up-to-date on their order status with shipping and delivery confirmations.
