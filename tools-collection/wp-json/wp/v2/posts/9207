Your marketing campaigns have paid off and you\u2019ve been inundated with fresh leads to hopefully turn into sales. That last part hinges on your ability to strategically and effectively follow up on those leads without letting any fall by the wayside or scare them off by coming on too strongly. And effectively following up means doing so multiple times. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketingdonut.co.uk\/sales\/sales-techniques-and-negotiations\/why-you-must-follow-up-leads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Marketing Donut<\/a>, 80% of sales leads require five follow-ups after the initial contact, but only 8% of salespeople actually follow up this many times.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-follow-up-with-sales-leads-stats-1.png\" alt=\"how-to-follow-up-with-sales-leads-stats\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Five times may sound like a lot, but if you approach your leads in the right manner, you can effectively communicate the right messaging to them that puts you in their favor. In this post, we\u2019re going to cover some tips on how to properly follow up with leads and increase your odds of turning them into repeat customers, including:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Segment your leads<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Respond in a timely fashion<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Nurture leads with useful content<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Personalize your communication<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Use various communication channels<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Create a follow-up schedule<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Track communications<\/li>\n<li>Learn when to abandon lost causes<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Sales lead follow-up best practices<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As you may already know, it\u2019s not only about when you follow up with your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/types-of-sales-leads\/\">sales leads<\/a> but also how you follow up with them. You need to consider their stage in your funnel, their pain points and needs, and the timing of your communication. Here are some best practices to help you effectively follow up with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ai-mode\">hot sales leads<\/a> and prospects to win more business.<\/p>\n<h3><strong><span lang=\"EN\">1. Segment your leads<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Each type of lead will require a different level of messaging. Depending on how the lead came to you, it may be hot and ready to close or may need a bit of warming. For example, a lead that comes to you by way of an email opt-in campaign as opposed to a lead that filled out a \u2018contact me\u2019 form on your webpage are at <a href=\"https:\/\/thrivehive.com\/the-marketing-funnel-a-5-step-recipe-for-success\/\">different points in the sales funnel<\/a> and should be approached accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Organize the leads into at least three groups: Hot, warm, and cold. Seems a bit remedial, but trust us, you\u2019ll want to take note of the leads\u2019 temperatures so that you don\u2019t treat them like one size fits all. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-follow-up-with-sales-leads-cold-warm-hot-funnel-1.png\" alt=\"how to follow up with sales leads cold warm hot funnel\" width=\"800\" height=\"525\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If you\u2019re interested in doing a more robust lead scoring initiative, there are software programs available that will separate your leads based on point values you assign to various consumer behaviors. Move leads from group to group as you get to know them better and move them closer to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/04\/nurture-marketing\">becoming a paying clien<\/a>t.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">2. Respond in a timely fashion<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Arrange for a thank you or welcome email or phone call to be made within 12-24 hours after a lead comes in. Offer to answer any questions they may have to demonstrate the care and attention you provide to each customer.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-follow-up-with-sales-leads-welcome-email-1.png\" alt=\"how to follow up with sales leads welcome email\" width=\"700\" height=\"941\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><strong>3. Nurture your leads with useful content<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>As is the case with any form of communication with your audience members, no matter what stage of the funnel they\u2019re in, you should always focus on adding value. Blog posts, infographics, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/29\/email-marketing-statistics\">helpful stats<\/a>, success stories, and downloadable guides are all great options. Your leads aren\u2019t going to become customers after one interaction, so focus on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/11\/03\/lead-nurturing\">nurturing the lead<\/a>, or \u201cwarming\u201d them. Rather than trying to get them to act in the form of converting into a customer, focus on smaller steps, like downloading that guide or visiting that blog post.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-follow-up-with-sales-leads-useful-content-1.png\" alt=\"how to follow up with sales leads useful content\" width=\"800\" height=\"508\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/small-business-email-examples-and-templates\/\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">4. Personalize your communication<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As you can see in the email example above, it\u2019s a good idea to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/06\/personalized-marketing\">personalize your correspondence <\/a><span lang=\"EN\">by including the recipient\u2019s name in your emails, sending them information based on the pages visited on your website, or responding personally to an online inquiry instead of pushing canned responses. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-follow-up-with-sales-leads-personalize-communication-1.png\" alt=\"how to follow up with sales leads personalize communication\" width=\"800\" height=\"506\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">5. Use various communication channels<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Leads have a preferred way of communicating and quite frankly, you have no idea what that is at this point.<a href=\"https:\/\/thrivehive.com\/ways-to-increase-social-media-engagement\/\"> Use social media<\/a>, email, snail-mail, and phone calls to connect with potential clients.<\/p>\n<p>We don\u2019t mean to reach out directly using every single communication tool you have! Just be sure that you\u2019re readily available no matter your lead\u2019s preferred medium. So, respond to social media messages quickly, answer your phone and return calls promptly, and check your inbox.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few of the communication methods you may try out:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Email<\/strong>: Emails are slightly less invasive than phone calls, and give the lead the opportunity to read and respond at their convenience. Yet given how many emails we get each day, the chances of your email getting lost in the shuffle are high, so it\u2019s important to follow up more than once. In your follow-ups, be sure to use intriguing and appropriate subject lines, and to offer useful content rather than just pitching your offerings.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Phone:<\/strong> Phone call conversations are a great way to show your prospect your expertise and demonstrate that you want what\u2019s best for them. However, you don\u2019t have the phone equivalent of an email subject line to catch your prospect\u2019s attention. In fact, you have the opposite&#8211;a foreign number appearing on their phone. With the phone call approach, it\u2019s important that you nail down your voicemail message so that you give your prospect a reason to call you back. Like emails, you\u2019ll also need to call more than once.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Text message:<\/strong> Sending text messages may be better for leads with whom you\u2019ve already communicated. Pay close attention to your conversations with them and base your follow up texts on those needs.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-follow-up-with-sales-leads-text-message-1.png\" alt=\"how to follow up with sales leads text message\" width=\"300\" height=\"647\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.textrequest.com\/blog\/text-you-should-send-warm-leads\/\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">6. Create a follow-up schedule<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Remember, it typically requires 7-10 touches before a <span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/31\/increase-conversions\">conversion<\/a> happens<span lang=\"EN\">. Creating a follow-up schedule will ensure you remain consistent with your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/21\/client-communication-during-covid-19\">communications<\/a> and prevent you from letting the leads you worked so hard to attain fall through the cracks. Your communications calendar should aim to keep you top of mind with your leads but not become a nuisance.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">For example, your schedule might look like this:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Emails: once per week<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Phone calls: once per month<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Face to face: once per quarter<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Anything more than that and you run the risk of getting the brush off.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-follow-up-with-sales-leads-follow-up-email-1.png\" alt=\"how to follow up with sales leads follow up email\" width=\"800\" height=\"303\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pipedrive.com\/en\/blog\/sales-follow-up-email-templates\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">7.

Learn when to abandon lost causes<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/06\/23\/how-to-qualify-ppc-leads\">Qualifying your leads<\/a> is a very important step and should be done as early as possible. Don\u2019t get trigger-happy and abandon leads because they may take a bit of work to close, but be smart about what you\u2019re chasing down. Three qualifying categories to consider:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Do they have the means to make a purchase?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Are they motivated?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Are they the decision-maker?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If you discover they\u2019re not qualified at this time, don\u2019t toss their info! Put them in a &#8220;to be followed up with later&#8221;\u00a0file and create a campaign to target those leads which you\u2019ve put on the back burner down the road when their circumstances may have changed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">Follow up with your sales leads the right way<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Lead prospecting is all about remaining in front of your clients without getting on their bad side \u2026 a sort of omnipresence, if you will. Your goal shouldn\u2019t necessarily be to convince them to buy, but rather to be there when they\u2019re ready to buy. This type of reliability bodes well for your brand and makes those leads feel respected and valued.
