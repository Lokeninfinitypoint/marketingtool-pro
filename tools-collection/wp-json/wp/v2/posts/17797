An estimated 20 million Americans, or one in every 12 adults, suffer from drug or alcohol addiction. These facts are important and difficult to dismiss. Addiction is a complicated disease with no simple cure. But nearly every recovery program agrees that the first step is to seek help. And as these 20 million Americans, their friends, and their families search for help, many turn to Google to find answers.<\/p>\n<p>However, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/20\/google-bans-government-documents-ads\">recent Google ad policy changes <\/a>complicate the picture of what results people get when they search for keywords related to rehab and drug treatment.<\/p>\n<p>According to a September 14 article in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/09\/14\/business\/google-addiction-treatment-ads.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">New York Times<\/a>, Google released a statement that the search engine has \u201cstarted restricting ads that come up when someone searches for addiction treatment on its site.\u201d Google cites that some rehab clinics advertising through Google Ads (formerly known as Google AdWords)\u00a0do not provide the quality care that addicts need to successfully overcome their disease. In response, Google claims to have \u201cstopped selling ads related to those searches.\u201d Following an investigation from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thetimes.co.uk\/edition\/news\/google-makes-millions-from-plight-of-addicts-vwkzhwtcv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Sunday Times<\/a>, Google similarly pulled rehab ads in the United Kingdom last week.<\/p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t appear that these ads have disappeared completely, however. <a href=\"https:\/\/trends.google.com\/trends\/explore?geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0278r2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Trends data<\/a> shows that drug rehabilitation searches are steady, while data from 29 rehab facilities advertising through Google Ads\u00a0reveals that the number of ad eligible searches on these queries has decreased significantly \u2013 down 96%. But Google is still showing some ads on these queries.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c44c08ff-115f-45b7-be28-99f095c93ab4\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-restricts-rehab-advertising.jpg\" alt=\"google restricts ads for rehab and drug treatment keywords\" width=\"800\" height=\"418\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Apart from their statement to the New York Times, Google has been quiet about the change to their ad policy. Advertisers bidding on rehab-related keywords were not notified of the change. They did not have their ads or keywords disapproved, but instead suddenly started seeing far fewer ad impressions from these keywords.<\/p>\n<p>Although Google is certainly restricting ads for common terms like \u201cDrug Rehab,\u201d as it said it would, it does not take much work to find other common queries serving a full pack of rehab ads:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a95e01d7-b02d-4b39-8ce4-513c4217ac20\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-rehab-ads-full-pack.jpg\" alt=\"google ads rehab searches\" width=\"655\" height=\"570\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s not clear whether Google changed how it serves organic listings for these rehab-related searches. If not, search engine users would be able to find those misleading or poor-quality sites anyway.<\/p>\n<p>Google also did not announce additional restrictions for its <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/29\/youtube-trueview-ads\">In-Stream ads on YouTube<\/a> or its image ads across the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/18\/google-display-network-tips\">Google Display Network<\/a> (although Google will continue to restrict advertisers from targeting individuals based on sensitive information related to these issues, such as through <a href=\"\/google-remarketing\">remarketing<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<h2>Which Keywords Are Affected?<\/h2>\n<p>This policy change leaves rehab advertisers, good and bad, in a confusing gray area. All advertisers are showing fewer ads on rehab terms, but what is and isn\u2019t allowed is unclear to many. Although advertisers are eligible to show on 96% fewer searches containing the word \u201crehab,\u201d not all keywords are equally affected. Common searches and restrictive <a href=\"\/keyword-match-types\">keyword match types<\/a>, such as Google\u2019s <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/20\/exact-match-keywords\">exact and phrase match keywords<\/a>, are showing almost no ads at all, whereas ads are much more common on <a href=\"\/long-tail-keywords\">long-tailed searches<\/a>, geo-related search terms, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/28\/new-dynamic-search-ads\">dynamic search ads<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/03\/22\/modified-broad-match-for-beginners\">modified broad<\/a> and broad match keywords.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ea4fac8c-4f3c-4e9f-aafc-c1f2ac235281\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/share-of-ad-eligible-rehab-searches.jpg\" alt=\"google adwords rehab ad policy changes\" width=\"800\" height=\"418\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>To complicate matters more, impacts to these ads differ vastly among different common semantic strings. Whereas Google is very restrictive of \u201crehab\u201d keywords, it\u2019s much more lenient on \u201ctreatment\u201d and \u201caddiction\u201d related keywords, which still show about a third as much as they did before the new policy. Some advertisers may have discovered that \u201ccounseling\u201d related keywords have been unaffected, resulting in twice as many ads from these keywords now.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6365baa1-1f06-49e4-b92c-c0c19d0a4a1a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/relative-ad-eligible-searches-rehab.jpg\" alt=\"ad eligible searches for drug rehab data\" width=\"800\" height=\"446\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>More complex and <a href=\"\/long-tail-keyword-tool\">long-tailed keywords<\/a> may also be further exempt from Google\u2019s policy. Searches about different kinds of substance abuse are treated differently \u2013 keywords around \u201csubstance abuse\u201d are largely ineligible for ads, whereas \u201cdrug abuse\u201d or \u201calcohol abuse\u201d keywords now serve even more ads.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4d9b03f8-50a3-452a-ad1c-68e56d7d11c3\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-rehab-ad-policy-changes1.jpg\" alt=\"google ads for rehab addiction facilities\" width=\"800\" height=\"446\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The current drug and alcohol addiction crisis is a complex one and unfortunately may not have any simple viable solutions. Seeking help and starting a conversation will always be the first step to recovery, and Google and its advertisers have a real responsibility to provide answers to those seeking help. Google\u2019s new ad policy may remove some qualified professionals from that conversation. At worst, the unclear policy change could restrict policy-abiding advertisers and open loopholes for sketchy advertisers to benefit from.<\/p>\n<h2>Update<\/h2>\n<p>Google <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/02\/google-adwords-rehab-facilities\">just announced<\/a> a path for qualified addiction treatment professionals to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adwordspolicy\/answer\/7683376?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=29265\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">resume their advertising<\/a>\u00a0while keeping risky players off their network.

LegitScript\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.legitscript.com\/service\/certification\/addiction-treatment\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">certification<\/a> ensures that all addiction treatment options that appear on the SERP are staffed with trained, licensed professionals, compliant with local laws and best practices, and are transparent on the services they offer their patients.<\/p>\n<p>As of February 2019, Microsoft Advertising (formerly known as Bing Ads) <a href=\"https:\/\/about.ads.microsoft.com\/en-us\/blog\/post\/february-2019\/bing-ads-to-require-certification-for-addiction-services\">also requires<\/a> addiction treatment advertisers to obtain LegitScript certification.<\/p>\n<h3>Data Sources<\/h3>\n<p>Data is based on a sample size of 29 accounts (WordStream clients) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/28\/ppc-campaigns-addiction-treatment-facilities\">advertising on keywords related to drug and alcohol rehabilitation<\/a> and similar services on the Google Search Network between September and December 2017.
