The first part is what growing your audience means for you. A lot of businesses use content marketing to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/10\/brand-awareness\">grow their brand awareness<\/a>. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/19\/get-on-first-page-google\">Showing up in the search results<\/a> is a great way to get your name in front of your potential customers.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/content-marketing-strategy-first-page-google.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"380\" alt=\"Moz content on the first page of google\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Moz\u2019s brand name appears five times here, for instance.

So without further ado, let&#8217;s get to work on your strategy.<\/p>\n<h2>How to develop a lead-generating content strategy<\/h2>\n<p>Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to developing your content <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-create-a-small-business-marketing-plan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing plan<\/a>, all the way from initial goal setting to ongoing updates to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/03\/get-more-traffic-from-evergreen-content\">keep your content fresh<\/a>. Let\u2019s jump in.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Set your goals<\/h3>\n<p>The first step in your content marketing plan\u2014or, let\u2019s be honest, any plan\u2014is to set your goals. What are you hoping to do? Why are you creating content?<\/p>\n<p>In this case, the short answer is probably to generate leads. That\u2019s a great place to start, but it\u2019s not quite enough. Next, you need to make sure your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/15\/marketing-objectives\">marketing objective<\/a> is something you can act on. For that, we\u2019d recommend using a SMART goal.<\/p>\n<p>This acronym stands for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specific<\/li>\n<li>Measurable<\/li>\n<li>Achievable<\/li>\n<li>Relevant<\/li>\n<li>Time-based<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/content-marketing-strategy-smart-goal-setting.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"342\" alt=\"smart goal setting chart for a content marketing strategy\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>So, for example, instead of saying your goal is to generate more leads, set your goal to generate 25% more leads from content over the next two quarters. That\u2019s something you can track, measure, and work towards.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Get to know your audience<\/h3>\n<p>Next, you need to identify your audience in order to create content. The best way to do that is to take a closer look at your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/03\/goal-talk-episode-4\">buyer personas<\/a>. These are semi-fictional profiles of your ideal customers, and they\u2019re excellent tools for content marketing strategies.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/content-marketing-strategy-customer-persona.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"394\" alt=\"example of a buyer persona profile to help guide your content marketing strategy\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/productmarketingalliance.com\/how-to-create-buyer-personas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Use these personas as a starting point for creating content that your audience would want to consume (keeping <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/23\/content-marketing-trends\">content marketing trends<\/a> in mind as well). After all, you\u2019re creating a content marketing plan to generate more leads, so you should be creating that content with your ideal customers in mind.<\/p>\n<p>Ask yourself some questions based on your personas:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are your personas concerned about?<\/li>\n<li>What do your personas want to learn more about?<\/li>\n<li>What do your personas want to get better at?<\/li>\n<li>What are your personas reading or watching?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The first few questions are great for thinking of topics for specific\u00a0blog posts,\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/04\/instagram-videos\">videos<\/a>, or themes you can cover. For instance, this blog post is about developing a lead-generating content marketing strategy. This is far from the only post about content marketing on the WordStream blog, though. There\u2019s a whole content marketing category with all kinds of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/06\/content-marketing-tools\">helpful tools and resources<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>That last question is a great way to get started with some <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">competitive keyword research<\/a>, which leads us to the next step.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Start your keyword research<\/h3>\n<p>In order to create content that generates leads, you need to make sure it\u2019s reaching people. We\u2019ll talk more about distribution channels later, but you should have <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/05\/seo-strategy\">SEO<\/a> in mind from the beginning for most of your blog posts, and even videos. <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/keyword-research\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">63%<\/a> of web pages don\u2019t get any organic traffic at all\u2014you don\u2019t want to be a part of that statistic.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/content-marketing-strategy-organic-search-traffic-distribution.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"495\" alt=\"pie chart showing 91% of pages get no organic search traffic from Google\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>So use the topics that your ideal customers are interested in as seed terms to start your search in your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/20\/cross-platform-keyword-research-tools\">keyword tool<\/a>. When your results come up, consider your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/15\/audience-targeting\">audience<\/a>\u00a0again and how interested they\u2019d be.<\/p>\n<p>And the other sites\u00a0your ideal customers are reading? Use your keyword research tool to see what their top-ranking pages are and what content <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">generates the most traffic<\/a>. This can be a great place to find video or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/04\/unique-blog-ideas\">blog post ideas<\/a> for your brand. You don\u2019t want to recreate content, but if it\u2019s out of date or not a good match for the search term, you can write something better.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Pay attention to search intent<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/26\/intent-marketing\">Search intent<\/a> describes the purpose of an online search. When you\u2019re looking for something to make for dinner after work, you might search \u201c30 minute dinner.\u201d The goal is to get a recipe that you can make in about half an hour. You\u2019re not looking for a definition or an explanation or to make a purchase. That\u2019s not the search intent here.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/content-marketing-strategy-recipe-results.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"332\" alt=\"recipe results for google search\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>See? Google knows.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>You want to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/09\/google-ranking-factors\">rank organically<\/a>, and you want to offer your audience what they\u2019re looking for. That\u2019s why search intent is important to keep in mind.<\/p>\n<p>There are four common types of search intent:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Navigational<\/li>\n<li>Informational<\/li>\n<li>Transactional<\/li>\n<li>Commercial<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/04\/keyword-intent-four-types.png\" alt=\"the four types of keyword intent\" width=\"720\" height=\"441\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-61610\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/04\/keyword-intent-four-types.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/04\/keyword-intent-four-types-480x294.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nFor your content strategy, you want to focus on informational and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/30\/commercial-intent-keywords\">commercial intent<\/a>. Someone looking for educational content about a topic or looking for information to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/23\/influence-buyers-marketing-psychology\">influence their purchase<\/a>. Leave the navigational and transactional to any login or pricing pages your company has.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Create high-quality content<\/h3>\n<p>In order to develop a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/22\/marketing-copy\">compelling<\/a>, lead-generating content marketing strategy, you need to prioritize creating <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/15\/quality-content-defined\">high-quality content<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As of today, there are about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.worldwidewebsize.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">3.75 billion<\/a> web pages indexed. That doesn\u2019t mean all of these rank, but it does mean that, regardless of your brand\u2019s focus, you\u2019re going to have some competition.<\/p>\n<p>Even more, you\u2019re going to be competing for attention. We all spend time on our phones, answering emails, watching\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/22\/instagram-reels-ideas-for-businesses\">Instagram Reels<\/a>,\u00a0or scrolling through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/22\/tiktok-ads\">TikTok<\/a>. And then we all get that wave of shame when we see our screentime reports each week\u2014or maybe the last one\u2019s just me. Regardless, the average person spends about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/johnkoetsier\/2020\/09\/26\/global-online-content-consumption-doubled-in-2020\/?sh=98cfece2fdeb\">seven hours<\/a> online each day, and a big portion of that\u2019s spent consuming content. In order to hold your audience\u2019s attention, you need to be <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/07\/29\/great-content\">creating great content<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/content-marketing-funnel.png\" alt=\"content marketing funnel\" width=\"640\" height=\"662\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-63246\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/content-marketing-funnel.png 640w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/content-marketing-funnel-480x497.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 640px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Lots of opportunity for great content across the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/01\/content-marketing-funnel\">content marketing funnel<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The good news? This content marketing strategy is a good place to start. Once you\u2019re ready, be sure to create content that answers their query and offers your audience value. Then, take the time for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/11\/06\/content-editing\">content editing<\/a> to ensure you\u2019re not missing any mistakes or opportunities (our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/24\/editorial-calendar\">editorial calendar template<\/a> may be helpful here). That\u2019s how you can create high-quality content that not only deserves to rank, but also generates <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/08\/lead-quality\">high-quality leads<\/a> for your business.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Optimize your content for conversions<\/h3>\n<p>This next step is key: In order to capture those leads, you need to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/31\/increase-conversions\">optimize your content for conversions<\/a>. For your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/08\/video-marketing-statistics\">video marketing<\/a>, that means focusing on your thumbnails or ending your content with a CTA. For your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/09\/how-to-write-a-blog-post\">blog post content<\/a>, that means strategically placing CTAs throughout your post.<\/p>\n<p>The best way to do this is to align your CTAs with your content. What does that mean? Let\u2019s consider this example from <a href=\"https:\/\/later.com\/blog\/instagram-creator-monetization-features\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Later<\/a>. Here\u2019s an in-text CTA in a blog post about Instagram creator features that let you monetize your content:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/content-marketing-strategy-eye-catching-in-text-link.png\" width=\"650\" height=\"459\" alt=\"example of in-text CTA in a blog post\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The text is highlighted and bold, and it\u2019s eye-catching centered on the page. But even more importantly, it\u2019s directing the reader to related content that they\u2019ll likely be interested in. It\u2019s more information about making money on Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>Another great way to optimize your content is to offer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/18\/gated-content\">gated content<\/a>, like a spreadsheet or template that users have to provide their email to obtain. Here\u2019s an example from <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/best-font-resume\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HubSpot<\/a> offers free resume templates on its blog post about the best resume fonts.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/content-marketing-strategy-hubspot-templates.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"346\" alt=\"example of hubspot content marketing with templates\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In this one, HubSpot uses a big orange button right at the top of the page to capture as many leads as possible.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Determine your distribution channels<\/h3>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve created your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/04\/marketing-collateral\">marketing collateral<\/a> and made sure it\u2019s optimized for leads, the next step is to distribute. Now, you might be wondering why you need to do that if you\u2019ve optimized it for keyword and search intent. But the goal is to get your content to as many interested people as possible, so you need to do more than SEO.<\/p>\n<p>After you\u2019ve posted your content on your website, you should share on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/19\/social-media-for-small-business\">social media<\/a>, send a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/25\/email-copywriting-tips\">compelling email<\/a> to your database, post on relevant Reddit or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/30\/quora-promoted-answers\">Quora<\/a> threads, or even use it for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/05\/webinar-marketing\">webinar<\/a> or conference materials.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/content-marketing-strategy-sem-rush-google-sheet-formulas.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"364\" alt=\"Semrush example of good content distribution on social media\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A great example of content distribution from <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/\"><em>Semrush<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Pro tip: <\/strong><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/03\/repurposing-content\">Repurpose<\/a> your content in multiple mediums for maximum distribution. You can use part of a blog post to script a video, use multiple blog posts to build a guide, and make a chart from a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/real-estate-advertising-benchmarks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">data project<\/a> into an infographic. That way, you can use one or two pieces of content to create four or five different types of content that you can use in your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/01\/email-marketing-tips\">email marketing<\/a>, across your social channels, and even throughout your website.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Keep updating<\/h3>\n<p>Time for some bad news: After you\u2019ve distributed your content and started counting your leads, you\u2019re not exactly done.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/2021-small-business-content-marketing-trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Content marketing trends <\/a>change, so your strategy needs to include a plan for updating your old content. Now, you should do this thoughtfully. Let\u2019s say your company sells electric cars. A short post announcing a new location opening up? Probably not necessary to update. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/23\/cornerstone-content-guide\">cornerstone<\/a> blog post on the emissions from standard and the potential environmental impact of switching to electric? Might be worth checking in on new research to make sure you\u2019re offering the best information to your audience.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/content-marketing-strategy-bloggers-update-posts.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"291\" alt=\"chart showing the increase of bloggers updating old articles\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.orbitmedia.com\/blog\/update-old-blog-posts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image\u00a0source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>So make room for monitoring the performance of your content and then <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/03\/get-more-traffic-from-evergreen-content\">updating as needed<\/a>.
