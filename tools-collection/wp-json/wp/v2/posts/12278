It\u2019s understanding what resonates best with them and why, and delivering value on those terms. It\u2019s not asking them to buy, it\u2019s building trust so that when the time comes for them to make a decision, they willingly choose you. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Digital marketing is no different; it\u2019s just that the dialogue occurs over electronic platforms.
