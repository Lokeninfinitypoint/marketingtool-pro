In large part, that&#8217;s down to marketers focusing on digital mass communication strategies like content and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/social-media-marketing\">social media marketing<\/a>. Of course, the pandemic gave that shift a huge shove, too.

First, the specter of robo-crafted content has marketers looking for new ways to connect with audiences more authentically.

AEO is the newest component of SEO<\/h3>\n<p>30-plus years ago, B2B businesses started focusing on getting their websites to appear at the top of Google search pages. Early<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/seo-trends-2025\"> SEO tactics<\/a> were clumsy, rules were ambiguous, and results varied greatly. In 2025, we\u2019ll see B2B marketers take their best shot at answer engine optimization (AEO) so their sites sit atop results in AI platforms like Perplexity and Google\u2019s Gemini.<\/p>\n<p>AI answer engines\u2019 place in search is growing. Google expanded its<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ai-overviews\"> AI Overviews<\/a> last year. Perplexity\u2019s user base<a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessofapps.com\/data\/perplexity-ai-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> continues to increase<\/a>. And<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/05\/chatgpt-seo\"> ChatGPT<\/a> launched its<a href=\"https:\/\/openai.com\/index\/introducing-chatgpt-search\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> search-focused platform<\/a>. For each search involving these tools, there are citations to websites that can deliver both<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/10\/brand-awareness\"> brand awareness<\/a> and clicks from the interaction.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/b2b-marketing-trends-wordstream-lily-ray.webp\" alt=\"B2B marketing trends -Linkedin post from Lily Ray.\" width=\"503\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89032 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/b2b-marketing-trends-wordstream-lily-ray.webp 503w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/b2b-marketing-trends-wordstream-lily-ray-480x573.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 503px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>SEO expert Lily Ray <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/posts\/lily-ray-44755615_seo-activity-7269046589665538048-K70c?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>pointed out<\/em><\/a><em> how many places a brand can be cited in an AI search result.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s very likely that we\u2019ll see more online searches involving AI-generated answers. Marketers will follow the search migration and focus more on AEO in 2025. And just like the early days of SEO, those in the know will land more of that coveted citation real estate. Use these tips to get started.<\/p>\n<h4>Get specific in copy and content<\/h4>\n<p>Answer engines seem to like to cite pages with direct answers to specific questions. So, ranking in an AE will be similar to grabbing the coveted feature snippet on a standard Google search. Make sure your copy includes a direct answer to the questions you\u2019re trying to rank for.<\/p>\n<h4>Get your structure down<\/h4>\n<p>FAQs, meta descriptions, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/15\/what-is-schema-markup\">schema markups<\/a> will help answer engines understand and share your pages. Go back to those basics if you haven\u2019t already done so.<\/p>\n<h4>Shore up your local listings<\/h4>\n<p>AI search tools pull data for local businesses from <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/listings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">business listings<\/a>. If your business has a physical location, make sure your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/holiday-local-listings-checklist\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">directory listings are complete<\/a> and up to date.<\/p>\n<div id=\"employee-ambassadors-take-the-lead\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Employee ambassadors take the lead<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/seo\">SEO<\/a> is most certainly not dead, but it does look a lot different than it did just a few years ago. Google SERPs are now rowdy places with frequently violent shifts in rankings and rules. In 2025, we\u2019ll see many B2B marketers respond by diversifying their traffic sources. One popular way to do this is to help their employees become brand ambassadors.<\/p>\n<p>Employee brand ambassadors work a lot like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/21\/social-media-influencers\">traditional influencers<\/a>, but they\u2019re employed by the business they\u2019re promoting.

And you don\u2019t need them to. Start by asking them to repost a post or shout out a milestone on their account. Give them the option to jump in doing whatever feels natural and build from there.<\/p>\n<h4>Give them tools and incentives<\/h4>\n<p>Unless they were hired as an influencer, you\u2019re asking something extra from someone who may not be familiar with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/01\/09\/social-media-marketing-strategies\">social media marketing best practices<\/a>.

AI transparency becomes a big debate<\/h3>\n<p>While many people don\u2019t care if robots created your marketing copy, most want you to tell them if it was.

Here are some ways to be prepared.<\/p>\n<h4>Create an internal AI use policy<\/h4>\n<p>The most important step in planning for AI is codifying how your team should use it (and how they should discuss it). It\u2019s okay to start simply with rules around writing blog posts and creating images. Remember to consider privacy since many AI models use the information you give them as a part of their training protocol.<\/p>\n<h4>Consider an AI use statement<\/h4>\n<p>If you want to get ahead of industry or legal standards, consider adding an AI use statement to your website.
