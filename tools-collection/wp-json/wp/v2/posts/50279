There are some metrics that hold enough weight to be acknowledged across any campaign type. Check out these \u201cbread and butter\u201d PPC metrics:<\/p>\n<h2>1. Impressions<\/h2>\n<p>At the bare minimum, impressions is the perfect starting point when it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/06\/adwords-metrics\">understanding PPC metrics<\/a>. An impression is counted whenever someone views your ad, regardless of whether they click on it.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say your ad shows in a lower position on the SERP. Unless the searcher scrolls down to physically see your ad, you won\u2019t get an impression.<\/p>\n<p>Impressions are usually free unless you choose to pay by impressions versus clicks. You can also have multiple impressions from the same person.<\/p>\n<h3>How important are impressions?<\/h3>\n<p>Impressions can be telling in any PPC situation. For example, if you have a high number of impressions but a low number of clicks or conversions, this tells you people are not inclined to click on your ads, and that you may need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/14\/writing-ad-copy-at-scale\">improve your <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/14\/writing-ad-copy-at-scale\">ad copy<\/a>, targeting, or something else.<\/p>\n<p>The highlight of impressions is that, at minimum, you\u2019re getting eyeballs on your ad and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/search-marketing-display-video\/7-ways-drive-leads-and-awareness-your-local-business\/\">increasing brand awareness.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>How to increase impressions<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking to increase impressions, here\u2019s what you can do:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Increase your budget:\u00a0<\/strong>The more budget you have to play with, the more you\u2019ll be able to bid in Google Ads auctions. If your budget is small, your clicks will eat it up too quickly in a day and you won\u2019t be able to continue bidding (and showing) for more impressions. Adding budget when you can will allow you to balance out your bids day by day for <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-impression-share\/\">a healthy impression share.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Use broad match keywords:\u00a0<\/strong>For search campaigns, try loosening your keyword match types to phrase match (or even broad match) as another go-to for more impressions. Since looser match types like broad or phrase have flexibility to match up to more searches, you\u2019ll be able to show to more people on the SERP.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Broaden your targeting<\/strong>:\u00a0This applies to all campaign types, but broadening your location, audience, or other forms of targeting is a given when it comes to getting more impressions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ppc-metrics-reach-vs-impression.png\" alt=\"PPC metrics: reach vs impressions\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"720\" height=\"293\" \/><\/div>\n<p><a id=\"ctr\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>2. Click-through rate (CTR)<\/h2>\n<p>Click-through rate is clicks divided by impressions. Don\u2019t worry, the platform does the math for you! It&#8217;s the\u00a0ratio of how many clicks you pulled in in comparison to how many impressions you showed for. It\u2019s displayed as a percentage, and can vary across accounts as well as verticals.<\/p>\n<p>CTR tells you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/12\/how-to-write-great-advertising-copy\">how well your ad copy is resonating with your audience<\/a>. Similar to our example above, a high number of impressions but low rate of clicks tells us that people aren\u2019t taking action on the ads you\u2019re presenting to them.<\/p>\n<h3>How important is click-through rate?<\/h3>\n<p>Not only does click-through rate clue us in on how our ad copy and targeting is doing, but it is also one of the three contributing factors when it comes time to assign your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/19\/does-quality-score-still-matter\">Quality Score.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>However, click-through rate often gets a bad reputation because it doesn\u2019t always equate to actual money-making conversions. Think of it this way: if you had a high conversion rate but a low click-through rate, you\u2019d want to improve that click-through rate to maximize your conversion opportunities!<\/p>\n<h3>What\u2019s a good click-through rate?<\/h3>\n<p>This depends on a number of factors. For example, the average CTR for the hobbies and leisure industry on Google Search is 7.45%, 0.38% on Google Display, and 0.92% on Facebook. And other industries have much lower or higher average CTRs.<\/p>\n<p>Use our<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/13\/search-advertising-benchmarks\"> search advertising benchmarks <\/a>to identify a good click-through rate for your industry.<\/p>\n<h3>How to improve click-through rate<\/h3>\n<p>We have many posts on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2010\/02\/02\/how-to-improve-adwords-click-through-rate\">how to improve your CTR<\/a>, but here are some brief tips.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Adjust your bids<\/strong>:\u00a0If you\u2019re on manual bidding, you could try raising your bid to rank higher.

Conversion rate (CVR)<\/h2>\n<p>Similar to click-through rate, conversion rate is looking at how often you pull in a conversion in relation to your clicks.

Cost per click (CPC)<\/h2>\n<p>Cost per click is of course the price of each click you bring in.

This is because it wants to show the most relevant results to its audience, so it\u2019s willing to sacrifice making less off a click to uphold its ad standards. If you improve your Quality Score, you\u2019ll find you can bid less aggressively to bring your average CPC down over time.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/19\/whats-a-good-quality-score\">Understand how you can achieve a good Quality Score here.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Adjust bidding:<\/strong> Speaking of bidding, your strategy could be the culprit behind your high CPC. Certain automated strategies bid more aggressively depending on the goal they\u2019re reaching for.\u00a0For example, Max Conversions will bid whatever it needs to bid to bring you in as many conversions as possible\u2014overlooking CPC. Or, you may want to lower your individual bids on Manual, your bid cap on Max Clicks, or your targets for ROAS or CPA. These all affect your bid level, and inherently, your average CPC results. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/19\/google-ads-automated-bidding\">Know what bidding strategy will work best with your CPC here. <\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Pause other assets in your account:\u00a0<\/strong>Let&#8217;s say you have an ad targeting a competitive location, audience, keyword, other component. This competition will drive up your CPC since you\u2019ll have to bid more to keep up.You need to lower your CPC, but you can\u2019t bear to part with that targeting because the conversions on that ad are high value. Instead of pausing that ad, you could instead pause other, lower-value ads in your account. Even if they don\u2019t have super high CPCs, pausing them will still lower your overall CPC so you can afford the high CPC campaign that truly matters. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/07\/18\/adwords-cost-per-click-too-high\">Learn what to look for to lower the CPC in your own account. <\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ppc-metrics-facebook-cpc-benchmarks.png\" alt=\"ppc metrics: facebook cpc benchmarks\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"550\" height=\"400\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/11\/12\/facebook-ad-benchmarks\"><em>Check out the full Facebook ads benchmarks report here.<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a id=\"costperacquisition\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>7. Cost per acquisition (CPA)<\/h2>\n<p>Cost per acquisition can also be known as cost per action, cost per lead, or cost per conversion (I always joke that CPC was already taken, so they went with CPA). It\u2019s basically the same idea as cost per click, but with conversions. This metric takes your total number of conversions in relation to your total spend.<\/p>\n<p>The best part about conversion-related metrics is that conversion actions are extremely customizable. Usually, when people think of a conversion they immediately equate it to a purchase, a phone call, or a lead form-fill. However, what you choose to track as conversions is totally up to you and your business needs.<\/p>\n<p>For example, while a page view, chat messages, or a video play may not directly equate to money made on your end, counting those types of indirect actions as conversions may make sense for your business\u2019s goals. Remember, though, whatever you decide to track as conversions will impact metrics like CPA.<\/p>\n<h3>How important is cost per acquisition?<\/h3>\n<p>To most accounts, it\u2019s usually considered one of, if not the most, important metric. This metric tells us the \u201cbang for our buck.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re an ecommerce account, though, it\u2019s more likely you\u2019ll be concerned about ROAS over CPA. ROAS is the revenue tracking sister metric to CPA\u2014which we\u2019ll get into later in the post!<\/p>\n<h3>What\u2019s a good cost per acquisition?<\/h3>\n<p>There isn\u2019t really any clear answer to this or average benchmark, since CPA measures cost per conversion, where conversion can mean anything you want it to<\/p>\n<h3>How to lower cost per acquisition<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Identify areas with highest CPA first:<\/strong>\u00a0Like we mentioned with other metrics, you need to look at your account from a bird\u2019s eye view. When my clients struggle with CPA, the first place we go is either keywords for search or audience and topic targeting for display.Usually you can pinpoint a high CPA from one specific place, like a keyword. From there, you can brainstorm tweaks you can make to either lower the cost or boost the conversions coming from that component.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Lower your budget:<\/strong>\u00a0A lower budget equates to less spend. Remember, there are two factors that go into CPA: spend and conversions. Raising conversions will be costlier and take more time. Meanwhile, saving on budget will lower your costs immediately which can help to lower your CPA for the time being.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Set or adjust your tCPA<\/strong>:\u00a0If you\u2019re worried about your current CPA, I\u2019m betting you\u2019re already building out your PPC strategy in a CPA-oriented way. If you have a target CPA set up on your current bid strategy (whether that be legacy tCPA or Max Conversions), try adjusting your target to be a realistic goal.Your CPA may be high due to automated bidding confusion. If you don\u2019t have enough data in your campaign, or the right target set, Google is probably struggling to bid correctly for an optimal CPA. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/15\/lower-cost-per-acquisition\">Get more tips on how to lower CPA here. <\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-to-lower-customer-acquisition-cost-cac-vs-cpa_0.png\" alt=\"customer acquisition cost vs cost per acquisition formulas\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"716\" height=\"412\" \/><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/13\/search-advertising-benchmarks\" id=\"costperclick&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;How important is cost per click?&lt;\/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The importance of cost per click is debatable. Noone likes to spend on a pricey click. However, if that helps you reach your overall conversion KPIs, it may be worth it.&lt;\/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So how much cost per click should matter to you is dependent on your account\u2019s end goal. If you\u2019re looking to save money above all else, you\u2019ll care more about your CPC being lower.&lt;\/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, if you\u2019re looking to get the most out of other metrics (like CPA, impressions, CVR, clicks, conversions, etc.), CPC will matter less to you.&lt;\/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What\u2019s a good cost per click?&lt;\/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I know the answer everyone is hoping for, and sadly, a penny per click is unrealistic. In fact, there\u2019s no set definition for a good cost per click. One account that might think they\u2019re getting a wicked deal on their clicks may have crazy high click costs in the eyes of another account. A good cost per click depends on your account and your industry. Aside from looking at our benchmark guides, try using a keyword tool to determine CPC averages for certain terms.&lt;\/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-cke-saved-href=\"><strong><em>Get CPA (and lots more!) benchmarks\u00a0for Google Ads here.<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Search-specific PPC metrics<\/h2>\n<p>While some metrics are universal, there are a few that are applicable to specific campaign types more than others. Let\u2019s start with Search-specific metrics.<br \/>\n<a id=\"impressionshare\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>8. Impression share<\/h2>\n<p>This, and the next two, are personally my favorite <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/ppc-metrics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PPC metrics<\/a>. Weird, I know. In my experience, advertisers get hung up on the rigid metrics like CPA or conversions.<\/p>\n<p>However,<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/10\/28\/adwords-impression-share\"> impression share<\/a> (and impression rates\u2014which are coming next) can tell you a lot about your PPC performance in comparison to the general SERP or GDN space.<\/p>\n<p>Impression share essentially answers the question of \u201cout of all the times your ads <em>could<\/em> be showing, how often are they <em>actually<\/em> showing up?\u201d After all, getting your ad in front of people is the first step to success.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a platform-specific metric that looks at your total impressions compared to the total eligible searches (or views on GDN) you could have shown for. It\u2019s displayed as a percentage and can vary by name depending on platform or campaign type.<\/p>\n<h3>How important is impression share?<\/h3>\n<p>Impression share can tell you if you\u2019re missing out on opportunities that could help grow your business. Impression share carries even more weight if one of your PPC goals is to increase brand awareness.<\/p>\n<h3>How to improve impression share<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Raise your bids:\u00a0<\/strong>The higher you bid, the more likely you\u2019ll be to win auctions and be allowed a chance to gain an impression. Plus, your bids work hand-in-hand with your Quality Score to determine your rank. When you rank higher, the more likely you\u2019ll be able to achieve that impression once you make it on the SERP.Again, if you\u2019re not using a manual strategy, adjust your bid limit or targets to be more aggressive.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/03\/14\/ppc-bid-management-guide\">Check out our bid management guide he<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/03\/14\/ppc-bid-management-guide\">re.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Adjust your keywords<\/strong>:\u00a0Most of the time, people think looking at their Quality Score is the first place to go when looking to boost their impression share. However, the keywords and match types you choose can make all the difference on how you perform on the SERP.A less restrictive match type can make it tougher to achieve a higher impression share. The text and intent of your keyword can also impact which types of searches you match up to\u2014especially since <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/27\/google-ads-match-type-update-2021-explained\">Google just updated how it analyzes matching behavior.<\/a>.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/26\/intent-marketing\">Get more details on keywords (and keyword intent) here<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Go after the competition<\/strong>:\u00a0Be sure to regularly check the Auction Insights section of Google ads to see who you\u2019re sharing the SERP with. They may be bumping you down by outbidding you. While Auction Insights isn\u2019t available for Display, the same logic applies. What can you learn from their ad copy or possibly higher bids that you can apply to your own account? The answer to that question will help you brainstorm ways to increase your impression share. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/06\/incredibly-useful-google-ads-features\">Learn more about Auction Insights here.<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/search-terms-report-tips-example-of-using-auction-insights.png\" alt=\"example of auction insights report google ads\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"720\" height=\"256\" \/><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/26\/search-impression-share\">Learn how to get your piece of the impression share pie here.<\/a><br \/>\n<a id=\"topimpressionrate\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>9. Top and absolute top impression rate<\/h2>\n<p>Top impression rate and absolute top impression rate are search ad metrics. Both are built off of your impression share and\u00a0displayed as percentages,\u00a0and the practices to improve them are the same as impression share. However, their impact on your competitive insights can be even more valuable.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Top impression rate<\/strong> answers the question of \u201cout of all the times your ads <em>do<\/em>\u00a0show, how often do they show in the top pack of ad results\u00a0(as opposed to on the bottom of the SERP)?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Absolute top impression rate<\/strong>\u00a0answers the question of\u00a0\u201cout of all the times your ads <em>do <\/em>show, how often are they the <em>very first ad<\/em> on the page?\u201d This means your ad is the first thing the searcher sees, which is ideal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Of course, a high rate for either of these metrics can be tough to achieve. I recommend shooting for your top impression rate to hit about 60-80%, and your absolute top rate to be about 20-30%. Your unique needs may change that, though. For example, the more competition you have, the harder it will be to get a high impression share or impression rate.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ppc-metrics-top-absolute-top-impression.png\" alt=\"ppc metrics: top vs absolute top impression\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"600\" height=\"616\" \/><\/div>\n<p><a id=\"searchimplostrank\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>10-11. Search impression share lost<\/h2>\n<p>Okay, so impression share and impression rates tell us the story of when our ads show up on the SERP. But what happens when they <em>don&#8217;t<\/em>? There are two reasons behind why you may be missing out on impressions: either your rank is too low<strong> (search impression share lost\u00a0to rank)<\/strong> or your budget is too low\u00a0<strong>(search impression share lost\u00a0to budget)<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s easier and quicker to tackle the latter. You can of course raise your campaign budget, but if that\u2019s not feasible, adjust your targeting to make your budget stretch further.<\/p>\n<p>For the former, you could reevaluate your bidding first as a quick fix. Your max CPC bid is factored in when calculating your rank in any auction. For a longer-term fix, identify any pain points within your Quality Score that you can work to improve on.<\/p>\n<p>For example, you may need to rearrange your landing page or refresh your ad copy.<\/p>\n<h2>Conversion tracking PPC metrics<\/h2>\n<p>While you should <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/24\/google-ads-conversion-tracking\">set up conversion tracking<\/a> for all your campaigns, I will say that these metrics are typically most applicable to Shopping and ecommerce campaigns.<br \/>\n<a id=\"conversionvalue\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>12. Conversion value<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/25\/conversion-value\">Conversion value <\/a>(conv. value) looks at the sum of values for each of your conversions is the sum of conversion values for your conversions.<\/p>\n<p>Think of this as your quality over quantity metric. We know that a $1000 lead is worth more than a $5 lead. Conversion value helps you understand the total monetary value of your conversions.<\/p>\n<p>That way, if your conversion numbers are low but the conversion value is high, you\u2019re still doing alright! Of course, this metric is only useful if you assigned a value to each of your conversion actions when setting up tracking.<\/p>\n<p>To maximize your conversion value, you may want to start outside of your account. Look at your landing page and evaluate the path your customers take. See if there are steps you can add in or take away to lead them to a more profitable conversion action.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/conversion-value-create.jpg\" alt=\"conversion value create screen in Google Ads\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"724\" height=\"213\" \/><\/div>\n<p><a id=\"conversionvaluecost\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>13. Conversion value\/cost<\/h3>\n<p>This metric calculates your return on investment. It takes your conversion value divided by the total cost of all your interactions. This metric looks at the actions within <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-customer-journey\/\">your customer\u2019s journey<\/a> holistically to understand how your spend relates to how many steps they took to reach a certain valuable action. A lower conversion value\/cost number means you\u2019re getting more out of your ads for less money.<br \/>\n<a id=\"conversionvalueclick\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>14. Conversion value\/click<\/h3>\n<p>Conversion value over click divides the total value of your conversions by the total number of clicks (or interactions) your ad gets. Google includes interaction in the definition of this one (even though clicks is in the name) because people can click on or engage with portions of your ad without arriving to your landing page. This metric is helpful when <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/11\/21\/customer-journey-mapping\">understanding the customer journey<\/a> and your audience\u2019s behavior. However, it\u2019s not as telling in terms of performance since it\u2019s only looking at the value of conversions and interactions\u2014not actual clicks and conversions.<br \/>\n<a id=\"valueconversion\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>15. Value\/conversion<\/h3>\n<p>Not to be confused with conversion value, value over conversion provides an average of how much your conversions are worth. Whereas, conversion value, looks at the total value for total conversions. This metric is an easy, quick gauge of, on average, how much an individual conversion is worth.<br \/>\n<a id=\"allconversions\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>16. All conversions<\/h3>\n<p>All conversions deserved an honorable mention in this section since it often gets confused with the conversions column. To clarify, all conversions shows every action you may be tracking, even if you opted for them to not be included in your standard conversions column.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you have a two-step form, you may only count the second step as a true conversion. However, you\u2019ll be able to see the number of completions of the first step under all conversions.<\/p>\n<p><a id=\"displaylostrank\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Display &amp; video ad metrics<\/h2>\n<p>Search isn\u2019t the only campaign type to get its own metric category. Here are some display-specific metrics to get familiar with.<\/p>\n<h3>17-18. Display lost impression share<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Display lost impression share (rank) and Display lost impression share (budget)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The basics of these two metrics are the same as they are on search. They tell you what percentage of your missed display or video ad impressions are due to a lack of rank or budget.<\/p>\n<p>While raising budget isn\u2019t always feasible, the nice thing about display ads is they have more targeting variables available than on search, making it easier to improve your rank.<\/p>\n<p>To improve your lost display impression share, try adjusting to a less competitive audience or changing your ad creative. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/19\/google-custom-audiences\">Audience targeting tips here.<\/a><br \/>\n<a id=\"relativectr\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>19. Relative CTR<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re in a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/why-is-it-important-companies-have-competitors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">highly competitive space<\/a>, this metric is for you. Your relative CTR tells you display or video ad\u2019s CTR in relation to the industry averages.<br \/>\n<a id=\"viewableimpressions\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>20. Viewable impressions<\/h3>\n<p>Your viewable impressions metric tells you the number of times your display or video ad was considered \u201cviewable\u201d which means more than 50% of it was seen for more than one second. This helps you understand if your ad was actually looked at.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ppc-metrics-viewable-impressions.png\" alt=\"ppc metrics: definition of viewable\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"720\" height=\"296\" \/><\/div>\n<p><a id=\"videoplayedto\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>21. Video played to: 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%<\/h3>\n<p>You can probably guess what this metric tells you. Sadly, not every viewer will watch your video ad the whole way through. Luckily, the four \u201cvideo played to X\u201d metrics tell you how many of your video views were only for a certain length of time. Use this to optimize your video ad content from start to finish!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/12\/memorable-youtube-ads\">Learn how to create compelling video ads here.<\/a><br \/>\n<a id=\"averagecpm\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>22. Average CPM<\/h3>\n<p>For high-volume video campaigns, average CPM is a helpful metric because it breaks down our total spend by chunks of impressions. 1000 impressions to be exact. Confusing, I know. The abbreviation doesn\u2019t translate well, but CPM stands for cost per 1000 impressions. This metric is commonly leveraged when using CPM bidding.<br \/>\n<a id=\"averagecpv\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>23. Average CPV<\/h3>\n<p>Cost per view is a simple yet supportive metric when it comes to understanding the bang for your buck on display and video campaigns. It averages out about how much each view is worth to you, and you can adjust accordingly if that number seems oddly high.<\/p>\n<p>Since you\u2019re pulling in so many views on display and video, though, it\u2019s usually a pretty low number. If you want to lower it even further, you can try Cost Per View bidding or alternatively, tighten your targeting. That way, when you get a pricey view it will be that much more worth it.<br \/>\n<a id=\"viewthroughconversions\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>24. View-through conversions<\/h3>\n<p>As display and video campaigns are becoming more prominent, so too has this metric. That\u2019s because it finally answers the age-old question of: \u201cIf my display campaign has a low CTR and CVR, what is it doing for me?\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/14\/view-through-conversions\">View-through conversions <\/a>tell us how many conversions in your account are from someone who saw, but did not click, on your display or video ad within the last 30 days. This proves the efficacy of your display and video campaigns in growing that brand awareness and triggering a conversion via another route. View-through conversions can tell you if your display or video ads are the primary catalysts to spark a conversion later on.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/view-through-conversion-vs-direct-conversion.png\" alt=\"view-through conversion vs direct conversion\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"714\" height=\"332\" \/><\/div>\n<p><a id=\"roas\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>25. ROAS<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/16\/return-on-ad-spend-roas\">Return on ad spend <\/a>is a major metric for Shopping campaigns, but other campaign types can find this data helpful as well. Similar to conversion value, ROAS tracks the overall revenue your ads are bringing in. It then takes that revenue number and puts it up against your spend.<\/p>\n<p>Shown as a ratio or a percentage, a healthy ROAS can vary from account to account. However, the usual starting point for an ideal ROAS is most commonly about 250-350%.<\/p>\n<p>ROAS can be finicky. To start improving, definitely set a target ROAS on your campaign-level bid strategy. Another option, if you don\u2019t want to fuss over it, is to try Smart Shopping campaigns. And definitely check out my post on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/25\/google-shopping-ads-priority-bidding-structure\">How to Improve Google Shopping ROAS with Priority Bidding<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Miscellaneous PPC metrics<\/h2>\n<p><a id=\"invalidclicks\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>26. Invalid clicks<\/h3>\n<p>Did you know Google watches out for clicks that could be spam, fake, or from bots? That is the entire point of the invalid clicks column within the platform! This is how many out of your total clicks Google has deemed questionable.<\/p>\n<p>This is helpful if you think you\u2019re being targeted by a competitor or any other sort of click fraud. Google has a <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/contact\/aw_complaint\">complaint form<\/a> you can use for situations like this so that they can step in and stop any inappropriate activity.<br \/>\n<a id=\"engagements\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>27. Engagements<\/h3>\n<p>Engagements are any actions associated with an ad. If someone views your ad, then clicks, those are both considered engagements. The more add-ons you have, like extensions, the higher your engagement rate will be.<br \/>\n<a id=\"interactions\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>28. Interactions<\/h3>\n<p>Interactions are the main action associated with an ad. This may be a view, a click, or any other meaningful action done on the ad.
