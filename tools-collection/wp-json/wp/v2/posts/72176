Utilize interest and behavior targeting<\/h3>\n<p>TikTok attracts <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insiderintelligence.com\/charts\/global-tiktok-user-stats\/#:~:text=TikTok%20will%20have%20834.3%20million,phenomenon%20has%20been%20incredibly%20quick.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">over 830 million<\/a>\u00a0monthly active users, which is a jaw-dropping <a href=\"https:\/\/upbeatagency.com\/tiktok-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statistic<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>On the one hand, this is great news for marketers. You can reach a colossal audience of potential customers, and there\u2019s plenty of opportunity for you to scale up your campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>However, this also means that you need to tighten up your TikTok ads targeting as much as possible to avoid high volumes of wasted impressions.<\/p>\n<p>Leveraging interest and behavior targeting is a great way to ensure that you\u2019re reaching relevant and receptive TikTok audiences.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ads.tiktok.com\/help\/article\/interest-targeting?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Interest targeting<\/a> allows advertisers to target users based on their long-term interests and passions. You can target audiences based on broad interest categories (e.g. gaming, food, finance) but the TikTok algorithm will also suggest associated interests to broaden reach.<\/p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https:\/\/ads.tiktok.com\/help\/article\/behavior-targeting?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">behavior targeting<\/a>, you can reach users based on recent actions, such as commenting on a specific profile or sharing a particular type of video content.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/tiktok-ads-targeting-behavior-targeting.jpg\" alt=\"tiktok ads targeting - interesting and behavior targeting in tiktok\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72185\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/tiktok-ads-targeting-behavior-targeting.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/tiktok-ads-targeting-behavior-targeting-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/ads.tiktok.com\/help\/article\/interest-targeting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Combining these two strategies will enable you to target relevant (and valuable) audiences.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, if you\u2019re a brand selling gym attire, then you could target interest categories such as \u2018Apparel &amp; Accessories\u2019 and \u2018Sports &amp; Outdoors\u2019 to find users that are likely to be interested in your products. You might also target users that have liked videos from well-known gym brands, as there\u2019s a good chance that they\u2019ll be open to your messaging.<\/p>\n<p>Although these are relatively broad targeting tactics, the TikTok algorithm will be able to identify the best-performing segments within these groups, meaning you can effectively optimize your ads over time to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/03\/improve-conversion-rates\">maximize conversions<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Think about it this way&#8211;interest and behavior targeting allow you to cast a wide net and reach users that are more likely to be interested in your brand.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve gathered some performance data based on these larger audiences, you can refine your targeting, allow the TikTok algorithm to work its magic, and increase your ROI.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Harness the power of Custom Audiences<\/h3>\n<p>Custom Audiences are one of the most powerful tools available to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/11\/advertising-on-tiktok\">advertisers on TikTok<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In basic terms, <a href=\"https:\/\/ads.tiktok.com\/help\/article\/custom-audiences\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Custom Audiences<\/a> allow you to target users that have already interacted with your brand in some way. These audiences are aware of your business, so you can focus on more action-led messaging to drive performance.<\/p>\n<p>That means you can instantly engage hot prospects that are infinitely more likely to purchase your products, which is a game-changer for cost efficiency.<\/p>\n<p>There are several different types of Custom Audiences available on TikTok, and selecting the right strategy is key to success. Marketers can choose to build the following segments:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Customer File:<\/strong> Upload your customer data to match and target TikTok accounts.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Engagement:<\/strong> Retarget users that have previously engaged with your video ads.<\/li>\n<li><strong>App Activity<\/strong>: Retarget users that have completed a specific action within your app.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Lead Generation:<\/strong> Retarget users that have engaged with your <a href=\"https:\/\/ads.tiktok.com\/help\/article\/lead-generation-objective?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lead Generation ads<\/a> on TikTok.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Website Traffic:<\/strong> Retarget users that have visited (or taken a specific action on) your website.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/tiktok-ads-targeting-custom-website-audience.jpg\" alt=\"tiktok ads targeting - custom audiences for website traffic custom audience in tiktok ads\" width=\"936\" height=\"512\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72181\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/tiktok-ads-targeting-custom-website-audience.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/tiktok-ads-targeting-custom-website-audience-480x263.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/ads.tiktok.com\/help\/article\/custom-audiences\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>All of these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/15\/retargeting-ads\">retargeting strategies<\/a> can be extremely effective at generating clicks and conversions since you\u2019re reaching users that have already engaged with your business.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to targeting high-value prospects on TikTok, it doesn\u2019t get much better than Custom Audiences.<\/p>\n<p>You can also utilize different Custom Audiences depending on your main objective, but always make sure that you\u2019re taking full advantage of these data-driven targeting segments.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Capitalize on Lookalike segments<\/h3>\n<p>Custom Audiences can deliver outstanding results for TikTok advertisers&#8211;but what if we told you that you could make them even more effective?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ads.tiktok.com\/help\/article\/lookalike-audience?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lookalike Audiences<\/a> allow you to effectively extend the reach of your Custom Audiences by identifying and targeting similar users.<\/p>\n<p>The TikTok algorithm will analyze a few common attributes across your Custom Audiences (e.g. operating device, demographics, interests) and locate user groups with the same profiles.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve already discovered profitable TikTok audiences, why not make the most of them?<\/p>\n<p>By building Lookalike segments, you can rapidly increase reach while still maintaining a clear focus on quality.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/tiktok-ads-targeting-lookalike-audience.jpg\" alt=\"tiktok ads targeting - lookalike audiences\" width=\"936\" height=\"541\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72182\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/tiktok-ads-targeting-lookalike-audience.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/tiktok-ads-targeting-lookalike-audience-480x277.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is a fantastic way to leverage data about your high-value prospects and expand the scale of your TikTok campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>You can use TikTok Lookalike Audiences in a few different ways to drive performance:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>At the beginning of a new campaign, launching Lookalikes helps the TikTok algorithm collect audience insights and optimize ads faster.<\/li>\n<li>If you feel like you\u2019re peaking in terms of conversion volumes, you can utilize Lookalike Audiences to expand reach and generate incremental sales.<\/li>\n<li>Finally, if campaign performance is beginning to slow down, you can use Lookalikes to stretch out ad delivery and deliver additional impressions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A combination of data-driven Custom Audiences and tactical Lookalike Audiences is guaranteed to identify cost-effective prospects on TikTok.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Analyze performance data and then optimize<\/h3>\n<p>Implementing the above targeting strategies will help you to reach and convert valuable TikTok audiences&#8211;but if you want to maximize performance, you\u2019ll need to stay close to your reporting data.<\/p>\n<p>By constantly analyzing your campaign data and implementing optimizations, you\u2019ll be able to focus on your most profitable audiences and significantly improve ROI.<\/p>\n<p>Keep an eye on the delivery of different audience segments to understand your best-performing tactics. Trust what the data is telling you and be decisive with your optimizations.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/tiktok-ads-targeting-reporting.jpg\" alt=\"example of tiktok ads reporting in tiktok ads manager\" width=\"829\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72183\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/tiktok-ads-targeting-reporting.jpg 829w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/tiktok-ads-targeting-reporting-480x347.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 829px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/business\/en-US\/blog\/how-to-view-campaign-performance-tiktok-ads-manager\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t hesitate to adjust your TikTok ad budgets.

The pixel will provide you with incredibly useful insights about audience performance, helping you to establish the users that are completing purchases, generating revenue, and driving the best ROI.<\/p>\n<p>Try to avoid making assumptions about your preferred audiences based on clicks alone.<\/p>\n<p>If you dig deeper into your pixel data and calculate the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/16\/return-on-ad-spend-roas\">return on ad spend (ROAS)<\/a> you\u2019re seeing from different targeting segments, you\u2019ll discover the best-performing audiences in no time.<\/p>\n<h3>6.

A\/B tests are only effective if you track performance and optimize accordingly, so keep an eye on your reports.<\/li>\n<li>Give the TikTok algorithm space to work. Be patient with your tests, and don\u2019t interfere with your audiences until you\u2019ve gathered reliable data.<\/li>\n<li>Ensure that all of your test audiences have a healthy budget. You\u2019ll only be able to gather targeting insights if you have enough campaign data to review!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you can stick to a consistent TikTok A\/B testing strategy, you\u2019ll find it much easier to refine your audience targeting and scale up your conversions.
