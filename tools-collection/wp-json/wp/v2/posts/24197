While this shift of power away from traditional media outlets opens a lot of doors for bloggers, it has also resulted in a glut of online content. That\u2019s a problem if you are trying to get your content noticed. But there are things you can do to make sure your content gets the attention it deserves.<\/p>\n<p>Here are <strong>nine tips<\/strong> to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/10\/content-style-guide\">get your content to stand out from the crowd<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Keep Your Ideal Audience in Mind<\/strong> \u2013 Always create great content with your ideal customers in mind\u2014will this information be valuable to them? If not, how can you craft the information so that it will interest them? If you use personas in your marketing efforts, consider the various personas, their individual interests, and unique needs.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Opt Out of Updating Old Content; Make New Posts Instead<\/strong> \u2013 If you\u2019re blogging about a developing story or continuing topic, create a new post rather than updating the old page. You can create a series of blog posts with a specific theme, like we have with our <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2011\/12\/13\/adwords-experts-11\">PPC Experts Interview Series<\/a> or the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2011\/10\/06\/google-adwords-call-extensions\">Google AdWords Ad Extension blog posts<\/a>. Link between the old and new pages for easy navigation.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use Online Data to Discover Trends<\/strong> \u2013 Twitter provides great real-time data about what topics are trending and what people are buzzing about, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/trends\">Google Trends<\/a> gives insight into the hot button topics people are searching for. Creating content with this online data in mind will keep you in the loop and allows you to optimize your content for those trending search terms.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pay Attention to URL Structure and Title Tag<\/strong> \u2013 Including the keywords you want to rank for in your URL and title adds a nice SEO boost.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Evaluate your Top Content \u2013 <\/strong>PPC experts know how important it is to continuously test and track an ad\u2019s success (or lack of). Testing allows you to discover what is and what is not working in your advertisements. Evaluating your top content is the same idea. Examine your top-ranking pieces and try to see why those posts did so well. Did you include several images? Was it a timely news piece? Did you include a great offer?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Make it Easy to Share<\/strong> \u2013Imbed Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google+ buttons on your content pages so that visitors can easily share them via social networks. We\u2019re all far too busy and\/or lazy to copy and paste.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use Dynamic Content and Internal Links<\/strong> \u2013 Increasing on-site discovery is important in boosting page views and time on site. You can suggest relevant topics to visitors through the use of dynamic content (most shared topics, most viewed topics, etc.). Internal links and relevant anchor text also make it easy for your visitors to discover additional content and navigate seamlessly throughout your site.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Insert Long-tail Keywords<\/strong> \u2013 <a href=\"\/long-tail-keywords\">Long-tail keywords<\/a> are keyword phrases made up of three of more words. Long-tail keywords are easier to rank on than head terms (one or two word phrases) because they are more specific. Inserting long-tail keywords into your content is a handy technique for driving targeted, relevant traffic.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t Skimp on the Media\u2014<\/strong>Inserting media like images and video into your content can help you rank higher in the SERPs. You can use an image\u2019s alt text to insert SEO keywords, but even more valuable is that many search engines, including Google, show multi-format results at the top of their SERP pages. People also love to share and \u201clike\u201d videos.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/24\/editorial-calendar\">Editorial Calendar<\/a>\u2014<\/strong>Capturing everything in one place makes it easy for you to streamline your content creation process, from ideation to publication to promotion and more!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Implement some of these tips and see how it affects your content\u2019s ranking. As always, <strong>content is king<\/strong>\u2014your pieces won\u2019t ever get too much attention if they don\u2019t offer valuable information that interests people. However, when you\u2019re creating <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/23\/cornerstone-content-guide\">great content<\/a> that just doesn\u2019t seem to rank, these tips might be just the boost you need to get your content noticed.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Need help getting your content to rank for SEO?
