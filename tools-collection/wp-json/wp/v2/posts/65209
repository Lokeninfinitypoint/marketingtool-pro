However, there are several strategies you can employ to improve your chances of winning a starring role on the FYP stage.<\/p>\n<p>Here are eight ways to increase your chances of getting featured on the TikTok For You Page.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Consistently post at the right time<\/h3>\n<p>It stands to reason that the more you post, the greater the chance you have of getting your content on the FYP; you\u2019ve got to be in it to win it.<\/p>\n<p>Aim for three times a week, building up to daily posts. But don\u2019t be tempted to post content just for the sake of it. Make sure it\u2019s good quality and engaging.<\/p>\n<p>You also need to post at the right times.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-get-on-tiktok-fyp-best-time-to-post-tiktok.png\" alt=\"how to get on tiktok's fyp - best time to post on tiktok\" width=\"444\" height=\"416\" class=\"wp-image-65211 aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As engagement increases your chances of getting on the FYP, you should post when your audience is online and ready to interact.<\/p>\n<p>So how will you know when the best times are?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Head to our post on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/09\/best-time-to-post-on-tiktok\">the best times to post on TikToK<\/a> and establish a baseline time to start with.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Switch to a TikTok Pro account. Like using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dialpad.com\/blog\/meeting-notes-templates\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">templates for meeting notes<\/a>, the Pro account makes your life much easier. With it, you can see the days and times your followers are most active and engaged.<\/li>\n<li>Look at the geographic locations of your audience to make sure your time zone is aligned.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>2. Use trending hashtags<\/h3>\n<p>Using trending hashtags makes your content more likely to be picked up by the algorithm and, therefore, boosts your chances of hitting the FYP. Just like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/29\/instagram-hashtags\">Instagram hashtags<\/a>, TikTok hashtags categorize your content and increase your discoverability.<\/p>\n<p>Aim for quality, not quantity\u2013choose 3-6 trending hashtags that are relevant to your content.<\/p>\n<p>You can use #fyp and #ForYou, but there\u2019s no guarantee this will work. Hashtags relevant to your content and niche provide a better chance of success with your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/tiktok-marketing-for-small-businesses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TikTok marketing<\/a> and will help you attract the right followers.<\/p>\n<p>For help choosing hashtags, search for keywords relevant to your niche and see what hashtags the most popular videos are using; or you can even rely on basic keyword research from your SEO efforts.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Post unique (and better) content<\/h3>\n<p>TikTok rewards high-quality, engaging content. If your video gets a good reaction, it\u2019s got a better chance of ending up on the FYP. But how do you ensure your content is a cut above the rest?<\/p>\n<p>Firstly, your video and audio quality must be top-notch. Most smartphones offer HD video, so it\u2019s easy to create high-resolution videos without a big budget.<\/p>\n<p>Take inspiration from others but don\u2019t be tempted to copy. Users enjoy unique content, so make sure your TikTok ideas stand out from the crowd. We\u2019ve got lots of ideas in our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/01\/how-to-go-live-on-tiktok\">guide to going live on TikTok<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Take trends in a new direction. Get creative and experiment with filters, stickers, and transitions. This will increase views and engagement.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-get-on-tiktok-fyp-post-educational-content.jpeg\" alt=\"how to get on tiktoks fyp - original content\" width=\"527\" height=\"406\" class=\"wp-image-65219 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-get-on-tiktok-fyp-post-educational-content.jpeg 527w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-get-on-tiktok-fyp-post-educational-content-480x369.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 527px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>4. Create short, engaging videos<\/h3>\n<p>TikTok cares about completion rates. Basically, that\u2019s how many people watch your video to the very end. The more viewers that do so, the more likely your content is to get on the For You Page.<\/p>\n<p>Videos can be up to one minute long, but the theory is that making your videos as short as possible will increase their chances of being watched to the end. But again, quality is king. If they are short, make sure they are still fun, interesting, and engaging. Your main aim should be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/17\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok\">boosting their chances of likes<\/a> and shares.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-get-on-tiktoks-fyp-short-videos.png\" alt=\"how to get on tiktok's fyp - short video screenshot\" width=\"300\" height=\"449\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65224 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-get-on-tiktoks-fyp-short-videos.png 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-get-on-tiktoks-fyp-short-videos-200x300.png 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Experiment with different lengths to find what works best for you.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Collaborate with influencers<\/h3>\n<p>Collaborations expand your reach, and if your partner shows up on the FYP, you\u2019ll benefit too. You can collaborate with creators in many ways, including duets and Stitches (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/11\/how-to-stitch-on-tiktok\">we show you how to Stitch on TikTok here<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>TikTok has the highest influencer engagement rate of any other platform.

Write short, interesting captions<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019re limited to 150 characters, so you need to focus on writing short captions that include relevant hashtags and that encourage engagement.<\/p>\n<p>Try creating curiosity-piquing captions like \u201cWait to see what happens at the end\u201d. This could boost views and completion rates. You could also ask a question to spark viewers\u2019 interest. Or tease the information you\u2019re about to reveal.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-get-on-tiktok-fyp-interesting-captions.png\" alt=\"how to get on tiktok's fyp - interesting captions\" width=\"600\" height=\"185\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-65223\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-get-on-tiktok-fyp-interesting-captions.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-get-on-tiktok-fyp-interesting-captions-480x148.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>8.
