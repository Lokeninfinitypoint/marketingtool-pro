AdWords Has a New UI<\/h2>\n<p>Google is billing this as \u201cthe most powerful change [they\u2019ve] made to how advertisers visualize and manage their campaigns in over 15 years.\u201d And it\u2019s easy to see why. The new AdWords UI is sleek. It\u2019s sexy. It\u2019s everything the clunky old UI, with its overlapping shades of grey and unfindable sub-menus, is not.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"25f9dd69-8a0e-4dc0-b537-4b968bf22508\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/new-adwords-ui-20-percent-faster1-2.png\" alt=\"adowrds changes 2017 new interfacec\" width=\"800\" height=\"384\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>That being said, you needn\u2019t worry about wrapping your mind around the whirring new labyrinth just yet: despite the fact that millions of advertisers already have access (and can vacillate between the old and new UI\u2019s at will) the \u201cnew AdWords experience\u201d won\u2019t be available to everyone until December.<\/p>\n<p>Stay tuned: we\u2019ll have a more in-depth post on the new AdWords UI later this week!<\/p>\n<h2>2. Life Events Targeting Comes to YouTube and Gmail Ads<\/h2>\n<p>There are some things that can be categorized as everyday purchases. Hand soap. Corn Chips. Cigarettes. Whatever.<\/p>\n<p>For purchases that tend to happen around or because of YUGE <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/29\/adwords-life-events-targeting\">life events<\/a> (think weddings and graduations), though, things are a bit different.<\/p>\n<p>There are patterns of behavior that tend to indicate an impending life event. Looking for an apartment and working on your resume and upgrading from kegs of swill to four-pack microbrews, for example, might establish that someone is graduating. If your product or service could help someone at this stage in your life, your advertising to them is a mutually beneficial proposition.<\/p>\n<p>Check this out:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"056d5427-9823-4c27-91d1-9c6a1ef28e1c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sonos-adwords-life-tergeting-1.png\" alt=\"life events targeting results\" width=\"800\" height=\"409\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>By using this exact strategy, smart-speaker company Sonos saw huge improvements in both ad recall and search intent.<\/p>\n<p>Now, AdWords will allow you to use <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/05\/google-adwords-life-events-targeting\">Life Events as a targeting option<\/a> in both your YouTube and your Gmail Ads. Big, bold, <em>targeted<\/em> creative. What\u2019s not to love?!<\/p>\n<h2>3. In-Market Audiences Come to Search<\/h2>\n<p>Machine learning was mentioned by virtually every speaker, but the bit that piqued my interest most was about in-market audiences finally coming to the Search network.<\/p>\n<p>As you know, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/17\/in-market-audiences\">in-market audiences<\/a>, which have been available on the Display Network for some time now, help advertisers find prospects who are nearing the end of the buying cycle. Through the synthesis of search query data and activity analysis, Google is now able to identify these hyper-valuable subsets of your target demo <em>on the search network<\/em>.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Location Extensions for YouTube Ads<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Good:<\/strong> A totally disinterested stranger finds and watches your video on YouTube.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Better:<\/strong> A prospect sees your video on YouTube.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Best:<\/strong> A prospect sees your video, notices the new location extensions beneath it, then heads to your brick-and-mortar joint to buy bespoke shoelaces or chewing gum that never loses its flavor or [insert your product or service here].<\/p>\n<p>Welcome to the new PPC reality.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Google Surveys 360<\/h2>\n<p>Account managers rejoice!<\/p>\n<p>Surveys 360 allows users to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a survey<\/li>\n<li>Find a specific audience sample across the web<\/li>\n<li>Generate results quickly<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Why does this matter? It promises to make A\/B testing SO MUCH EASIER, by giving you the ability yo solicit feedback from customers. By asking someone why they clicked your ad, you can get an idea as to what\u2019s working (and what isn\u2019t) straight from the horse\u2019s mouth.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f466a9fe-b486-436a-b2e3-c7ca49389e46\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-surveys-360-announcement.png\" alt=\"google surveys 360\" width=\"800\" height=\"562\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>This was the feature that elicited the most favorable response from members of our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/marketing-services\">marketing services<\/a> team. Nic D\u2019Amato, a Senior Paid Search Strategist, said \u201cIt\u2019ll help with remarketing, with ad copy testing: it\u2019s got a bunch of applications and I\u2019m excited to try this out.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>6. AMP Ads and Landing Pages for Search &amp; Display<\/h2>\n<p>Mobile matters. (Duh.)<\/p>\n<p>According to Google, every additional second of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/adwords-landing-page\">landing page<\/a> load time represents a 20% dip in conversion rate. This is no good. You need fast(er) landing pages and you need them yesterday.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3a21873d-8310-485f-84b2-0cf16c122ded\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/amp-for-search-display-3.png\" alt=\"amp ads on mobile serp\" width=\"514\" height=\"545\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>AMP landing pages are Google\u2019s latest answer to improving page speed.<\/p>\n<p>But wait: it gets better.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to sending search traffic to AMP pages (as you can already do organically), Google has also unveiled Display ads for AMP pages. These ads allegedly load up to 5 seconds faster than regular Display creative: even though the ads look the exact same!<\/p>\n<h2>7. Google Optimize: The Landing Page Solution We\u2019ve Been Waiting For?<\/h2>\n<p>After the big shiny new UI, this has the potential to be the most interesting announcement to come out of Marketing Next.<\/p>\n<p>Google Optimize will now integrate with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/02\/google-adwords-rehab-facilities\">AdWords<\/a>, giving advertisers more agility in the often clunky, belabored world of landing page testing.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"8d8377de-aa6c-43bd-8c1b-69a77fcb3864\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-optimize-landing-page-testing.png\" alt=\"google optimize makes landing pages testing even easier\" width=\"705\" height=\"427\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Per Google: \u201cWith the Optimize and AdWords integration, you can quickly and easily create new versions of your landing pages and then apply them to any combination of AdWords campaigns, ad groups, and keywords \u2013 no coding or webmaster required.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Just let that sink in for a minute.<\/p>\n<p>Landing page variants with no coding required. It\u2019s a PPC fever dream like no other.<\/p>\n<p>Simplified landing page testing will give advertisers a massive advantage over their current selves (especially when you consider <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/16\/adwords-quality-score-reporting\">the new Quality Score reporting<\/a> available in AdWords, which allows us to view landing page experience on its own).<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m <em>really<\/em> curious to see exactly how this works and begin using it in my own clients\u2019 accounts.<\/p>\n<h2>8. Hello, Google Attribution<\/h2>\n<p>Another new product!<\/p>\n<p>The complexity of the average customer journey, which often traverses the digital and physical worlds, far exceeds my pay grade. Most attribution solutions don\u2019t really make life any easier on this front, so the majority of marketers are stuck in \u201cwhere did that conversion <em>actually come from<\/em>\u201d limbo.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"052100c2-5f28-4173-af39-7d470b9c9983\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-attribution-new-tool.png\" alt=\"google unveils new attribution modeling tool\" width=\"800\" height=\"407\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Google Attribution will allow you to view the true impact of your digital marketing efforts from 10,000 feet. For free.<\/p>\n<p>Attribution modeling is a pain (unless you\u2019re some kind of data scientist or something). This will make it easier. What\u2019s not to love?<\/p>\n<h2>9. New Landing Page Report<\/h2>\n<p>More mobile stuff. Shocker.<\/p>\n<p>For my money, this is the most actionable takeaway of the lot. Google has baked a nuanced, upgraded version of the PageSpeed tool right into the new AdWords UI.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3ffd04c6-e67c-4e97-ace1-5e1198aa67a7\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/mobile-friendly-test-1.png\" alt=\"Google Marketing Next conference mobile-friendly test results\" width=\"640\" height=\"418\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Outside of providing suggestions for optimizing the load time for a specific page, this new Landing Page Report will allow you to review a site-wide usability report and ask experts questions.<\/p>\n<h2>10. Google Assistant Makes Buying Easy<\/h2>\n<p>Offering users a simple way to pay for your goods or services would be fantastic, right?<\/p>\n<p>What if they could do so from their phone? Using only their voice?<\/p>\n<p>Interested? Cool.<\/p>\n<p>So is Google.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"b4463bf6-a23d-46d2-a0ff-335a9b66b703\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/buying-on-phone.png\" alt=\"making a purchase on phone using google assistant\" width=\"800\" height=\"250\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Per the announcement today, mobile devices (plural: people using multiple devices, like up to 5 in a day, is a thing) will afford prospects much faster checkout times. That\u2019s not the neatest part, though. That honor belongs to the way Google Assistant is being integrated.<\/p>\n<p>By uploading local inventory, a searcher can be alerted to the exact number of X product in stock at your shop <a href=\"https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/simple_image\/public\/images\/adwords-voice-purchase.gif?.WaWCtYITIY2tTu1QAdruJrhb4O2Gx_6&amp;itok=obnUqBq8\">in real time<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This one\u2019s got some stringent caveats (prospects must use Android Pay, the Play Store, or some form of payment stored in Chrome), but it represents the future, <em>man<\/em>.<\/p>\n<h2>11. Cookie the Dog<\/h2>\n<p>Last but definitely not least.
