Behavior and interest targeting<\/h3>\n<p>All of the targeting that is housed in the Behaviors and Interests sections of the major platforms are based on actions those users have taken around the web, both on platform and not. The AI portion comes into play when Google, Facebook, Snap, or another platform analyzes those user patterns and then groups them into the targeting options you see in the Ad Manager.<\/p>\n<p>On Facebook, we\u2019re able to target users who are interested in Advertising and Marketing simply by checking a box. That opts us into targeting users who have \u201cexpressed an interest in or like pages related to\u201d Advertising and Marketing. All determined by Facebook\u2019s AI systems, which we typically refer to in the ad world as machine learning.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/facebook-ads-interest-targeting.webp\" alt=\"facebook ads interest targeting\" width=\"866\" height=\"378\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-92554\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/facebook-ads-interest-targeting.webp 866w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/facebook-ads-interest-targeting-480x210.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 866px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 <strong>Are your search ads driving the best performance?<\/strong> Find out with a free, instant audit &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"lookalike-audiences\"><\/div>\n<h3>2.

For this audience, advertisers need to create a seed audience of desirable users, whether it\u2019s customers, pipeline, or some other high-value group, then Facebook will analyze that user group for patterns and create an audience that \u201clooks like\u201d them.

Text and image asset creation<\/h3>\n<p>The simplest version of AI in ad creation happens across just about every platform now.<\/p>\n<p>Whenever you begin creating a new ad in their editors, just about every platform will have some version of what you see above in Google Ads. The platforms will suggest text variations you can use in each of the different fields, usually based on the website you provided and other assets already in your account.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/google-ads-ai-asset-suggestion.webp\" alt=\"google ads ai asset suggestion\" width=\"337\" height=\"609\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-92496\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/google-ads-ai-asset-suggestion.webp 337w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/google-ads-ai-asset-suggestion-166x300.webp 166w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Both Facebook and Google now take AI ad creation one step further and have tools that will generate imagery for your ads as well.

Depending on how you\u2019ve leveraged pins, Google can then create almost any combination of those assets to fill the three available headlines and two available descriptions for each ad.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/responsive-search-ads-wordstream.webp\" alt=\"how responsive search ads work\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-92499\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/responsive-search-ads-wordstream.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/responsive-search-ads-wordstream-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Facebook has a similar option with its ad creatives as well.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/facebook-asset-suggestions.webp\" alt=\"facebook asset suggestion from ai\" width=\"900\" height=\"565\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-92500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/facebook-asset-suggestions.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/facebook-asset-suggestions-480x301.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Each time an ad auction takes place, the platforms use machine learning to dynamically generate an ad from your assets that it thinks will perform best for that given user, and is focused on achieving the stated goals of your campaign.<\/p>\n<p>While this use of AI is entirely behind the scenes and out of your control, aside from the assets you provide, it\u2019s a highly important and impactful use of AI in the ad platforms.<\/p>\n<div id=\"ad-enhancements\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. Ad enhancements<\/h3>\n<p>This last option is really just for Facebook at this point but is still important to point out. When you create ads on Facebook, you can opt into a number of what are called Enhancements.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/facebook-ad-enhancements.webp\" alt=\"facebook ad enhancements\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-92502\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/facebook-ad-enhancements.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/facebook-ad-enhancements-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>These are all options that Facebook can either adjust your current creative or add to it with additional media to enhance the user experience.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>There are eight different options for enhancements, including music, site links, text overlays, visual touch-ups, 3D animation, text improvements, image animation, and brightness adjustments.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/facebook-ads-ai-music-creation.webp\" alt=\"facebook ads ai music generation\" width=\"900\" height=\"752\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-92555\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/facebook-ads-ai-music-creation.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/facebook-ads-ai-music-creation-480x401.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Some of these you simply opt into, like the brightness adjustment, but others you can specify how you want the enhancement to look, even going so far as to choose the text and colors as well as the music. So even though they\u2019re \u201cautomatic\u201d enhancements, you do have some level of control over a few of the options.<\/p>\n<h2>AI features for bidding and budget controls<\/h2>\n<p>The last portion of AI within the ad channels I want to address will be around all of the algorithmic inputs for bidding and budget controls. But before we get there, we need to address the performance prediction abilities within the platforms.<\/p>\n<div id=\"predictive-performance-forecasting\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. Predictive performance forecasting<\/h3>\n<p>No matter which ad channel you use, their backend platforms are always trying to determine what it thinks your performance will be based on factors from other campaigns. Those could be campaigns within your own account or from other businesses in a similar sector. That\u2019s why the platforms are almost always providing some estimated performance metrics within their interfaces, even if you\u2019ve never advertised before.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/facebook-ads-estimated-performance.webp\" alt=\"facebook ads estimated performance\" width=\"520\" height=\"504\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-92556\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/facebook-ads-estimated-performance.webp 520w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/facebook-ads-estimated-performance-480x465.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 520px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have an impact here. If anything, it\u2019s the opposite.<\/p>\n<p>The more information you give the systems, the better they can perform. And I\u2019m not talking about just giving the platforms more budget.<\/p>\n<p>Although Google claims they don\u2019t need any conversion volume to optimize your campaigns for performance, the truth is they will always do better when you have a solid foundation of conversions to go on. The more data, the better.<\/p>\n<p>The same is true for Facebook. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/facebook-learning-phase\">Learning Phase<\/a> is a time period where the platform is still learning how to get the best performance from your ads, and conversion (or result) performance is a big portion of that.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/facebook-learning-phase-example.webp\" alt=\"facebook learning phase example message\" width=\"900\" height=\"651\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-92557\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/facebook-learning-phase-example.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/facebook-learning-phase-example-480x347.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>So, although the platforms are very smart and always looking to forecast performance in your campaigns, the best results will always come when you\u2019re using actions that have lots of volume and good data associated with them.<\/p>\n<div id=\"smart-bidding-strategies\"><\/div>\n<h3>8. Smart Bidding strategies<\/h3>\n<p>As a result of the platforms having predictive performance models, they\u2019re able to adjust your bids in real-time as you enter the auctions for different users.<\/p>\n<p>Google Ads has quite a few automated bidding strategies that can optimize toward just about any performance outcome you\u2019re looking for.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/google-ads-bidding-strategies-smart.jpg\" alt=\"google ads bidding strategies\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91784\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/google-ads-bidding-strategies-smart.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/google-ads-bidding-strategies-smart-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Facebook also has a couple of different options depending on if you\u2019re looking for volume or profitability.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/facebook-ads-bidding-strategies-wordstream.webp\" alt=\"facebook ads bidding strategies\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-92558\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/facebook-ads-bidding-strategies-wordstream.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/facebook-ads-bidding-strategies-wordstream-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>No matter which you choose, just as I mentioned before, make sure you\u2019re providing the platforms with as much data as possible to help them see patterns and predict where to best serve your ads for optimal results.<\/p>\n<div id=\"dynamic-budget-allocation\"><\/div>\n<h3>9. Dynamic budget allocation<\/h3>\n<p>The last way we can use AI in the platforms is to let them determine where our budget gets allocated. I left this one for last as it\u2019s the extension of basically all the other factors combined.<\/p>\n<p>Based on the conversion performance we see in a given campaign and the forecast performance, the platforms have some settings to choose where our budget should be spent.<\/p>\n<p>For Google Ads, this can be used via a Shared Budget. With Shared Budgets, you can combined multiple campaigns into a single budget, then Google will decide where to allocate the spend based on predicted performance. Rather than having $20\/day allocated to each of five campaigns, you could have $100\/day allocated across those campaigns, then let Google decide where those funds are best spend.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-shared-budgets-product-example.avif\" alt=\"google ads shared budget - product structure\" width=\"929\" height=\"488\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-90878\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-shared-budgets-product-example.avif 929w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-shared-budgets-product-example-300x158.avif 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-shared-budgets-product-example-768x403.avif 768w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-shared-budgets-product-example-480x252.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Facebook\u2019s answer to this is called Advantage+ Campaign Budget. The same logic applies, just across the ad sets within a campaign. Rather than setting individual budgets, you can add a budget at the campaign level, then Facebook will dynamically adjust the spend across ad sets based on what\u2019s been performing well and what\u2019s expected to help reach your campaign goals.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/facebook-advantage-plus-budget.webp\" alt=\"facebook advantage+ budget set up\" width=\"900\" height=\"379\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-92559\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/facebook-advantage-plus-budget.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/facebook-advantage-plus-budget-480x202.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Take advantage of AI to give your ads a boost<\/h2>\n<p>While there are always going to be much sexier versions of AI being talked about in external tools that may or may not cost money (like the new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-max-for-search\">AI Max for Search<\/a>), don\u2019t lose sight of the fact that there\u2019s plenty of AI functionality baked directly into the ad platforms themselves.
