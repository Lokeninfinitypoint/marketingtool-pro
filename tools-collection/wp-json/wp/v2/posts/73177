However, it&#8217;s crucial to have a way to measure the success of your event. Be sure you&#8217;re able to track how many people registered or attended your event, and how many may have interacted with your business.

Print advertising<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Although print advertising is a bit more of an &#8220;old-school&#8221; marketing channel, it&#8217;s still a lucrative strategy for many businesses. Print advertising includes tactics like direct mail, advertisements in publications such as newspapers or magazines, flyers, and more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Print advertising tips:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Solidify your creative strategy.<\/strong> Print advertising is all about the visuals you create to pop on your viewer&#8217;s page.

TV and radio<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>We can&#8217;t do a marketing channels roundup without a nod to traditional marketing channels like TV and radio. While digital marketing channels should primarily be your focus, TV and radio can help supplement any other online and offline promotions you may be running.<\/p>\n<p>Tips for TV, radio, and similar traditional marketing channels:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use your OTT ads as material for TV ads.<\/strong> Since TV commercials and OTT ads are so similar, you can knock out two marketing channels at once if you use the same video ads across both platforms.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Remember the rule of seven.<\/strong> A common mistake with traditional marketing channels is worrying that you&#8217;ll overtire your audience.
