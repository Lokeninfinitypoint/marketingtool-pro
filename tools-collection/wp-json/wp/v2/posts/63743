More often than not, they share their name and email. This is a relatively easy way to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/17\/b2b-lead-generation\">generate more leads<\/a> because you\u2019re offering something of value that your ideal client or customer wants, rather than simply asking for their email outright or pitching your offer immediately.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/gated-content-example-voluum.png\" alt=\"example of gated content - pdf guide from voluum\" width=\"720\" height=\"440\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63772\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/gated-content-example-voluum.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/gated-content-example-voluum-480x293.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Gated content can come in nearly any form.

For example, a CMO making an expensive purchasing decision is going to be more interested in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/03\/how-to-write-a-case-study\">case study<\/a> while a that shows what you do as a company rather than a checklist or guide.<\/p>\n<p>The file itself can be uploaded to your website and therefore accessible via a website page, but that page is not accessible to website visitors.

With your potential customers&#8217; contact info, you can follow up with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/30\/lead-nurturing-campaign-emails\">nurture emails<\/a>, and if you collect other information on your form, you can cater your copy and subsequent offers to their preferences and circumstances.<\/li>\n<li><strong> Inexpensive:<\/strong> With a proper <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/13\/content-marketing-strategy\">content marketing strategy<\/a>, creating gated content is inexpensive and therefore a high-ROI lead generation tactic.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Build trust:<\/strong> If a user finds a resource worth exchanging their contact information for, this indicates they find value in it, which helps enhance your brand authority.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p>If you&#8217;re looking for more great marketing strategies, look no further:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Free guide: <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite17BestMarketingStrategies.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_17BestMarketingStrategies_Download\">The 17 Best Marketing Strategies for Any Business<\/a><\/strong><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h4><strong><\/strong>Cons of gated content<\/h4>\n<p>There are a few cons to consider as well.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Barrier to entry:<\/strong> Having to share contact information might deter some people from actually accessing the resource. If this is a case study that can help someone make a purchasing decision, for example, you might stand to lose more than you gain. Then again, if a person isn&#8217;t interested enough to provide their contact information, this is a good way to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/25\/lead-qualification\">filter out unqualified leads<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>SEO:<\/strong> In addition, gated content is typically shared in the form of a downloadable PDF or other media type. As such, the text isn\u2019t on the webpage itself, meaning you can&#8217;t <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/seo\">optimize it for SEO<\/a> or use it for generating traffic.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are ways around this, however. For example, you can optimize the landing page for those keywords and &#8220;sneak in&#8221; the high-quality long-form content <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/06\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google\">required for the page to rank<\/a> in the form of FAQs below the fold of the page.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/gated-content-landing-page-seo-optimized-example.png\" alt=\"seo optimized landing page for gated content\" width=\"438\" height=\"618\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-63773\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can also use your ungated content to target high-volume keywords, and then promote gated content on those high traffic pages. This could even be a PDF version of the ungated content that has additional information and value.<br \/>\n<a id=\"how\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>How to create gated content in 7 steps<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re ready to generate more leads with gated content, there are a few important steps you need to take to ensure it actually achieves that goal. Use these tips to make sure you create a resource that works.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Choose the right content<\/h3>\n<p>For someone to give their personal information, they have to really want what you\u2019re offering. To figure out what they consider to be worthwhile, look at your blog traffic, customer and audience behavior, and even competitor resources that your current customers or clients find most valuable.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Determine the funnel stage<\/h3>\n<p>Figure out which stage of the funnel you\u2019re targeting with this gated content. Over time, you\u2019ll likely have options that fall within each stage. For example, a case study would likely be categorized as middle or bottom of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/01\/content-marketing-funnel\">content marketing funnel<\/a> because someone downloading a case study is more toward the evaluation and intent phases, rather than the awareness phase.<\/p>\n<p>Knowing the phase you\u2019re targeting will provide clarity around the type of resource you should create.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/content-marketing-funnel.png\" alt=\"content marketing funnel\" width=\"720\" height=\"745\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63246\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/content-marketing-funnel.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/content-marketing-funnel-480x497.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>3. Create a strong landing page&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>Your landing page contains information about the content that the visitor needs in order to decide whether to download it, as well as the form to obtain it. To <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/15\/landing-page-best-practices\">optimize your landing page for conversions<\/a>, you need a strong hook, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/06\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells\">compelling copy<\/a>, and very little clutter so the visitor is encouraged to fill out the form.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/great-landing-pages\">Here are some landing page examples<\/a> to give you some ideas. If your landing page is indexed (i.e., it can appear on Google), you&#8217;ll need to take care of all the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/06\/on-page-seo\">on-page SEO best practices<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>4. &#8230; and thank you page<\/h3>\n<p>This, of course, is the page the user is redirected to upon completing the form and is the most important part of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/25\/optimize-lead-generation-process\">lead generation process<\/a>. This page either contains a button to download the PDF or media file, or it lets the user know what to do next\u2014like check their inbox. You can even put a secondary, lower-funnel offer on your thank you page as a way to even further qualify an engage your lead.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/gated-content-thank-you-page-example-wrike.png\" alt=\"example of a thank you page from write after requesting gated content\" width=\"720\" height=\"438\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63770\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/gated-content-thank-you-page-example-wrike.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/gated-content-thank-you-page-example-wrike-480x292.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t have a marketing automation platform, you can use pageviews of the thank you page to see how many times something was downloaded.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Deliver on your promise<\/h3>\n<p>If the person doesn\u2019t get what they were promised, you end up hurting your brand more than helping it. Think about it: if a person fills out a form to get an ultimate guide on something, only to find that it&#8217;s not a comprehensive piece of content on the topic, you&#8217;ve now lost their trust, and any nurturing tactics you had planned are not going to work.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Follow up with and nurture your leads<\/h3>\n<p>This is one of the most important pieces because, once you have your leads, you need to get your offer in front of them. Depending on your product and sales process, this could look like creating a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/lead-nurturing-emails\">nurture flow<\/a> that continues to deliver value, while educating them on what you offer, for a certain number of days, weeks, or months after.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/gated-content-nurture-email-flow.png\" alt=\"gated content nurture email flow example\" width=\"331\" height=\"486\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-63774\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If sales calls are an important part of your selling process, your goal with these emails is likely then to get those who\u2019ve accessed the resource on a call. As such, all your emails are guiding the recipient to book that call.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Measure success &amp; iterate<\/h3>\n<p>As with anything in marketing, it takes time to get your gated content strategy right and optimize for the best results. Use data from Google Analytics, your CRM, and other <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/05\/b2b-marketing-automation-tactics\">marketing automation<\/a> tools to understand how successful the campaign was and then leverage that data to create gated content that works even better.<br \/>\n<a id=\"examples\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Examples of gated content<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re not sure where to start, use these examples of gated content and their associated landing pages to create a valuable resource that generates leads. In each of these examples, notice how the landing pages are simple, concise, and persuasive with a large lead form to encourage conversions.<\/p>\n<h3>1.
