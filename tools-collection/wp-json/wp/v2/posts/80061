A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/19\/conversion-rate-benchmarks\">conversion rate<\/a> above 3.2% means you&#8217;re acing it, comfortably sitting in the top 20% of digital storefronts. And if your numbers are soaring at 4.8% or higher? You&#8217;re the headline act, dominating the scene and turning browsers into buyers like you&#8217;ve got a magic wand for sales.<\/p>\n<p>But if your site&#8217;s conversion rate dips below 0.2%, it&#8217;s like being the DJ who can&#8217;t get the crowd moving. You&#8217;re in the bottom 20%, and it&#8217;s a clear signal to remix your strategy. But remember, if you&#8217;re already a high-flier over 3.2%, pushing for more might hit the point of diminishing returns, where the effort might not quite match the reward.<\/p>\n<h3>4.

Doing so doubled their likelihood of making a purchase, catapulting conversion rates by an impressive 102%.<\/p>\n<p>This data underscores a clear message: active interaction with customer reviews, photos, and videos turns shoppers into buyers, making UGC a vital key to unlocking e-commerce success.<\/p>\n<h3>6.

That\u2019s unchanged since 2019.<\/p>\n<p>The real eye-opener is the direct correlation between speed and conversions. If your site loads in a brisk one second, your conversion rates could triple compared to a five-second load time. Even more impressive, that same one-second page load can mean conversion rates five times higher than those of a 10-second loader. It&#8217;s clear that when it comes to clinching leads, every second shaved off your load time can make a substantial difference.<\/p>\n<h3>13.

If your pages load in just one second, you&#8217;re looking at ecommerce conversion rates that are a whopping 2.5 times higher than if your site takes a more leisurely five seconds to load.<\/p>\n<p>Bottom line? When it comes to B2C ecommerce, faster is better, and every second really does count.<\/p>\n<h3>14. Product reviews greatly affect conversion rates<\/h3>\n<p>Products flaunting just five reviews are <a href=\"https:\/\/spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu\/how-online-reviews-influence-sales\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">270%<\/a> more likely to be purchased than those with none. Talk about a skyrocket in consumer confidence!<\/p>\n<p>It seems the heftier the price, the heftier the influence of reviews. For more budget-friendly items, showing off reviews can pump up conversion rates by a solid 190%. But for those big-ticket items? A dramatic 380% boost. The graph paints a clear picture: reviews can nearly double conversion rates for low-priced goods and nearly quadruple them for the expensive stuff.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-high-price.webp\" alt=\"conversion rate optimization - graph comparing high and low priced items and conversion rate\" width=\"609\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-80077 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-high-price.webp 609w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-high-price-480x473.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 609px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu\/how-online-reviews-influence-sales\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Yet, when it comes to star ratings, perfection can raise eyebrows.

Personalized CTAs convert 202% better than standard ones<\/h3>\n<p>Personalized <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/20\/call-to-action-buttons\">call-to-action buttons<\/a> (CTAs) aren&#8217;t just effective, they&#8217;re like striking conversion oil. <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/personalized-calls-to-action-convert-better-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HubSpot&#8217;s deep dive<\/a> into over 330,000 CTAs over six months unearthed a sparkling stat: Personalized CTAs have a conversion rate that&#8217;s 202% better than your run-of-the-mill, one-size-fits-all CTAs.<\/p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t just small potatoes, it&#8217;s a full-on feast of potential. Why? Because personalized CTAs are like having a secret handshake with each customer, offering them something that clicks with their unique journey and interests.<\/p>\n<h3>16. Videos convert more with mid-roll CTAs and clear email asks<\/h3>\n<p>While conventional wisdom placed CTAs and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/22\/lead-capture-form\">lead capture forms<\/a> at the beginning or end of videos, <a href=\"https:\/\/wistia.com\/about\/state-of-video\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">data from Wistia<\/a> consistently shows that mid-roll placements are the conversion sweet spots.<\/p>\n<p>Despite a decrease in their usage, lead capture forms have seen a doubling in conversion rates\u2014hinting at untapped potential, especially when the forms include the term &#8220;email&#8221; in their copy.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, while allowing viewers to skip giving out their email might seem counterintuitive, it\u2019s proving effective. But the real conversion heroes? The fully gated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/13\/explainer-videos\">videos<\/a>\u2014those that require an email before proceeding\u2014see the highest conversion rates, suggesting that viewers are more willing than ever to exchange their contact information for valuable content.<\/p>\n<h3>17. CTA button color isn&#8217;t the conversion hero<\/h3>\n<p>Think a splash of red or a dash of blue on your CTA button is a game-changer for conversions? Not quite. It&#8217;s less about the hue and more about how the button pops against the page, grabbing attention and guiding users to click.<\/p>\n<p>Take a cue from Bing, who dialed up their revenue by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shockmarketer.com\/call-to-action-color\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$80 million<\/a> just by picking the perfect blue\u2014a blue not too different from Google&#8217;s, tapping into users&#8217; web-wired brains that equate blue with links.<\/p>\n<h3>18. Entertainment, games, and travel lead the pack on Apple\u2019s App Store<\/h3>\n<p>In the search ad scene in Apple&#8217;s App Store, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/1412216\/apple-app-store-ads-conversion-rate\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">travel and entertainment apps<\/a> were playing to win.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-apps2.webp\" alt=\"conversion rate optimization - graph showing entertainment apps get good conversion\" width=\"674\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-80078 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-apps2.webp 674w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-apps2-480x427.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 674px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/1412216\/apple-app-store-ads-conversion-rate\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>In the search ad scene in Apple&#8217;s App Store during the latter half of 2022, games and entertainment apps were playing to win.<\/p>\n<p>A staggering 69% of users who spotted an ad for a travel app couldn&#8217;t resist tapping on it. That&#8217;s like two out of every three people deciding to check out the app after seeing an ad.<\/p>\n<p>But hold your horses, because entertainment apps were the ones stealing the spotlight. They hit an eye-popping 79.69% conversion rate, meaning nearly 8 out of 10 people were swiping at those ads like there&#8217;s no tomorrow.<\/p>\n<h3>19. Events and navigation apps had the highest conversion rate in the Google Play Store<\/h3>\n<p>Now, let&#8217;s jump into the Google Play Store&#8217;s world, focusing on the US market. Here, the overall download conversion rate for Android apps was sitting at a comfy <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/1405963\/gp-store-app-conversion-by-category\/\">31%<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-apps1.webp\" alt=\"conversion rate optimization - app conversion rates in the Google play store\" width=\"936\" height=\"578\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-80079 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-apps1.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-apps1-480x296.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/1405963\/gp-store-app-conversion-by-category\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Now, let&#8217;s jump into the Google Play Store&#8217;s world for the first half of 2023, focusing on the US market. Here, the overall download conversion rate for Android apps was sitting at a comfy 31.3%.<\/p>\n<p>But check this out. Events apps, alongside maps and navigation, were crushing it with an approximate 84% conversion rate. Imagine that\u2014almost every time someone came across one of these apps, they just had to download it. It&#8217;s like these categories had the secret sauce that made nearly everyone hit &#8216;install.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>On the flip side, card and word gaming apps were hanging out at the other end of the spectrum, struggling to turn those ad views into downloads. It\u2019s a classic case of &#8216;not all apps are created equal&#8217; when convincing users to take the plunge.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Use these conversion rate optimization statistics to guide your strategy this year<\/h2>\n<p>In 2025, it will be all about getting creative to convert more business.
