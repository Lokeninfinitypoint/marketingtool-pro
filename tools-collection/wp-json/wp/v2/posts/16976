These early rumblings reached a crescendo a few days ago, when, as confirmed by Google\u2019s Danny Sullivan, Google began rolling the feature out universally:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"fe491033-fc71-48cc-a0b8-0ec137570f11\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-more-results-danny2028129.jpg\" alt=\"Google More Results Danny Sullivan\" width=\"495\" height=\"269\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>In this post, we\u2019ll give a full rundown on the \u201cMore Results\u201d test as it has unfolded, and discuss the potentially substantial ripples it could send throughout the world of paid and organic search.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s dive in.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4ae8eab9-7047-4416-b117-35eacbaddeb6\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-more-results2028229.png\" alt=\"Google More Results\" width=\"1365\" height=\"767\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>What Is Google\u2019s \u201cMore Results\u201d Test?<\/h2>\n<p>More Results is a mobile-only test currently in beta at Google. Google is experimenting with replacing the option to click to the next page of the SERP with the option to merely expand (or elongate) page one. To illustrate, here is a nice gif of the proposed action from Barry Schwartz over at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.seroundtable.com\/google-expands-more-results-button-test-25542.html\">Search Engine Land<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"47e53b83-4f0c-49c3-8cc5-87d699225a2e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-more-results-barry-schwartz2028129.gif\" alt=\"Google More Results Barry Schwartz\" width=\"640\" height=\"896\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>In theory, then, if More Results were to go completely universal, and if Google were to stick with it, pages two and up of the SERP would be indefinitely eliminated, and all results would exist on \u201cpage one.\u201d The effect that would have on ranking designations remains unclear. What <em>is <\/em>clear, at least for the moment, is that this is a mobile-only test.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5eba63fa-550f-496d-a865-f89ca771c861\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-more-results-danny-sullivan2028129.jpg\" alt=\"Google More Results Danny Sullivan\" width=\"494\" height=\"248\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>In theory (again), More Results is perfect for mobile. Back in <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/google-tests-results-mobile-search-interface-new-search-refinement-buttons-288765\">December of 2017<\/a>, Google tested a very limited version of More Results. The button itself came two-thirds up a truncated page, after just two or three search results. The current iteration of More Results would seem to offer the best of both worlds\u2014the decreased load time of staying on page one, with the full-bodied flavor of a full mobile SERP. An endlessly scrollable page\u2014in case, say, you reach result number 15, decided result number 5 was click-worthy after all, and want to quickly scroll back.<\/p>\n<h2>Implications: Desktop vs. Mobile<\/h2>\n<p>As I\u2019ve said, this experiment is tailor-made for mobile, and really doesn\u2019t change much of the current aesthetic. You\u2019re going from this:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"094af334-77fc-4db0-a062-40835ef6f0de\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-more-results-next2028129.jpg\" alt=\"Google More Results Next\" width=\"396\" height=\"66\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>And this:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"14496273-f362-4d18-8393-71fece6aa6ca\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-more-results-page22028129.jpg\" alt=\"Google More Results Page 2\" width=\"418\" height=\"60\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>To this:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a0ce68aa-4588-44f4-8fec-db89073a42b6\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-more-results-button12028129.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"325\" height=\"57\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Sideways to down. Nothing groundbreaking there.<\/p>\n<p>Still, the prospect of staying on one page is appealing, especially if you\u2019re remote and load speeds are already compromised\u2014a pretty common mobile occurrence.<\/p>\n<p>And on desktop? Does More Results make sense? Ehhhhhh.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"43335b13-556b-40b3-91b1-fe841837fc81\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-more-results-serp2028129.jpg\" alt=\"Google More Results SERP\" width=\"417\" height=\"89\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Sacrificing those funny-looking O\u2019s is going to make it awfully difficult to skip to page 3 on multiple IPs and vigorously up the click-through rate of your number 36-ranked blog post. Not that someone would do that. Ditto, it\u2019s going to make it hard for your average Joe to skip back to that bed and breakfast he mentally earmarked after his third tap of \u201cMore Results\u201d\u2014especially if he\u2019s tapped it 3 more times since then.<\/p>\n<p>But honestly, the most sensible argument against More Results on desktop might just be that we don\u2019t need it. The desktop experience allows for plenty of clicking accuracy, and desktop browsing (usually) receives the benefit of wifi-connected load speeds. More autonomy where you can afford it, right?<\/p>\n<h2>What about my ads?<\/h2>\n<p>The jury is still very much out on how More Results could affect mobile advertising (though we have some ideas). If you\u2019re among those thinking about the efficacy of your mobile AdWords campaigns, it might pay to direct some pointed concern <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dannysullivan\">@dannysullivan<\/a> (sorry, Danny), because we can\u2019t do much more than give it the eye test and make observations. That said, when you look at how ads appear on the current mobile SERP, there <em>is <\/em>one very interesting thing to note.<\/p>\n<p>Head to your mobile device and type in a query that\u2019s going to return some paid results. I went with, simply, \u201cmobile ads\u201d:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"83677338-eb20-400b-a875-ab34c7d9807f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-more-results-mobile-serp2028129.jpg\" alt=\"Google More Results Mobile SERP\" width=\"576\" height=\"1024\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Nothing out of the ordinary here. A few paid results to start, 10 organic results, and a few paid results to finish:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7dbd04c8-b8fc-4901-874a-473c94535c85\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-more-results-mobile-serp12028129.jpg\" alt=\"Google More Results Mobile SERP\" width=\"576\" height=\"1024\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>What\u2019s interesting, though, is what happens when you do tap \u201cMore Results\u201d:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"b5ce8edd-ae9b-42f4-9cc5-daf7adc1fc61\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-more-results-mobile-serp32028129.jpg\" alt=\"Google More Results Mobile SERP 2\" width=\"576\" height=\"1024\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>If that button says \u201cNext\u201d instead of \u201cMore Results,\u201d the next 3 or 4 results are ads. At the top of page 2. It appears that with More Results, however, in order to avoid listing six\/seven ads in a row, Google has pushed those ads beneath the 10 organic results you would normally see on page 2. That means that if your ad was in the 11th position in the mobile SERP, it\u2019s now in the 21st. Likewise, scroll down and tap \u201cMore Results\u201d again, and the ads you would normally see at the bottom of page 2 have been relegated beneath 10 <em>more <\/em>organic results.<\/p>\n<p>To put this in a less muddled conceptual lens, and using \u201cmobile ads\u201d as an example: in the old mobile SERP, the ratio of organic results to paid results per page was 10:7. On pages 1, 2, 3, so forth. In the <em>new<\/em> mobile SERP, the ratio changes from 10:7 to 10:3 after your first click of \u201cMore Results.\u201d Way less ads, way more organic results.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s too early to tell what, if any impact this change will have on mobile campaigns, but you can easily imagine some lost visibility on the paid side of things. Still, when Google has eliminated ads in the past (a la right-hand sidebar ads), it\u2019s because those ads were hardly getting clicks anyway. So it could be this will have little to no effect on impressions or clicks. We\u2019re keeping our ears to the ground either way!<\/p>\n<h2>What does it all mean??<\/h2>\n<p>If Google catches the amount of flack for More Results as if did for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/23\/google-zero-search-results\">Zero Results<\/a>, this experiment will last about as long as that one did: no longer than a week. Interestingly, More Results and Zero Results share the same ostensible benefit (decreased load time), but seem to contend with different stakeholders. The biggest detractors of Zero Results were SEOs (over the loss of organic traffic and visibility) and users (over the misunderstanding of their search intent). The biggest detractors of More Results may very well be acquisition specialists losing visibility in their paid campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>Clarity should emerge in the coming weeks!<\/p>\n<p><em>We\u2019ll do our best to update this post as the story develops.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In this post, we\u2019ll give a full rundown on the More Results test as it has unfolded, and discuss the potentially substantial ripples it could send throughout the world of paid and organic search.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":131,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[5],"tags":[],"dipi_cpt_category":[],"class_list":["post-16976","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-paid-search-marketing"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v25.8 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Google&#039;s &quot;More Results&quot;
