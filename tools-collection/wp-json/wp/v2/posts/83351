This documentation included over 2,500 pages of more than 14,000 attributes that Google measures, or can measure, as part of its algorithm.<\/p>\n<p>Rand Fishkin, co-founder and CEO of SparkToro, was approached by a then-anonymous source (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AEb8_rbfFVw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">he has since come forward<\/a>) about the content and authenticity of these documents. He shared findings from that conversation as well as his analysis <a href=\"https:\/\/sparktoro.com\/blog\/an-anonymous-source-shared-thousands-of-leaked-google-search-api-documents-with-me-everyone-in-seo-should-see-them\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>After countless publications covered the documentation leak with nary a word from Google, Google <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/5\/29\/24167407\/google-search-algorithm-documents-leak-confirmation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">verified<\/a> the documents are real on May 29.<\/p>\n<p>This leak provides never-before-seen access to the inner-workings of Google\u2019s algorithm\u2014the main takeaway being that Google hasn\u2019t been entirely truthful about what\u2019s in the algorithm over the last few years. <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p>One important thing to note: While the leak included documentation about metrics that Google either <em>is<\/em> collecting or <em>has<\/em> collected in the past, it did not reveal the weight of those metrics or whether or not they\u2019re currently being used as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/09\/google-ranking-factors\">ranking factors<\/a>. So while we know that Google has the ability to measure metrics like domain authority and clicks (which we\u2019ll get into later), we don\u2019t know exactly how important those metrics are to rankings from this source alone. And, of course, Google makes changes to its algorithms all the time.<\/p>\n<p>While we\u2019re not going to stake our whole strategy on the findings, it does provide some very interesting insights into how Google works.<\/p>\n<div id=\"what-google-measures-for-seo\"><\/div>\n<h2>7 things Google can measure that might affect your SEO<\/h2>\n<p>There were some surprising metrics Google is measuring, according to the leaked documents. We\u2019re sharing seven that stood out to us and what that means for your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/seo-tactics\">SEO strategy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"domain-authority\"><\/div>\n<h3>1. Domain authority<\/h3>\n<p>Previously, Google representatives have said that Google does not measure or consider <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-domain-authority\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">domain authority<\/a> at all. They claimed that they don\u2019t take the overall quality or authoritativeness of your site into account when ranking individual pages. However, the leaked documentation painted another picture.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn reality, as part of the Compressed Quality Signals that are stored on a per document basis, Google has a feature they compute called \u2018siteAuthority,\u2019\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/ipullrank.com\/google-algo-leak\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">writes<\/a> Mike King of iPullRank.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/google-ranking-factors-api-documents-site-authority-screenshot.webp\" alt=\"google algorithm api documents - screenshot of site authority ranking\" width=\"795\" height=\"217\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83378 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/google-ranking-factors-api-documents-site-authority-screenshot.webp 795w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/google-ranking-factors-api-documents-site-authority-screenshot-480x131.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 795px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What this means: <\/strong>Your domain authority <em>is<\/em> being measured by Google. Again, we don\u2019t know exactly if or how important it is to ranking, but Google is looking at it in some way. This means you need to have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/14\/website-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">well-built website<\/a> with high-quality, authoritative content, plus credible links to your site that prove your content is valuable. Find more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/12\/domain-authority\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ways to increase domain authority<\/a> here.<\/p>\n<div id=\"clicks\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Clicks and engagement<\/h3>\n<p>Not only does how many clicks you\u2019re getting matter, but also the <em>quality<\/em> of clicks you\u2019re getting from your organic rankings. Google has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.seroundtable.com\/google-ctr-ranking-clickbait-32368.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">previously said<\/a> (over and over, in fact) that clicks weren\u2019t a ranking factor, although many SEO experts have long debated whether or not that was true. Recently, <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/former-googler-google-using-clicks-in-rankings-432401\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">information<\/a> came out during the Google antitrust trial revealing that Google\u2019s Navboost system, based on click quantity and quality, is \u201cone of the important signals\u201d in ranking sites.<\/p>\n<p>So this inclusion isn\u2019t necessarily surprising at this point. But it is interesting to see that Google measures clicks in a variety of ways, including badClicks, goodClicks, lastLongestClicks, and unsquashedClicks, according to the documents.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/google-algorithm-document-leak.webp\" alt=\"google api documents - screenshot of navboost in google algorithm documents\" width=\"701\" height=\"593\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83379 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/google-algorithm-document-leak.webp 701w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/google-algorithm-document-leak-480x406.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 701px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sparktoro.com\/blog\/an-anonymous-source-shared-thousands-of-leaked-google-search-api-documents-with-me-everyone-in-seo-should-see-them\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>What this means: <\/strong>Focus on driving more successful clicks by broadening the amount of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/26\/intent-marketing\">high-intent queries<\/a> you target, and make sure the content on those pages is truly helpful to users. Useful content and strong UX are the best ways to send healthy engagement signals to Google.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA focus on driving more qualified traffic to a better user experience will send signals to Google that your page deserves to rank,\u201d writes Mike.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd0d Find high-intent keywords your content strategy can target with our<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Free Keyword Tool<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"content-freshness\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Content freshness<\/h3>\n<p>Content recency and freshness is another metric Google is measuring as part of its algorithm. There are many references to content publication and update dates within the Google API documents. In fact, Google reviews dates in the byline (bylineDate), URL (syntacticDate), and on-page content (semanticDate).<\/p>\n<p><strong>What this means: <\/strong>The more recent and relevant your content, the better. To keep your content fresh, it\u2019s necessary to check in regularly on the topics covered on your website to see if there\u2019s any outdated information.<\/p>\n<p>For example, you could use a <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite2024MarketingCalendar.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2024MarketingCalendar_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing planning calendar<\/a> to take note of any significant dates that may require your content to be updated and plan new content to keep your site fresh. Let\u2019s say your industry is real estate. In that scenario, you\u2019d want to update your site to reflect the latest interest rates.<\/p>\n<div id=\"change-history\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Change history<\/h3>\n<p>While Google cares about recency, it also would know if you were lying about it. It was found in the documents that Google keeps copies of multiple versions of all indexed pages. Essentially, Google could recall all changes made to a page over time. That said, it will only use <a href=\"https:\/\/ipullrank.com\/google-algo-leak\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the last 20 changes<\/a> of a URL when analyzing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What this means: <\/strong>The fact that Google is taking your pages\u2019 change history into consideration means you may want to be cautious when considering a series of changes to a given page. Making tiny changes to try to trick Google into thinking your content has been more dramatically updated could actually hinder your performance.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you were to update a blog post\u2019s publish date when the content is basically the same, that could hurt rather than help your rank. In short, try to keep your content truly fresh and up to date. Quality and accuracy matter more than a date on the page.<\/p>\n<div id=\"content-originality\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Originality<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cPages with little content,\u201d as it\u2019s put in the documents, get an OriginalContentScore. This score indicates that the less content you have on a page, the more original and unique it should be.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/google-algorithim-document-leak-content-score.webp\" alt=\"google algorithm documents - content score screenshot\" width=\"785\" height=\"256\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83380 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/google-algorithim-document-leak-content-score.webp 785w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/google-algorithim-document-leak-content-score-480x157.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 785px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ipullrank.com\/google-algo-leak\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>While there\u2019s no metric that measures character count, it\u2019s clear that Google is looking for any short-form content to have an added dose of authenticity.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThin content is not always a function of length,\u201d writes Mike.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What this means: <\/strong>If your content tends to be shorter, then you\u2019ll want to ensure it\u2019s unique and original. Try not to rely heavily on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/28\/ai-for-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">generative AI for your content<\/a>. Also, see what types of content your competitors are putting out to pinpoint ways you can <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-make-your-business-stand-out\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">make your business stand out<\/a> content-wise.<\/p>\n<div id=\"site-size-and-age\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. Site size and age<\/h3>\n<p>The Google \u201cSandbox\u201d is an SEO industry term used to describe the phenomenon of newer, smaller sites needing to go through a kind of waiting period before their pages rank. Google <a href=\"https:\/\/www.seroundtable.com\/google-sandbox-nope-28082.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">has previously denied<\/a> there being any sort of Sandbox, but there are factors mentioned in the documents that do look at site size, like smallPersonalSite, and age, like hostAge. However, it\u2019s unclear whether this could boost or demote a site.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What this means: <\/strong>A common <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/small-business-challenges\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">small business challenge<\/a> is being able to rank on Google quickly. It can be a long, slow road, so be patient and don\u2019t take shortcuts. Focus on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/19\/brand-community\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">building your brand<\/a><span> over time<\/span>. In the meantime, look for other ways to reach your target audience, such as building an email list, promoting your business on social media, running display ads, and more.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor small and medium businesses and newer creators\/publishers, SEO is likely to show poor returns until you\u2019ve established credibility, navigational demand, and a strong reputation among a sizable audience,\u201d writes Rand.<\/p>\n<div id=\"chrome-data\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. Chrome data<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s no secret that Google is able to measure data from its own online browser, Chrome. That data could be impacting your SEO rankings, however, because it was found in the Google API documents that the number of views from Chrome attributed to both individual pages and entire domains are being tracked.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;My read is that Google likely uses the number of clicks on pages in Chrome browsers and uses that to determine the most popular\/important URLs on a site, which go into the calculation of which to include in the sitelinks feature,\u201d writes Rand.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What this means: <\/strong>The more popular your pages are on Chrome, the better. Chrome owns <a href=\"https:\/\/gs.statcounter.com\/browser-market-share\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">66%<\/a> of the global internet browser market share, and it\u2019s by far the most popular browser in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>Having a site that your users love\u2014even if they find it through other means than search\u2014is likely good for your SEO in general, because Google knows if your site is getting traffic and engagement.<\/p>\n<p>While it may feel tempting to give up on SEO amidst all this recent Google news, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/17\/increase-online-presence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">strong online presence<\/a> is as important as it ever was. If you can optimize your pages to be what users from Chrome and other pages really want to click, it can also benefit your overall site rank.<\/p>\n<h2>Staying ahead of the latest Google algorithm ranking factors<\/h2>\n<p>The moral of this latest Google news story? The leaked Google API documents remind us to stay focused on what we always knew to be true: building site content that makes our audiences happy is what will ultimately bring us success. Plus, being mindful that Google doesn\u2019t always tell the truth about what it measures and what works is key.<\/p>\n<p>If you still feel like your search marketing and advertising is struggling to maintain growth during these times of constant change from Google, you\u2019re not alone.
