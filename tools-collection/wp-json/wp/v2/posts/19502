You guys may have Las Vegas and Atlantic City, but generally speaking, gambling is a cultural taboo in many parts of America. Not so in the U.K., where we\u2019ll \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ldoceonline.com\/dictionary\/have-a-flutter\">have a flutter<\/a>\u201d on almost anything \u2013 the UEFA Champions League Final, disastrous snap elections, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.betminded.com\/celebrity-death-pool-betting-14085.html\">\u201cdead pools\u201d of celebrity death predictions<\/a>, you name it.<\/p>\n<p>My countrymen\u2019s appetite for wagers of questionable taste notwithstanding, it doesn\u2019t surprise me that the most expensive keywords in this list are focused on gambling and online casinos. Online gambling is an obscenely profitable industry in Great Britain. Between April 2015 and March 2016, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk\/news-action-and-statistics\/news\/2016\/New-figures-show-online-gambling-is-largest-gambling-sector-in-Britain.aspx\">online gambling contributed $5.7 billion<\/a> (\u00a34.5 billion) to the British economy alone, so it makes sense that the competition for and costs of these keywords is so high. It\u2019s also very interesting to see that three of the four keywords in the Casino category are branded terms.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Here are a few more pockets of keywords that are especially pricy in the U.K. but didn\u2019t turn up on the U.S. or other lists:<\/p>\n<h2>Real Estate<\/h2>\n<p>Says Dan:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The U.K. has been experiencing a severe housing crisis for several years. Home ownership is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.redfernreview.org\/\">completely out of reach<\/a> for many people (especially those poor <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/02\/marketing-to-millennials\">Millennials<\/a>), and public concern about the nation\u2019s housing crisis is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.housing.org.uk\/resource-library\/browse\/lyons-housing-commission-members-update-report-november-2016\/\">the highest it\u2019s been in my lifetime<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s most interesting to me about this keyword data is the specific terms that we see above. The keyword \u201cequity release\u201d is included in the Finance category, but <a href=\"http:\/\/www.which.co.uk\/money\/pensions-and-retirement\/youre-retired-working-on-benefits-equity-release\/guides\/equity-release\/what-is-equity-release\">equity release<\/a> refers to a British financial instrument that allows homeowners over the age of 55 to access the equity they have tied up in their property either as a lump-sum payment or via a series of installments in the form of a secured loan. After years of failed government austerity policies, it\u2019s a little sad \u2013 but not at all surprising \u2013 to see more people searching for ways to access this equity as inflation has outpaced wage growth.<\/p>\n<p>The \u201cwe buy any house\u201d and \u201cselling my house quickly\u201d keywords are also very revealing. After years of rising house prices and skyrocketing rents, Britain\u2019s housing market is finally beginning to stagnate, which could account for the popularity of these search terms. There\u2019s a strong urgency to both these keywords; for property buyers hoping to turn a quick profit and capitalize on sellers\u2019 desperation, and for beleaguered homeowners eager to minimize depreciation and cut their losses through a quick sale.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>He also tells me \u201creal estate\u201d is a \u201cvery American phrase\u201d that Brits don\u2019t use! Sorry about that\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Examples of expensive keywords related to property include \u201cwe buy any house\u201d (this is the name of a property company in the UK) and \u201cestate agents Edinburgh.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Elderly Care<\/h2>\n<p>Variations on \u201clive-in care\u201d almost broke the top 10.

Likewise, keywords involving different types of lawyers (such as \u201cmalpractice lawyer\u201d and \u201cinjury lawyer\u201d) or insurance were grouped together. We used a similar methodology last time so as to avoid featuring too many specific long-tail or local keywords that wouldn\u2019t have broad applicability to a large number of businesses. We separated distinct services (pest control vs. termites) as much as possible.<\/p>\n<p>We also filtered out keywords with less than 100 clicks from our data set. We only looked at advertisers bidding in USD, GBP, AUD, CAD, and ZAR, and analyzed different currencies separately. We also eliminated non-English ads and duplicates (where both the keyword and the CPC were exactly the same) from that set. The results you\u2019re reading about in this article are in GBP.<\/p>\n<p><em>Shout out to everyone who helped compile, analyze, and illustrate the data: our data analyst Josh Brackett, our web team leader Meg Lister, and our designer Kate Lindsay.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What are the most expensive keywords in the United Kingdom?
