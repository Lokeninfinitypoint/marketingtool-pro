And I\u2019m not alone: According to <a href=\"http:\/\/expandedramblings.com\/index.php\/by-the-numbers-17-amazing-facebook-stats\/\">DMR<\/a>, <strong>65% of Facebook users log on daily<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>As marketers, we know how critical it is to have a business Facebook presence, but we also know that it\u2019s becoming increasing challenging to stand out among our peers. With over <a href=\"http:\/\/newsroom.fb.com\/company-info\/\">1 billion daily active Facebook users<\/a>, marketers need to be smart in terms of how they grow their audience and business through Facebook.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/smart-easy-facebook-marketing-ideas-2.png\" alt=\"facebook marketing ideas\" width=\"586\" height=\"293\" \/><\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s tricky, but it\u2019s not impossible! Here are <strong>10 smart Facebook marketing ideas <\/strong>to help you stand out in the crowded social sea.<\/p>\n<h2>10 easy Facebook marketing ideas<\/h2>\n<p>When you&#8217;re done here, head on over to these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/10\/facebook-post-ideas\">62 engaging Facebook post ideas<\/a> for inspiration!<\/p>\n<h3>1. Target an insanely specific audience<\/h3>\n<p>Did you know that you can target French and English speaking women, between the ages of 31-56, who live in a 10-mile radius of Boston, MA, who are \u201cfit moms\u201d of grade-school kids? Don\u2019t believe me? Check out my article on the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/10\/20\/facebook-audience\">11 unbelievably specific Facebook audiences you can target<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The super-sophisticated level of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/16\/ad-targeting\">ad targeting<\/a> is one of the main reasons to be excited about Facebook marketing. Hopefully, you\u2019ve dedicated time and resources to analyzing your customer base and forming <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/23\/buyer-personas\">buyer personas<\/a>; now you can put those personas to use and go after the people that are most likely to be interested in your products or offerings.<\/p>\n<p>Caution! If you go <em>too<\/em> specific this strategy can work against you so, keep an eye on the audience definition tool to ensure you\u2019re not getting so granular with your persona targeting that nobody sees your stuff.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-marketing-ideas-audience-definition.png\" alt=\"facebook marketing audience\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>2. Run a simple contest to up engagement<\/h3>\n<p>Facebook contests are nothing new, but that doesn&#8217;t make this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/10\/facebook-advertising-tips-for-small-business\">Facebook Ad tip<\/a> any less helpful. You\u2019ve likely been exposed to many, and have potentially even entered some (I know I have). But have you actually tried running one yourself?<\/p>\n<p>Running a contest with a tempting incentive is one of the best ways to spur ad engagement on Facebook. What beer lover wouldn\u2019t want a free trip to one of the best beer-fests in Boston (see ad below)?<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-marketing-costest-ideas-harpoon.png\" alt=\"facebook marketing contest ideas\" width=\"428\" height=\"440\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The best thing about running a contest is that it doesn\u2019t have to be overly complicated. Follow Harpoon\u2019s lead for instance, simply asking people to submit photos with your product in them, and then choosing a winner at random for a fun trip.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Create short, enticing video posts<\/h3>\n<p>So, you\u2019ve tried marketing your company with videos on Facebook, but people just don\u2019t seem to be interested? This is likely due to one of two reasons:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your videos are too long<\/li>\n<li>Or, they\u2019re just not engaging enough<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Facebook users are looking to be entertained. They\u2019re spending their time on a <strong><em>social <\/em><\/strong>platform, likely to kill time or stalk their friends, so you need to divert their attention quickly, with entertaining content. What better way to do that then through video?<\/p>\n<p>Other marketers are catching onto this trend. The amount of average daily video views on Facebook <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/visual-content-marketing-strategy\">doubled<\/a> from 4 billion video views per day to 8 billion, bewteen April and November of 2015!<\/p>\n<p>Companies like BuzzFeed have figured out the recipe to driving video engagement \u2013 keep it short and sweet, with a visually engaging thumbnail. I spent about 2 hours the other night watching these short video recipe posts on BuzzFeed Food\u2019s Facebook page.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-marketing-ideas-short-videos.png\" alt=\"facebook marketing video ideas\" width=\"333\" height=\"436\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As a bonus for you, the marketer, short videos are easier to film and edit! Here are <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/05\/marketing-videos\">15 tips for filming and editing marketing videos<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Use eye contact in your images to direct attention<\/h3>\n<p>People follow directional cues from other people. If everybody in the room looks up, you\u2019re going to look up too. This is human nature.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHuman beings have a natural tendency to follow the gaze of others, and we have been coached since birth to follow arrows directing us to where we should be looking\/going,\u201d says <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kissmetrics.com\/eye-tracking-studies\/\">Help Scout\u2019s Gregory Ciotti<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Take advantage of this fact to focus viewers\u2019 attention toward the most important part of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/03\/facebook-f8\">Facebook ad<\/a>. For instance, if you have a strong call-to-action, you could show an image with a person looking at or pointing to that text.<\/p>\n<p>Check out Moz\u2019s Facebook post below \u2013 the image shows a clear journey of where to direct your eyes, starting with Rand\u2019s gaze and then following the red arrows.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-marketing-ideas-directional-cues.png\" alt=\"ideas for facebook marketing\" width=\"392\" height=\"420\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>5. Post images of dogs acting like humans or babies acting like adults<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019m aware that this tip sounds bizarre. But it works! Why? Because who doesn\u2019t love dogs and babies?<\/p>\n<p>Oh, dogs and babies aren\u2019t related to your brand? Who cares? Make them related to your brand by giving them hilarious, brand-related captions. Bark Box happens to be in the pet industry, but they truly excel at this with adorable images of dogs with human-like captions.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-marketing-ideas-dogs-babies.png\" alt=\"facebook image ideas\" width=\"319\" height=\"383\" \/><\/div>\n<p>When you\u2019re doing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/02\/facebook-marketing-for-small-business\">Facebook marketing<\/a>, it\u2019s a good idea not to take yourself too seriously. Inserting some playfulness into your posts will grab busy, distractible people\u2019s attention, and this is the perfect formula to do just that: Baby + headset and suit + adult-like caption, always makes for a good laugh.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Target the leads you already have on Facebook<\/h3>\n<p>Did you know that you can upload a list of emails right into Facebook and then show your ads to that audience? Through <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/27\/facebook-custom-audiences\">Facebook\u2019s Custom Audiences<\/a> feature, you can target the leads you\u2019ve captured from your newsletter signup or other lead gen efforts, or perhaps a group of your current customers that you\u2019re trying to upsell.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-custom-audience-reach-size.gif\" alt=\"Facebook custom audiences reach size\" width=\"1185\" height=\"646\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In addition to focusing on insanely targeted audiences (see tip #1) you should also be crafting ads to the contacts you already have, but in an even more personalized way. For instance, let\u2019s say you have a list of people who downloaded a guide titled \u201cIntroduction to Building Your Own Website.\u201d You can upload that list of people and target them with a highly specific ad that refers to that guide and what the next steps are to take their website to the next level.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Clone your main revenue-generating audience<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019ve discussed a few strategies for creating relevant audiences; once you\u2019ve acquired enough data, you can clone your top-performing Facebook audience. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/28\/facebook-ad-targeting\">Facebook\u2019s Lookalike Audience feature<\/a> allows you to take an audience you already have and expand your reach by finding new leads that have similar attributes. You can pretty much clone your best customers. It\u2019s that simple!<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ad-targeting-create-lookalike-audience.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook ad targeting create lookalike audience\" width=\"600\" height=\"365\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>8. Humanize your brand with fun employee photos<\/h3>\n<p>Facebook is all about people. The original intent of Facebook was to interact with friends, not advertise your business, but it\u2019s easy for marketers to forget this. The problem is, pushing solely product-related messages is only going to take you so far. You need to show the people behind the brand to connect with your audience.<\/p>\n<p>There are a lot of companies that do this well \u2013 take Unbounce. They use their <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/16\/facebook-business-page\">Facebook business page<\/a> to show off employees in a humorous and relatable way.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/easy-facebook-marketing-ideas-employee-photos.png\" alt=\"facebook marketing post ideas\" width=\"321\" height=\"383\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>9. Only pay to promote your best content<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019re likely reporting on a bi-weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis to see which content is resonating with your audience in terms of page views, shares, comments, and other engagement metrics. With all of this knowledge at your fingertips, you should be using this data to decide where to focus your promotion budget. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/26\/content-promotion\">Put some money behind your best content<\/a> to get it even more exposure.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-marketing-content-promotion-ideas.png\" alt=\"facebook content marketing\" width=\"564\" height=\"318\" \/><\/div>\n<p>It might seem like common sense, but it\u2019s easier then you\u2019d think to let rockstar content fade away and acquire dust in the corner. Stop doing this, and run Facebook ads to give a second life to your content superstar performers. Evergreen content will still resonate with a larger audience if it did well when it was originally published. (This is especially effective for content that isn\u2019t ranking well in organic search.)<\/p>\n<h3>10. Use emojis in Your Facebook marketing<\/h3>\n<p>In May of 2015 WordStream\u2019s beloved data-scientist Mark Irvine found that <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/27\/emojis-in-ad-text\">ads with emojis get far higher click-through-rates<\/a> than ads without. Unfortunately, Google quickly caught on and emojis are no longer allowed in AdWords ad text.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.adweek.com\/news\/advertising-branding\/infographic-emojis-are-becoming-preferred-communication-tool-across-demographics-167355\">According to AdWeek<\/a>, <strong>92% of online users use emojis<\/strong>, and frequent users feel emojis express their feelings more accurately than words. Emojis are kind of like dogs and babies, people just like them. Moral of the story, use emojis in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/06\/10\/facebook-post-engagement\">your Facebook marketing posts<\/a> to add personality and emotion to your text.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-marketing-emoji-feelings.png\" alt=\"emoji marketing facebook\" width=\"303\" height=\"192\" \/><\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s just that easy.
