Have a marketing budget<\/h3>\n<p>A $0 marketing budget can\u2019t be stretched. I have worked with small businesses that historically allocated zero resources to marketing, and nobody is surprised to hear that these retailers were not performing to their full potential.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/optimize-marketing-budget-wordstream-monday-1.webp\" alt=\"Optimize marketing budget - screenshot of a Monday.com budget template.\" width=\"856\" height=\"453\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87279 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/optimize-marketing-budget-wordstream-monday-1.webp 856w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/optimize-marketing-budget-wordstream-monday-1-480x254.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 856px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>No matter how elaborate your <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-budget\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>budget template<\/em><\/a><em> is, you can\u2019t manage and optimize zero marketing dollars.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>There were retailers in our specialty retail industry who, like many small businesses, eliminated or significantly cut their promotional budgets during the recession. I get it. Consumers stopped having disposable income and subsequently stopped buying as many things, so why toss money into what seems like a burning pit of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/04\/marketing-collateral\">marketing collateral<\/a>? I\u2019ll tell you why: because eventually, people got new jobs, had disposable incomes again, and, most importantly, started buying things again.<\/p>\n<p>After the economy recovered (in most markets), the retailers that stayed on message and stayed promotional even when times were rough had a <strong>huge<\/strong> advantage over competitors that had been waiting on the sidelines for conditions to improve. In some cases, our post-crash promotional retailers overtook their silent, non-promotional <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-find-your-competitors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">competitors<\/a> by default and emerged as the single voice for consumers in their market.<\/p>\n<p>You need to build marketing into your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/28\/small-business-budget\">small business budget<\/a>.

Pick one social media channel and do it well<\/h3>\n<p>When Google+ was launched, I remember the collective panic expressed by the small business owners I worked with at the time. That same panic came along with the growing popularity of Instagram and Pinterest. Then there was Snapchat. How will an already insanely busy small business owner or marketer ever find the time and money to manage <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/social-media-marketing\">social media marketing<\/a> on a gazillion business pages when they\u2019re struggling to just promote one?<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 <strong>See what your competitors pay for Facebook ads!<\/strong> Get <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/facebook-benchmarks?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_FBAdsBenchmarks2024_Download\">The Facebook Ads Benchmarks Report.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/optimize-marketing-budget-wordstream-social-channels-1-1.webp\" alt=\"Optimize marketing budget - chart of popular social media channels.\" width=\"544\" height=\"593\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87287 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/optimize-marketing-budget-wordstream-social-channels-1-1.webp 544w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/optimize-marketing-budget-wordstream-social-channels-1-1-480x523.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 544px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Each <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/11\/most-popular-social-media-platforms\">major social media channel<\/a> has its own merits, but it&#8217;s nearly impossible to be successful on all of them at the same time.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Take a deep breath and stop panicking. Take a look at your resources and level with yourself. Can you really get the results you want with social if you try to be really good at all of them?<\/p>\n<p>If your answer is no, I have good news for you. My tried and true recommendation is to pick one or two and go all in. When you focus your time and money on a streamlined <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/19\/social-media-marketing-plan\">social strategy<\/a>, you can bring in all of those resources scattered across multiple properties and put them toward a more concentrated and simplified strategy.<\/p>\n<p>I can\u2019t tell you <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/24\/social-media-advertising\">which social media network to choose<\/a> because that depends on your business, but I will say that most B2C businesses that take my advice choose Facebook, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-drive-traffic-from-instagram\">Instagram<\/a>, or both, while most B2B businesses choose X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, or LinkedIn. When everyone tells you to start <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/09\/snapchat-ads\">advertising on Snapchat<\/a>, and you think your head might explode, you have my permission to just say no. You\u2019re welcome.<\/p>\n<div id=\"pay-to-play-in-social\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Pay to play in social (instead of thinking organic is enough)<\/h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s say that after you read tip #2, you chose <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/08\/facebook-marketing-ideas\">Facebook<\/a> as your social strategy focus. Good choice since Facebook is the most popular social network in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>Well, long gone are days of effective free <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-run-facebook-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">advertising via Facebook<\/a> business page posts. The good news is that Facebook advertising and boosted posts are highly effective and very affordable.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"fcf3f589-21dd-4d21-ae95-ce00a2b52263\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/small-marketing-budget-facebook-boost-posts.png\" alt=\"Optimize marketing budget - small marketing budget for facebook\" width=\"471\" height=\"162\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Facebook boosted posts insights from <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/columbuscaraudioaccessories\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Columbus Car Audio<\/em><\/a><em>, a specialty retailer with ~5,000 likes.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The screenshot above shows how a boosted post performed vs. an unpaid post, and I think it speaks for itself. This $30 boosted post ran during a freak snowstorm as a way to promote car remote start systems. Nope, I am not missing any zeros, my friends, that is thirty dollars. It reached 10,000 people, was clicked 531 times, and had 55 comments. Yay for freak snowstorms!<\/p>\n<p>You probably also noticed the post below it, however, which was not boosted and got only 265 views and 5 engagements. They paid more for the boosted post than the free one, but they got <strong>38 times the reach and a whopping 106 times the engagement<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Boosting posts isn\u2019t the only way you can pay to play on Facebook. Columbus Car Audio spends about $300-$500 per Facebook ad campaign and gains, on average, about 57 leads per campaign with about an 8% <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/11\/increase-conversion-rates\">conversion rate<\/a>. Considering that an average ticket for a 12-volt retailer is around $1500 (but usually higher!), they get a pretty healthy ROI from Facebook ads.<\/p>\n<p>Now, how about some good old-fashioned anecdotal evidence to pile on top of these statistics and charts? When I asked the folks over at Columbus Car Audio about their feelings on paid vs. organic social content, they replied, \u201cAnything paid definitely blows organic posts out of the water. We think Facebook ads are one of our most successful advertising endeavors, and we\u2019ve increased the budget tremendously for campaigns in 2016.\u201d Thanks, Columbus Car Audio, for sharing your stats and success with the world!<\/p>\n<div id=\"invest-in-email-marketing\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Invest in email marketing and shred direct mail<\/h3>\n<p>Sometimes, we do what we\u2019ve always done because it\u2019s safe and familiar and because we\u2019ve always done it. I know some businesses are still placing ads in print phone books (apparently, that is still a thing), and others are still choosing to invest in direct mail instead of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/01\/email-marketing-tips\">email marketing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Harvard Business Review did a comparison between direct mail and email marketing in <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2012\/08\/why-email-marketing-is-king\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this great article<\/a>. To summarize their case study, direct mail costs about 100 times as much as email marketing, and ROI-wise, email marketing campaigns performed about 95 times better.<\/p>\n<p>The barrier to email marketing that I hear most is, \u201cI have no list\u201d or, \u201cMy list is too small, and I don\u2019t know how to build one.\u201d You <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/11\/how-to-build-an-email-list\"><em>can<\/em> build a list<\/a> and you<em> can<\/em> do it cheaply.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"43edcc9b-b882-4222-9767-939d30e34f83\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/small-marketing-budget-email-list-offer.png\" alt=\"email for small marketing budgets\" width=\"588\" height=\"462\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>A simple popup with an attractive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/09\/call-to-action\">call to action<\/a> will generate new subscribers like crazy.<\/p>\n<p>Capture email leads on your website or sign up customers at checkout by clearly explaining the value of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/05\/increase-email-signups\">signing up for your newsletters<\/a> (so make sure there <em>is<\/em> value).
