There are a multitude of channels marketers and business owners can use to grow a business\u2013organic search, paid search, affiliates, influencer marketing, the list goes on. But email is the <em>only <\/em>channel that gives you the ability to send direct, no-cost messaging to a high-intent list of prospects or customers at the drop of a hat.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s the power of email marketing. The average email marketing conversion rate is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mailmodo.com\/guides\/email-marketing-conversion-rate\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">around 15%<\/a>. Compare that to, say, paid search, where average conversion rates are around <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/15\/google-ads-benchmarks\">7%<\/a>. You read that right. When done correctly, you can generate email conversions at nearly twice the rate that you generate clicks on your paid search ads.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/average-conversion-rate-email-marketing-vs-search-ads.webp\" alt=\"average conversion rates for search ads vs email marketing\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75148\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/average-conversion-rate-email-marketing-vs-search-ads.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/average-conversion-rate-email-marketing-vs-search-ads-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Getting 15 out of every 100 people to fill out your interest form or buy your product is great.\u00a0 But imagine extrapolating that 15% conversion rate out over hundreds and thousands of email subscribers.

It\u2019s easy enough to convert customers when they\u2019re on your subscriber list. But how do you actually grow a list that\u2019s big enough to contribute meaningfully to your bottom line?<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s exactly the challenge we\u2019re going to tackle today.

Sure, it&#8217;s great to collect as many emails as possible. But if you&#8217;re not collecting the right information along with those emails, then you&#8217;re going to miss opportunities down the line with your email marketing.<\/p>\n<p>Consider these attributes of an effective email list.<\/p>\n<h3>Easy to segment<\/h3>\n<p>You want to be able to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/04\/customer-segmentation-models\">segment users<\/a> in your email list based on demographics, interests, previous buying behavior, and more. This means you need to collect this information as you&#8217;re building your email list.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/customer-segmentation-models.webp\" alt=\"nine customer segmentation models\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-74999\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/customer-segmentation-models.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/customer-segmentation-models-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Easy to personalize<\/h3>\n<p>The basic level of personalization is to include the recipient&#8217;s name in the subject line or body copy of the email. So you need that info. But you can also collect more data that will allow you to further <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/06\/personalized-marketing\">personalize your email campaigns<\/a> to specific subscribers down the line.<\/p>\n<h3>Subscribers are engaged<\/h3>\n<p>If your email list is filled with people who aren&#8217;t opening your emails or are reporting your messages as spam, it can harm your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.campaignmonitor.com\/blog\/email-marketing\/9-things-that-are-killing-your-email-deliverability\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">deliverability rates<\/a>.

This will impact your form and opt-in process.<\/p>\n<h2>How to build an email list for free (or minimal cost)<\/h2>\n<p>Try these seven free or low-cost and extremely effective ways to build your email list.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Create a newsletter<\/h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/25\/email-newsletter-ideas\">newsletter<\/a> is one of the best ways to build an email list for your business. It gives subscribers a reason to provide their information, it&#8217;s easy to produce, and&#8211;best of all&#8211;it&#8217;s free!<\/p>\n<p>Your newsletter can include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Helpful content you produce on your website or blog<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/19\/customer-testimonial-examples\">Testimonials<\/a> or reviews<\/li>\n<li>FAQs<\/li>\n<li>Upcoming events your business is hosting<\/li>\n<li>Specials, promotions, or deals<\/li>\n<li>New product announcements<\/li>\n<li>Referral or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/09\/customer-retention-strategies\">loyalty program<\/a> information<\/li>\n<li>And much more!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/build-email-list-newsletter-example.webp\" alt=\"build email list - newsletter example\" width=\"621\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75163\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/build-email-list-newsletter-example.webp 621w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/build-email-list-newsletter-example-480x463.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 621px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The flexibility of a newsletter provides ample opportunities to connect with your audience and keep your email list engaged.<\/p>\n<p>You can encourage <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/11\/call-to-action-examples-for-email-newsletter-signups\">newsletter sign-ups<\/a> through a form on your website, by including an opt-in button any time someone submits one of your other forms (like a content download, online order, or contact request), or by using some of the ideas below.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\ud83d\udce9 Get ready-to-go email templates perfectly worded for every situation &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteEmailExampleTemplate.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Email_EmailTemplates_Download\">30 Free Email Templates<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<h3>2. Offer a discount to new subscribers<\/h3>\n<p>Nothing exactly novel here, but this is perhaps the most time-honored way to generate new subscribers. And while you may not count this as a &#8220;free&#8221; way to build an email list, it&#8217;s not going to cut into your costs. Offering new subscribers a 10%, 15%, or even 20% discount in exchange for joining your mailing list is a surefire way to generate new emails quickly.<\/p>\n<p>We see the most classic form of this is in the world of ecommerce:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/email-list-new-subscriber-discount.webp\" alt=\"how to build an email list - new subscriber discount pop up example \" width=\"806\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75131\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/email-list-new-subscriber-discount.webp 806w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/email-list-new-subscriber-discount-480x356.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 806px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But the premise remains the same for B2B businesses as well. Depending on the price point of your product or service, offering a discount is a low-risk way to get potential customers into the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/01\/content-marketing-funnel\">funnel<\/a>. It\u2019s an equally low-risk way for your potential customer to familiarize themselves with your brand and its offerings before committing to purchase.<\/p>\n<p>Just make sure to back up your welcome pop-up with a quality <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/18\/welcome-email\">welcome email<\/a>, a personalized nurture campaign, a newsletter, or any steady flow of compelling content that will demonstrate to your new subscriber that your brand is worthy of a purchase.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Gate your best content<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s true what they say: the best things in life are free. <em>Except <\/em>when it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/13\/content-marketing-strategy\">great content<\/a>. Keeping your great content out in the open\u2013on your YouTube channel, your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/02\/how-to-get-verified-on-instagram\">Instagram<\/a>, your blog\u2013is great for top-of-funnel engagement, but it\u2019s not going to drive growth through the middle of the funnel.<\/p>\n<p>Having great organic engagement with a minimal email list is a good problem to have. It just means you have to start <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/18\/gated-content\"><em>gating <\/em>(or putting forms in front of) your best content<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>That case study that you slaved over for hours? Don\u2019t just stick it on your website. Put it behind a form (like Salesforce does here).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/email-list-gated-content.webp\" alt=\"how to build an email list - gated content example from salesforce\" width=\"655\" height=\"597\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75132\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/email-list-gated-content.webp 655w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/email-list-gated-content-480x437.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 655px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>That in-depth how-to video you put on your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-for-free\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube channel<\/a>? Offer it exclusively to email subscribers, and promote it on some of your other videos that took you less time and energy to create.<\/p>\n<p>There are myriad ways to do this, but the point remains the same: really amazing content is hard to come by. If you\u2019ve put in the time and resources to create it, make sure you leverage it to grow your email list. We detail more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/15\/lead-magnet-ideas\">lead magnet ideas<\/a> here!<\/p>\n<h3>4. Run a contest or giveaway<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019ve made it this far into this post, you\u2019re probably starting to notice a theme: unless you have a show-stopping newsletter or super sticky brand that people want to keep a pulse on (and maybe you do!), you need to offer people something of value if you want them to join your email list. While this may not be totally free depending on the prize, it&#8217;s one of the best ways to grow your email list.<\/p>\n<p>Think of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/instagram-giveaways\">giveaway<\/a> that would really excite a potential customer in your space. Maybe it is a gift package that includes some of your premium products. Or maybe it\u2019s a free audit or consultation that you can segue, in the future, into a service offering.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/email-list-contest-giveaway.webp\" alt=\"how to build an email list - giveaway or contest pop up example\" width=\"936\" height=\"532\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75134\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/email-list-contest-giveaway.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/email-list-contest-giveaway-480x273.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Entrance into a sweepstakes, like the example above, is a fast and fun way to build your email list.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s my favorite method for generating emails through a giveaway:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Define the rules of your contest or giveaway, and define your prize package.<\/li>\n<li>Promote the giveaway across your social channels, your website, and any other marketing media you typically use.<\/li>\n<li>Using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/24\/facebook-lead-ads\">lead ads<\/a>, put some budget into a paid campaign on Facebook and Instagram. Use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/13\/facebook-interest-targeting\">interest targeting<\/a> and lookalikes to target broad audiences that generate a low cost-per-lead.<\/li>\n<li>Use compelling copy and imagery to drive home the value of your prize package.<\/li>\n<li>Bonus points if you can find an influencer or a like-minded brand or business to partner with to help you maximize exposure and drive up engagement.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Again, there\u2019s no wrong way to run a contest, but I\u2019ve found that by using the above tactics, you can generate new emails at a super efficient clip.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Leverage exit intent pop-ups<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019ve talked about pop-ups thus far in the form of the welcome pop-up. And honestly, <em>any <\/em>pop-up, so long as it is useful, not intrusive, and offers a relevant piece of content or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/05\/best-call-to-action-phrases\">CTA<\/a>, is going to help you build your email list.<\/p>\n<p>The key phrase here is <em>not intrusive. <\/em>Even the most relevant and useful piece of content can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/29\/ux-conversion-rates\">cause friction in your user experience<\/a> if it is offered at the incorrect time\u2013say, right when your user is educating themselves about your brand, or on the verge of taking another meaningful action.<\/p>\n<p>Exit intent pop-ups solve this problem by only triggering when a user is <strong>about to abandon the page<\/strong>. On mobile, this can take the form of clicking out of the browser or scrolling back up to the top of the page (a sign that the user is about to hit the \u201clast\u201d button on their mobile device). On desktop, it simply means that whenever your users\u2019 cursor leaves the browser window, you can hit them with a perfectly-timed message.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/email-list-exit-popups.webp\" alt=\"how to build an email list - example of exit pop up on website\" width=\"808\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75135\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/email-list-exit-popups.webp 808w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/email-list-exit-popups-480x356.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 808px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve used exit intent pop-ups on a variety of sites to great effect. They are super low risk and low friction, especially when you target exclusively new users and non-subscribers (repeat users and existing subscribers are more likely to be leaving your site temporarily).<\/p>\n<h3>6. Build great landing pages<\/h3>\n<p>If you really want users to take the action you want (in this case, join your mailing list), you need to hold their hand a bit. Just driving traffic to your homepage or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/20\/product-positioning\">product page<\/a> and hoping you get their contact information isn\u2019t going to cut it. In order to maximize your conversion rates, you need to constantly be creating (and split testing) relevant, <em>sticky<\/em> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/great-landing-pages\">landing pages<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>What do I mean by sticky? Sticky doesn\u2019t quite mean that there\u2019s <em>nowhere <\/em>else for a user to go once they hit your landing page; it just means that filling out your form is going to be their most enticing\/logical option.<\/p>\n<p>Just getting a user to a more granular landing page is a great start. But you want to then make it as difficult as possible for that person to leave the page without taking the desired action.<\/p>\n<p>Check out this landing page from Uber:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/email-list-landing-page.webp\" alt=\"email list - example landing page from uber\" width=\"781\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75136\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/email-list-landing-page.webp 781w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/email-list-landing-page-480x368.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 781px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>What I love about this lander is its simplicity.

You can leave the page, or you can fill out the form. Uber has even removed the top-level site navigation from this page, which is another trick that I love to use to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/03\/improve-conversion-rates\">maximize conversion rate<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\ud83d\udea8 Get the guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLiQContentDLHowToMakeGreatLandingPages.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_LandingPages_HowToMakeGreatLandingPagesGuide_Download\">How to Make Landing Pages (with Crazy-High Conversions!)<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<h3>7. Test and optimize your landing pages<\/h3>\n<p>There are a ton of cool landing page testing tools out there. Tools like Unbounce and CrazyEgg will allow you to create, host, and split-test standalone landing pages and measure the results. HubSpot has some nice design functionality but, in my experience, limited testing features.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to really invest in split testing, VWO is another pretty robust option that also gives you the benefit of personalization (dynamically catering the landing page experience to users based on what you know about them).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/email-list-test-optimize-landing-pages.webp\" alt=\"email list - unbounce landing page optimization tool \" width=\"648\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75137\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/email-list-test-optimize-landing-pages.webp 648w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/email-list-test-optimize-landing-pages-480x444.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 648px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Unbounce\u2019s testing UI, which includes the ability to create new variants and measure results.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Whatever <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/07\/landing-page-test-ideas\">landing page testing tool<\/a> you go with, make sure you\u2019re testing the following elements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Your headline<\/strong>.
