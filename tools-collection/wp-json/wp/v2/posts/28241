Let\u2019s go!<\/p>\n<h2>Mirror the visitor\u2019s end goal<\/h2>\n<p>Because many of your competitors are using <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adwords\/answer\/74992?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dynamic keyword insertion<\/a> and bidding on similar keywords, you\u2019ll notice that a lot of their ads <strong>say the same thing<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to get lost in the mix and hurt your chances of getting that click \u2013 so how can you stand out?<\/p>\n<p>Advertisers sometimes lose sight of what their customers are truly looking for. I call this <strong>\u201cThe End Goal:\u201d what people ultimately want to accomplish with the help of your product or service.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Understanding this can be the secret to writing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/16\/gallery-ads\">an ad that stands out<\/a> from the sea of DKI keywords.<\/p>\n<h3>A hypothetical example<\/h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you sell acne products and your visitors search for keywords like, \u201cHelp get rid of acne.\u201d You want to know <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/03\/how-to-write-exceptional-ppc-ad-copy\">how to write a Google ad<\/a> based on that search term.<\/p>\n<p>Your headline shouldn\u2019t ask prospects if they\u2019re \u201cDealing with Acne?\u201d \u2013 as the advertiser, you already know that they are.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-copy-get-rid-of-acne.png\" alt=\"adwords-copy-get-rid-of-acne\" width=\"560\" height=\"398\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Instead, you should speak to their End Goal \u2013 what they\u2019re looking to achieve \u2013 with a headline like this:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Kill Acne Once &amp; For All<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Don\u2019t give up very precious headline space for something you and the visitor already know. Instead, give visitors that end solution they\u2019re looking for.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>A real-world example<\/h3>\n<p>What if you\u2019re a car buyer who purchases cars from the general public? What should your Google ad copy look like?<\/p>\n<p>Interested prospects might search for something like this:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-copy-sell-your-car.png\" alt=\"adwords-copy-sell-your-car\" width=\"560\" height=\"310\" \/><\/p>\n<p>WeBuyCars.com tells the visitor they\u2019ll buy the car \u2013 which mirrors the prospect\u2019s end goal.<\/p>\n<p>To make it easy for people to convert and remove ambiguity, all these ads should focus on telling prospects what they want to hear: \u201cWe\u2019ll Buy Your Car Today.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Why? Because the goal of the searcher is to have someone buy their car. <strong>How they go about selling it isn\u2019t as important as actually getting it sold.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>With a headline like \u201cSell Your Car Today,\u201d the searcher might wonder if they have to list their car themselves on an AutoTrader-like platform and field calls from a ton of tire-kickers who aren\u2019t really serious about buying a car. Or even worse, will they get a call back from seven interested companies who will spam them until they die?<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve run this test, specifically for a car buyer, pitting \u201cNeed To Sell Your Car?\u201d (control) versus \u201cWe\u2019ll Buy Your Car Today\u201d (variation).<\/p>\n<p>This simple headline tweak resulted in a <strong>30% increase in conversions.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>\ud83c\udf32 <strong>Want to spruce up your Google Ads copy?
