Perhaps because being trapped at home for 11 months straight felt a little like taking a long journey across the ocean, a 19th-century sea shanty went completely <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/14\/tiktok-trend-discovery\">viral on TikTok<\/a>. What started as duets on the original video soon blossomed into sea shanty versions of contemporary songs.

Yes, that really happened.)<\/p>\n<p>Imagine you\u2019re leading marketing for your business at this time.

Do ask if this trend matters to your target audience<\/h4>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve assessed a trend\u2019s relevance for your industry, go a little deeper.

Do be creative<\/h4>\n<p>A viral trend goes stale quickly because it is, by definition, repetitive. There are only so many sea shanty videos a TikToker can watch before their eyes glaze over.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why creativity is essential for brands trying trendjacking. What unique spin can you put on the trend, and how can it help your content stand out from the others?<\/p>\n<p>This is also an opportunity to show off your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/31\/brand-personality-messaging\">brand\u2019s personality<\/a>. Don\u2019t be afraid to take a creative risk within the framework of the trend.<\/p>\n<h3>Trendjacking don\u2019ts<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019ve tried trendjacking in the past with little success, these don\u2019ts might be holding you back. Avoid these common mistakes to get further with your viral-inspired content.<\/p>\n<h4>5. Don\u2019t chase bad trends<\/h4>\n<p>Some trends aren\u2019t a good fit for your brand. But other trends aren\u2019t a good fit for <em>any<\/em> brand. Avoid these types of trends at all costs:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mean or offensive trends: <\/strong>Consumers don\u2019t like brands that punch down or are unnecessarily crass. If getting in on the trend means being petty or gross, don\u2019t do it. <em>*The exception here is brands with an edgy voice. Adult Swim, you can participate!<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Confusing trends: <\/strong>If your marketing team doesn\u2019t understand the trend, don\u2019t do it. That means the trend is either: 1) Inscrutable to everyone (in which case, why bother?), or 2) Potentially hazardous. You may be missing a nefarious meaning that resonates on some dark side of the web.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Hollow trends: <\/strong>This one can be hard to gauge\u2014who\u2019d have thought we\u2019d all still know <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mannequin_Challenge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the mannequin challenge<\/a> nearly a decade later?

Don\u2019t trendjack too often<\/h4>\n<p>Chasing every last trend is exhausting for your team. You have limited bandwidth, so think carefully before leaping at a trendjacking opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>Not only that, if your brand participates too regularly in viral moments, you become a one-trick pony. Give your team the breathing room to create meaningful content and your audience the space to be surprised and delighted when you <em>do<\/em> engage in a trend.<\/p>\n<h4>7. Don\u2019t take forever to post<\/h4>\n<p>Viral trends move fast. A new meme, GIF, or challenge may only last a week or so before it reaches peak saturation and completely sputters out. If you think of trendjacking as existing on a bell curve, you want to get your content out before the peak.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/trendjacking-wordstream-graph.webp\" alt=\"Trendjacking - Bell curve of popularity.\" width=\"937\" height=\"530\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-94887 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/trendjacking-wordstream-graph.webp 937w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/trendjacking-wordstream-graph-480x272.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If your internal approval process means it will take weeks to get your trendjacking content published, sit this one out.<\/p>\n<p>And if you work in a highly regulated industry where compliance and legal often need to opine on your marketing output, create a fast-track approval process for trend-related posts in advance. Then, when the right trend comes along, you\u2019ve already created a pathway for your team to get content out quickly.<\/p>\n<h4>8. Don\u2019t assume success<\/h4>\n<p>As you try trendjacking, always keep track of your content\u2019s results. Which trendjacking posts move the needle for your brand in meaningful ways (reshares, new follows, great consumer feedback, media mentions), and which fall flat?<\/p>\n<p>As you continue to play with trendjacking, you\u2019ll see patterns emerge. Identifying the elements of a trending moment that resonate with your audience can help you further refine your trendjacking strategy and drive greater social media success.<\/p>\n<h2>Try trendjacking for a big boost in brand awareness<\/h2>\n<p>When done successfully, trendjacking is a proven tactic for gaining a ton of attention, especially on social media.<\/p>\n<p>As you think through your first trend hijacking adventure, remember these dos and don\u2019ts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do target trends relevant to your industry<\/li>\n<li>Do ask if this trend matters to your target audience<\/li>\n<li>Do use relatable hashtags<\/li>\n<li>Do be creative<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t chase bad trends<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t trendjack too often<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t take forever to post<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t assume success<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Trendjacking is a great way to gain attention.
