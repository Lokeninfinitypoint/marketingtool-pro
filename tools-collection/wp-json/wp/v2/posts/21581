Unless you\u2019re a marketing expert, most people don\u2019t think about how much money goes into a steady marketing campaign.<\/p>\n<p>A good marketing agency won\u2019t try and sell you on what you can\u2019t afford, but try and figure out what will work best for your situation. All companies are different and have individual needs, but we have figured out a simple way to get your business on the right track for planning your marketing budget. This post includes a template and process for allocating your marketing budget whatever your company size and revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Now it\u2019s time to whip out that calculator and figure out your true marketing budget.<\/p>\n<h2>Calculating Revenue<\/h2>\n<p>One of the first steps to figuring out your marketing budget is to establish your total revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Talk to your CFO, financial department, or accountant and figure out your gross revenue or estimated revenue.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-calculate-a-marketing-budget.png\" alt=\"marketing budget how to\" width=\"843\" height=\"538\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Gross Revenue<\/strong> &#8211; Revenue received before any deductions or allowances, as for rent, cost of goods sold, taxes, etc.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Estimated Revenue<\/strong> &#8211; Amount of earnings projected for a given accounting period. This calculation can be important for a number of financial activities including estimating taxes due, budgeting, and issuing statements to shareholders and interested members of the public (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.wisegeek.com\/what-is-estimated-revenue.htm\">wisegeek<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>For our marketing budget example, we will say that our company\u2019s gross revenue for this accounting period is <strong>$100,000.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>Company Size<\/h2>\n<p>Are you a new up-and-coming company or an older, established company? Typically new companies are truly the ones that need to push their marketing. They are trying to establish their brand and gain loyal customers.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/company-size-typical-marketing-budget.png\" alt=\"marketing budget examples by company size\" width=\"861\" height=\"526\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Established companies, while they should always be marketing, don\u2019t have to push as hard; customers know their name and will purchase without even giving it a second thought (think Kleenex).<\/p>\n<p>For our example, let\u2019s say our company is an up-and-coming startup, have been around for about 2 years, and have 13 employees.<\/p>\n<h2>Marketing Budget Allocation<\/h2>\n<h3>Marketing Budgets for New Companies<\/h3>\n<p>For those new companies, at least 12%-20% of your gross revenue should be allocated to marketing. That seems like a lot, doesn\u2019t it? Especially for a smaller company!<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/suggested-marketing-budget-for-company-size.png\" alt=\"how to allocate marketing budget\" width=\"832\" height=\"558\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Well, think about it this way: You have this amazing new product or service \u2013 a major game-changer in your industry. But, no one is buying. Why? Well, probably because they have no idea it\u2019s even a real thing yet.<\/p>\n<p>Word of mouth only does so much, and new companies need to take their business to the next step. Marketing should be a major focus of these young companies; not only does it bring in new customers and leads, but establishes your brand in the industry. Once your brand is established, you can definitely discuss bringing down your marketing budget.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a startup, also check out:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/15\/adwords-for-saas-startups\">How SaaS Startups Should Be Using AdWords<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/15\/lead-generation-strategies\">6 Lead Generation Strategies from Fast-Growing Startups<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/10\/22\/demand-generation\">9 Killer Demand Generation Strategies for New Brands<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Marketing Budgets for Established Companies<\/h3>\n<p>For established companies, at least, 6%-12% of your gross revenue should be allocated to marketing. But why so little compared to those little companies? As previously mentioned, established brands don\u2019t need to market as heavily. They have their loyal customers that really aren\u2019t going anywhere. While they still need to market, they certainly don\u2019t need to allocate as many resources as a small company.<\/p>\n<p>For our example, our small company with a revenue of <strong>$100,000<\/strong> has decided to allocate <strong>15%<\/strong> of their gross revenue to marketing. By taking our revenue (100,000) and multiplying it by our marketing percentage (.15), we have come to a marketing budget of <strong>$15,000 <\/strong>for our accounting period.<\/p>\n<p>See, math can <em>sometimes<\/em> be easy.<\/p>\n<p>While there is no magical number for each and every company when it comes to setting a marketing budget, these percentages are a great starting point so your brand can get started on your marketing strategies.<\/p>\n<p>Check out the full infographic below.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-budget-infographic-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"marketing budget template\" width=\"2083\" height=\"6562\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>About the Author<\/h3>\n<p>Ryan Flannagan is the CEO and Founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/nuancedmedia.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nuanced Media<\/a>.
