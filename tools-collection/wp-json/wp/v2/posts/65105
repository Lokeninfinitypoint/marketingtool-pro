In addition to following best practices, many businesses are using accessibility widgets which allow users to customize their experience to their particular needs.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.neren.com\/\">NEREN<\/a>, or the New England Real Estate Network, is one such website. On the bottom right of the website you see an &#8220;Accessibility&#8221; button:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/real-estate-website-design-examples-neren-homepage-accessibility-plugin.jpg\" alt=\"real estate website design examples - accessibility plugin\" width=\"720\" height=\"520\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-65134\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/real-estate-website-design-examples-neren-homepage-accessibility-plugin.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/real-estate-website-design-examples-neren-homepage-accessibility-plugin-480x347.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Click on it and you can adjust the contrast, text size, and text spacing, as well as highlight links, pause animations, and make the content dyslexia friendly.

Long and Foster: Convey emotion with video<\/h3>\n<p>Looking for a place to live isn\u2019t just a stressful process because of logistics\u2014it\u2019s also emotional. In some cases, this search means an exciting step in a relationship; it could also involve leaving a home, with memories, comfort, and even family, behind. A real estate agent that understands the emotional stakes in the process is appealing. That\u2019s why you want to make sure to convey this understanding on your website.<\/p>\n<p>Video is a great way to do this genuinely. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.longandfoster.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Long and Foster<\/a> has a great video on its website that captures scenes of a family cooking together, a woman relaxing in her own living room, and more heartwarming moments at home.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/real-estate-website-design-examples-long.jpg\" alt=\"real estate website design examples - long and foster's website\" width=\"720\" height=\"327\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-65126\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/real-estate-website-design-examples-long.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/real-estate-website-design-examples-long-480x218.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In case the video didn\u2019t make it completely clear, the tagline spells it out: Search. See. Love.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Dawn McKenna: Cater to your target audience<\/h3>\n<p>Most of your potential customers will face a stressful experience, navigate the emotional impact of moving, and value insider knowledge about their prospective locations. But your website should also appeal to the specific experience of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">target customers<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, if you have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/20\/b2b-website-design\">B2B website<\/a>, you&#8217;ll want to cater your language to the decision-makers and executives. If your audience is families, you&#8217;d want to focus on school districts and suburbs. Or if your firm deals exclusively with waterfront houses, you\u2019re likely working with a lot of people purchasing second homes. This should shape all of your marketing decisions.<\/p>\n<p>Take <a href=\"https:\/\/dawnmckennagroup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dawn McKenna<\/a>. This real estate website is a great example of appealing to target customers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/real-estate-website-design-examples-dawn-mckenna.jpg\" alt=\"real estate website design examples - dawn mckenna's website\" width=\"720\" height=\"303\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-65127\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/real-estate-website-design-examples-dawn-mckenna.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/real-estate-website-design-examples-dawn-mckenna-480x202.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Take a look at the sleek Montserrat font, the dramatic visuals, the gray and white color scheme, the chef\u2019s kitchen with the integrated refrigerator, and the double oven.

I trusted her to have our back and she exceeded our expectations. Kristen is a gem of a person, she&#8217;s funny, fun to work with, and helps bring levity to what can be a really stressful process. We moved out of the Seattle area and I really wish they covered the area we moved so we could work with them again. Sweet Living officially set the standard I will hold all realtors to.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/real-estate-website-design-testimonials-sweet-living.png\" alt=\"real estate website design examples - reviews on sweet living's website\" width=\"720\" height=\"472\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-65138\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/real-estate-website-design-testimonials-sweet-living.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/real-estate-website-design-testimonials-sweet-living-480x315.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is a great review.

Zillow: Focus on ease of use<\/h3>\n<p>Now, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zillow.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zillow<\/a> isn\u2019t a perfect real estate website example. It\u2019s a listing tool, so it isn\u2019t run by an agent or a firm. But it is the stickiest real estate website out there, and one that sees <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/381468\/most-popular-real-estate-websites-by-monthly-visits-usa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">36 million visitors <\/a>each month. Worth getting some inspiration from.<\/p>\n<p>Part of the reason why Zillow is so compelling is that it\u2019s easy to use\u2014searching by city, map view, price, and more. The copy on Zillow\u2019s website emphasizes this appeal by presenting the process of buying or renting a home simply.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/real-estate-website-design-examples-zillow.jpg\" alt=\"real estate website design examples - zillow's homepage\" width=\"720\" height=\"242\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-65120\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/real-estate-website-design-examples-zillow.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/real-estate-website-design-examples-zillow-480x161.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Find it. Tour it. Own it. In this market? Not quite that simple, but it could be easier if you\u2019re starting on Zillow to find listings or figure out which area you want to be in.<\/p>\n<p>Another thing Zillow does really well is branding. Zillow is consistent with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/12\/color-psychology-marketing\">colors<\/a> and tone across its platforms. Take a look at its Twitter bio, for instance.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/zillow-twitter-account.jpg\" alt=\"zillow's twitter account\" width=\"600\" height=\"533\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-65118\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/zillow-twitter-account.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/zillow-twitter-account-480x426.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The row of houses with the on-brand blue. The \u201cHome, tweet home.\u201d line. It\u2019s wonderful\u2014and, even better, it\u2019s memorable.<\/p>\n<h2>Real estate website design takeaway tips<\/h2>\n<p>We went through a lot of real estate websites, so here\u2019s a quick overview of the key takeaways as they relate to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/fall-real-estate-marketing-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">real estate marketing<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Make it easy.<\/strong> Moving is stressful.
