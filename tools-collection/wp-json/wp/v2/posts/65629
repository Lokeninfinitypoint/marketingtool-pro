It&#8217;s about first understanding how the algorithm works, then creating a strong foundation based on that foundation, and then using the tools and tactics available to you to get ahead. Let&#8217;s dive in.<br \/>\n<a id=\"quality_score\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>1. Understand the power of Quality Score<\/h3>\n<p>With <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/14\/how-does-google-ads-work\">the way the Google Ads auction works<\/a>, higher quality ads get rewarded with higher positions and lower costs.<\/p>\n<p>Why? Because if Google serves crappy ads, it will lose searchers. And if no one clicks on those ads, Google doesn\u2019t make money.<\/p>\n<p>How? By factoring your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/quality-score\">Quality Score<\/a> into the algorithm. Your Ad Rank is your Quality Score multiplied by your maximum bid. Higher Ad Rank = higher position on the SERP. And your cost per click is the Ad Rank of the ad below yours, multiplied by your Quality Score, plus one cent.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/quality-score-ad-rank-cost-google-ads.png\" alt=\"diagram showing how higher google ads quality score means higher ad rank and lower costs\" width=\"533\" height=\"1041\" class=\"wp-image-65631 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/quality-score-ad-rank-cost-google-ads.png 533w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/quality-score-ad-rank-cost-google-ads-480x937.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 533px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As we see in the example, Sam gets the highest position and pays the lowest CPC even though he has the lowest bid, because of his stellar Quality Score. Jane, on the other hand, has bid the highest but hasn&#8217;t made it onto the SERP because of her poor Quality Score.<\/p>\n<p>In short, you can\u2019t just raise your bid if you want to compete in Google Ads. You need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/quality-score-tool\">raise your Quality Score<\/a>. So how do you do that? The three main drivers of Quality Score are click-through rate (CTR), ad relevance, and landing page experience. So the next three tips will cover those.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p><strong>\u2734\ufe0f How does your Quality Score compare to others in your industry?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Find out instantly with the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Free Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p><\/div><\/div><br \/>\n<a id=\"ctr\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>2.

Improve your ad relevance<\/h3>\n<p>Relevance has been taken to a whole new level these days. It\u2019s not just about being relevant to the search query, but also to the searcher themself. Here\u2019s how to do that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Include the keyword in your headline and description: <\/strong>Google also bolds the query that was searched, which attracts eyeballs and clicks. Here\u2019s an example for \u201caccounting software for small business:&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-compete-google-ads-keyword-bolded.png\" alt=\"how to compete in google ads - example of google ad with query terms bolded\" width=\"720\" height=\"615\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65634 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-compete-google-ads-keyword-bolded.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-compete-google-ads-keyword-bolded-480x410.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Refine your targeting: <\/strong>Use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/07\/google-ads-geotargeting\">geotargeting<\/a> to narrow your ads to particular locations and cater your copy to those geos.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use audiences: <\/strong>You can use audience targeting on top of keywords in search ads.

Perfect your landing page experience<\/h3>\n<p>The third piece to the Quality Score puzzle is landing page experience. Even more importantly, the landing page is how you make sure conversions happen, so even if your CTR is great and costs are low, you\u2019re not really competing if you\u2019re not converting. Here&#8217;s how to improve your landing page experience and optimize them for conversion:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use unique landing pages for each offer: <\/strong>Do not send all of your visitors to your homepage or to a generic landing page. You need a unique landing page for each offer and even each audience.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Keep it clean and clear:<\/strong> Balance out text with images and keep your text concise: Lead with benefits, support them with features, and use specific CTAs.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Consistency: <\/strong>The copy, imagery, and messaging in your landing page should be consistent with that of the ad that preceded it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Make it easy: <\/strong>The page should load fast, function well on any device, and if it contains a form, not ask for too much information.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/05\/perfectly-optimized-landing-page-wordstream.png\" alt=\"a perfectly optimized landing page\" width=\"720\" height=\"1159\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65458 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/05\/perfectly-optimized-landing-page-wordstream.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/05\/perfectly-optimized-landing-page-wordstream-480x773.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Get more tips in our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/great-landing-pages\">complete guide to persuasive landing pages<\/a>.<br \/>\n<a id=\"keywords\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>5. Optimize your keywords<\/h3>\n<p>At the heart of a successful Google Ads campaign is the right keywords. But it&#8217;s not enough to just do your keyword research, input the list into your campaign, and call it a day. You need to regularly maintain keyword lists and seek out new keywords to target. Here are some of our tips for keyword optimization:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use the search terms report:<\/strong> Though it&#8217;s gone through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/16\/google-ads-search-terms-report-changes\">some less-than-ideal changes<\/a>, it&#8217;s still the only one we&#8217;ve got. Use the search terms report to find the cheaper, higher-converting keywords that have less competition as well as new keywords to bid on. You\u2019ll also find potential <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/06\/negative-keyword-guide\">negative keywords<\/a> to add to your campaigns so you\u2019re not wasting money on bad keywords.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bid on competitors&#8217; terms: <\/strong>Look at your competitor\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/03\/19\/why-bid-on-branded-terms-ppc\">brand terms<\/a> and consider bidding on them. Chances are they\u2019re already bidding on yours.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Isolate low Quality Score keywords: <\/strong>Sometimes you\u2019ll have one or two keywords in an ad group that have consistently low Quality Scores no matter what you do. Rather than letting them drag down your ad group and campaign, Remove the ones with low Quality Scores and put them in their own ad group with hyper-focused ads and landing pages. If you can&#8217;t get a lift in performance there, you may want to pause or delete them if they&#8217;re not valuable enough for your business.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-compete-google-ads-keyword-quality-score.png\" alt=\"how to compete in google ads - keyword report with quality score\" width=\"720\" height=\"494\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65644 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-compete-google-ads-keyword-quality-score.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-compete-google-ads-keyword-quality-score-480x329.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>6. Examine your competition<\/h3>\n<ol start=\"7\"><\/ol>\n<p>This last one tends to get overlooked. We get so wrapped up in our own metrics that we forget the obvious: Look at your competition.

Master your bidding strategy<\/h3>\n<p>This guide focuses on all of the things you can do to compete in Google Ads without raising your bids. But that doesn&#8217;t mean you don&#8217;t need to have a solid bidding <em>strategy<\/em> to begin with. You can also adjust your bids so that you&#8217;re spending more in one area but less in anotherHere&#8217;s how to achieve that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Choose the right bidding strategy:<\/strong> Your bidding strategy tells Google how to spend your budget according to what you&#8217;re trying to achieve\u2014maybe you want as many clicks as possible. Or maybe conversions. Or maybe you don&#8217;t want to exceed a particular cost per lead. Use our\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/19\/google-ads-automated-bidding\">guide to all 10 bidding strategies in Google Ads<\/a> to determine the right one for you.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Try bid stacking: <\/strong>Despite Google harping on advertisers to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/06\/broad-match-smart-bidding\">&#8220;upgrade&#8221; to broad match with Smart Bidding<\/a>, and even recently releasing a beta test to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/13\/future-of-keyword-match-types\">disable match types at the campaign level altogether<\/a> to do this, we don&#8217;t recommend doing this.

If you&#8217;re using a Smart Bidding strategy, Google will adjust your bids for you, but you should still test out and see how different targets and minimums and maximums impact your performance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/google-ads-bidding-strategies-chart.png\" alt=\"what is target roas - google ads bidding strategies chart\" width=\"700\" height=\"430\" class=\"size-full wp-image-58094 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/google-ads-bidding-strategies-chart.png 700w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/google-ads-bidding-strategies-chart-480x295.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udcb0 Want more Google Ads budgeting tips? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>Free download <\/strong>&gt;&gt; <\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLDigestibleAdBudgets.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_GoogleAdsBudgetsGuide_Download\" class=\"waffle-rich-text-link\">The Easy Guide to Google Ads Budgets<\/a><\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><\/div><\/div><\/span><\/p>\n<p><a id=\"tools\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>8.
