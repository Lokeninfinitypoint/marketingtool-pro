Develop your restaurant\u2019s brand identity<\/h3>\n<p>Your brand identity is more than just your brand colors. It represents your business&#8217;s personality, the tone of your content, the emotions you want to inspire in your customers. &#8220;Happy&#8221; is not enough. Think about the most popular restaurants:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Taco Bell: humor and wit<\/li>\n<li>Cheesecake Factory: indulgence and extravagance<\/li>\n<li>Panera: health and freshness<\/li>\n<li>Olive Garden: family and comfort<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So first and foremost, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/18\/beginners-guide-to-target-markets\">understand your target audience<\/a>, then further segment that audience into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/23\/buyer-personas\">individual buyer personas<\/a> with interests and lifestyles you cater to.

Get a website<\/h3>\n<p>This is non-negotiable. At the bare minimum, you need a homepage, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/27\/guide-to-about-us-pages\">about us<\/a>, menu, and contact page. But ideally, you&#8217;ll want a reviews page, photo gallery, blog, and even a FAQ page.

Establish your mission statement<\/h3>\n<p>This goes along with your brand identity, and should be a documented statement expressing the purpose of your business. Is it to make healthy food more affordable? Is it to encourage family bonding? Promote sustainability? Your mission statement should state what you provide, where\/to whom, why you do it, and how.

The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/11\/most-popular-social-media-platforms\">most popular social media platforms<\/a> for restaurants are Facebook and Instagram, but TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, and even LinkedIn have their place for many brands.

Get listed on restaurant apps<\/h3>\n<p>Dining and restaurant apps are among the best free restaurant marketing tools, as getting found on one of these means getting found by people with high intent. Dining apps allow users to filter very specifically, so the key to these is adding as many details as possible, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Category (There are far more than the eight in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thrillist.com\/news\/nation\/most-popular-type-of-restaurant-in-every-state-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thrillist chart above<\/a>.)<\/li>\n<li>Website<\/li>\n<li>Address and phone<\/li>\n<li>Store hours<\/li>\n<li>Menu<\/li>\n<li>Price Range<\/li>\n<li>Photos, and lots of \u2018em<\/li>\n<li>Attributes: wifi, outdoor seating, parking, special diets, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/how-to-market-a-restaurant-yelp.png\" alt=\"how to market a restaurant - yelp search results\" width=\"720\" height=\"475\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58239\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/how-to-market-a-restaurant-yelp.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/how-to-market-a-restaurant-yelp-480x317.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As for which apps to get listed on, these include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yelp (check our <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/07\/22\/yelp-reviews\">Complete Guide to Yelp<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Zomato (formerly Urbanspoon)<\/li>\n<li>Open Table<\/li>\n<li>Zagat<\/li>\n<li>TripAdvisor<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>6.

You need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/03\/google-my-business-optimization\">optimize your Google Business Profile<\/a> if you want it to appear in the Local 3-pack, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/02\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps\">rank higher on Google Maps<\/a>, and actually attract customers from your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/listings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">listing<\/a>.

Eaters love to do research online \u2013 in fact, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.grabstats.com\/statcategorymain.aspx?StatCatID=23\">89% of consumers research a restaurant<\/a> online prior to dining. This is why it\u2019s of <strong>vital importance that all your<\/strong> <strong>restaurant details are online and up to date, <\/strong>including address, phone number, hours, your current menu, etc. The stronger and more accurate your online details are, the better.<\/p>\n<p>\u2b50\ufe0f <strong>Get all the tips you need to collect more reviews in this free guide download &gt;&gt;<\/strong>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/how-to-get-more-reviews?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_howtogetreviews_Download&amp;itm_source=localiq&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\">How to Get More Reviews: 8 Tips to Boost Ranking, Reputation, &amp; Revenue<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>7. Have a sleek, functional online menu<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Don\u2019t make users scramble to find your menu or squint to see it. <\/strong>Provide a high-quality, easy-to-read menu that is up to date and accurate. Not sure how? Some delivery sites like those mentioned below offer to publish your menu online for free. <a href=\"http:\/\/openmenu.com\/\">Open Menu<\/a> is another great site that can help you get your menu looking sleek and stylish (it even offers some handy social integration, for both paid and free users).<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/restaurant-marketing-sleek-menu-example.jpeg\" alt=\"restaurant marketing ideas - attractive menu example\" width=\"500\" height=\"607\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58198\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/restaurant-marketing-sleek-menu-example.jpeg 500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/restaurant-marketing-sleek-menu-example-480x583.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nStill, you\u2019ll want to make sure to have your menu published on your website, since that\u2019s often the #1 piece of information users are looking for when visiting your site (along with hours, location, and contact info).<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have a good menu online and available for customers, most of your other restaurant marketing strategies are basically useless! In this day and age <strong>customers <em>need <\/em>to have access to an online menu<\/strong>, otherwise they\u2019ll simply look elsewhere. And speaking of restaurant marketing strategies&#8230;<\/p>\n<div id=\"restaurant-marketing-strategies\"><\/div>\n<h2>Restaurant marketing strategies<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you have your basic foundation established, it&#8217;s time to get into the specific strategies that will help you to attract customers to your restaurant and keep them coming back.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Ask for reviews<\/h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/online-review-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">power of online reviews<\/a> is undeniable, and customers are almost always happy to leave them. But the thing is, they still need a little prompting. This means that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">asking for reviews<\/a> should be a part of your restaurant marketing strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some ways to do it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have an artistic and framed sign near the mints with an easy-to-remember link or QR code.<\/li>\n<li>Include a request and link on your website, menus, coupons, punch cards, and receipts.<\/li>\n<li>Ask for them in person<\/li>\n<li>Occasionally ask in social posts<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/restaurant-marketing-strategies-ask-for-reviews.png\" alt=\"how to market a restaurant - twitter post asking for review\" width=\"400\" height=\"566\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58241\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/restaurant-marketing-strategies-ask-for-reviews.png 400w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/restaurant-marketing-strategies-ask-for-reviews-212x300.png 212w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>2. Respond to reviews<\/h3>\n<p>Whether and how you respond to your customers&#8217; reviews shapes the public&#8217;s perception of your restaurant.\u00a0 Here are some tips:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Respond to positive reviews to show that you value your customers&#8217; input and to encourage more of them.<\/li>\n<li>Thank customers for their reviews, positive and negative.<\/li>\n<li>Respond to negative reviews promptly, publicly, politely, and professionally, then offer to take the resolution offline.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I\u2019ve seen this work in favor of many businesses, as reviewers are often flattered at the consideration shown and are more generous in their critique knowing the restaurant owner values their opinion and is working hard to improve.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Send out an email newsletter<\/h3>\n<p>Your restaurant&#8217;s newsletter can include new menu items, upcoming events, coupons, customer stories, and more. And it doesn&#8217;t have to be weekly. In fact, users will probably appreciate a less flooded inbox if you simply send them a newsletter every month or so. Some quick tips:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Here are our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/05\/increase-email-signups\">tips to get more newsletter signups<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Get inspiration from these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/11\/call-to-action-examples-for-email-newsletter-signups\">creative email signup call to action examples<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Choose from these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/25\/email-newsletter-ideas\">email newsletter ideas<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/restaurant-marketing-ideas-cracker-barrel-newsletter-example.png\" alt=\"restaurant marketing - cracker barrel newsletter\" width=\"450\" height=\"843\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58197\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/restaurant-marketing-ideas-cracker-barrel-newsletter-example.png 450w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/restaurant-marketing-ideas-cracker-barrel-newsletter-example-160x300.png 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udceb Want email marketing ideas for every month of the year? <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite2024MarketingCalendar.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2024MarketingCalendar_Download\">The Mega Must-Have Marketing Calendar<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>4. Turn your Facebook business page into a community<\/h3>\n<p>Businesses with a<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-increase-social-media-presence\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> strong social media presence<\/a> are the ones that fare the best, and in the competitive food industry, ignoring social media is a death sentence. We already mentioned creating a Facebook page above, but not about leveraging its power to market your restaurant. Here&#8217;s how to do it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Treat your page like a listing: Facebook is a business directory! Fill out all fields, encourage reviews, and keep it updated.<\/li>\n<li>Post regularly: customer photos, upcoming events, special offers, hours updates, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Engage with your followers: Inspire discussions, respond to comments, follow them back.<\/li>\n<li>Change out your cover photos seasonally.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Also check out this list of easy <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/08\/facebook-marketing-ideas\">Facebook marketing ideas<\/a> for any type of business.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; align-content: space-evenly; border-top: 1px solid #000; border-bottom: 1px solid #000; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly; padding-top: 50px; padding-bottom: 50px;\">\n<div style=\"margin: auto; display: flex; flex-direction: row; flex-wrap: wrap; align-items: flex-start;\">\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px !important; padding-right: 10px;\">Brought to you by<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/WS-Logo-2023.webp\" alt=\"wordstream logo\" width=\"130\" height=\"auto\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 30px !important; text-align: center; margin-top: 5px;\">Ready to grow your business?<\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin: auto; width: 70%; padding-bottom: 25px;\">\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px; text-align: center;\">Unlock the results you\u2019re looking for with technology-backed solutions designed for small businesses and agencies.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"margin: auto;\"><a style=\"padding: 10px 50px; border-radius: 24px; background-color: #0047ff; color: #f9f5ea; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;\" onmouseover=\"this.style.background='#0097ff'\" onmouseout=\"this.style.background='#0047ff'\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/marketing-services?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Demo_Blog_Demo&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links&amp;itm_content=incontent_links_htmldesign\">Get your free demo<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h3>5. Loyalty programs<\/h3>\n<p>Partnering with online apps encourages visitors to check out your restaurant through gamification and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/10\/customer-loyalty\">customer loyalty programs<\/a>, which offer visitors a free purchase or discount for visiting a certain number of times.<\/p>\n<p>Popular foodie apps that offer integrated loyalty programs include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bellycard.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Belly<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thelevelup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LevelUp<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.loyalblocks.com\/\"><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.perka.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Perka<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You could also kick it old school and hand out punch cards. They aren\u2019t quite as cool as apps, but they still show that you value customers and appreciate their loyalty.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Local SEO<\/h3>\n<p>While Google can infer your location based on your online information, and a searcher&#8217;s location based on their IP address, that doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;ll rank in local results for every relevant search. In other words, you need to do your<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/local-marketing-lab\/seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> local SEO:<\/a><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get listed on the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/best-free-business-listing-sites\/\">top local listing sites<\/a> (we&#8217;ve touched on this already).<\/li>\n<li>Embed a Google Map of your location in your Contact Us page.<\/li>\n<li>Publish content specific to your location regularly.<\/li>\n<li>Get online reviews (the number one <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/09\/google-ranking-factors\">ranking factor<\/a> in local SEO)<\/li>\n<li>Make sure your information is as identical as possible across all your online assets. Google doesn&#8217;t like inconsistencies!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>7. Invest in paid ads<\/h3>\n<p>Running paid ads on platforms like Google and Facebook will get your restaurant in front of large volumes of qualified eyes. For help incorporating paid media into your restaurant marketing plan:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/07\/google-ads-geotargeting\">location targeting<\/a> to ensure only users in certain cities or within a specific radius see your ads (eliminating non-relevant clicks, which can cost you big ad bucks).<\/li>\n<li>Follow these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/20\/facebook-ads-for-restaurants\">Facebook ad tips for restaurants<\/a> to get the most out of the platform.<\/li>\n<li>Check out our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/04\/optimize-google-local-advertising\">guide to Google local advertising<\/a> to make sure you&#8217;re optimizing your account for the highest ROI.<\/li>\n<li>Have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/16\/mobile-ppc-strategy\">mobile PPC strategy<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Mobile ads tend to be cheaper than desktop ads, and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/16\/mobile-ppc-strategy\">mobile boasts impressive conversion rates.<\/a> What\u2019s really cool is that Google Ads allows for all kinds of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/18\/mobile-ad-strategies\">mobile customization and targeting options<\/a> that let you get the most out of your bids. For example, you can increase your bids around dinnertime, when users are often looking for fast food on their mobile phones. Boosting your bids during the dinnertime period increases your chances for showing up for a specific query. This means you could be the first ad to show up for a \u201cpizza\u201d search when pie-hungry users are on the search for a slice.

Start a blog<\/h3>\n<p>Starting your own blog is a great way to build community and engage with your customers. Blogs offer the chance to experiment with your restaurant\u2019s voice and personality. Share your successes and struggles, funny stories, recipes, and anything else you think might interest your customers.<\/p>\n<p>A blog can be a huge project, but it doesn\u2019t <em>have<\/em> to be. <strong>Keep your blog as simple or complex as you\u2019d like<\/strong>. You don\u2019t have to be constantly posting (quality over quantity), but it\u2019s good to have your restaurant blog set up for when you have an announcement or news you want to get out to the world. If you\u2019re serious about taking over the world, check out more <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/24\/blogging-tips\">blogging tips<\/a> here.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Offline marketing strategies<\/h3>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget about the physical world in your restaurant marketing plan! These tactics are still effective, especially if you&#8217;re a local restaurant.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Postcards<\/li>\n<li>Menus<\/li>\n<li>Care packages<\/li>\n<li>Free samples<\/li>\n<li>Local newspaper, radio, and TV<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"restaurant-marketing-ideas\"><\/div>\n<h2>Restaurant marketing ideas<\/h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take these strategies one step further with some easy and creative <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/restaurant-marketing-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">restaurant marketing ideas<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Foodie photos<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019ve ever logged onto<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/06\/instagram-marketing-for-restaurants\"> Instagram<\/a>, you\u2019ll understand that food porn is alive and well.<\/p>\n<p>Arguably the very best way to promote your restaurant online is with high-quality, drool-inducing photos. Visual content is in high demand online these days, and having delicious-looking photos on your website and across various social media outlets is essential for drawing hungry eyes.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/restaurant-marketing-ideas-food-art.jpg\" alt=\"restaurant marketing ideas - food photos\" width=\"720\" height=\"395\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58245\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/restaurant-marketing-ideas-food-art.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/restaurant-marketing-ideas-food-art-480x263.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nBe warned though \u2013 taking really great food photos can be tougher than it looks, as lighting is often a key factor. Consider hiring a pro to take some top-notch photographs, or try it DIY style with your smartphone (you can use our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/26\/product-photography\">product photography tips!)<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>11. Offer coupons &amp; discounts<\/h3>\n<p>Providing coupons and discounts for your restaurant is always a surefire way to bring customers running. Offer a free dish to your new email newsletter subscribers (<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/05\/increase-email-signups\">we can show you how to get more of those too<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can try advertising a discount through Groupon or Living Social \u2013 if you go that route, you\u2019ll get a TONS of exposure, but you\u2019ll end up paying a hefty portion of sales to the deal website, so keep that in mind.<\/p>\n<h3>12. Share your reviews<\/h3>\n<p>Not only does the quantity and quality of reviews impact how high you rank in results and whether customers click on your result, but also, the content of those reviews makes for excellent marketing material. Sync them to appear on your website, share them on social, and even incorporate reviews on specific dishes into your menu.<\/p>\n<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\ud83d\udcd7<strong> Free Guide<a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite30BestWaysToPromote.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Marketing_The30BestWaysToPromoteYourBusiness_Download\"> &gt;&gt; The 30 Best Ways to Promote Your Business<\/a><\/strong><\/div><\/div><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>13. Be an Insta-ham<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/06\/instagram-marketing-for-restaurants\">Instagram marketing for restaurants<\/a> is a no-brainer.<\/p>\n<p>Show off your storefront, get up close with your top dishes, and use this social media main stage as a place to <strong>play around with your brand identity<\/strong>. For example, an all-natural health food store might try snapping pics of people kayaking, cooking, farming, or other activities you think your fan base will enjoy.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/restaurant-marketing-ideas-instagram-style.jpg\" alt=\"restaurant marketing ideas - instagram feed\" width=\"600\" height=\"829\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58191\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/restaurant-marketing-ideas-instagram-style.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/restaurant-marketing-ideas-instagram-style-480x663.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Also be sure to <strong>have some fun with hashtags<\/strong> \u2013 whether jumping on the hype of existing popular <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/02\/twitter-hashtags\">Twitter hashtags<\/a> like #ThrowbackThursday or inventing your own, hashtags are a great way to have some fun with fans.<\/p>\n<p>Instagram is a no-brainer for those in the food business \u2013 learn even more about <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/06\/instagram-marketing\">Instagram marketing here.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>14. Food blogger outreach<\/h3>\n<p>When you\u2019re a new restaurant, you may find it difficult to generate reviews and hype about your business. One great way to get reviews and press on the web is to invite food bloggers to your restaurant to give you a try, and consider offering a free meal or appetizer to get them in the door. Politely ask if they\u2019d be willing to review your restaurant and share their experience online.<\/p>\n<p>You can\u2019t outright ask for a positive review, as that would be dishonest, but it\u2019s fine to simply ask them for an objective restaurant review. Some bloggers might decline your offer, but the more you ask, the better your chances are of getting some positive feedback and generating more interest online.<\/p>\n<p>Some food bloggers have big followings, and getting their attention can have a huge influence on your restaurant. Even just one write-up or mention from a major foodie can be huge for <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/restaurant-promotion-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">restaurant promotion<\/a> efforts.<\/p>\n<h3>15. Show off your staff<\/h3>\n<p>In an age of robotic customer service reps and soon to be self-driving cars, the human element is severely lacking. Show off your 5-star staff doing what they do best! Seeing happy, smiling employees does wonders for your reputation, as customers long to be served by joyful workers.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/restaurant-marketing-ideas-show-your-staff.jpg\" alt=\"retaurant marketing ideas - example of staff pic\" width=\"600\" height=\"515\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58193\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/restaurant-marketing-ideas-show-your-staff.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/restaurant-marketing-ideas-show-your-staff-480x412.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nShowing off your pleasant employees also provides major reputation points \u2013 happy workers say a lot about a business, and fans are sure to take notice.<\/p>\n<h3>16. Share positive press<\/h3>\n<p>Another major restaurant marketing tip \u2013 when you\u2019re mentioned in a news outlet or magazine, be sure to <strong>show off your good publicity on your website and via social media<\/strong>. Fans will spread the word, and newcomers will be encouraged to visit in person when they see trusted sources celebrating your restaurant.<\/p>\n<h3>17. Social media contests<\/h3>\n<p>The key to Facebook and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/11\/instagram-giveaways\">Instagram giveaways<\/a> is to have an appealing prize. Don&#8217;t do a boring gift card, offer something specific like, free sides, an extra pizza, dinner for two, swag, free delivery for a month. and more. Have people enter by posting about and tagging your business and\/or using your hashtag on Instagram. This is a great way to increase your followers and bring in your local audience (especially for a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/restaurant-grand-opening-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">grand opening<\/a>).

Source local ingredients<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Customers love to hear that they\u2019re eating local, and sourcing local ingredients from nearby can do a lot to boost your fan base and give you a positive reputation in the community. If it\u2019s not out of your budget, definitely consider this option!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/restaurant-marketing-ideas-local-sourced-food.jpg\" alt=\"restaurant marketing ideas - locally sourced food\" width=\"720\" height=\"448\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58246\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/restaurant-marketing-ideas-local-sourced-food.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/restaurant-marketing-ideas-local-sourced-food-480x299.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>19. Partner up with delivery services<\/h3>\n<p>In today\u2019s online-driven environment, ease of use is the name of the game. Many online delivery services streamline the ordering process, and internet-savvy patrons often love taking advantage of such delivery services.<\/p>\n<p>Consider partnering with services like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Seamless<\/li>\n<li>Eat24<\/li>\n<li>Foodler<\/li>\n<li>Delivery.com<\/li>\n<li>GrubHub<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Some customers may even discover you for the first time<\/strong> through services such as these!<\/p>\n<h3>20. Trivia nights<\/h3>\n<p>Weekly or monthly trivia nights are always a hit with restaurants. Offer great prizes to the winners, good in-between music, and promote it on social media and your newsletters to spread the word.<\/p>\n<h3>21. Fishbowl business card giveaways<\/h3>\n<p>Let customers drop their business cards into a bowl for a raffle. The reward can vary \u2013 a lunch for the winner and 10 friends, a 2-hour happy hour with discounted drinks, whatever you feel like!<\/p>\n<p>Not only are these raffles fun, but you can also make use of those business cards by emailing customers. Let them know that while they didn\u2019t win this time, they can sign up for your newsletter to be notified of their next chance to enter, plus the opportunity to hear about discounts and other offers they\u2019d enjoy. Then tadaa \u2013 you\u2019ve got yourself a bunch of super valuable new newsletter subscribers!<\/p>\n<h3>22. Start a food truck<\/h3>\n<p>Starting a food truck isn\u2019t for the faint of heart \u2013 it\u2019s a tremendous endeavor and, depending on the kind of truck you want to buy, it can be very pricey. However, starting a food truck enables you to dish out your food to folks you might never normally come in contact with. You can greatly extend your reach, build more press, and acquire new fans who might love you so much that they become patrons of your brick-and-mortar location as well!<\/p>\n<h3><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/restaurant-marketing-ideas-food-truck.png\" alt=\"restaurant marketing ideas - food truck\" width=\"600\" height=\"386\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58247\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/restaurant-marketing-ideas-food-truck.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/restaurant-marketing-ideas-food-truck-480x309.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/h3>\n<h3>23.

Promote user-generated content<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/28\/user-generated-content\">User-generated content<\/a> (lovingly dubbed UGC) is a great way to develop personal and intimate engagement with users. Host a photo contest by asking customers to share their favorite meal at your establishment, and share the entries on a dedicated content page (and\/or share submissions across your various social networks). Consider awarding some random lucky contestants with a free appetizer or other prize!<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/restaurant-marketing-ideas-user-generated-content-barking-crab.jpg\" alt=\"restaurant marketing ideas - user-generated content example\" width=\"450\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58192\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/restaurant-marketing-ideas-user-generated-content-barking-crab.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/restaurant-marketing-ideas-user-generated-content-barking-crab-226x300.jpg 226w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Hosting and promoting user-generated content <strong>shows customers that you appreciate them<\/strong>, turning occasional visitors into die-hard devotees.<\/p>\n<h3>25.

Time those Tweets<\/h3>\n<p>Twitter can be a true treasure for restaurants, and timing your tweets can have a big influence on hungry stomachs.
