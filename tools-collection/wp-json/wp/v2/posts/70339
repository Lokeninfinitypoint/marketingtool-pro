The trip must go on! This post covers everything you need to get your PPC engine up and running again so you can hit the road and reach your destination.<\/p>\n<h2>10 reasons your Google Ads aren\u2019t converting (&amp; how to fix!)<\/h2>\n<p>The reasons your Google Ads aren&#8217;t converting can range from technical errors to strategic snafus and everything in between. Here are 10 culprits and how to solve them.<\/p>\n<h3>1. It\u2019s too early<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re just starting out in online advertising, it\u2019s important to make sure you understand how machine learning works. Ad platforms are designed to deliver your ads based on the conditions you select, and then, as users interact with the campaign, use that data to detect patterns and further optimize.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, it needs a certain amount of data in order to learn how to best serve your ad. The time it takes to meet this threshold is known as the algorithmic learning period, and will vary based on how many times your ad is getting served.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-learning-period.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"237\" height=\"130\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9269 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-learning-period.png 237w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-learning-period-100x55.png 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If your ads aren\u2019t converting right away, Google may still be in that learning period. You may need to give your campaign more time to learn, or you may need to increase your budget or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/21\/google-ads-audience-targeting-cheat-sheet\">expand your targeting settings<\/a> so that it can hit that threshold faster.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Your expectations are too high<\/h3>\n<p>Are your Google Ads not converting at all or simply not converting <em>enough<\/em>? If you\u2019re getting zero conversions, there may be some troubleshooting to do (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/24\/google-ads-conversion-tracking\">we cover several conversion tracking hangups here<\/a>). If you\u2019re getting fewer conversions than you expected, double-check your expectations.<\/p>\n<p>In our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/11\/10\/search-advertising-benchmarks\">latest search advertising benchmarks analysis<\/a> (as of writing this post), we found the average conversion rate across 23 different industries to be 7.26%, but this should not be the standard you use to gauge your conversion rates. Instead, you should be looking at your industry average. After all, the average conversion rate for Furniture is 2.21% while for Physicians and Surgeons it\u2019s 13.94%.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/google-ads-not-converting-average-conversion-rate-google-ads.png\" alt=\"why aren't my google ads converting - average conversion rate\" width=\"700\" height=\"723\" class=\"size-full wp-image-70351 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/google-ads-not-converting-average-conversion-rate-google-ads.png 700w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/google-ads-not-converting-average-conversion-rate-google-ads-480x496.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">You can find our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/online-advertising-benchmarks\">always-updated online advertising benchmarks here<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>This is because some conversion actions are easier for customers to take (like making a call or booking an appointment) than others (like purchasing or signing up for a free trial). Even within your account you\u2019ll have bigger commitment conversion actions in some campaigns than others.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Your conversion tracking is broken<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re seeing zero conversions for your Google Ads campaign, there\u2019s a chance your conversion tracking may be broken or was not set up properly. If you were seeing conversions but aren\u2019t anymore, check your change history to see if you made any changes that could have caused a problem.<\/p>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t seen any conversions at all, use our guide on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/30\/google-ads-conversion-tracking\">how to set up Google Ads conversion tracking<\/a> to make sure you got all the steps right.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Your location targeting is off<\/h3>\n<p>When you set up a Google Ads campaign, you will be asked to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/07\/google-ads-geotargeting\">choose your location targeting<\/a>. Of course, local businesses should target only their local area and national businesses may want to consider sticking just with major cities. But one nuance that could be impacting your conversion rates is the presence\/interest settings.<\/p>\n<p>You have three options:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Presence or interest: People in, regularly in, OR showing interest that location.<\/li>\n<li>Presence: People in or regularly in that location.<\/li>\n<li>Interest: People searching for that location.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-geotargeting-location-options-presence-interest.png\" alt=\"google ads location targeting - location options\" width=\"500\" height=\"241\" class=\"size-full wp-image-51042 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-geotargeting-location-options-presence-interest.png 500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-geotargeting-location-options-presence-interest-480x231.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Google defaults to the top option, which is not ideal for some businesses. After all, a person looking up an area because they\u2019ll be vacationing there is not going to be interested in veterinary services there. So make sure you choose the right setting for your business.<\/p>\n<h3>5. It\u2019s a seasonal dip<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/21\/how-to-run-google-ads\"> just starting out in Google Ads<\/a>, you will have your own learning to do about your audience and your campaigns. There will be certain times of the day, week, month, or year that your ads see spikes and dips in conversions. If you\u2019re not experiencing any of the aforementioned <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/24\/google-ads-conversion-tracking\">conversion tracking hangups<\/a>, your conversion rates may return to normal if given more time. If this is the case, take note of these patterns and be sure to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/17\/google-ads-bid-management\">adjust your bids<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/13\/how-to-set-up-ad-scheduling\">ad schedule<\/a> accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>(Note also that at the time of writing this post, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/11\/10\/search-advertising-benchmarks\">conversion rates across industries are in a dip right now<\/a>, due to the economy. We\u2019ve seen an average overall decrease of 19% in conversion rate.)<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/google-ads-not-converting-average-conversion-rate-dip.png\" alt=\"why aren't my google ads converting? average conversion rate year over year\" width=\"626\" height=\"696\" class=\" wp-image-70352 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/google-ads-not-converting-average-conversion-rate-dip.png 626w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/google-ads-not-converting-average-conversion-rate-dip-480x533.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 626px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>6. Your budget is too low<\/h3>\n<p>Even though the Google Ads auction is all about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/14\/improve-google-ads-click-through-rate\">getting clicks at the lowest possible costs<\/a>, it\u2019s still a highly competitive channel and you need to bid high enough to keep up. If your bids are too low, Google may be struggling to find auctions for you to win.<\/p>\n<p>If your bids are high enough but your budget is too low, Google will stop showing your ad when budget runs out, or will lower your bids so that your budget can last you longer. Campaigns with this scenario will appear as &#8220;limited by budget&#8221; in the status column.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/lower-google-ads-cost-per-lead-limited-by-budget.png\" alt=\"how to lower cpl in google ads - limited by budget campaign status\" width=\"720\" height=\"423\" class=\"size-full wp-image-66280 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/lower-google-ads-cost-per-lead-limited-by-budget.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/lower-google-ads-cost-per-lead-limited-by-budget-480x282.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Use top-of-page bid to get a feel for what you need to bid to appear, and to appear high enough to get clicks and conversions.<span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>7. Your landing pages are not optimized<\/h3>\n<p>Conversion rate optimization encompasses all kinds of strategies, but at the foundation is an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/great-landing-pages\">optimized landing page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This means it is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Responsive and fast-loading<\/li>\n<li>Unique to the offer and the audience you are targeting<\/li>\n<li>Closely associated with the ad that preceded it<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And that it has:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/01\/headline-examples\">powerful headline<\/a><\/li>\n<li>A prominent CTA<\/li>\n<li>Concise, benefit-focused copy<\/li>\n<li>Clean design with high-quality images<\/li>\n<li>Accessible, easy-to-use form<\/li>\n<li>Trust signals like testimonials, reviews, and partner badges<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It\u2019s not until you have these essentials in place that you can expect to get a solid baseline of conversions.

Your ad copy needs work<\/h3>\n<p>There are a few directions this can go in. Maybe your click-through rate is high, but you\u2019re capturing too-broad an audience which is lowering your conversion rates. If this is the case, try <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/25\/lead-qualification\">prequalifying<\/a> your clickers with more specific ad copy that includes pricing, specific personas, or other criteria.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not getting enough clicks, your ad copy may be a snoozefest. Make sure it contains the keywords you\u2019re targeting as well as your value prop or differentiators, and uses the language specific to that region.<\/p>\n<p>For help with your ad copy model after\u00a0these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/24\/google-ads-examples\">eye-catching Google Ads examples!<\/a><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/improve-google-ads-ctr-emotional-ad-example.png\" alt=\"how to improve google ads ctr - example of an emotional ad\" width=\"720\" height=\"463\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64445 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/improve-google-ads-ctr-emotional-ad-example.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/improve-google-ads-ctr-emotional-ad-example-480x309.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/03\/how-to-write-exceptional-ppc-ad-copy\"><\/a><\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p>\u2734\ufe0f Speaking of great ad copy&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Get the free guide!<\/strong> &gt;&gt; <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLWebBlogInContentTextLinkTrickstoClicks.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_TrickstoClicks_Download\" class=\"waffle-rich-text-link\">10 Tricks to Get the Click: How to Write Exceptional PPC Ad Copy (With Examples!)<\/a><\/strong><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h3>9. Keyword intent is misaligned<\/h3>\n<p>Even if your ads and landing pages are relevant to the keywords you are targeting, you could be making mistakes in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/11\/21\/ppc-keyword-research-guide\">actual keywords you\u2019ve chosen for your ads<\/a>. Here are some things to check:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Target commercial intent:<\/strong> Make sure you\u2019re bidding on<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/30\/commercial-intent-keywords\"> keywords with commercial and transactional intent<\/a>. These keywords will include words like \u201cbuy,\u201d \u201ccheap,\u201d \u201ccompare,\u201d and more.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Be specific:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/07\/long-tail-keyword-myth\">Long-tail keywords<\/a> are more specific and can be cheaper and more relevant to your audience.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Refine your match types:<\/strong> Google is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/06\/broad-match-smart-bidding\">all about broad match lately<\/a>, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should hop on board.

Not enough brand awareness<\/h3>\n<p>Last but not least, your Google Ads may not be converting because you simply haven&#8217;t generated enough brand awareness. Even though intent to buy is highest on search engines, a user is not likely to click on your ad if they&#8217;ve never heard of your business before. And they definitely won&#8217;t click on your ad if it appears alongside the ad of a brand they have heard of before.<\/p>\n<p>This is why it&#8217;s important to have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/10\/15\/multi-channel-marketing\">multi-channel marketing strategy<\/a> so that you can be exposing your audience to your brand across the web.
