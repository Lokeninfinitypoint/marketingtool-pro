By implementing these strategies, ecommerce brands can find the holy grail, which remains the right consumer on the right device at the right moment.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s get started.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Implement Google Shopping ads<\/h2>\n<p>One popular strategy is using the ad platform <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/01\/shopping-ads-benchmarks\">Google Shopping<\/a>, which shows users products related to their Google searches\u2014and when that user clicks on an item, they are ushered directly to the seller\u2019s site.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"883ca5a1-884f-4c41-8c2a-e07e16ed456c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-shopping-reviews-search.jpg\" alt=\"Google shopping reviews SERP\" width=\"824\" height=\"438\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Per Gil Gildner, co-founder of search marketing company Discosloth, narrowly targeted Shopping ads in particular are \u201cone of the easiest and most cost-effective [ways] of getting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/11\/increase-online-store-sales\">more product sales<\/a> for an ecommerce company.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s because they effectively pre-vet potential customers by showing the product image and the price, so advertisers only get highly targeted clicks.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is extremely easy to implement on platforms like Shopify or WooCommerce,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>And they work. Nikki Bisel, founder of digital marketing consultancy and agency Seafoam Media, said Google Shopping campaigns have resulted in as much as a 200% increase in conversion rate and click-through rate (CTR) by targeting consumers who have already interacted with a given brand by putting products in their carts or browsing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/18\/google-shopping-feed\">product categories<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn narrowing our audience, we see a drop in overall clicks, but a huge uptick in CTR and conversions\u2014a win-win-win situation in terms of budget and ROI,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<h3>Specifically, try out Google showcase shopping ads<\/h3>\n<p>Ruba Aramouny, owner and strategic director of Solid Marketing, suggested using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/17\/showcase-shopping-ads\">Google\u2019s showcase shopping ads<\/a> to help attract top-of-funnel traffic at a lower cost. This feature allows advertisers to group related products together to help introduce a brand to users searching with more generic product terms.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"09b797ec-da46-41d8-ab41-3a929869fe3f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-marketing-strategies-google-showcase-shopping-ad.jpg\" alt=\"Google showcase shopping ad &quot;penny loafer&quot; example\" width=\"413\" height=\"575\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>\u201cWhat makes Showcase ads so interesting is that you can bid lower than you typically would on a traditional Shopping ad, while showing prospects a wide variety of products and images,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if a prospect doesn&#8217;t immediately make a purchase on your store, you&#8217;ve familiarized them with your brand and can build a warm audience to remarket to at a lower cost.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>2. Add structured markup language<\/h2>\n<p>For his part, Kent Lewis, president and founder of digital marketing agency Anvil Media, said brands should add structured markup language, which is also known as schema, to the backend of their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/06\/01\/product-pages\">product pages<\/a> to help search engines index them properly. And, because this makes it easier for the search engine to know the information on a given page, there\u2019s potential for a rankings boost, too.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBy adding rich snippets, you help Google put your products in front of the right people for the right search terms,\u201d said Beth Kearsley operations assistant at search marketing agency Tao Digital.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Optimize for voice search<\/h2>\n<p>Olga Mykhoparkina, CMO of team chat platform Chanty, predicts <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/15\/voice-search-seo\">voice search<\/a> will be the biggest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/31\/2020-ecommerce-marketing-trends\">trend for ecommerce marketing strategies <\/a>in 2020.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs more buyers are using voice to search for products, brands that optimize their content for these search terms will have the upper hand in grabbing organic traffic from search engines,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest challenge is there still aren\u2019t many <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/18\/ecommerce-tools-for-local-business\">tools<\/a> to analyze popular voice search terms, but she nevertheless believes 2020 will be the year content and SEO begin to accommodate voice.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor ecommerce and local-based companies, this will be the ideal opportunity to capitalize on long-tail keywords without unnaturally stuffing them into their content,\u201d she added.<\/p>\n<p>For brands that are more cautious about voice technology, John Frigo, digital marketing lead at MySupplementStore.com, said another communication option shoppers actually use is SMS and push notifications, which have huge open rates. And because not a lot of marketers are using it yet, brands can stand out.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"081041ba-bcd0-423a-8737-b70c94653100\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-marketing-strategies-push-notification-example.jpg\" alt=\"push notification example\" width=\"280\" height=\"551\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wigzo.com\/blog\/5-examples-of-ecommerce-push-notifications-that-will-surely-fetch-you-more-sales\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhereas everyone is coming at people in email, Google search and social, people aren\u2019t being inundated with marketing messages via text or push,\u201d he said. \u201cSMS is great in that you get right in front of someone and also most people don\u2019t know how to turn it off.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>4. Focus on site speed<\/h2>\n<p>Ecommerce brands will also want to make sure <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/08\/how-to-build-an-ecommerce-website\">their websites<\/a> are \u201cbang on,\u201d Kearsley said\u2014including site speed, header tags, and interactive media.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGetting these right will greatly increase your site&#8217;s visibility and click-through rates,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Clark Covington, marketing manager at Jelly Bean Rubber Mulch, agreed good things happen when website load speed increases, including improvement in the performance of the brand\u2019s online ecommerce page.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSpecifically, we found that when website load speed increases Google will rank pages higher in search results for relative keywords by increasing our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/24\/page-speed\">page speed<\/a> score in our paid Google Ads account,\u201d he said. \u201cMost striking of all, we found a Google study showing a 90% increase in bounce rate when load speed goes from 1 to 5 seconds.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Lewis recommends optimizing images specifically for commerce, as Google Images is the second-largest search engine by volume.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOptimizing your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/26\/product-photography\">product images<\/a> with alt text is essential to ensuring they rank in product-related images searches,\u201d he said. \u201cThe images link to the product pages where interested parties can purchase [them] easily.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"de40d27f-099d-4c13-bcf4-30fd5c8ddd50\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-marketing-strategies-product-images.jpg\" alt=\"&quot;camera&quot; Google image search w\/shopping ads\" width=\"530\" height=\"458\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>5. Make lots of (relevant) videos<\/h2>\n<p>According to Jeff Neal who works with the online marketplace The Critter Depot, the ecommerce brands that will win in 2020 will create <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/20\/youtube-marketing\">YouTube channels<\/a> with videos that answer relevant questions to a given customer base.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe sell live feeder insects to reptile owners through the mail,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cSo we created a handful of videos that we posted on our product pages that discuss how to breed crickets, how to store your crickets and superworms and what it&#8217;s like to unbox them.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"videos\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_video\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"09b7729e-680e-48c1-a2a2-b988f6ad865a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/oUvO8dNOdyE?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The result?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThese videos have done a nice job increasing our on-page time by over a minute per page,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we&#8217;re pushing forward and creating more videos for our top-converting pages.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Matthew Ross, COO of mattress review website The Slumber Yard, agreed YouTube can help drive traffic and revenue because in part Google tends to organically rank relevant videos higher on the first results page, making this a more cost-efficient strategy than PPC\u2014to the tune of 2 million views for The Slumber Yard last year.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAll in all, this strategy has easily saved us hundreds of thousands of dollars that we otherwise would have spent on digital ads,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Tap into UGC and influencer marketing<\/h2>\n<p>Like email signups, Prafull Sharma, CEO of content marketing agency LeadsPanda, recommends brands encourage their fans to produce their own content in exchange for an incentive. This will increase engagement and conversions, as well as build trust within the brand\u2019s digital community. Camera brand GoPro is a good example. Its YouTube channel\u00a0has nearly 8 million subscribers and a library of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/05\/marketing-videos\">high-quality videos<\/a> from customers.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"videos\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_video\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c5a4c348-eeb6-47d1-bc15-af8f07e857eb\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/azgvOyBB7fA?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>\u201cCustomers are featured on their channel and GoPro gains content\u2014an exchange that builds a relationship between the audience and the brand,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s because user-generated content evokes more trust than content from brands.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c[User-generated] content, like reviews and testimonials in the form of photos or videos and published both on the brand&#8217;s social media platforms and ecommerce site, seems more believable for customers, knowing that the brand is not only selling with their own produced content,\u201d Sharma said.<\/p>\n<p>UGC from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/21\/social-media-influencers\">micro-influencers<\/a> can also help maintain the authenticity and authority some big-time influencers have lost.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, citing figures from the Digital Marketing Institute, Sarah Donawerth, content manager at influencer marketing platform Carro, said 49% of consumers rely on influencer recommendations when making a purchase decision, so influencer marketing is an easy way to make trustworthy content potential customers will enjoy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNormally when we think of influencers, we think of a Kardashian-level celebrity with millions of followers,\u201d said Meaghan Brophy, senior retail analyst at small business resource Fit Small Business. \u201cHowever, accounts with smaller, yet more engaged, followers provide businesses with higher conversions for a smaller price.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2c078444-34fc-4d19-85df-a9a514e18a69\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/social-media-marketing-strategy-work-with-social-media-influencers.jpg\" alt=\"social media influencer post on Instagram\" width=\"809\" height=\"596\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BrPVgHsgfjt\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Brands looking for micro-influencers can search hashtags and interests related to their products and then monitoring the type of content posted and the engagement it receives.<\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u201cThe challenge for ecommerce businesses in terms of integrating UGC into their marketing strategy is how to achieve this organically without crossing the line into sponsorship and identifying and incentivizing sufficient users to make a worthwhile effort,\u201d said Polly Kay, senior marketing manager at window treatment company English Blinds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>After inviting potential partners to collaborate, Donawerth said brands should ship their products so content creators can try them out and then honestly recommend the right ones to their respective audiences.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Try filters and QR codes<\/h2>\n<p>Sneh Ratna Choudhary, content marketer at proximity marketing company Beaconstac, said filters on social platforms like Snapchat and Instagram can yield unique shopping experiences for ecommerce brands. That includes denim brand Levi\u2019s, which allowed Snapchat users to scan QR codes in-store to virtually try on a jacket they could then by online, and Kylie Jenner\u2019s makeup brand Kylie Cosmetics, which used Instagram filters to let users see what her new lipsticks looked like.<\/p>\n<p>On a related note, QR codes in print ads allow consumers to easily visit advertisers\u2019 websites.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThese QR Codes are usually dynamic which allows users to unlock new offers at different times of the day,\u201d Choudhary said. \u201cAmazon sent a toy catalog to millions of its customers last November that contained QR codes that allowed parents to shop for toys for their kids seamlessly. This served them well given the vacuum\u00a0that was created once Toys R Us was shut down.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>8. Make shopping social<\/h2>\n<p>Aalap Shah, founder of Amazon\/ecommerce-focused agency 1o8, said to consider social commerce platform CommentSold.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI&#8217;m finding for my apparel\u00a0and beauty clients in particular that this tool creates an effective\u00a0new\u00a0sales channel to drive directly into Shopify or owned e-comm sites and stores,\u201d he said. \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/25\/social-shopping\">Social selling<\/a> in itself is not new, but the tools to create momentum and ease [through automated invoicing, sales analytics, customer data and inventory and order management] are getting better and better.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a9eb0eae-fb3b-4d77-9df6-632118f95abb\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/social-shopping-instagram-news-feed-2.jpg\" alt=\"social-shopping-instagram-shoppable-news-feed-post\" width=\"454\" height=\"898\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>9. Send personalized emails<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s an oldie, but a goodie: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/23\/email-marketing-ecommerce\">Email marketing<\/a>. Especially personalized ones to help<a href=\"https:\/\/ebizcharge.com\/2020\/12\/01\/how-to-keep-customers-shopping-again-and-again-9-simple-but-effective-tips\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> keep customers coming back<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Brands that are looking to incentivize signups should consider lures like coupons and free trials.<\/p>\n<p>Bernard Wong, digital marketer for ecommerce site Vape Club, said this strategy has helped the online e-liquid store amass a list of over 45,000 emails so far in the U.K. In addition, he said customers of ecommerce platform Shopify can easily implement the tactic by installing apps from the Shopify App Store like Woohoo.<\/p>\n<p>For his part, Tom Buchok, founder of email monitoring firm Mailcharts, cautioned brands to pay attention to tone, subject line and clickbait-y words that might trigger spam filters in the emails they send customers and leads.<\/p>\n<p>And, according to Tanya Yablonskaya, an ecommerce industry analyst at software development firm ScienceSoft, personalization, or researching a customer\u2019s purchasing habits and then customizing their interaction as a result, is another important email tactic for ecommerce brands.<\/p>\n<p>There are two ways to do this: with recommended products and targeted promotions during a customer\u2019s <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/22\/how-to-personalize-ecommerce-customer-journey\">digital journey<\/a>; and with personalized follow-up emails.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, excellence in the art of personalization comes with practice: the more you experiment and track the success of your tries, the more understanding of your customers you gain and can talk to them more effectively thereafter,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Brophy suggested using personalization in emails to retarget customers with abandoned carts.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"45ea2d77-6e57-4769-8b49-14ba6420cdb8\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-marketing-strategies-personalized-email-example.jpg\" alt=\"personalized email subject line &quot;Did you forget something?&quot;\" width=\"506\" height=\"114\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>\u201c[These] emails alone \u2026 remind shoppers of left-behind items can have a big impact on sales,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, the most effective emails are personalized to include the shopper\u2019s name and a special offer or call-out to a previous purchase or browsing history.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>10. Write newsletters and blog posts<\/h2>\n<p>And, of course, you\u2019ll want content. Lots of content.<\/p>\n<p>Calloway Cook, president of dietary supplement company Illuminate Labs, suggests <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/01\/20\/guest-blogging\">guest blogging<\/a> as an effective\u2014and cost-effective\u2014strategy for 2020.<\/p>\n<p>He recommends using a tool like the browser extension MozBar to find the domain authority of sites and to only reach out to those with a domain authority greater than 40.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt&#8217;s a proven way to get high-quality backlinks pointed to your homepage and increase your site&#8217;s domain authority [and thereby increase your site&#8217;s organic rankings],\u201d Cook said.<\/p>\n<p>Gildner agreed long-form blog posts with informational guides can boost organic SEO by as much as 2 to 3x over the course of a year.<\/p>\n<p>For her part, Andrea Loubier, CEO of desktop email client Mailbird, said well-written content gives potential and existing customers alike a reason to visit your ecommerce site. This provides useful information, such as positioning the brand as an expert on a given subject, which, in turn, gives potential customers more of a reason to shop with said brand.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAll content marketing strategies are different, especially dependent on the niche,\u201d Loubier said. \u201cBut all of the best are comprised of several different methods, incorporating <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/08\/non-newsletter-emails\">newsletters<\/a>, emails, social media, and link building. Consider your content as a free offer to potential or existing clients, which can be used as a tool to create new purchases and other additional sources of revenue.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>11. Issue coupons<\/h2>\n<p>Not surprisingly, Sara McQueen, digital PR executive at content marketing agency Fractl, said client Shopper.com, which applies discount codes for users when they check out, found coupons are the way to go. That\u2019s in part because nearly one in three shoppers actively look for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/21\/ecommerce-discounts\">discount codes<\/a> nearly every time they make a purchase online\u2014and that\u2019s expected to go up in the coming year.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7fae4ec0-369f-4c7f-8816-cb987b49e665\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-marketing-strategies-coupons-discounts.jpg\" alt=\"Bed Bath &amp; Beyond discount coupon\" width=\"640\" height=\"417\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>But, McQueen said, in interviews with 1000 customers in the U.S. and U.K., Shopper.com learned consumers feel 3x savvier when they find coupons in online searches than if they are simply handed to them.
