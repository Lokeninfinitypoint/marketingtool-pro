Maximum delivery<\/h3>\n<p>Maximum delivery is a fully automated bid strategy where LinkedIn sets your bid for you using machine learning to try and deliver as many results for your campaign as possible while trying to spend your entire budget every day.<\/p>\n<p>This is the default <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/linkedin-ads-bidding\">bidding strategy<\/a> for every new campaign you\u2019ll set up in the LinkedIn ads platform.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-bidding-strategies.webp\" alt=\"linkedin ads bidding - maximum delivery\" width=\"875\" height=\"217\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85477 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-bidding-strategies.webp 875w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-bidding-strategies-480x119.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 875px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf31 <strong>Make a plan to grow your business on LinkedIn<\/strong> with our free, easy-to-use <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite7StepstoGrowthStrategy.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_GrowthStrategy_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">growth strategy template<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Cost cap<\/h3>\n<p>Cost cap is a step below maximum delivery in that it\u2019s still an automated bidding strategy (where LinkedIn sets the actual bid for each auction) but in this case, the advertiser has some control by adding in a cost cap or a target cost for the bidding algorithm to pay for each result. For example, if you want to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/generating-leads-on-linkedin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">generate leads on LinkedIn<\/a> with an ideal <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/linkedin-ads-cost\">cost per lead<\/a> of $75, then you may set a $75 cost cap as your bidding strategy.<\/p>\n<p>This strategy does not guarantee you\u2019ll hit your cost cap for every conversion, or even the total number of conversions, but it does work to try and hit the parameters you\u2019ve set on average. That means if you generate two leads for your campaign, one lead might cost $25 and the second might cost $125. While that second lead is technically above your $75 cost cap, the average of the two leads is $75.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-bidding-cost-cap.webp\" alt=\"linkedin ads bidding - cost cap\" width=\"849\" height=\"315\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85478 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-bidding-cost-cap.webp 849w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-bidding-cost-cap-480x178.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 849px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>3. Manual bidding<\/h3>\n<p>With manual bidding, the advertiser has all the control. There\u2019s no machine learning to take over or adjust bids for you. Each time your ad is eligible for the auction, you\u2019ll bid your maximum bid and pay just above the price of the next advertiser if your ad wins a place.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll notice in the screenshots for the other two bidding strategies that manual bidding isn&#8217;t shown. It\u2019s hidden under the \u201cshow additional options\u201d dropdown. You can take that to mean LinkedIn prefers when you use one of the other two bidding strategies, likely because they get to apply their machine learning to the campaign.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-bidding-manual.webp\" alt=\"linkedin ads bidding - manual\" width=\"817\" height=\"314\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85479 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-bidding-manual.webp 817w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-bidding-manual-480x184.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 817px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"linkedin-ads-bidding-by-campaign-type\"><\/div>\n<h2>Available bidding strategies for each campaign objective and optimization goal<\/h2>\n<p>For the next few points, we\u2019re going to refer to this table below, so you might need to come back to it for reference from time to time.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-bidding-strategy-chart.webp\" alt=\"linkedin ads bidding strategy - chart\" width=\"825\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85480 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-bidding-strategy-chart.webp 825w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-bidding-strategy-chart-480x349.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 825px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>While there are only three bidding strategies, they\u2019re not all available for every campaign objective or optimization goal.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you\u2019re planning to use a brand awareness objective and a reach optimization goal, you will only be able to use the maximum delivery bid strategy. Cost cap and manual bidding are not an option for those.<\/p>\n<p>If you were to shift your optimization goal to impressions, however, you could use any of the three bidding strategies available.<\/p>\n<p>As of the writing of this post, the table above is accurate in determining which strategies can be used for which goals. This is true even though some LinkedIn documentation looks different. Specifically, for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/07\/linkedin-lead-generation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn ads lead generation<\/a> objective, <a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/marketing-solutions\/success\/best-practices\/ad-bidding-tips\">official LinkedIn documents<\/a> say cost cap isn\u2019t available. Still, if you visit just the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/help\/lms\/answer\/a706289\">cost cap page<\/a>, or test it out in your own account, you\u2019ll see it is available.<\/p>\n<p>Before you decide which campaign objective and optimization goal you want to use, make sure you can also leverage the right bidding strategy you intend to use.<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-linkedin-ads-get-charged\"><\/div>\n<h2>How you&#8217;ll get charged for each LinkedIn ads bidding strategy<\/h2>\n<p>In the last column on the right in the chart above, you\u2019ll see how each bidding strategy is charged based on the campaign objective and optimization goal. If you have strong opinions about being charged by either clicks, impressions, or a different benchmark, then make sure the bidding strategy you choose will reflect that preference.<\/p>\n<p>Personally, I don\u2019t have strong issues with any specific charge method as long as my campaigns are performing well.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-bidding-strategies-linkedin-chart.jpg\" alt=\"linkedin ads bidding - chart of all linkedin bidding strategies\" width=\"842\" height=\"515\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85482 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-bidding-strategies-linkedin-chart.jpg 842w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-bidding-strategies-linkedin-chart-480x294.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 842px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/help\/linkedin\/answer\/a421112#:~:text=Bid%20suggestions,-If%20you%20select&amp;text=The%20suggested%20range%20represents%20an,are%20targeting%20the%20same%20audience.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"linkedin-ads-bid-cap-strategies\"><\/div>\n<h2>Suggested bid ranges for cost cap and manual bidding<\/h2>\n<p>Something to note about the images for the cost cap and manual bidding strategies in my overview above is that these are both from a real client account I have. You\u2019ll notice that my bids are significantly lower than the bid ranges LinkedIn suggests. There\u2019s a good reason for that<\/p>\n<p>The suggestions for LinkedIn bid ranges are based on how competitive your audience is and, as you can see in the bottom line of the manual bidding image, \u201cusing the recommended bid helps you effectively spend your campaign budget.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll notice it doesn&#8217;t say anything about performance. It\u2019s only based on spending the budget. But if I\u2019m using manual bidding or cost cap, I\u2019m not here to necessarily spend my entire daily budget. I\u2019m here for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/25\/optimize-linkedin-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">good LinkedIn ads campaign performance<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>When you start your bids below the suggested range, you\u2019ll still show some impressions and you\u2019ll likely get some clicks, but the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/17\/lower-cost-per-click\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CPCs<\/a> and CPMs will be much lower. You\u2019ll bid for only the less competitive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/12\/linkedin-retargeting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">users in your LinkedIn ads audience<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Once you start seeing results, you can increase your bid to find more volume for either manual bidding or cost cap, but I always start low and work my way up depending on the results I\u2019m seeing first. Not simply based on the range LinkedIn suggests.<\/p>\n<p>That said, this range can be really useful in understanding how far you\u2019ll likely have to increase your bid to see maximum delivery of your budget. Hopefully, for your sake, you could take this example $7.50 bid in your accounts all the way up to the $53 CPC bid and still see results. For now, my account is still making progress toward that goal.<\/p>\n<div id=\"linkedin-ads-bidding-strategies\"><\/div>\n<h2>When to use which LinkedIn ads bidding strategy<\/h2>\n<p>Depending on your campaign goals, there may be one bidding strategy that works best for you or you might find that a combination of strategies across different campaigns works best.<\/p>\n<p>For example, in most of my accounts, I have a handful of manual and cost cap campaigns with maybe a maximum delivery campaign or two mixed in. There\u2019s no right or wrong answer, but there are some better use cases than others.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Scenarios for maximum delivery<\/h3>\n<p>Use maximum delivery bidding when&#8230;<\/p>\n<h4>You want brand awareness and consistent spend<\/h4>\n<p>If brand awareness and consistent spending are your main objectives with your LinkedIn campaigns (more so than a specific conversion goal with a strict profitability objective) you\u2019re likely best suited for maximum delivery. As mentioned above, the maximum delivery strategy works to spend your entire daily or lifetime budget and get you as many results as possible.<\/p>\n<p>In my experience, this means you\u2019ll see consistent spending at your max, but depending on performance goals, you may or may not see good results for directly trackable profitability.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 <strong>Want more ways to build brand awareness beyond LinkedIn?<\/strong> Download our free <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLTheDefinitiveGuideBrandAwareness.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_BrandAwareness_Guide_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">guide to brand awareness <\/a>complete with branding strategies, tips, and examples.<\/p>\n<h4>Your existing LinkedIn ads campaigns are performing strong and you need to scale<\/h4>\n<p>While it might be the exception more than the rule in my experience, there are times when you see such good results from manual or cost cap bidding that you can shift to maximum delivery and see only minor hiccups in performance.<\/p>\n<p>In this instance, you might feel confident enough to remove your bid or cost cap limitation and let LinkedIn spend as much as possible to reach your audience. That means your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/05\/best-call-to-action-phrases\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">call to action<\/a> is so strong that you can overcome the higher CPCs or CPMs.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/best-advertising-platforms-linkedin.webp\" alt=\"linkedin ads advertising platform example\" width=\"428\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81032 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/best-advertising-platforms-linkedin.webp 428w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/best-advertising-platforms-linkedin-215x300.webp 215w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 428px) 100vw, 428px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/best-advertising-platforms\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">An example<\/a> of a LinkedIn ad with a compelling call to action. <\/em><\/p>\n<h3>2. Scenarios for cost cap<\/h3>\n<p>Use cost cap bidding when&#8230;<\/p>\n<h4>You already have a ton of conversion history and you need to control costs<\/h4>\n<p>For this bidding strategy to work well, you need to have seen some good conversion performance data from the past that you can lean into. As discussed above, this strategy uses machine learning to find conversions at a cost that averages out to your goal. Without that solid footing of previous conversions, the platform can&#8217;t be sure what bids might work best.<\/p>\n<p>As much as I like LinkedIn ads, they don\u2019t quite have the same sophistication in their bidding algorithms as Google or Facebook, so starting from scratch, or even very little conversion performance, could be a big issue with cost cap.<\/p>\n<p>Informally, I had a rep tell me on a call that the number they use internally is 100 conversions. Meaning if you have fewer than 100 conversions in the last 30 days on any given call to action, the cost cap strategy isn\u2019t going to perform optimally.<\/p>\n<p>Just like other \u201cbest practices\u201d out there, that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t work with fewer than 100 conversions in 30 days, but it\u2019s still worth mentioning such a high bar is the \u201coptimal\u201d level.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-conversion-report.jpg\" alt=\"linkedin ads conversion reporting\" width=\"821\" height=\"253\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85483 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-conversion-report.jpg 821w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-conversion-report-480x148.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 821px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/b2linked.com\/blog\/linkedin-ads-conversions-understanding-this-metric-for-deeper-reporting-and-insights\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">An example <\/a>of how you can view your current LinkedIn ads campaigns&#8217; conversion performance. <\/em><\/p>\n<h3>3. Scenarios for manual bidding<\/h3>\n<p>Use manual bidding when&#8230;<\/p>\n<h4>You&#8217;re first starting out<\/h4>\n<p>I\u2019ll be honest, in my mind, just about every campaign is right for manual bidding, at least at some point in its journey. Here\u2019s my typical four-step process for a LinkedIn ads campaign:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Start on manual bidding with low bids.<\/li>\n<li>Monitor initial performance and make adjustments to audiences and ads if we\u2019re not seeing results we want.<\/li>\n<li>As performance flows in, increase the bid to gain more traction within your audience and control costs.<\/li>\n<li>Find the \u201csweet spot\u201d bid that gets you the volume of spend and conversions you want for a reasonable CPA.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Depending on how a campaign is performing on manual bidding, I\u2019ll sometimes test using maximum delivery or cost cap to either gain scale or control costs at a higher level without a need to regularly review and adjust the bids. If those perform well, I\u2019ll keep them. If they don\u2019t, I\u2019ll typically switch back to manual bidding, and continue a regular review to adjust settings as needed.<\/p>\n<h2>Find the right mix of LinkedIn ads bidding strategies for your business<\/h2>\n<p>LinkedIn might have a limited number of bidding strategies compared to other platforms, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not all worthy options depending on your goals. You may find it\u2019s best to manage bids manually, or you might see good enough results with maximum delivery that you can let the system optimize to its heart\u2019s content.<\/p>\n<p>Either way, it\u2019s worth knowing how each strategy works and what some of the pitfalls are to make sure you\u2019re setting yourself up for success and seeing the results you need. Don\u2019t be afraid to switch bidding strategies from time to time to see if one might get a better result than another (and run regular <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/linkedin-ads-audit\">LinkedIn Ads audits<\/a> to check).
