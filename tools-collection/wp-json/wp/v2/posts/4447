Although our lives are vastly different than our neanderthal ancestors, we aren\u2019t as far removed as we think. We are still programmed to make choices based on the actions of others. There is safety in numbers with the herd mentality, so when we see a lot of people recommending an item and saying they HAVE to have it, we tend to feel likewise.<\/p>\n<p>As someone who frequents Slickdeals, a website that aggregates the daily online deals, I\u2019ve witnessed myself and many others fall victim to the herd mentality. Many silly purchasing decisions have been made all because of a forum swarming with users saying, \u201cin for 3, what a great deal!\u201d or \u201cunbelievable price on these, they\u2019ll sell out quickly.\u201d This results in unnecessary, even down-right useless purchases \u2013 an outcome that many on the site dub <em>the SD affect<\/em>. The truth is that we\u2019re programmed to act quite sheepish.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/buy-amazon-reviews-fiverr-1.jpg\" alt=\"reviews on Amazon\" width=\"620\" height=\"322\" \/><\/div>\n<p><em>Bah ram you, sheep aren&#8217;t so true (photo courtesy\u00a0<\/em><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/wheatfields\/\">net_efekt<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>When it Comes to Getting Amazon Reviews, the More the Merrier<\/h2>\n<p>Social proof is some powerful stuff, and the more proof you have, the more potent it becomes. An item rated as 4.5 stars reviewed by 10 people won\u2019t sell as well as an item rated as 4 stars reviewed by 300 people.

Here\u2019s how.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-make-a-review-on-amazon-1.png\" alt=\"how to get top amazon reviews\" width=\"429\" height=\"105\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>1. <\/strong><strong>Provide a great consumer experience.<\/strong> The majority of negative reviews involve consumers feeling misled about a product. Be honest about what you\u2019re selling and <em>provide as much accurate, precise information about your product as possible<\/em> to avoid any confusion or false expectations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2.\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Send follow-up emails after an Amazon purchase asking for feedback.<\/strong> Amazon asks for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/24\/customer-feedback\">customer feedback<\/a> following a purchase, but it\u2019s a generic email with nothing special. Instead, send personalized review requests; ideally, you want to send them shortly after they\u2019ve received your product so its awesomeness is still fresh in their minds. You can even use a site like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ecomengine.com\/feedbackfive\">FeedbackFive<\/a>\u00a0or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.feedbackexpress.com\/\">Feedback Express<\/a> to automatically send customized feedback request emails. Make it <em>really <\/em>easy for users to leave a review by including a link.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. <\/strong><strong>Request Amazon reviews via newsletter and social media.<\/strong> Chances are, the folks subscribed to your newsletter and your fans on Facebook already like you, so why not <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">ask them for reviews<\/a>? There\u2019s a decent chance they\u2019ve already bought a product from you, so they can provide legitimate, positive Amazon customer reviews. In our article about getting <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/07\/22\/yelp-reviews\">reviews on Yelp<\/a>, we noted that Yelp discouraged directly soliciting reviews. Amazon, on the other hand, is much more lax.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. <\/strong><strong>Reach out to users who reviewed similar products.<\/strong> You can find users who have reviewed products similar to yours (even your competitor\u2019s products) by visiting your product page, going to \u201cCustomers Who Bought This Item Also Bought\u201d and \u201cCustomers Who Viewed This Item Also Viewed.\u201d These are your competitors, and you could do well simply taking note of them and reading their reviews (paying attention to what they do well and what they fail at), and even checking out their website.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/amazon-reviews-1.png\" alt=\"Amazon reviews\" width=\"816\" height=\"265\" \/><\/div>\n<p>For the sake of our Amazon review-centered discussion, simply click for the \u201ccustomer reviews\u201d link and sort by newest reviews. Click the reviewer\u2019s name for their details. \u00a0If they provide contact info connected with their profile, you\u2019re in luck! Send an e-mail.\u00a0 If only a name shows up, try contacting them on another social network like Twitter or Facebook.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Solicit the top Amazon reviewers.<\/strong> Amazon holds a list of their top reviewers \u2013 a compilation of esteemed reviewers who are valued for their insightful and objective critiques. Many of these top Amazon reviewers also hold titles such as \u201cTop Ten Reviewer,\u201d or \u201cHall of Fame Reviewer,\u201d which are displayed alongside their reviews, making their reviews ultra-valuable.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-get-reviews-amazon-1.png\" alt=\"How to get Amazon reviews\" width=\"518\" height=\"50\" \/><\/div>\n<p>We\u2019ll discuss how to find these coveted super-star Amazon reviewers in our next section below.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Get Reviews from Top Amazon Reviewers<\/h2>\n<p>Snagging an assessment from one of these prize reviewers can mean big things for your Amazon seller account. These guys are the big mouth Billy basses of the Amazon world, and we\u2019re going to show you how to reel them in.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-get-product-reviews-on-Amazon-1.png\" alt=\"how to get reviews on Amazon\" width=\"655\" height=\"583\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Some of these Amazon reviewers make a living doing this \u2013 it\u2019s serious business, and some may do as many as 100 reviews a month. Be prepared to offer your product for free in exchange for a review \u2013 depending on your product, this could be a pricey expenditure, so you\u2019ll have to decide if this is a strategy you can afford.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. <\/strong><strong>Find the top reviewers.<\/strong> First we\u2019ll scour the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/review\/top-reviewers\">Amazon list of Top Reviewers.<\/a> You\u2019ll see the page is divided into Top Reviewer Rankings and Hall of Fame Reviewers. Hall of Fame holds the long-time legacy reviewers, while the Top Review Rankings shows the best Amazon contributors at the current moment. Hall of Fame shows the reviewers\u2019 title badges and accolades, although you can get this same info mousing over names in the Top Reviewers section.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. <\/strong><strong>Search for relevant tags.<\/strong> Mousing over names in either section will bring up the reviewer\u2019s most used tags. Your goal will be to find top reviewers who have used tags related to product or industry in the past, making them a perfect target.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/amazon-customer-reviews-1.png\" alt=\"Amazon customer reviews\" width=\"790\" height=\"264\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>3. <\/strong><strong>Keep track of contacts.<\/strong> Next you\u2019ll want to compile a contact list. Prepare to be excel-ent as you\u2019ll want to keep all this info in a neat and tidy spreadsheet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. <\/strong><strong>Fish around for emails.<\/strong> Many popular reviewers will have their email addresses on their profile page. If you don\u2019t see an email address, you\u2019ll have to try reaching out via social media (Twitter, Facebook, etc.)<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/amazon-top-reviewers-1.png\" alt=\"getting amazon top reviewers\" width=\"616\" height=\"516\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>5. <\/strong><strong>Reach out with a thoughtful e-mail.<\/strong> Time to plead your case, so put on those puppy-dog eyes! Explain to the target that you found their review on Amazon and that you\u2019d like to send them a product you believe they might be interested in. Don\u2019t send out one soulless generic mass email \u2013 personalize the message showing that you\u2019ve read up on the reviewer and seen their past reviews. Maybe comment on one review you found especially illuminating or clever. Personalizing your messages <strong>greatly improves your chances of getting a reply<\/strong>, so be sure to implement some considerate correspondence.<\/p>\n<p>Tell them that you\u2019re hoping for an honest review of the product, although no obligation is required. Many won\u2019t respond to your email, and probably only around half will review the product you send, but that\u2019s the name of the game. Yes, it\u2019s risky. But if your product is awesome and you know it can earn great reviews, a few 5 star ratings from these top Amazon reviewers will be HUGE.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6. <\/strong><strong>Say thank you! <\/strong>One of my all time favorite books, <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People<\/em> (I swear, I\u2019m not a self-help junkie, this is an eccentricity in my library), notes that all people crave <em>sincere appreciation<\/em>. Be sure to follow-up and thank the top Amazon reviewers for their thoughtful review \u2013 with sincerity of course!<\/p>\n<p>Getting Amazon reviews from Amazon\u2019s cream-of-the-crop critics isn\u2019t easy, but it\u2019ll pay off in the end when you\u2019re rolling in gold stars.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/get-reviews-on-Amazon-1.jpg\" alt=\"get reviews from Amazon\" width=\"580\" height=\"508\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Rainbow Brite knows all about star power<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>A Different Approach: Fake Reviews<\/h2>\n<p>Amazon is doing their best to combat fake reviews, but honestly, they aren\u2019t doing a ton.

It\u2019s not a matter of if you\u2019ll ever get a bad review \u2013 it\u2019s just a matter of when.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/amazon-consumer-reviews-1.png\" alt=\"amazon customer reviews\" width=\"829\" height=\"563\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Prepare for the worst. You\u2019ll get bad reviews. Maybe even really terrible ones. Criticisms may be indelicate, undeserved, or even downright cruel, and there\u2019s no internet police who will come around and slap those naughty complainers on the wrists. That means it\u2019s up to you to handle the situation. We suggest that you\u2026<\/p>\n<p><strong>Take a cool down.<\/strong> Negative reviews can sting, which is why your first step upon receiving a negative Amazon customer review should be to simply step back. Take a day or even several to cool down and then assess the situation with a clear mind. Is there any merit to the review? Maybe this is a clue to how you can improve your product. Is it a pure emotional tirade? Other uses can sense a baseless rant, so while your star ratings may be affected, users who take the time to read your 1-star reviews may see the senselessness of a bad review. If the review is blatantly emotional, these cool down days may be as beneficial for you as for the reviewer \u2013 they may be able to realize their earlier review was unreasonable and be open to editing it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Approach with extreme caution.<\/strong> The next step is deciding whether or not to respond to a piece of negative feedback. Here\u2019s where things get tricky, because the situation can change depending on whether you are an Amazon reseller dealing with negative <em>seller<\/em> feedback, or whether the problem is a negative product review.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>For Amazon Resellers:<\/strong> First examine the issues the buyer had \u2013 can the problem be remedied? Consider offering refund or replacement. Buyers can remove feedback for up to 60 days after a review is posted, so there\u2019s usually a chance of redemption.<\/li>\n<li><strong>For Bad Amazon Product Reviews:<\/strong> Responding publically may add further damage, especially if others take the side of the reviewer. Look forward to burying this negative review with new positive ones. Amazon will remove a review in specific cases like those <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/community-help\/customer-reviews-guidelines\">involving privacy violations or obscene language<\/a>, but these situations aren\u2019t common.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Enjoy Those 5-Star Reviews!<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve done our best to provide you with the Amazon aptitude necessary to bring in great Amazon reviews.
