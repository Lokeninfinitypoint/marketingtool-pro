Starbucks releases holiday drinks. Crockpots make their way back onto countertops. Last year\u2019s gloves suddenly appear at the bottom of your coat pockets. And content marketers get out their calendars to start brainstorming and prepping for next year.<\/p>\n<p>So we asked a number of industry experts what content marketing trends they\u2019re most excited about\u2014what they want to try, what they expect to see, and why\u2014so that you can use these tactics in your 2021 planning.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the seven biggest content marketing trends you need to know about going into the new year:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Building content communities<\/li>\n<li>Going live with video and webinars<\/li>\n<li>Improving content experience<\/li>\n<li>Focusing on products and services<\/li>\n<li>Testing AI-powered copy<\/li>\n<li>Doubling down on SEO<\/li>\n<li>Repurposing content across channels<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Let\u2019s get started!<\/p>\n<h2>1. Building content communities<\/h2>\n<p>The biggest content marketing trend to try in 2021 isn\u2019t a surprise. With the rise of Slack communities across tech and the focus on personalization in marketing during the pandemic, building communities has been a push for marketing teams all year. But building communities specifically around content sharing and creation will allow marketing teams to continue to expand their reach, even with fewer resources.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"e2111028-7c8d-48f1-bedc-f1b08c27611d\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-marketing-trends-2.png\" alt=\"Content Marketing Trends\" width=\"977\" height=\"335\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/foundationinc.co\/lab\/slack-communities-better-sales-marketing-results\/\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Lauren Pope, content marketing manager at <a href=\"https:\/\/learn.g2.com\/\">G2<\/a>, thinks limited resources and high output demands will help this trend take off next year.\u00a0 \u201cAt some point,\u201d she says. \u201cEvery content team is going to hit peak content velocity, with every writer creating the max content they can without sacrificing quality.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She also points to the benefits of expanding your brand\u2019s reach with a community of contributors. \u201cYou tap into those writers&#8217; massive audiences on platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and just <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/26\/word-of-mouth-marketing\">word-of-mouth marketing<\/a>. This generates more experts who are excited to write for your publication.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Expanding your reach is great for brand awareness\u2014and, of course, your metrics\u2014but that kind of inclusion is also good for fostering a sense of community with your audience, too. <a href=\"https:\/\/inkandcopy.com\/\">Masooma Memon<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">, a SaaS content marketer, expects this inclusive community feel to have a positive impact on audience engagement. \u201cWhether it&#8217;s content for social, your blog, or a webinar, it\u2019s going to continue focusing on making your audience feel like a community,\u201d she says. \u201cFolks love this sense of community belonging. It makes them feel valued, so this trend should continue picking up pace.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>2. Going live with video and webinars<\/h2>\n<p>With events out of play this year, video and webinar content has been even more important\u2014and it\u2019s not going away.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<span lang=\"EN\">My guess is video marketing including the boom in live video will continue to grow in 2021,\u201d Masooma predicts. But it\u2019s not only because of in-person restrictions; there\u2019s a reason why live video was trending well before the pandemic. \u201cThe reason? <strong>Video is a quick and effective medium to communicate your message and educate your audience<\/strong>. Consumers want to get information\/learn quickly and there\u2019s no better way to do so than with the help of video marketing.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5f7be9b8-e77d-46da-b3c2-07e90b80651c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-marketing-trends-3.png\" alt=\"Content Marketing Trends\" width=\"977\" height=\"510\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">The fact that most marketers <\/span><\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/state-of-video-marketing-new-data\"><em>report a positive ROI for video marketing<\/em><\/a><em><span lang=\"EN\"> doesn\u2019t hurt, either.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">But even more attention on live video and webinars could be a good thing. \u201cBecause of this, we&#8217;ll probably see some innovative new approaches to webinars,\u201d Patrick Whatman, content marketing lead at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.spendesk.com\/\">Spendesk<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">, said. \u201cSmall, exclusive AMA sessions and masterclasses, fireside chats, and more interactive approaches will be more popular. People are less and less interested in sitting through 30+ slides. They want to be able to ask questions and interact. And I&#8217;m excited about that element too. I&#8217;m involved in webinars all the time, but don&#8217;t personally attend many because I feel that the information is available faster (and on my own time) in a blog post. But the chance to be in a small group asking questions of experts is still highly appealing.\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>3. Improving content experience<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Ever click on an article you want to read only to get to a page filled with pop-ups and ad panels? It\u2019s awful, and most of the time I close out of the page without reading anything. At the same time, I\u2019ll spend clicking around tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/imisstheoffice.eu\/\">I Miss the Office<\/a> because they look interesting\u2014even though I definitely don\u2019t miss the sound of coworkers chewing.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"61f730a8-6517-44eb-b542-7e41427a5c8d\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-marketing-trends_0.png\" alt=\"Content Marketing Trends\" width=\"977\" height=\"464\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The bottom line is that sometimes how you\u2019re interacting with content is just as important as what content you\u2019re interacting with. That\u2019s why a focus on content experience is going to be a key content marketing trend, whether it\u2019s new, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/04\/interactive-content\">interactive content<\/a> or better UX. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">\u201cIn order to drive ROI with content, you need to focus on content experience. That means you need users to stay on your website, love what you write about, find exactly what they&#8217;re looking for, and enter a sales funnel,\u201d explains content marketing expert <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adamenfroy.com\/\">Adam Enfroy<\/a>. \u201cOne of my favorite examples of an amazing content experience is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smartpassiveincome.com\/learn\/digital-marketing\/\">Pat Flynn&#8217;s learning pages<\/a>. They include not only text content, but courses, webinars, videos, podcast episodes, and tactical calls-to-action sprinkled throughout. If brands aren&#8217;t already creating content silo pages like this to drive leads, they need to start right now.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/10\/content-audit\"><strong>&gt;&gt; How to do a Content Audit (+6 Free Templates)<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>4. Focusing on products and services<\/h2>\n<p>Another content marketing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/22\/digital-marketing-trends-2021\">trend<\/a> experts are expecting to continue is the tighter focus on bottom-of-funnel content related to core offerings.<\/p>\n<p>Part of this will be motivated by limited resources or conservative marketing plans. \u201cI see businesses trying to stay lean as much as possible over at least the next 6-9 months,\u201d Patrick says. \u201cAnd that applies to content marketing too. So for starters, I think content marketers will try to stay laser-focused on their key <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/23\/buyer-personas\">buyer personas <\/a>and core topics. This isn&#8217;t the time to go exploring whole new horizons.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That laser-focus means more attention to content at the bottom of the funnel, specific to key buyer personas and closely related to the product or service offering. But it can also help with a better understanding of content ROI.<\/p>\n<p>This is already in practice at places like G2, according to Lauren. \u201cRecently, we\u2019ve put much more emphasis on creating content pieces that directly tie into product launches, user-integrations, and much more,\u201d she says. \u201cThis makes it much easier to attribute content marketing directly to influenced revenue, plus it supports so much of the amazing work our other internal marketing teams produce.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>5. Testing AI-powered content<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">When I first tested out an AI-powered content tool this fall, I thought it was cool and futuristic\u2014and potentially a little scary, but more on that in a minute. After I looked into it, I realized that content experts have actually been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/lilachbullock\/2019\/01\/30\/2019-content-marketing-strategy-here-are-5-content-marketing-trends-that-you-cant-ignore-this-year\/?sh=74abf6485618\">predicting the rise of AI in content<\/a> for years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Now, with tools like the API GPT-3 and Contentyze, which uses AI to take data and create summaries, captions, and even full blog posts, becoming more widely available it\u2019s likely this trends take off in 2021.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">\u201cI&#8217;ve been on the waitlist for GPT-3 for aaaaages,\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mightyfinecopy.com\/\">Rachel Pilcher<\/a>, a B2B and SaaS conversion copywriter, says. \u201cThis is the thing I\u2019m most excited to try out for my own content marketing. The huge leaps in AI tech lately have some interesting things in store for us as marketers, so I\u2019m really hoping I can get access to this in 2021 (fingers crossed!).\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"videos\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_video\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"939f3022-3583-4a3a-8ec2-d825cb7cde41\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/-mxJ7c6bUg8?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As for this being a scary trend for content marketers, I don\u2019t think we need to worry. PPC has been debating on automations taking jobs for years\u2014and if anything, automations have allowed account managers to accomplish even more. Plus, I\u2019m sure AI-powered copy will need more content editing than your standard blog posts.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>6. Doubling down on SEO<\/h2>\n<p>Some trends never go completely out of style but fall in and out of focus. For fashion, it\u2019s corduroys. For beauty, it\u2019s blue eyeliner. For content, it\u2019s SEO.<\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">\u201cI expect to see <em>high quality <\/em>SEO continue to be a critical piece for content marketing in 2021,\u201d says <a href=\"https:\/\/www.saleshacker.com\/\">Sales Hacker<\/a> Head of Content Brooklin Nash. \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.animalz.co\/blog\/second-mover-advantage\/#:~:text=The%20second%20mover%20advantage%20is,the%20Achilles'%20heel%20of%20incumbents.\">Second-movers<\/a> will continue to figure out how to differentiate themselves from the big SEO titans\u2014capturing niche and long-tail keywords and creating content that&#8217;s more engaging than all the \u2018Ultimate Guides\u2019 and \u2018Top 55\u2019 lists.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"11db5a25-ce7d-42a4-86f3-5f5188ac6799\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-marketing-trends-4.png\" alt=\"Content Marketing Trends\" width=\"977\" height=\"527\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">We may have gone too far.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">That means spending time creating a solid <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unstack.com\/blog\/b2b-seo-content-strategy\">SEO strategy<\/a> and digging into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">keyword research<\/a> to find those long-tail opportunities is going to be even more important for your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/13\/content-marketing-strategy\">content marketing strategy<\/a> next year.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>7. Repurposing content across channels<\/h2>\n<p>Now, this might be my favorite content marketing trend. With an emphasis on creating engaging content with fewer resources, it makes sense that next year will bring a bigger focus on repurposing content across channels. When you\u2019re spending time and effort to create high-quality, engaging content, you want to share it with as many people as possible. The best way to do that is to repurpose.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI&#8217;m most excited to see how content teams repurpose content instead of starting from scratch,\u201d Brooklin says. \u201cBrands have figured out the virtual event thing (more or less) in 2020. In 2021, content teams will start figuring out how to most effectively use content from webinars, round tables, podcasts and conferences to stoke the content bonfire. In every panel discussion, there&#8217;s at least five <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/2021-social-media-marketing-trends\/\">social media<\/a> posts, a blog post, a newsletter mention. We don&#8217;t have to reinvent the wheel\u2014just get it turning faster.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A content audit could really help you out here!
