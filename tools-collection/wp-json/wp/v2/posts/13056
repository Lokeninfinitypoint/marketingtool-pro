Secondly, as one of the fastest-growing visual platforms, Instagram has become a <a href=\"https:\/\/business.instagram.com\/getting-started?ref=igb_carousel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">perfect marketplace<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> for online shopping: 80% of users follow at least one brand on the platform, 60% of Instagrammers discover products in-app, and one-third of the most viewed stories come from businesses. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Simply put, it\u2019s more likely your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/15\/audience-targeting\">target audience<\/a> is ready to discover and buy holiday gifts on Instagram. What is more, it is easy for brands to sell on the platform: The company has introduced product tags, shopping Instagram Stories stickers, and in-app checkout.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Wouldn\u2019t it be great if you could boost seasonal sales on Instagram?

Thus, it\u2019s important to know how to create encourage your holiday shoppers to take the desired action immediately. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\" xml:lang=\"EN\">Let\u2019s talk about s<\/span>even\u00a0ways to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/10\/boost-holiday-sales-and-revenue\">increase holiday sales<\/a>\u00a0with Instagram:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Use limited-time offers and deals<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Believe it or not, time-limited offers and deals still work: Although people know this marketing tactic well, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/20\/ppc-ad-copy\">the fear of missing out (FOMO) effect<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> has a great impact on them, so customers hasten to buy from you during a certain period of time to get a reward. Many brands get great results when they include scarcity.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Let\u2019s take Starbucks, for example. In honor of the red cup season, the company created holiday-themed reusable cups and launched the time-limited offer for seasonal shoppers which solved two problems at once: The company supported its sustainability initiative and created a sense of urgency.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"571dbd01-2ac2-481f-8a8a-0e69613ca1ce\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-sales-time-limited-offer-starbucks.jpg\" alt=\"Starbucks red cop Instagram post\" width=\"699\" height=\"447\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Bpop_5ynzAU\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Another great example comes from Lancome.

With a lifespan of 24 hours, Instagram Stories create a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/05\/how-to-increase-urgency\">sense of urgency<\/a>, as users are afraid of missing out something important. For brands, this means another proven way to reach their audience and deliver the brand message fast. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Any proof needed? To promote its big holiday sale, <a href=\"https:\/\/business.instagram.com\/success\/young-and-reckless\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Young and Reckless<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> ran Instagram Stories ads that resulted in a 6x return on ad spend.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a74b1b16-4a9d-436a-a299-003b1ee65313\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-sales-short-lived-content.jpg\" alt=\"short-lived content Instagram example\" width=\"643\" height=\"564\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>And here\u2019s another successful example of using Instagram Stories ads from <a href=\"https:\/\/business.instagram.com\/success\/made-com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Made.com<\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"72b57819-ed4e-403b-a471-dabffe323a0f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-sales-short-lived-content-countdown-timer.jpg\" alt=\"Instagram post with countdown timer\" width=\"727\" height=\"353\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>To promote its winter sale, the company ran a campaign in Instagram Stories that helped to increase <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/16\/return-on-ad-spend-roas\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">return on ad spend<\/span><\/a> by 69%, website traffic by 44%, and the number of new visitors by 28%. Not bad, huh?<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have time or money to run Instagram Stories ads, you should publish ephemeral content to get great results. Instagram rolls out business-specific features that help brands achieve their goals faster. For example, you can create a sense of urgency with <strong>the countdown sticker<\/strong>. This feature<span lang=\"EN\"> reminds<span lang=\"EN\"> your audience about the important events, so you can post a story with the countdown sticker once your seasonal sale<span lang=\"EN\"> begins and set the date when it ends so that your followers will never miss out something important.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Here\u2019s what you can learn:<\/span><\/strong> <span lang=\"EN\">With a limited lifespan, Instagram Stories encourage people to purchase quickly, as they are afraid of missing out something important. That\u2019s why using this short-lived content is a perfect choice when you want to create a sense of urgency and encourage users to take action faster.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">Make boosting Instagram sales a part of your holiday plan<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">With the growing popularity of Instagram among customers, this platform has become an important marketplace for ecommerce brands that want to increase sales during the holiday shopping season.
