However, cost per lead did not increase as drastically in 2025 as it did from 2023 to 2024, suggesting a little more stability in the paid ad space (after an <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/google-rankings-how-volatile-451424\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">extremely volatile year for organic rankings<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/2025-GA-Benchmarks-Ave-5Years-chart.png\" alt=\"google ads benchmarks - google ads costs last five years\" width=\"767\" height=\"535\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91538 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/2025-GA-Benchmarks-Ave-5Years-chart.png 767w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/2025-GA-Benchmarks-Ave-5Years-chart-480x335.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 767px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at the big picture of this benchmark data before we get into the metric-by-metric details.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Overall, average click-through rate (CTR) increased<\/strong> <strong>slightly<\/strong>, by 3.74%, but when broken down by industry, just over half of the industries saw a <em>decrease<\/em> in CTR YoY, while 48% saw either stable or increased CTRs. This is a departure from our findings over the last two years, where CTR increased pretty significantly for many industries. Google and other search engines have continuously optimized ad placements to better blend in with organic results, but they may have done all of the optimizations they can do (for now), which speaks to increased costs and lower click-through rates (for 52% of industries).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cost per click increased for 87% of industries.<\/strong> Some industries, like Education &amp; Instruction and Beauty &amp; Personal Care, saw substantial increases (over 40%). This is in line with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/2024-google-ads-benchmarks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our data last year<\/a>, where we saw cost per click (CPC) increase for 86% of industries. The continuing increase in costs is likely due to crowded and unstable SERP conditions, plus increased competition.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Conversion rate increased for 65% of industries.<\/strong> It\u2019s not all bad news! 15 out of 23 of the industries we looked at saw increases in conversion rate (CVR) YoY. This comes after a decrease for most industries last year. Some industries, like Sports &amp; Recreation and Education &amp; Instruction, saw large increases (over 40%). It\u2019s encouraging to know that despite rising costs, search ads are still effective at driving leads for businesses. This could be due to a more stable economy throughout 2024.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cost per lead increased for 13 out of 23 industries<\/strong>, although the average increase was only around 5% YoY, noticeably lower than last year\u2019s 25% average increase. However, some industries did see significant decreases, including Career &amp; Employment (46.74%) and Arts &amp; Entertainment (32.28%). An increase in cost per lead (CPL) isn\u2019t surprising given lower CTRs in those industries and increased CPC.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/2025-GA-Benchmarks-YOY-1024x602.webp\" alt=\"google ads benchmarks - overall changes year over year\" width=\"1024\" height=\"602\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91520 size-large\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/2025-GA-Benchmarks-YOY-980x577.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/2025-GA-Benchmarks-YOY-480x282.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Although costs have gone up, so have click-through rates and conversion rates, indicating generally better performance for advertisers as a whole.<\/p>\n<p>According to Cliff Sizemore, Senior Marketing Manager at LocaliQ, \u201cCosts are rising, but so is performance\u201465% of industries saw better conversion rates in 2025.

It\u2019s not surprising to see these industries on the higher end of the CPC spectrum; they typically have high-competition keywords, and clicks can yield higher purchase values for these types of businesses.<\/p>\n<p>However, the economic landscape likely has an impact on industries with high average CPCs as well, like the Home &amp; Home Improvement category.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the most notable trends in the advertising landscape is the rising costs associated with Home &amp; Home Improvement services, which are now closely following the traditionally high costs of attorney and legal services,\u201d said Navah Hopkins, Brand Evangelist at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.optmyzr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Optmyzr<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Average cost per click: YoY<\/h4>\n<p>The industries with the biggest decreases in cost per click were Arts &amp; Entertainment\u2014down 6.98%, then Restaurants &amp; Food\u2014down 5.96%, and Attorneys &amp; Legal Services\u2014down 4.03%.<\/p>\n<p>On the other end, Beauty &amp; Personal Care average cost per click was up 60.11%, followed by Education &amp; Instruction up 41.91%, and Shopping, Collectibles, &amp; Gifts up 33.72%.<\/p>\n<p>The overall average cost per click in Google Ads across all industries increased by 12.88%.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/2025-GA-Benchmarks-CPC-YOY-836x1024.webp\" alt=\"google ads average cost per click year over year benchmarks chart\" width=\"836\" height=\"1024\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91515 size-large\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Education &amp; Instruction, seeing one of the biggest increases in cost per click year over year, could indicate a general lull in the industry.<\/p>\n<p>For example, many educational institutions\u2014including both higher education and K-12 schools\u2014are bracing for a looming <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/2024\/07\/03\/education-enrollment-cliff-schools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">enrollment cliff<\/a>.

The lower your cost per click, the better, since that means you\u2019re spending less overall and can inherently lower your cost per lead.<\/p>\n<p>While we share plenty of ideas to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/17\/lower-cost-per-click\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lower your cost per click in Google Ads<\/a> here, keep in mind factors that may be out of your control, like industry competition. For example, Google Ads recently updated its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-unfair-advantage-update\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">unfair advantage policy<\/a> to now allow the same brand to serve multiple ads in different locations on the SERP, which could drive up costs. In this case, it\u2019s best to master campaign basics to ensure your landing pages, keywords, and ads are tightly aligned to increase Quality Score and, in turn, lower your cost per click.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, your bidding strategy could have an impact on your cost per click. For example, if you choose an automated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-smart-bidding\">smart bidding<\/a> strategy that\u2019s optimizing for conversions over clicks, Google\u2019s machine learning might bid higher for queries more likely to convert\u2014even if they\u2019re more competitive and expensive.<\/p>\n<p>According to Katia Hausman, Vice President of Product at LocaliQ, \u201cThe rate of CPC increases varies depending on optimization type, but we&#8217;ve seen sharper increases on campaigns with smart bidding, which is likely expected since Google has direct control over these CPCs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udcb8 <strong>Want to lower your costs fast?<\/strong> Download our free guide to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/ways-to-save-money-in-google-ads?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_SaveMoneyinGoogleAds_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">6 easy ways to save big in Google Ads now<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"2025-google-ads-benchmarks-conversion-rate\"><\/div>\n<h3>Average conversion rate in search ads<\/h3>\n<p>Conversion rate is a crucial <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/19\/ppc-metrics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PPC metric<\/a> when it comes to gauging your search ad performance, because it proves how well your ads are equating to real sales or leads.<\/p>\n<p>A high conversion rate indicates that your ads are showing to interested potential customers with ad copy and creative that\u2019s compelling enough to hook them in and that your landing page is optimized for the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-the-buyers-journey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">buyer\u2019s journey<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The average conversion rate in Google Ads in 2025 is 7.52%.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/2025-GA-Benchmarks-CVR-871x1024.webp\" alt=\"2025 google ads benchmarks - conversion rate chart year over year\" width=\"871\" height=\"1024\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91513 size-large\" \/><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Business Category<\/td>\n<td width=\"312\">Average CVR<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Animals &amp;

For instance, if you\u2019re getting less clicks at higher costs, it\u2019ll be more difficult to maintain a high conversion rate as your budget stretches to cover what are likely lower-intent clicks. Remember, a click is half the battle when securing a conversion.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRising CPCs are one of the only constants in Google Ads, so it&#8217;s refreshing to see advertisers focusing on what they can control in response: conversion rates,\u201d said Jyll Saskin Gales, Google Ads Coach.<\/p>\n<p>If you find you want to squeeze more out of your conversion rate and your CTRs and CPCs are already maximized, you may want to consider new conversion actions to test on your landing pages to make it easier for visitors to take action on your site.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEverything comes down to your landing page offer in combination with your ad. If your focus area was on making your ad and landing page as conversion-friendly as possible, then CVR will improve as well,\u201d said Brett McHale, Founder of Empiric Marketing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLanding page optimization, compelling creative, offline conversion tracking\u2014these are some of the tools we have to increase conversion rate and keep ROI in line. 65% of industries saw increases in average conversion rates this year, a promising trend to counteract rising costs,\u201d Jyll said.<\/p>\n<p>Other <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/26\/marketing-channels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing channels<\/a> can also help support your Google Ads conversion rate optimization efforts, as your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/11\/most-popular-social-media-platforms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media accounts<\/a> might inspire potential customers to search for your business online, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>Be sure to check out this resource for more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/03\/improve-conversion-rates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">conversion rate optimization tips<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u26a1<strong>Get ideas to optimize your campaigns and increase conversion rates fast<\/strong> with a free, instant account report from our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\\\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads Grader<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"2025-google-ads-benchmarks-cpl\"><\/div>\n<h3>Average cost per lead in search ads<\/h3>\n<p>While you want to consider <em>all <\/em>your available metrics when evaluating your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/07\/ppc-reporting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PPC reporting<\/a> and performance, cost per lead is one that usually gets special attention.

Plus, you may need to consider your lead quality when evaluating your cost per lead.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCost per lead is an essential metric, but measuring lead quality and value is just as important today. Advertisers need to track the real business impact of those leads. Feeding platforms actual conversion value signals, like scored call data, improves CPL over time,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/alessandrocolarossi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alessandro Colarossi<\/a>, Director of Account Management at SearchKings.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn industries like Home &amp; Home Improvement, where the average CPL is already $90.92, focusing on better lead quality over sheer quantity is critical,\u201d Alessandro said.<\/p>\n<p>It also may be beneficial to evaluate your other marketing platforms in tandem with your search ads cost per lead to see how you could bring down costs across the board to work towards your business\u2019s bottom line.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/marketing-channels-chart.webp\" alt=\"marketing channel mix example\" width=\"941\" height=\"724\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91546 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/marketing-channels-chart.webp 941w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/marketing-channels-chart-480x369.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 941px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>An example of marketing channels that could complement your search ad strategy and help you bring down costs overall. <\/em><\/p>\n<div id=\"2025-google-ads-benchmarks-what-it-means\"><\/div>\n<h2>What these search ad benchmarks mean for your business<\/h2>\n<p>Regardless of how your current PPC results align with your industry\u2019s averages, there are always ways you can improve and optimize your campaigns!<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCost per lead is either increasing at a slower pace or decreasing altogether for many industries, mostly due to improving conversion rates. This suggests ads, keywords, and landing pages are becoming more relevant, leading to a higher percentage of website visitors contacting the business,\u201d Katia said.<\/p>\n<p>To help you make smart PPC strategy decisions, here\u2019s what to know about the key trends and takeaways from these Google Ads benchmarks.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Keeping an eye on SERP changes is hugely important<\/h3>\n<p>Google has already been looking for additional ways to squeeze money out of the SERP, like reversing a long-held rule keeping businesses from running multiple ads on the same SERP. We expect Google to also introduce more ad options within AI Overviews to further monetize the search results page.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/google-ads-benchmarks-example-ads-on-serp.webp\" alt=\"google ads benchmarks - example ad on serp\" width=\"800\" height=\"379\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91526 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/google-ads-benchmarks-example-ads-on-serp.webp 800w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/google-ads-benchmarks-example-ads-on-serp-480x227.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/google-ads-benchmarks-duplicate-ad-example-1.webp\" alt=\"google ads benchmarks - duplicate ad example \" width=\"753\" height=\"331\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91524 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/google-ads-benchmarks-duplicate-ad-example-1.webp 753w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/google-ads-benchmarks-duplicate-ad-example-1-480x211.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 753px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>There are ads for JustAnswer in the top ad spot and then again further down the page in this SERP example, proving how Google\u2019s recent updates are changing the ad landscape.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>2. Diversifying your search ad strategy is key<\/h3>\n<p>As we\u2019ve seen potential ad placements expand and become more streamlined with campaign types like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/05\/performance-max-tips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Performance Max<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/22\/demand-gen-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Demand Gen<\/a> campaigns, it\u2019s more important than ever to take advantage of all the options Google has available to reach your audience.<\/p>\n<p>You might not be able to rely solely on search ad placements and could expand to other strategies like Shopping Ads or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/11\/google-local-service-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Local Services Ads<\/a> to supplement your search campaigns and improve your overall account health.<\/p>\n<p>More campaign variety could also lead to lower CPCs in general. For example, industries that rely heavily on visuals to showcase their offerings are generally seeing lower costs as they move towards media-rich, feed-based campaign types.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is intriguing to observe how inexpensive categories such as Real Estate have become. The affordability of Real Estate is particularly surprising, as one would expect the CPCs in this sector to be more competitive,\u201d Navah said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis raises questions about whether the introduction of Performance Max campaigns is contributing to the lower average CPCs, as more Real Estate marketers adopt this feed-based campaign type,\u201d Navah said.<\/p>\n<p>You should also consider all your search ad platform options. For example, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/replicate-google-ads-on-bing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">replicate your Google Ads success on Microsoft Ads<\/a> for typically a lower cost.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDiversifying your advertising spend across different platforms can help offset rising costs on any single platform. This allows you to reach different audiences while reallocating budgets to the ad publishers that deliver the best conversions,\u201d Katia said.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Account structure can make or break your experience in the ad auction<\/h3>\n<p>How you break out your campaigns and segment your target audiences has a huge impact on performance. It\u2019s important to consider your account structure when evaluating costs, as auctions for certain campaign types or audience segments may be more competitive than others. This means your different campaigns may require variations in keyword lists, budget, bidding strategy, and more.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/google-ads-account-structure.webp\" alt=\"google ads account structure chart\" width=\"818\" height=\"613\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91558 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/google-ads-account-structure.webp 818w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/google-ads-account-structure-480x360.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 818px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\uddfa Map out your account for success\u00a0now<\/strong> using our free guide to <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLAccountStructure.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_LastAccountStructureGuide_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the perfect Google Ads account structure<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is essential to pay close attention to auction prices. If there are significant variations across different regions or business segments\u2014where some areas are costly while others are more affordable\u2014it is crucial to manage these differences effectively,\u201d Navah said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cKeeping these variations in separate campaigns allows for more efficient budgeting and resource allocation,\u201d she added. \u201cUltimately, it is vital to align your campaigns with the revenue generated from sales, regardless of whether the transaction is immediate or part of a lead generation process.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>4. Fine-tuned targeting is a must<\/h3>\n<p>The right account structure can also help you target more effectively.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA big tip I have for improving search ad results would be to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">know your audience<\/a> and optimize your campaign to that audience. The more tailored your ads can be for the audience most likely to convert, the better,\u201d said Stephanie Scanlan, Vice President of Client Success at LocaliQ.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUse tools, such as settings by demographics, to make sure your ad spend is going towards people who would use the product or service you\u2019re selling. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-audience-targeting\">Add in audiences<\/a> to help your ads show for people who have engaged with similar businesses or industries recently. Know your audience well and maximize your reach to them,\u201d Stephanie said.<\/p>\n<p>In this instance, your PPC goals can be a guiding light for your campaign structure and targeting strategy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBuild campaigns that are hyper-focused on the goal that you are trying to achieve. Google Ads (and nearly every other ad platform) is heavily pushing broad \u2018AI-enhanced\u2019 targeting. While this can be helpful, you still want to maintain as much control over targeting as possible. Don\u2019t always opt for the easiest campaign setup with Performance Max or other AI features. Instead, test AI-powered capabilities first and use them strategically,\u201d Brett said.<\/p>\n<p>From there, you can create ads that are tightly aligned to your campaign\u2019s audience segments.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAlways focus on creative and messaging. Once targeting is optimized, your best strategy is to heavily focus on where folks are landing from your ads and what is going to draw them there to convert. Conversions start at the ad level and work their way down. Make that process as seamless as possible,\u201d Brett said.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Focusing on overall ROI throughout the year should be a priority<\/h3>\n<p>While it can be easy to get bogged down with one specific metric, try to think about how these key Google Ads metrics play into your business\u2019s overall bottom line. While it\u2019s important to track individual performance metrics within Google Ads, you should find ways to uncover your search ads ROI as a whole, too.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt the end of the day, with PPC it is about the ROI. Is your PPC campaign putting money back into your business and helping it grow? For a business owner, it is important to continually optimize your PPC campaigns for what is generating ROI at that moment in time,\u201d Stephanie said.<\/p>\n<p>Your PPC ROI may be subject to seasonality as well. So, be ready to shift your strategy as needed throughout the year to maintain an effective, always-on approach to your campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIndustries see shifts throughout the year, and what was giving you the best ROI in April won\u2019t necessarily be the same services or products giving you the best ROI in October. Your PPC campaign needs to be adjusted along with this to ensure you\u2019re maximizing your best ROI,\u201d Stephanie said.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Don\u2019t be surprised if industry competition continues to increase<\/h3>\n<p>With the current state of search advertising, it\u2019s inevitable that competition is only going to increase for most industries. To combat this and stay ahead, lean into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/12\/first-party-data\">first-party data<\/a> and value-based campaign tracking and bidding.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/types-of-customer-data-collection-sources-png.webp\" alt=\"customer data collection sources\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90342 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/types-of-customer-data-collection-sources-png.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/types-of-customer-data-collection-sources-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cAdvertisers seeing the strongest long-term results despite rising competition are the ones strengthening their first-party data foundations. For instance, using customer match for prospecting, GA4 audiences for smarter targeting, and securing conversion durability through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/04\/17\/how-to-set-up-google-ads-enhanced-conversions\">enhanced conversions<\/a> and GA4 user-provided data,\u201d Alessandro said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe widening gap between CPC and CPL across industries really stands out to me. While some categories like Automotive\u2014Repair, Service &amp; Parts show a manageable cost per click of $3.90, the cost per lead still stretches to $28.50,\u201d Alessandro said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOn the higher end, Attorneys &amp; Legal Services has a CPC of $8.58 but a much higher CPL of $131.63. This shows that even when clicks are reasonably priced, competition for meaningful conversions can drive lead costs significantly higher. It highlights the growing need for advertisers to track and value their conversions carefully as acquisition costs continue to rise.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The value a search ad lead brings to your business can make dealing with high costs and competition well worth it.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe ultimate measure of success is the value of the leads generated. It&#8217;s acceptable for CPC to rise if CPL is falling and conversion rates are improving. Therefore, it&#8217;s important to invest in tools that allow you to understand the true value of your leads to get a complete picture of performance,\u201d Katia said.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Auditing your PPC accounts regularly is crucial<\/h3>\n<p>As the overall averages for CTR, CPC, CVR, and CPL have fluctuated in recent years, you\u2019ll want to stay ahead of any potential changes to your account performance. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/06\/ppc-account-audit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Auditing your PPC accounts<\/a> regularly can help you understand how your campaigns are performing against benchmarks in your industry.<\/p>\n<p>Try finding an easy-to-follow audit structure that works best for you and your team. For example, many advertisers use the SWOT analysis exercise (which looks at their account\u2019s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) to track, benchmark, and optimize their performance.<\/p>\n<p>Or, you could try following a checklist, like the example below, to be sure you\u2019re covering all your performance tracking bases.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/2025-Google-Ad-Audit-chart.png\" alt=\"google ads benchmarks - google ads account audit\" width=\"910\" height=\"601\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91537 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/2025-Google-Ad-Audit-chart.png 910w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/2025-Google-Ad-Audit-chart-480x317.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 910px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc40 <strong>Want a true read of your Google Ads campaign performance?<\/strong> Try our free <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads Grader<\/a> for an instant account report!<\/p>\n<h2>Google Ads benchmarks 2025: How to take action in your account now<\/h2>\n<p>Remember, no two Google Ads accounts are exactly the same.
