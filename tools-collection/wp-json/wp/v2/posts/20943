And now you can already see the problems.<\/p>\n<p>For one, nobody likes to read. So \u201ccontinue reading\u201d doesn\u2019t exactly inspire. If it did, you would still have a Borders bookstore to go kill time in, flipping through images in magazines.<\/p>\n<p>No, the value \u2013 the compelling reason <em>why <\/em>one should \u201cclick here\u201d or \u201ccontinue\u201d anything \u2013 is the end result that \u201creading\u201d will get you.<\/p>\n<p>Years ago, <a href=\"http:\/\/lkrsocialmedia.com\/\">Laura Roeder<\/a> ran a promotion with that exact button copy.

It uses an action-oriented verb that expertly emphasizes the end results, while at the same time, better aligning the message match between the button, the page headline, and the program name (which was called \u201cCreating Fame\u201d). But most importantly, it answers the prospect\u2019s question, \u201c<em>Why<\/em> should I click?\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Reason #4. Implying Costs &amp; Commitment Instead of Value<\/h2>\n<p>The word \u201csubmit\u201d makes people uneasy.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s anxiety. An apprehension as to what comes next.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s too close to \u201csubmission,\u201d which means <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/07\/conversion-sabotaging-words\">different things to different people<\/a>. <em>Most<\/em> of which are negative, especially for commitment-phobes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSubscribe\u201d causes similar anxiety, making people think they\u2019re about to pay for something and that it\u2019s going to be a bigger decision than it probably is. And as we\u2019ve already seen, forcing people to think can sink conversions.<\/p>\n<p>Simple, everyday words like these carry their own connotations \u2013 pernicious ones to avoid related to cost.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/sales\/appliance-sales-lessons\">Sales 101 says<\/a> to trump cost objections with value building. That\u2019s true in this conversion game too, where customers are constantly weighing the discrepancy between these two opposing forces. \u201cProspects subconsciously subtract perceived <strong>cost force<\/strong> from the perceived <strong>value force<\/strong>\u201d, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marketingexperiments.com\/blog\/research-topics\/copywriting-research-topics\/value-proposition-in-copy.html\">according<\/a> to Flint McGlaughlin, Managing Director of MECLABS (the parent company of MarketingExperiments).<\/p>\n<p>Which \u2013 <em>apparently<\/em>, I\u2019m told \u2013 is what this graphic illustrates:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"eef581f5-e51d-4037-857e-9df66a4f50a7\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/value-force-vs-cost-force.png\" alt=\"value force vs cost force\" width=\"650\" height=\"469\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>I have no idea what that image says, either. But images, yo! GRAPHS AND CHARTS!<\/p>\n<p>This point was further illustrated by the simple copy test of two seemingly innocuous phrases: \u201cSelect Lodging\u201d vs. \u201cSee All Rentals\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The first sounds simple enough. But the second crushed it by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marketingexperiments.com\/blog\/research-topics\/copywriting-research-topics\/value-proposition-in-copy.html\">427%<\/a> (along with a few other changes, to be fair).<\/p>\n<p>The theory goes back to negative connotations. \u201cSelect Lodging\u201d implies that people will have to do all the work, assuming not just a hard cost to purchase, but also a soft one in the form of mentally-taxing, time-consuming searches that need performing.<\/p>\n<p>The second version of the CTA text is more value-based. It\u2019s asking for less work and commitment in comparison, and instead focuses on the variety of rentals they have to offer. That\u2019s value.<\/p>\n<h2>Reason #5.
