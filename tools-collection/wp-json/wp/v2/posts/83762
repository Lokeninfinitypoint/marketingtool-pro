But <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-marketing-pros-drive-traffic\">non-paid traffic<\/a> will become much harder to harvest.<\/p>\n<h3>\u201cGenerative AI requires much more energy than traditional keyword searches\u201d<\/h3>\n<p>This point came from a discussion about the broader effects of AI Overviews. A recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/what-do-googles-ai-answers-cost-the-environment\/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Scientific American article<\/a> shared that it can take up to 30 times the energy to produce new text for an AI response compared to a traditional search result.<\/p>\n<p>Google processes about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.demandsage.com\/google-search-statistics\/#:~:text=How%20many%20Google%20searches%20per,a%20query%20and%20give%20results.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">85 billion<\/a> searches every day. Even though Google only rolled out AI Overviews broadly in the US, and they only show up in a portion of results, a huge amount of additional energy is still needed. And that power draw will grow when Google pushes the program worldwide.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEmbedding generative AI in such a widely used application [online search] is likely to deepen the tech sector\u2019s hunger for fossil fuels and water,\u201d the Scientific American piece concluded.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no stopping AI now, and in many cases, that\u2019s a net positive. However, there is an opportunity to use the technology more intentionally, only consuming extra resources when there\u2019s a significant benefit in exchange.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc4b Learn how (and how not) to use AI in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/emergency-ai-guide?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_AIMarketing_Download\">The Emergency Guide to AI in Marketing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-should-ai-overviews-make-search-better\"><\/div>\n<h2>How should AI make search better?<\/h2>\n<p>If AI isn\u2019t tasked with answering our questions, what can we ask it to do? Ideally, Google could train its large language models to show us what\u2019s on the other side of each link. Properly educated, we\u2019ll be more prudent with our clicks, saving us from skimming unhelpful content and speeding up our research.<\/p>\n<h3>Tell us what\u2019s inside an article<\/h3>\n<p>AI is excellent at surfacing the most valuable bits from a text. That\u2019s one application that would speed up research, wrote<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/alexander-perekalin-26ba61146\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Alexander Perekalin<\/a>, Marketing Content Manager at Mouseflow.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/AI-Overview-problems-wordstream-alex.jpg\" alt=\"AI Overviews do the wrong job - LinkedIn comment\" width=\"936\" height=\"301\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83788 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/AI-Overview-problems-wordstream-alex.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/AI-Overview-problems-wordstream-alex-480x154.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Search engine users want to know more about content before they click on it.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I could see this as a hover-over summary for the top search results if not all.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d also love to see the summary include points unique to the content. Say you\u2019re searching for the best brownie recipe; you might get an overview that says, \u201cThis recipe goes in-depth on the best flours for brownies\u201d or \u201cThis post includes a shopping list the others don\u2019t.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Confirm credibility<\/h3>\n<p>In theory, Google should prioritize the highest-quality, most trustworthy content. In reality, some SERPs have several unverified articles that may include incorrect information. Sometimes that\u2019s an inconvenience. For health or financial queries, those that<a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/docs\/fundamentals\/creating-helpful-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Google calls<\/a> \u201cYour Money or Your Life\u201d (YMYL), errors are dangerous.<\/p>\n<p>There are a few ways AI could help us know which of these posts to trust. First, AI could tag content with a credibility score based on the website&#8217;s history (like if the website has published a lot of content for a long time about similar topics).<\/p>\n<p>In her LinkedIn reply, Krista suggested a second option: Google could label critical content by whether or not it\u2019s been fact-checked by a trusted or known expert.<\/p>\n<p>In a third verification step, Google\u2019s AI could tell you if the article contains original data. That way you\u2019re not running down the all-to-common statistics rabbit hole looking for original sources and unique data.<\/p>\n<h3>Guide us to the next click<\/h3>\n<p>You often need to scan multiple pieces of content to find the complete answer to your question. How exhausting is it to skim a half dozen articles only to find they\u2019re nearly identical? And then none of them give any unique information that expands your understanding.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s where the Sameness Score comes in. AI could tell us that the next post in line is nearly identical to the one we\u2019ve just read. Combined with the unique attributes it shows for each result, you\u2019d know which content to skip, which to review, and what to look for when you click.<\/p>\n<p>After you\u2019ve reviewed the first page, AI could show you what post to read next based on where others went before you. A statement like, \u201c85% of people who read this post opened this one next,\u201d would be really helpful.<\/p>\n<div id=\"search-engine-features-on-the-right-track\"><\/div>\n<h2>Some search engine features are on the right track<\/h2>\n<p>Several people responded to the LinkedIn post with ways alternative search engines use AI to address one or more of the ideas above.

Arc gives you an AI-generated page overview when you hover over a link on a desktop or pinch a page on a smartphone.<\/p>\n<p>Arc also has a feature called Browse for Me which creates a custom tab with multiple webpages organized from a single query.

Goggles lets you create customized ranking signals to tailor your results feed to your needs.

I played around with it a few times. It produces an AI summary similar to Google\u2019s AI Overviews. And I liked how it grouped Reddit discussions in a separate box instead of mixing them with other links.<\/p>\n<h3>Google\u2019s Web filter<\/h3>\n<p>You may have noticed the new Web filter option on your Google results pages.

But I\u2019d argue it\u2019s one of the most useful options added to Google Search in a long time.<\/p>\n<p>Basically, Web turns Google Search back into a simple web search without the knowledge graphs, snippets, or AI Overviews.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/AI-Overview-problems-wordstream-nonweb.jpg\" alt=\"AI Overviews do the wrong job - search result without web filter.\" width=\"821\" height=\"600\" class=\"wp-image-83791 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/AI-Overview-problems-wordstream-nonweb.jpg 821w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/AI-Overview-problems-wordstream-nonweb-480x351.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 821px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Un-filtered Google search result<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/AI-Overview-problems-wordstream-web.jpg\" alt=\"AI Overviews do the wrong job - Google result with the web filter.\" width=\"646\" height=\"600\" class=\"wp-image-83792 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/AI-Overview-problems-wordstream-web.jpg 646w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/AI-Overview-problems-wordstream-web-480x446.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 646px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Google search result with the new Web filter<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Some searches benefit greatly from People Also Ask and Featured Image snippets.

It\u2019ll push creators to produce better, more differentiated posts and videos.<\/p>\n<p>Clicks are currency in search engine marketing.

A Sameness Score, credibility rating, and uniqueness review would tell users which content is different and trustworthy.<\/p>\n<p>Better content would then collect more clicks, and creators would be motivated to produce pieces that stand out with novel perspectives, original data, and verified information.
