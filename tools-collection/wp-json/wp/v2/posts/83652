It\u2019s no longer enough to focus on one\u2019s own business, product offerings, customer service, operations, and the like. Business owners need to be actively engaged in collecting insights and data points about the state of their competition. Heck, how are you supposed to know how to win if you don\u2019t know who is running the race and how they\u2019re running it?<\/p>\n<p>In fact, the discipline of collecting competitive insights isn\u2019t simply about gauging the business landscape in your particular vertical. It\u2019s about actively improving your business. Why? Because whether you like it or not, your competitors are, in all likelihood, succeeding in some way that you\u2019re not. They\u2019re failing in some way you\u2019re not. And when you truly start to analyze these successes and failures, you\u2019re in for a veritable goldmine of ideas about how to improve your own operations.<\/p>\n<p>In this post, we\u2019re going to run through seven of the most actionable insights you can collect on your competitors. We\u2019ll show you where to find them, and what they mean. And most importantly, we\u2019ll show you what to <em>do <\/em>with this data to make <em>more<\/em> revenue in the form of <em>greater<\/em> market share this year.<\/p>\n<h2>Top competitive insights to collect<\/h2>\n<p>There are a ton of ways to go about collecting (and analyzing) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/competitive-positioning\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">competitive<\/a> insights, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re here to talk about today. Here are the top competitive insights we\u2019re going to cover:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#products-features-positioning-pricing-analysis\">Product suite, features, positioning, and pricing<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#review-credibility-analysis\">Review and credibility analysis<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#authority-seo-analysis\">Authority and top-level SEO analysis<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#content-gap-keyword-analysis\">Content gap, top keywords, and top pages<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#backlink-analysis\">Backlink analysis<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#paid-keyword-strategy-analysis\">Paid keyword strategy<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#paid-social-strategy-analysis\">Paid social creative strategy<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Let\u2019s dive in.<\/p>\n<div id=\"products-features-positioning-pricing-analysis\"><\/div>\n<h3>1. Product suite, features, positioning, and pricing<\/h3>\n<p>Products, features, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/20\/product-positioning\">positioning<\/a>, and pricing are probably the most important competitive insights you can collect. Why? Because if your products and services aren\u2019t positioned or priced correctly, no amount of marketing or competitive research is going to allow you to beat your competitors.<\/p>\n<p>For pricing, try using a competitive pricing tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/hello.pricelabs.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PriceLabs<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.repricer.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Repricer<\/a>. Or try pricing your products or services how they are actually valued. Look at your competitors\u2019 websites. How are they packaging their offerings? What prices are they using? How is your product meaningfully better than theirs? How is it worse? Do you use better materials? Do you have better customer service? How are they positioning their offering as better or different than the other offerings on the market?<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-pricing.webp\" alt=\"example of pricing options from competitor for competitive insights\" width=\"884\" height=\"511\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83700\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-pricing.webp 884w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-pricing-480x277.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 884px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>With regard to price, you may be tempted to undercut your competitors to win more business. But consider what having a lower price says about your product. In fact, consumers will often choose the higher price because they believe a higher price equates to a higher value. And for consumers looking for a lower price, an honest conversation with your sales team about <em>why <\/em>you are priced higher than your competitors (because your product is better!) is often enough to win the sale.<\/p>\n<p>A good ole\u2019 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/12\/20\/swot-analysis\">SWOT analysis<\/a> can help you keep track of these competitive insights.

Review and credibility analysis<\/h3>\n<p>You can use a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/competitive-analysis\">competitive analysis<\/a> tool to analyze reviews en masse, but if you\u2019re cash-strapped, you\u2019ll be happy to hear that this step is completely free. Just head to your competitors&#8217; pages on Yelp, Google Business, Amazon, Trustpilot, and the like. Anywhere your competitors\u2019 customers have gone to tell the world exactly how they feel about them.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-review-example.webp\" alt=\"example of review from competitor\" width=\"878\" height=\"497\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83701\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-review-example.webp 878w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-review-example-480x272.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 878px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We used a restaurant example here, but whether you\u2019re a software company, a roofing company, or an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/04\/ecommerce-statistics\">ecommerce<\/a> brand, reviews are where you go to understand where your competitors are falling short of their customers&#8217; expectations, where they are meeting them, and where they are exceeding them.<\/p>\n<p>Do they take too long to respond to a support chat? That\u2019s an area where you can beat them. Is there a particular feature one customer wishes they had? That\u2019s an area where you can beat them. Are customers responding positively to your competitors\u2019 pricing? Well, you may want to consider lowering your prices a touch to compete for that business.<\/p>\n<p>\u2b50\ufe0f <strong>Want more reviews for your business?<\/strong> We&#8217;ve got you covered!

Authority and top-level SEO analysis<\/h3>\n<p>Page and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/12\/domain-authority\">domain authority<\/a> are a huge factor in your competitor\u2019s ability to outrank you in the search results. Authority is measured on a scale of 0-100, and is essentially the fruit of your greatest ally in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/13\/off-page-seo\">off-page SEO<\/a> (Search Engine Optimization): backlinking.<\/p>\n<p>Does your competitor have a lot of links from other websites? Are they quality links from reputable sites with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/13\/content-creation\">strong content<\/a>? These are the questions you need to ask yourself, and you\u2019ll find the answers in tools like Semrush, Ahrefs, and Moz: any tool that measures authority and can show you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/27\/backlink-audit\">your competitors&#8217; backlink profiles<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To find this competitive insight, try typing the name of your domain into Ahrefs, and click on the \u201cOrganic Competitors\u201d tab. Note: you will need a paid version of this tool or a free trial to see this competitive insight.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-organic-traffic.webp\" alt=\"example of competing domains organic traffic\" width=\"884\" height=\"527\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83703\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-organic-traffic.webp 884w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-organic-traffic-480x286.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 884px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As you can see, Ahrefs gives us a nice scatter plot of how we compare to our competitors in terms of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/03\/organic-traffic\">organic traffic<\/a>, number of pages in the search results, domain rating (or authority), number of organic keywords, and more.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-competing-domains.webp\" alt=\"example of competing domains in ahrefs\" width=\"857\" height=\"396\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83702\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-competing-domains.webp 857w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-competing-domains-480x222.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 857px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"content-gap-keyword-analysis\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Content gap, top keywords, and top pages<\/h3>\n<p>Since we\u2019re talking about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/seo\">SEO<\/a>, we might as well follow this thread to our content gap analysis. This competitive insight shows you which pages or keywords are generating the most organic traffic for your competitors <em>that you do not rank for<\/em>. This is yet another tab within tools like Ahrefs, Semrush, and Moz, and it looks like this:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-keyword-gap.webp\" alt=\"example of keyword gap tool\" width=\"840\" height=\"348\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83704\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-keyword-gap.webp 840w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-keyword-gap-480x199.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 840px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There are a number of ways to slice and dice this report. You can see which keywords your competitors rank for on page one that you rank for on page two. You can see which keywords you don\u2019t rank for at all that you <strong>should<\/strong> rank for. You can sort by traffic. You can also simply pull a list of your competitors&#8217; top organic keywords by traffic.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-keyword-rankings.webp\" alt=\"example of keyword rankings report\" width=\"883\" height=\"535\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83705\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-keyword-rankings.webp 883w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-keyword-rankings-480x291.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 883px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Creating a content plan and not sure where to start? Head to the \u201cTop Pages\u201d tab, search for \u201cblog\u201d in the URL, and see where the lion\u2019s share of your competitors\u2019 organic blog traffic is coming from.<\/p>\n<p>However you choose to do it, these reports will start to give you a great idea of what type of content you need to create, and what <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/organic-keyword\">types of keywords<\/a> you need to target, in order to enjoy the same organic success as your competitors.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd0e <strong>Need help finding the right keywords?<\/strong> Try our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"backlink-analysis\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Backlink analysis<\/h3>\n<p>Once we have a high-level hold on how we compare to our competitors organically, we can start digging a bit deeper. It looks like the competitor at the top of the list, the one with whom we share the most common keywords, is crushing us in organic traffic. How have they accrued the domain authority to outrank us on so many critical keywords?<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at their backlinks. We can do this by clicking on the \u201cBacklinks\u201d tab after searching their domain.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-backlinks.webp\" alt=\"example of backlink analysis for competitive insights\" width=\"727\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83706\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-backlinks.webp 727w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-backlinks-480x396.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 727px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We can see here that the first two websites linking to our competitor have really strong authority (92). If we scroll down the list, not only do we start getting a sense of what kind of links we need to accrue in order to compete, but we can start to mark down some great targets for link outreach.<\/p>\n<div id=\"paid-keyword-strategy-analysis\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. Paid keyword strategy<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019ve discussed how to use your competitors\u2019 <strong>organic<\/strong> keywords to buoy your business; now, let\u2019s look at a paid keyword report. Once again, you can find this report in a tool like Semrush.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-paid-keywords.webp\" alt=\"example of paid keyword report\" width=\"814\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83707\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-paid-keywords.webp 814w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-paid-keywords-480x353.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 814px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can see that once we enter a competitor\u2019s domain, we can see who they are competing with, how much paid search traffic they are getting, where their ads are positioned, and most importantly, their top paid keywords. Hop over into the Ad Copies tab, and you can see what messaging they\u2019re using for each of these top keywords:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-advertising-research.webp\" alt=\"report that shows where keywords are being used\" width=\"804\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83708\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-advertising-research.webp 804w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-insights-advertising-research-480x358.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 804px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re running Google Ads on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/20\/google-adwords-search-versus-display\">search network<\/a>, this is invaluable insight.
