A PPC audit is a thorough evaluation of the structure and performance of a paid ad account in a pay-per-click ad platform, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/15\/google-ads-benchmarks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads<\/a>, Microsoft Ads, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/11\/28\/facebook-ads-benchmarks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook Ads<\/a>. A PPC <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-audit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">audit<\/a> looks at the setup of key account components and settings in order to uncover potential errors and areas for optimization. Regularly auditing your PPC accounts can help you stay ahead of performance trends and opportunities to maximize your<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-roi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u00a0marketing ROI<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So <em>how<\/em> do you do a PPC audit? Let&#8217;s look at the steps that go into a PPC audit next!<\/p>\n<h2>1. Be sure conversions are being tracked (properly)<\/h2>\n<p>Are you tracking conversions properly? This is an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/16\/ppc-audit\">essential question to ask in any PPC audit<\/a>. Neglecting to track conversions is one of the biggest mistakes a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/ppc-management\">PPC manager<\/a> can make. Without this data, it\u2019s impossible to understand whether all of your hard work is paying off! While this should be one of the very first tasks completed after setting up an account, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/wasting-adwords-budget-lessons-2000-adwords-audits\/162413\/\">report<\/a> from Disruptive Advertising found that only 58% of the 2,000 accounts featured in their study had at least one conversion registered.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/ppc-audit-conversion-tracking.jpg\" alt=\"ppc audit - google ads conversion tracking screenshot\" width=\"913\" height=\"332\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-80660 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/ppc-audit-conversion-tracking.jpg 913w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/ppc-audit-conversion-tracking-480x175.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 913px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Google has made this setup easier and easier through the years. Use it!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s bad, but this is worse\u2014of this group, only half of the accounts that were \u201ctracking conversions\u201d had the code implemented correctly. Meaning, only 29% of all accounts reviewed passed muster when it came to tracking conversions.<\/p>\n<p>Be sure that your newly acquired account doesn\u2019t fall into this group. If conversions are registered in the account, be watchful for these tell-tale signs that the tracking has been set up improperly:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your click count and conversion count are identical. If this is the case, you either have the most amazing products in the world or your conversion tracking code was added to your landing pages, rather than your thank you\/order confirmation page.<\/li>\n<li>Your conversion rates are super-high, despite low sales numbers. If so, your conversion tracking may be measuring visits to a product page or home page, rather than an order confirmation.<\/li>\n<li>Your conversion count is suspiciously low, suggesting that you\u2019re missing conversions. In this case, the former account manager neglected to track <a href=\"\/adwords-call-tracking\">phone call conversions<\/a> or forgot to add tracking codes to new landing pages.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If no conversions are registered on the account, <a href=\"\/conversion-tracking-setup\">generating and implementing conversion tracking code<\/a> should be your first order of business! With this first PPC audit step conquered, your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads conversion rate optimization<\/a> is off to a good start.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf31Get more tips on how to grow your PPC strategy with our free guide to <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteHackingGoogleAds.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_HackingGoogleAds_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hacking Google Ads<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"ppc-audit-targeting\"><\/div>\n<h2>2. Review campaign-level settings<\/h2>\n<p>Setting your campaign targeting settings is a simple activity that takes five minutes, tops, but one small misstep in this section can have a profound impact on your account performance. (You can see how some of our clients learned this the hard way <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/13\/ppc-mistakes-destroy-budget\">here<\/a>.)

The audit\/optimization process that you follow will be dependent on the network you\u2019re targeting.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mobile Bid Adjustments: <\/strong>Do you want to show on mobile devices? If so, make sure that your bid modifiers are high enough to score you visibility for mobile searches. To determine this, segment your performance by device to assess the effectiveness of your existing mobile bids. Is your new company not quite ready for mobile traffic? Set the bids to -100%, until you get your mobile-preferred ads and mobile landing pages up to snuff. I recommend prioritizing this, given the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/24\/mobile-ppc-charts\">ever-growing percentage of searches occurring on mobile devices<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Target Locations:<\/strong> Check to ensure that your company services the regions that your account has opted into. Then, take this one step further and review your geo-reports. You may find that a particular area performs ridiculously well (or ridiculously poorly) and can fine-tune the account to prioritize that location.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Congrats! Another step your<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/ppc-optimization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> PPC optimization checklist<\/a> knocked out.<\/p>\n<div id=\"ppc-audit-steps\"><\/div>\n<h2>3. Assess your ad groups<\/h2>\n<p>The general rule of thumb is that an ad group should never contain more than 15-20 keywords and, for auditing purposes, I think this is a good jumping-off point. Scan your newly inherited account to find ad groups that hold more than about 20 keywords. These are likely the groups that will require the most clean-up.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019re probably thinking, why the heck does the number of keywords matter so much? Realistically, your ad groups\u2019 keyword count won\u2019t impact performance. However, keep in mind that you\u2019re serving the same set of ads for every keyword in a given ad group. If your keyword list is huge, it is likely includes various themes, meaning you\u2019re forced to write generic ad copy.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, your goal should be to populate each ad group with a list of super-granular keywords that all share the same semantic theme. You can then create hyper-specific ads for each ad group that are truly reflective of what the searcher is looking for.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-audit-keywords.jpg\" alt=\"keyword groupings\" width=\"624\" height=\"189\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>I think we can agree that it\u2019d be way easier to write an ad for the second keyword group than the first!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Despite the best of intentions, it\u2019s easy to wind up with a few big ad groups in your account. Even if you start with small, tightly-knit keyword combinations, as more and more terms are added, your ad groups can grow to an unwieldy size. It\u2019s important to QA them regularly and move terms that aren\u2019t a good fit into new ad groups.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1Find more ways to clean up your campaigns during your PPC audit using our free guide to <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLAccountStructure.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_LastAccountStructureGuide_Download\">Google Ads Account Structure<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"ppc-ad-audit\"><\/div>\n<h2>4. Check how many ads are in each ad group<\/h2>\n<p>If the account you inherit only has one active ad in each ad group, it\u2019s an indication that the previous manager was not testing ad variations, which severely limits account optimization. On the flip side, having multiple active ads per ad group can also be detrimental. Likely, the previous owner was a testing zealot who dreamt up plenty of ad creative and tried to test it all at once (fail) or he just never bothered to <em>end<\/em> any of his tests (double fail).<\/p>\n<p>The sweet spot you should be shooting for is two to three ad variations per ad group. This is a manageable number of ads to run tests with. Once you\u2019ve identified your winner, pause the losing ad and try testing a new variation.<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-assets-audit\"><\/div>\n<h2>5. Dive into ad assets<\/h2>\n<p>If your Google Ads account doesn\u2019t have any ad assets (formerly known as ad extensions) set up, hop to it! In this day and age, ad assets are not a <em>nice to have<\/em>, they\u2019re a <em>must<\/em> for creating competitive ad copy.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/ppc-audit-google-ads-example.jpg\" alt=\"ppc audit - google ads asset examples\" width=\"729\" height=\"483\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-80658 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/ppc-audit-google-ads-example.jpg 729w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/ppc-audit-google-ads-example-480x318.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 729px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Ray-Bans has the right idea. This ad features callout and sitelink assets.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Luckily, since Google\u2019s announcement that assets officially do impact ad rank, most advertisers have gotten their act together and implemented them. However, just because these asstess <em>exist<\/em>, doesn\u2019t mean you can cross them off of your to-do list.<\/p>\n<p>Confirm that the assets running are appropriate fits for the business itself. For example, if you\u2019re using call assets, be sure that your company\u2019s phone lines are staffed to handle incoming call volume. If you don\u2019t have someone to answer incoming calls around the clock, schedule the assets to only appear during your hours of business. If you\u2019re advertising for an e-commerce company with no physical storefront, be sure to eliminate any location assets so your ads don\u2019t appear in Google Maps. Finally, check to ensure that your sitelinks, callouts and structured snippets are truly representative of your offerings and not overly repetitive.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t forget about automated assets! You can view the performance of any automated assets that Google has served alongside your ads from the assets section of Google Ads. Typically, we see that these yield positive performance but, if any appear to be negatively impacting the account, stop the bleed by opting out of them in the advanced extension options settings!<\/p>\n<div id=\"ppc-keyword-audit\"><\/div>\n<h2>6. Review keyword match type settings<\/h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/21\/how-to-run-google-ads\">well-run Google Ads\u00a0account<\/a> typically includes keywords set to a variety of <a href=\"\/match-types\">match types<\/a>. Each serves a unique purpose, for example broad match is great for<a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteBigEasyKeyword.html?cid=Web_Any_Homepage_PPC_BigEasyKeyword_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> keyword research<\/a>, while exact helps to ensure you\u2019re only connecting with the most highly-qualified searchers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/ppc-audit-keyword-match-types.jpg\" alt=\"ppc audit tools - keyword match type guide\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-80666 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/ppc-audit-keyword-match-types.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/ppc-audit-keyword-match-types-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nOne of the most common (and dangerous) account faux-pas is running all keywords on the same match type. We see this most commonly with broad match (since it is Google\u2019s default). Although these broad-match keywords yield plenty of traffic, many of their impressions are from people searching terms that are loosely related to the business, resulting in disastrous click-through and conversion rates and poor Quality Scores. Although broad match is usually the culprit for this problem, using all phrase or exact match can be just as damaging, as they may limit volume considerably.<\/p>\n<p>If the account you\u2019ve inherited is already using mixed match types, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re off the hook. Take the time to dive in and understand the previous owner\u2019s strategy and ensure that it was implemented correctly. Just because they\u2019ve attempted to enact an advanced strategy, like tiered bidding per match type, doesn\u2019t mean they did it right!<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd0d Perfect your keyword strategy using our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"ppc-audit-negative-keywords\"><\/div>\n<h2>7. QA your negative keyword lists<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/negative-keywords\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Negative keywords<\/a> are your best defense against impressions and clicks from unqualified searchers. If the previous account manager was not utilizing negatives, your work is cut out for you. You can proactively set negatives by doing some guesswork, but with an active account, I like to take more of a reactive approach. Try heading to your query reports to understand exactly what terms have been triggering your ads. Be on the lookout for terms that you do <em>not<\/em> want to continue showing for and set them as negatives.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-account-audit-Master20Negative20Keyword20List.png\" alt=\"Google Ads master negative keyword list\" width=\"704\" height=\"608\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>As you can see, we have a robust \u201cmaster list\u201d of negatives that we use for all campaigns!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If the former account manager added negatives already, review the list with a fine-toothed comb. Confirm that all of the negative terms are genuinely a good fit for the business and are not blocking impressions for any of your keywords. In addition, check your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/31\/negative-match-types\">negative keywords\u2019 match type settings<\/a> to ensure that they are operating as anticipated. I can\u2019t tell you how many accounts I\u2019ve seen with negatives set to \u201cexact\u201d match that are doing absolutely nothing for them. These settings can drastically affect the impact of your negatives.<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-do-a-ppc-audit\"><\/div>\n<h2>8.
