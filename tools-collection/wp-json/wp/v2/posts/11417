And with consumers rarely looking past the first few results when looking for a place to go, it\u2019s crucial to make sure your Google Maps listing is optimized to show up first for relevant searches.<\/p>\n<p>Research also shows that these consumers end up on Google Maps <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/listings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">business listings<\/a> from a keyword (aka \u201cdiscovery\u201d) search far more often (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/research\/google-my-business-insights-study\/#:~:text=The%20average%20business%20receives%201%2C009,the%20remaining%2016%25%20from%20direct.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">84%<\/a> of the time) than from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/23\/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name\">business name<\/a> (aka \u201cdirect\u201d) search.

Just like how there are on-page and off-page optimizations for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/13\/smb-seo-strategies-covid-19\">local website SEO<\/a>, there are on-listing and off-listing optimizations for business listing SEO. But first, you need to get listed on Google Maps and claim your listing, which we\u2019ll be covering next.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Add your business to Google Maps<\/h3>\n<p>Of course, you can\u2019t rank higher or perform successful <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/12\/03\/google-maps-marketing\">Google Maps marketing<\/a> if you don\u2019t have a Google Maps listing in the first place. If you already have one, skip this section. If you don\u2019t have a listing or are not sure, follow the steps below to add your business to Google Maps:<\/p>\n<p>1. Go to Google.com\/maps or to the Google Maps app on your smartphone and search for your business name.<\/p>\n<p>2. If it appears in the drop-down menu with a location next to it, then you have a listing! Skip to the next section.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20rank20higher20on20google20maps20listing20exists.png\" alt=\"how to rank higher on google maps listing exists\" width=\"600\" height=\"311\" \/><\/p>\n<p>3. If your business name doesn\u2019t appear, you\u2019ll see an option in the drop-down menu to \u201cadd a missing place.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20rank20higher20on20google20maps20add20missing20place20token20shop.png\" alt=\"how to rank higher on google maps add missing place token shop\" width=\"600\" height=\"383\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Once you click that, you\u2019ll be prompted to provide your name, category, and location.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20rank20higher20on20google20maps20adding20your20place20to20google20maps.png\" alt=\"how to rank higher on google maps adding your place to google maps\" width=\"800\" height=\"476\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Something to note here is that anyone in the world can add a business to Google Maps. So, even if you yourself haven\u2019t done so, it\u2019s still best to check and make sure your business listing doesn\u2019t already exist. And don\u2019t worry: No matter who it is, the person who adds your business to Google Maps does not have control over that listing. Only the one who claims the listing by proving ownership of the business has that control, which is what we\u2019ll get into next.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Claim your Google Maps business listing<\/h3>\n<p>The second step in getting your business to rank higher on Google Maps is to claim your listing. This is because when you <em>create<\/em> your listing, all you are able to provide is the name, category, and location; but when you <em>claim<\/em> your listing, you can provide many more details about your business, and the more information a business listing contains, the higher it will rank on Google Maps. Plus, you can\u2019t do any of the other steps in this guide if your listing is not claimed.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20rank20higher20on20google20maps20claimed20vs20unclaimed.png\" alt=\"how to rank higher on google maps claimed vs unclaimed\" width=\"800\" height=\"659\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The prerequisite to claiming your business listing on Google Maps is having a free <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/08\/what-is-google-my-business\">Google My Business account<\/a>. If you have an account already, simply pull up your Google Maps business listing, select the option that says \u201cClaim this business\u201d or \u201cOwn this business?\u201d and follow the prompts. If you don\u2019t have a Google My Business account, head over to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/10\/create-google-my-business-account\">this post<\/a> and we\u2019ll walk you through creating an account and claiming your business with it.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Add information to your Google Maps business listing<\/h3>\n<p>Alright, so now that you have a Google Maps business listing and a Google My Business account linked to it, you are armed and ready to optimize it for higher ranking in <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/02\/local-business-marketing-tips\">local search results<\/a>. As I mentioned earlier, the more information your listing provides, the higher it will rank in results. To add more information to your listing, log in to your Google My Business account. Here you will see a dashboard with several tabs down the side.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20rank20higher20on20google20maps20gmb20dashboard20tabs20magfied-01.png\" alt=\"how to rank higher on google maps gmb dashboard tabs magfied\" width=\"778\" height=\"526\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Select the \u201cInfo\u201d tab, which includes your name, category, address, service area (if applicable), hours, special hours, phone number, website, products, services, attributes, and description. Here are some tips for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/03\/google-my-business-optimization\">optimizing these Google My Business account sections<\/a> for higher ranking on Google Maps:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Be consistent with name and address<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Google Maps ranks businesses it can trust, and one measure of your trustworthiness is the consistency of information about your business across the web. For example, say you have a business called \u201cNorth Shore Wellness Center.\u201d Make sure your business name <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/08\/business-name-ideas\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/08\/business-name-ideas\">(creative business name ideas here!)<\/a> in your Google My Business dashboard is exactly that and not a slight variation, such as N. Shore Wellness Center or North Shore Wellness Ctr. Also, make sure this name is identical across all of your other online properties\u2014your website, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/07\/22\/yelp-reviews\">Yelp listing<\/a>, Facebook profile, and more. The same goes for address information (for example, using \u201cSt\u201d vs Street\u201d).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Use a local phone number<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Google isn\u2019t keen on toll-free (800 and 877) numbers because these types of numbers are frequently used for spam. Use a local telephone number with the area code of your location. This will help you to rank higher in Google Maps, and it will also verify for searchers that your business is located in that area.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Include your tracked <em>and<\/em> main number<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you use call tracking, use a tracked number for your primary business phone number and your main number as your secondary number. This will get most of your calls coming in through the tracked line so you can see the efficacy of your listing; but with the main number still in your listing, Google can then match your number with the one on your website and other listings.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Keep your hours updated<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Google Maps business listings tell users if that business is open, closed, or opening or closing soon. (And during the pandemic, whether it&#8217;s temporarily closed\u2014making it an <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/13\/smb-seo-strategies-covid-19\">important SEO tactic during COVID-19<\/a>.) Keeping these hours <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/09\/edit-update-google-business-listing\">updated<\/a> signals to Google that you are active and, therefore, trustworthy, and this will help with your rank. It will also prevent customers from making the trip out to your store only to find that it\u2019s closed or closing\u2014which can sometimes spark a negative review (which hurts your ranking on Google Maps).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20rank20higher20on20google20maps20keep20hours20updated20copy.png\" alt=\"how to rank higher on google map keep hours updated\" width=\"800\" height=\"698\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Be sure to also update your holiday hours so you don\u2019t get an \u201chours might differ\u201d label on your listing.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Write a business description<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The description on your Google Maps business listing should provide the big picture of your business to help orient visitors; as well as unique attributes to compel searchers. It should also be written in a tone that aligns with your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/31\/brand-voice\">brand<\/a>, to help establish a better connection. Be sure to include keywords in your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-write-a-business-description\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">business description<\/a>, as this will help your business listing on Google Maps to rank not just for searches that contain your business name, but for searches for products and services as well.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf89 <strong>Need help articulating what makes your business special?<\/strong> Get the guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLValuePropositionGuide.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_ValuePropositionGuide_Download\">How to Create a Unique Value Proposition From the Ground Up<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Properly categorize your business<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In terms of ranking, the category of your business as it appears on Google Maps is very important. For your primary category, choose the one that best represents the core offering of your business. If any other categories apply, choose them as secondary categories.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20rank20higher20on20google20maps20choose20a20category20blurred20name.png\" alt=\"how to rank higher on google maps choose a category blurred name\" width=\"800\" height=\"526\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>To rank higher in Google Maps, choose primary and additional categories through your Google My Business dashboard.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that you cannot add custom categories, but if you begin typing your main offering into the box, you\u2019ll see a drop-down menu of possible categories to choose from.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Add photos to your Google Maps business listing<\/h3>\n<p>Google loves it when you upload photos to your listing. First, because it signals that you are an active listing worthy of ranking higher in results. Second, because Google\u2019s photo-recognition technology is advancing and Google is starting to show images in local search results. And third, because the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/12\/local-seo\">SEO rule of thumb <\/a>is that Google loves what consumers love, and consumers love photos. Plus, if you don\u2019t add photos to your listing, it will show a generic map image like this:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps-photo.png\" alt=\"how to rank higher on google maps - screenshot of listings with photos\" width=\"600\" height=\"433\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-60001\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps-photo.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps-photo-480x346.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Google Maps business listings without photos are less appealing to consumers and may not rank as high as listings with photos.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>So, to improve your Google Maps ranking, upload high-quality and compelling photos to your business listing that captures what it\u2019s like to be at your business. You do this by going to the \u201cPhotos\u201d tab in your Google My Business dashboard and click on the blue circle with a white plus sign. From there, you\u2019ll be able to drag and drop several photos and\/or videos at once. Ideally, you should strive to add at least one new photo a day.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Get Google reviews<\/h3>\n<p>Knowing that Google loves what customers love, it should be no surprise that Google Maps gives ranking favor to business listings with positive reviews. So <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/16\/get-more-google-reviews\">how do you get more Google reviews<\/a>? Well, when you create a business listing on Google Maps, this automatically opens your business up to reviews.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps-reviews.png\" alt=\"how to rank higher on google maps - gmb review ranking factors\" width=\"555\" height=\"507\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-60002\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps-reviews.png 555w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps-reviews-480x439.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 555px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll get them. You\u2019ll need to be proactive in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">asking for reviews<\/a>, and you\u2019ll also need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/06\/online-reputation-management\">respond to them<\/a>. Responding to reviews encourages more of them and mitigates the damage of negative reviews. Plus, your responses show other prospects how attentive you are to customers and how well you resolve issues.<\/p>\n<p>Reviews can be scary, but unless your service is truly atrocious, bad reviews tend to be few and far between. Plus, as long as you respond properly you can mitigate and even reverse the damage of a negative review.<\/p>\n<p>\u2b50\ufe0f <strong>Get all the tips you need to collect more reviews in this free guide download &gt;&gt;<\/strong>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/how-to-get-more-reviews?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_howtogetreviews_Download&amp;itm_source=localiq&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\">How to Get More Reviews: 8 Tips to Boost Ranking, Reputation, &amp; Revenue<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>6.

Post regularly to your Google Maps business listing<\/h3>\n<p>Like Facebook, you can publish posts that appear right on your Google Maps business listing. Regularly posting like this sends signals to Google that you proactively manage your listing, which it considers when ranking. In addition, when consumers are on search engines, they have high intent, so through Google posts, you can get your offers in front of a ready-to-engage audience.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20rank20higher20on20google20maps20post20using20google20my20business.png\" alt=\"how to rank higher on google maps post using google my business\" width=\"800\" height=\"559\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Create posts in your Google My Business dashboard to appear on your business listing and to tell Google you are active.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>How to use your website to rank higher on Google Maps<\/h2>\n<p>In addition to taking action directly on your business listing, there are some optimizations you can perform on your website to support higher Google Maps ranking.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Make sure your website is responsive<\/h3>\n<p>The first is to make sure your website is responsive, which means that it functions consistently across any device or screen size. This is because Google Maps business listings contain a link to your website, and nearly<a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/report-nearly-60-percent-searches-now-mobile-devices-255025#:~:text=According%20to%20official%20Google%20statements,it%20varies%20significantly%20by%20country.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> 60%<\/a> of Google searches occur on mobile devices. So if your listing takes searchers to a website that requires pinching and zooming, has broken links, or is slow to load, your Google Maps ranking will suffer.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Add local keywords to your website<\/h3>\n<p>The second way to use your website to boost your Google Maps ranking is to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2011\/12\/27\/eleven-seo-tips-for-local-search-optimization\">target it for local search<\/a>. Of course, this will help your website to rank higher in Google Search, but may also influence how high your Google Maps business listing ranks. So be sure to incorporate location-based keywords to the main pages of your site, such as the homepage, about us page, contact us page, products and services page, and even blog posts\u2014and not just to the title of the pages, but also to the headings, body text, image tags, captions, and URLs.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20rank20higher20on20google20maps20target20your20website.png\" alt=\"how to rank higher on google maps target your website\" width=\"800\" height=\"437\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Emphasizing to Google through your website that you are prominent in your local area can help Google to feel more confident in ranking your business listing on Google Maps for that area as well.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Embed a Google map on your website<\/h3>\n<p>Another way to rank higher on Google Maps is to embed a Google map on your website, which most businesses do on the contact us page. Embedding a Google map is just another way of telling Google that your business is located where your listing says it is.
