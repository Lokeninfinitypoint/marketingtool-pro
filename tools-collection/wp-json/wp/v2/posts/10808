Eligibility will differ depending on if you want to use dynamic ads for remarketing and what industry your account is in. To help you get started with this helpful feature of Google Ads, I\u2019m going to walk you through the basics for campaign setup. We&#8217;ll cover:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Eligibility requirements for dynamic display ads on Google.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">How to set up your dynamic display campaign in Google Ads.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">How to create the\u00a0dynamic feed required for these types of ads.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">I\u2019ll also cover the limitations, templates, and common issues that occur with feeds\u00a0so you can have a clear path to dynamic display ad success. Let&#8217;s begin.<\/span><\/p>\n<h1>Can my Google Ads account use dynamic display ads?<\/h1>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This is a good question we need to answer right away. Certain website and app categories are not allowed to use dynamic display. If your website or app falls under any of these categories, you will not be able to use <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/04\/01\/dynamic-remarketing\">dynamic remarketing audiences<\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Personal hardship:\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">Google is trying to avoid reminding users of any difficult times they may be going through. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Identity and belief:\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">Anything possibly related to potential stigmas, discrimination, prejudices, or other classifications along those lines. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Sexual interests:\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">Because these experiences are extremely private, all sexually explicit ads are prohibited.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Access to opportunities:\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">Starting Oct. 19, 2020, any ads appearing to target specific audiences impacted by societal bias may be rejected. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Alcohol:\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">Any ads that show or even just resemble alcoholic beverages. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Gambling:\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">Whether it\u2019s online or physical casinos, any ads promoting gambling are not allowed to use dynamic remarketing.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Clinical trial recruitment:\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">Ad copy in this category must be highly precise.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Restricted drug terms:\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">If the drugs are only for animal use, then they may be accepted.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Users under the age of 13: <\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\">As you might expect, there too much room for error in this category.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If you don\u2019t fall into any of the categories just listed, your account is most likely okay to move on and start using dynamic remarketing. Now let us go through the campaign setup in Google Ads. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20set20up20dynamic20display20ads20how20dynamic20remarketing20works.png\" alt=\"how to set up dynamic display ads how dynamic remarketing works\" width=\"800\" height=\"237\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.adwordsrobot.com\/en\/dynamic-remarketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h1>How to set up a dynamic display ad campaign<\/h1>\n<p>When creating a new campaign, choose the \u201cSales\u201d campaign goal objective. As mentioned in the intro of this post, dynamic advertising is only available on the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/18\/google-display-network-tips\">Display Network<\/a> so choose \u201cDisplay\u201d as your campaign type. Then for a subtype, the only option allowing dynamic remarketing is \u201cStandard display campaign.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20set20up20dynamic20display20ads20setting20for20google20dynamic20remarketing20campaign.png\" alt=\"how to set up dynamic display ads\u2014the campaign creation options tab\" width=\"798\" height=\"883\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As for the rest of the process, set your account up as you would\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/23\/google-display-ads\">set up any\u00a0other Display Network campaign<\/a>, but there\u00a0will be an additional area in\u00a0Settings you&#8217;ll want to find. First, find the \u201cDynamic ads\u201d section. Next, click on the checkbox asking if you want to \u201cUse dynamic ads feed for personalized ads.\u201d You will then get a selection box with the following options:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google20dynamic20display20ads20setting20up20your20google20remarketing20campaign.png\" alt=\"google dynamic display ads \u2014 the &quot;use dynamic ads feed for personalized ad&quot; box is checked\" width=\"800\" height=\"343\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Pick whichever business type aligns with your account. If you do not see an option that fits with your account, you can easily choose the \u201cOther\u201d option. Last, if you are already running Shopping campaigns, you will also see the option to sync a feed that you already have linked from the Google Merchant Center. Finish the rest of your ad group set up, then it will be time to work on setting up your feed.<\/p>\n<h1>How to create a\u00a0feed for your dynamic display ads<\/h1>\n<p>Feeds are an absolute necessity if you want to run any dynamic remarketing in Google Ads. If you do not have a feed, then you will not be able to create a dynamic ad. Pretty straightforward there. Again, retail accounts running <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/14\/google-shopping-ads\">Shopping campaigns<\/a> will already be a step ahead because most likely you have your product feed(s) created in <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/18\/google-merchant-center\">Merchant Center<\/a>. For any of the other industries seen in the last image, you will need to use one of the feed templates for your business type. Before I share the business feed templates, there are some limitations we need to be aware of.<\/p>\n<h2>Feed limitations<\/h2>\n<p>Per Google Ads\u2019 policies, there are limitations to how many and how large your feeds can be. Here are the three feed limit rules currently in place at the time this post was written:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>There can only be 5 million rows or feed items per account. Keep in mind this isn\u2019t just for dynamic remarketing. The feed item total also includes extension and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/08\/18\/ad-customizers\">ad customizer<\/a> feeds.<\/li>\n<li>There can only be 100 user-generated or business data feeds per ad account.<\/li>\n<li>Each attribute within your feeds needs to be 3,000 bytes or less. (Google says this is roughly 750-3,000 characters depending on which characters you are using)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Feed templates<\/h2>\n<p>Depending on which industry you chose in the campaign set up, you will need to use the proper business type feed template. Each business type feed has different attributes, so yes, the template does matter. Last, if you chose \u201cOther\u201d as your business type, you can create a custom feed to use in your ads. Below you will find the direct download links for each of the Google Ads business types.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gstatic.com\/adextensions\/education-feed-template.csv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Education<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gstatic.com\/adextensions\/flights-feed-template.csv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Flights<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gstatic.com\/adextensions\/hotels-and-rentals-feed-template.csv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hotels and rentals<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gstatic.com\/adextensions\/jobs-feed-template.csv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jobs<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gstatic.com\/adextensions\/local-deals-feed-template.csv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Local deals<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gstatic.com\/adextensions\/real-estate-feed-template.csv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Real estate<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Retail &#8211; Link your product feeds via the Google Merchant Center<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gstatic.com\/adextensions\/travel-feed-template.csv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Travel<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gstatic.com\/adextensions\/custom-feed-template.csv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Custom template<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Rather than go in-depth\u00a0into every business type feed, I will choose one industry just so we can see an <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/02\/banner-ads-examples\">ad example<\/a> later on. I chose the Education template using my <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/26\/marketing-strategies-college-students\">alma mater<\/a> just for fun. They are not a client.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20set20up20dynamic20display20ads20feed20example.png\" alt=\"how to set up dynamic display ads\u2014feed template example\" width=\"800\" height=\"70\" \/><\/div>\n<p>There will be a default example for every template you download as well as extra rows to guide you on the set up. Once your feed is filled out and is ready to be submitted, it is time to head back into Google Ads.

Then name your feed. Then you are ready to upload. You will then be taken back to the main Data feeds page. With a simple refresh, you should be able to see your feed in the list. Now let me show you how this feed may look in an ad.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RELATED:<\/strong> Find out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/17\/dynamic-remarketing-for-retail\">how to set up dynamic remarketing for retail<\/a> here.<\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">Why is my dynamic display data feed not working?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>There are a few reasons why your feed could be disapproved. Here are some common reasons for you to check if you are getting flagged for feed errors.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>If your feed is not formatted properly or you are going over the byte limits mentioned earlier in this post.<\/li>\n<li>If you did not add information into the fields under required attribute columns, that will definitely flag an error with your feed.<\/li>\n<li>You also need to make sure your fields are formatted properly. The example in each feed template will give you information on format (price, airport codes, and many more).<\/li>\n<li>A URL may be invalid. Whether it\u2019s a Final URL or an image URL, make sure every one entered into a feed is working.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>There are a few other reasons why your feed comes back with errors, but these are some common ones I have run into. Your feed could come back with errors a few hours after submitting. You can edit the feed directly in Google Ads or update your original feed and reupload into the channel.<\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">Using data feeds in dynamic ads<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>You are probably expecting this massive, long section on how these <a href=\"\/online-ads\">ad formats<\/a> are going to be completely different than anything you have ever created. Well I hate to disappoint you because that is not the case. The main structure of a dynamic ad is really a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/22\/maximize-ROI-with-responsive-search-ads\">responsive<\/a> display ad. Your data feed is just an additional feature added to the ad.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20set20up20google20dynamic20display20ads20feed20attached20to20ad.png\" alt=\"how to set up google dynamic display ads feed attached to ad\" width=\"383\" height=\"76\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Since your data feed was applied to the ad group, there is nothing you need to do to the ad itself. Create your responsive display ad like you normally would. You will need your <a href=\"\/press\/shutterstock-integration\">marketing images<\/a> and logo images. You will need to add short (up to 5) and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/02\/ppc-ad-headlines\">long headlines<\/a> as well as <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/06\/26\/product-descriptions\">descriptions<\/a> (also up to 5). You can possibly add videos from YouTube to make the ad more engaging if it makes sense.

Using dynamic feeds for products or services can be a great way to reconnect with users and showcase items or pages that are familiar to your previous visitors. Even if your account\u2019s industry does not fall under one of the main business types mentioned in this post, take some time to review custom feed formats. You can always create a feed that best fits your account (even if you fall under one of the default business types). Layering on an ad message that can speak to your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/16\/engagement-ads\">target audience<\/a> with a familiar feed of products or services can help improve the performance from your Display campaigns from both an engagement and conversion success metric.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dynamic display ads are a great way to advertise previously viewed products by your website visitors.
