However, a good rule of thumb is that<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/19\/digital-marketing-statistics\"> 5-10%<\/a> of your revenue should go towards your marketing budget. For larger businesses, that number could climb to 14% or higher.<\/p>\n<h3>Audience<\/h3>\n<p>Picture your ideal customer when you\u2019re picking your channels.

This will allow you to still be using multiple channels to see what works, as opposed to only using one or two, and you can always add on from there.<br \/>\n<a id=\"implementation\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>How to create a cross-channel marketing strategy<\/h2>\n<p>You might be wondering: is cross-channel marketing easy to achieve? Short answer: yes. You<em> can<\/em> do it all! Here are our ten tips to finding cross-channel marketing success for your business:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Map out your customer journey<\/h3>\n<p>Before you dive into cross-channel marketing, it\u2019s important to get a bird\u2019s eye view of your sales funnel. Understanding your consumers\u2019 behavior at each step of the buyer\u2019s journey will help you to identify which offers best align with each stage.<\/p>\n<p>Look at historical data and information your business may have on how past customers may have converted. You could also leverage your audience analysis to put yourself in your customers\u2019 shoes and brainstorm the steps they may take to ultimately commit to your business.<\/p>\n<p>Not only will this help you tailor your cross-channel marketing to specific scenarios throughout the customer journey, but it will also help you to narrow down which channels are best (more on this next).<\/p>\n<h3>2. Have an offer funnel<\/h3>\n<p>The key to cross-channel marketing is aligning your offers with each stage of the funnel. Someone at the top of your funnel is more likely to be open to a guide on how to do something than a demo on how to use your product. Or even within the guide category, they may be more receptive to a high-level overview on something than a more technical one on ways to do it.<\/p>\n<p>So be sure to map out different offers and topics to the stages of your customer journey. This will look different for every business, but here&#8217;s a loose example:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/cross-channel-marketing-offer-funnel.png\" alt=\"corss-channel marketing offer funnel\" width=\"421\" height=\"467\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-62187\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>3. Choose your channels<\/h3>\n<p>Using our guidelines above may have helped you narrow down the <em>number<\/em> of channels you\u2019ll be looking to use, so now it\u2019s a matter of <em>which<\/em> channels. Here at WordStream, we believe in working smarter, not harder. Your best bet would be to pick channels that will work better together to maximize your results.<\/p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/22\/combine-ppc-with-social-media\">search marketing and social media marketing<\/a> complement one another. When someone sees your posts pop up on social, that may trigger them to search for you later to learn more.<\/p>\n<p>Think back to your ideal <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/23\/buyer-personas\">buyer persona<\/a> to understand which channels they may be hitting the most frequently, and that should help you uncover which ones are best for your business.<\/p>\n<p>To help get you started, here are some possible channels to consider:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/website-grader\/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Website<\/a><\/li>\n<li>SEO<\/li>\n<li>PPC<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/social-media-marketing\">Social media marketing<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Social media advertising<\/li>\n<li>Display advertising<\/li>\n<li>Remarketing<\/li>\n<li>Print ads<\/li>\n<li>Email marketing<\/li>\n<li>Mailers<\/li>\n<li>Geofencing<\/li>\n<li>Live chat<\/li>\n<li>Messaging apps<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/09\/what-ott-advertising\">OTT advertising<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Video marketing<\/li>\n<li>Content marketing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/cross-channel-marketing-channels-list.jpg\" alt=\"cross-channel marketing - chart of channels to consider for a cross-channel marketing strategy\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-62135 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/cross-channel-marketing-channels-list.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/cross-channel-marketing-channels-list-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>4. Take inventory of your costs<\/h3>\n<p>Be ready to be flexible with your budget as you implement cross-channel marketing. The performance of your channels might ebb and flow, so you may need to reallocate your budgets accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>To help you get a sense of how much to spend on each channel, use<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/18\/search-advertising-benchmarks\"> industry benchmarks<\/a> to estimate costs. Check in on these reports frequently to troubleshoot your spend or to see how your business stacks up throughout your marketing journey.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe height=\"644\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" title=\"Search Advertising Benchmarks\" aria-label=\"Column Chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-yhYoP\" src=\"https:\/\/datawrapper.dwcdn.net\/yhYoP\/2\/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><script type=\"text\/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();<\/script><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Using industry benchmarks<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/online-advertising-benchmarks\"><em> like these <\/em><\/a><em>can help you keep your cross-channel budget in check.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>5. Have a set of overarching goals<\/h3>\n<p>While each channel may achieve different things, having a couple of \u201cbig picture\u201d goals can help you to unify your efforts. It can be easy to get bogged down in the deep performance details of each channel. Overarching goals help to hold yourself accountable for keeping your channels on track for success.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Use a CRM<\/h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/09\/crm-for-small-business\">customer relationship management<\/a> (CRM) tool can work wonders for your cross-channel marketing. As your prospects\u2019 behavior evolves, a CRM will allow you to track those changes and recognize broader trends in the customer journey. It will also make it easy for you to segment your campaign audiences so you can customize your offers.<\/p>\n<p>CRMs can also make major cross-channel initiatives, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/17\/retargeting-campaign-tips\">retargeting<\/a>, a breeze.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Use retargeting<\/h3>\n<p>Speaking of which, retargeting is a must-have for any cross-channel marketing strategy. There are a number of<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/17\/remarketing-audiences\"> retargeting audiences<\/a> you can try out. For example, you might run a retargeting Facebook ad for a product that someone added to their cart but did not purchase. Or you might run a specific promotion for your most loyal customers.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Button up your tracking<\/h3>\n<p>Be sure you implement tracking parameters across every channel you leverage in your cross-channel marketing strategy. Not only will this allow you to see how each channel, offer, and placement is working, but it will also allow you to set rules in your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/05\/b2b-marketing-automation-tactics\">marketing automation<\/a>. For example, if a person downloads guide X, show them thank you page A with offer B.<\/p>\n<p>The naming convention you use for tracking is completely up to you\u2014what\u2019s most important is you have an easy and reliable way to consistently know how your performance is pacing across channels.<\/p>\n<p>And on a related note, make sure you resolve all your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/24\/google-ads-conversion-tracking\">conversion tracking hangups<\/a> for search engine marketing as this can make or break your campaigns.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Use multi-touch attribution<\/h3>\n<p>Attribution modeling determines how the different channels involved in a customer\u2019s journey will be credited.<\/p>\n<p>For cross-channel marketing, it\u2019s best to go with one that falls under the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/15\/multi-touch-attribution\">multi-touch attribution <\/a>umbrella. Since you\u2019ll be encouraging customers to take specific actions across channels, you\u2019ll want to see the impact your campaigns have on the entire customer journey.
