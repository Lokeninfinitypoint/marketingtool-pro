Usually, someone who types \u201cbuy fine point Sharpie pens\u201d into Google is on the hunt for some insanely dope, reasonably priced writing utensils. But on Facebook, while a ludicrous array of information can be leveraged to create hyper-granular audiences, the intent component <em>usually<\/em> isn\u2019t there.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, Facebook doesn\u2019t even offer keyword targeting. You have to define an audience to show your ads to.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6b53a5b6-2017-4290-b6f3-955b75a827eb\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-audience-creation.jpg\" alt=\"facebook audience creation broad vs specific\" width=\"700\" height=\"209\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Now, this doesn\u2019t mean that Facebook advertising isn\u2019t useful. Quite the opposite. It\u2019s a wellspring of opportunity for B2C and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/25\/b2b-facebook-advertising\">B2B advertisers<\/a> alike. Facebook allows you to get reasonably interested eyeballs on your product or service and nurture them through dynamic, engaging content from initial exposure until the day you can close a deal (sell a widget, etc.). It\u2019s amazing for building brand awareness and feeding your funnel.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, doing so effectively requires a nuanced understanding of <em>who<\/em> you\u2019re targeting and, more importantly, <strong>how you\u2019re targeting them. <\/strong>This means striking a balance between broad and specific audiences, effectively turning your Facebook advertising efforts into a self-contained marketing funnel.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a closer look at what I mean by \u201cbroad\u201d and \u201cspecific\u201d audiences.<\/p>\n<h2>Targeting Broad Audiences with Facebook Ads: Best for New Campaigns, Brand Awareness, &amp; Gathering Data<\/h2>\n<p>You<em> can<\/em> use Facebook ads to target all two billion (and counting) users with a single offer. This is not what I mean by \u201ctargeting broad audiences.\u201d This is just \u201cdumb.\u201d Instead, I\u2019m referring to using core audiences\u2014those created using Facebook\u2019s suite of targeting options\u2014to put your brand in front of new prospects.

Simple: you just gotta trust Zuck.<\/p>\n<p>Targeting broadly gives Facebook a good chunk of power. It requires that you trust one of the planet\u2019s wealthiest entities (in terms of straight cash <em>and<\/em> user data) to algorithmically determine which subsets of humanity could be a fit for your product or service. While it can be scary to cast a wide net, this approach can help you find potential customers you\u2019d never have known existed otherwise. You can also use the data you glean from broad audience targeting to formulate more specific audiences further down the funnel.<\/p>\n<p>Targeting broadly then digging into Audience Insights\u2014check out <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/facebook-insights-create-audience-personas-budget\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this killer post from Moz<\/a> about using this resource to create audience personas\u2014and your reporting will allow you to paint a better picture of the Facebook users who interact with your ads in a positive way.

You\u2019re going to use it to <em>inform the creation of more targeted audiences<\/em> to whom you\u2019ll advertise with engaging, audience specific ad creative. Think of this wide but informed net as the Facebook equivalent of the Display network or a well-placed billboard. Pairing this information gathering\/brand building strategy with more sales-centric targeting further down the funnel will help you to create a steady stream of prospects for your business. It shouldn\u2019t occupy a large portion of your overall advertising budget, but allocating a small percentage of your Facebook spend to broad audiences like this one will allow your business to benefit from the intelligence of Facebook\u2019s advertising algorithm.<\/p>\n<h3>Who should target broadly on Facebook?<\/h3>\n<p>Everyone!<\/p>\n<p>Provided you\u2019re not ballin\u2019 on an extremely tight budget, broad audience targeting will expose your brand to net-new prospects: people who\u2019d never have known about you otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, your ad and offer need to align with your broad audiences\u2019 lack of intent. Your goal here isn\u2019t to sell a hat or close a deal <em>today<\/em>: it\u2019s to gain exposure and fill your funnel. From there, you can create new core and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/12\/11\/facebook-custom-audience-strategy\">custom audiences<\/a>, steering Facebook users towards making a purchase as you learn more about their characteristics, wants, and needs.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"fcae15c8-3b32-40c6-a227-86126f25a769\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/uncover-ideal-audiences-facebook.png\" alt=\"uncovering your ideal facebook audience\" width=\"427\" height=\"276\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Even though you\u2019ll likely see higher engagement using broad targeting (simply due to the number of folks you\u2019ll reach), the majority of your Facebook advertising budget should still be assigned to targeted audiences that can be tied to actual business value. Speaking of\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>Targeting Specific Audiences with Facebook Ads: Best for Driving Cost-Effective Conversions<\/h2>\n<p>Targeting specifically means, well, just that.<\/p>\n<p>You give Facebook a strict set of parameters. They serve your ad creative to a smaller subset of users than you\u2019d reach with broader targeting. They purchase your wares.

This is why it\u2019s so important to pair broad and specific audiences, using the former to funnel new prospects towards the latter.<\/p>\n<h3>Specific Facebook Audience Targeting in Action<\/h3>\n<p>As you already know, there are an uncountable number of ways through which you can define an audience in Facebook. \u201cSpecific\u201d does not explicitly refer to the use of custom or lookalike audiences but, rather, a well-defined set of Facebook users. Basically, anything that takes control away from Facebook and can ratchet this:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"e6865879-d6cb-4381-a3f2-699649217ef0\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-underdefined-audience-reach.png\" alt=\"underdefined facebook audience too much reach\" width=\"340\" height=\"168\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Down to this:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6d3d811c-80c4-4047-b1aa-cd53773bae85\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-defined-audience-reach.png\" alt=\"well defined facebook audience\" width=\"344\" height=\"169\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Can be defined as \u201cspecific\u201d audience targeting. The three main ways to accomplish this are using layered targeting, custom audiences, and lookalike audiences.<\/p>\n<h3>Layered Targeting<\/h3>\n<p>Facebook allows you to layer myriad targeting options on top of one another to create new, granular core audiences.<\/p>\n<p>The advantage of doing so is obvious: you can tailor your ad creative to the overlapping characteristics of small audiences to show prospects how your product or service addresses a specific need.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"95f26728-993d-49a9-9c89-43598d5e92ac\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-layered-audiences-specificity.jpg\" alt=\"facebook layered audience targeting\" width=\"600\" height=\"203\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>For example, if you sell homeowners insurance, you\u2019ll want to target people who purchased a home recently. But more specifically, you can use layered audience to create variations of the new homeowner audience based on characteristics like home type (apartment, condo, single family, multifamily), home value, and household composition.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f7360c72-58fb-40aa-ac39-23e257c837a7\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ad-home-insurance-example.jpg\" alt=\"facebook ad targeted using layered audiences\" width=\"457\" height=\"463\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>This ad, for example, would be great for folks who\u2019d just bought a bungalow, but completely wasted on apartment-dwellers.<\/p>\n<p>By breaking recent home buyers into segments using layered targeting, you can serve completely different ads to the pair of twenty-somethings buying a one bedroom apartment in Brooklyn, the Midwestern family of eight, and the recent divorcee with a beachfront condo in Malibu. This persona-specific creative can be an excellent way to account for Facebook\u2019s lack of intent, bolstering conversions in the middle of your sales funnel.<\/p>\n<h3>Custom Audiences<\/h3>\n<p>Facebook\u2019s core targeting options can feel limitless but sometimes, the best way to create an audience isn\u2019t through latent characteristics. What\u2019s better?<\/p>\n<p>Action, people. Action.<\/p>\n<p>Custom audiences allow you to target Facebook users based on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Customer file (email addresses you upload)<\/li>\n<li>Website traffic (provided the Facebook Pixel is on your website)<\/li>\n<li>App activity (pretend this doesn\u2019t exist)<\/li>\n<li>Engagement (explicit action taken on either Facebook or Instagram)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Of the four possible sources for custom audiences, the most valuable are, without a doubt, customer file and website traffic. (Note that custom audiences are often the smallest audiences you can create on Facebook. This makes it difficult for Facebook to serve your ads unless they attain supreme levels of engagement among your audience\u2014as reflected in your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/14\/facebook-relevance-score\">Facebook ads\u2019 relevance scores<\/a>)<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"52b7236d-83be-4cee-a775-fb94a61293cd\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ad-custome-audience-sources.png\" alt=\"custom audiences facebook\" width=\"548\" height=\"518\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The \u201ccustomer\u201d component of customer file audiences is, uh, negotiable. You could feasibly upload any email list and reach Facebook users whose email credentials match. Use these custom audiences to upsell existing customers, offer a product demo to people who downloaded a specific piece of content: the possibilities are endless. Ditto for custom audiences generated based on website traffic; use Google Analytics to determine which pages people tend to visit, ensure the Facebook Pixel is on those pages, create an audience, and serve creative that elaborates on the content prospects viewed.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s like shooting fish in a barrel.<\/p>\n<h3>Lookalike Audiences<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"\/facebook-lookalike-audiences\">Facebook lookalike audiences<\/a> are the cream cheese frosting atop the nut-packed carrot cake that is Facebook advertising. This is fact, not opinion.<\/p>\n<p>While custom audiences are generally limited\u2014since you need to upload a list or supply users based on on-site in-app actions completed\u2014lookalikes are simply aggregated users whose characteristics mirror those of a selected source audience. The degree to which they match can be altered (with 1% representing a near-facsimile and 10% being more like a second cousin).<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"78e18257-f64b-485c-bca6-0c362658ecab\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ad-lookalike-audiences-seeding.png\" alt=\"facebook ad lookalike audience with seeding\" width=\"650\" height=\"246\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The \u201csource audience\u201d for your lookalikes can be any Facebook audience you\u2019ve already created; to maximize their value, though, you should use converters (based on the Facebook Pixel) or customer email addresses.\u00a0 It\u2019s no use to create a lookalike of people who, after seeing an ad as a member of one of your broader audiences, have told you to [expletive] yourself.<\/p>\n<h3>Who should use specific audience targeting on Facebook?<\/h3>\n<p>Everyone (for real this time, though)!<\/p>\n<p>Lookalike audiences are one of the most effective ways to derive immediate value from Facebook ads. Layered audiences are a great way to glean some value from Facebook\u2019s inherent intelligence without spending a ton of cash. And custom audiences are the perfect way to implement mid and lower funnel audiences into your Facebook advertising strategy.<\/p>\n<p>***<\/p>\n<p>Now that you\u2019ve got a handle on the differences between broad and specific Facebook audience targeting, here are three tips to help you use them both more effectively.<\/p>\n<h2>Tip #1: Achieve (and Act On) Statistical Significance ASAP<\/h2>\n<p>Statistical significance refers to the point at which you\u2019ve accrued enough data to make an educated decision regarding performance. It\u2019s integral for both broad and specific audiences, but for vastly different reasons.<\/p>\n<p>With broad audiences, you need to determine and act on statistical significance quickly to avoid hemorrhaging ad spend on massive swaths of tangentially interested Facebook users. This is where <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ads\/audience_insights\">Audience Insights<\/a> can really become an invaluable tool in your arsenal.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6cb468a6-376f-4a5c-9121-cb263ce8accc\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-audience-insights-example.png\" alt=\"facebook audience insights\" width=\"691\" height=\"761\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>When it comes to your more specific audiences\u2014the ones that stand to garner conversions <em>quickly<\/em>\u2014tweaking your targeting and ad creative based on performance will allow you to ensure that small, valuable audiences aren\u2019t growing frustrated with your efforts. This is the best way to determine whether an audience is working or not and, subsequently, begin the never-ending process of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/28\/facebook-advertising-benchmarks\">Facebook conversion rate<\/a> optimization.<\/p>\n<p>Now, it can be tempting to split your campaigns into dozens of ad sets based on this information. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/121933141221852\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">According to Facebook<\/a>, this is a big no-no:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to segment your campaign into many small ad sets to see which one performs best and then use that as a model for future ad sets. However, with that many ad sets, you&#8217;re unlikely to get a statistically significant number of results for any one of them anyway.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Too broad and you\u2019re white noise. Too narrow and significance is unattainable. Instead, use engagement data from broad and specific audiences to inform your ad creative. If something flat-out isn\u2019t working, use those Audience Insights to tweak your targeting and reengage your prospects.<\/p>\n<h2>Tip #2: Base Lookalike Audiences on EXTREMELY Valuable Sources<\/h2>\n<p>As I touched on earlier, sources like post comments, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/16\/facebook-business-page\">Facebook business page<\/a> engagement, or random email addresses scrawled in a notebook you found in a TGI Fridays are not viable foundations for your <a href=\"\/facebook-lookalike-audiences\">Facebook lookalike audiences<\/a>. There\u2019s no way of knowing whether their characteristics represent discernable business value that you\u2019d like to mirror. But that\u2019s not the only issue. Lookalike audiences tend to be smaller than the broad, core audiences we talked about a thousand words or so ago.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5b99a01c-f5e4-4361-a4c5-83bf3babd8da\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-equals-money.png\" alt=\"facebook ads make money when you understand the value of targeting\" width=\"491\" height=\"169\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>As such, their use can hamstring Facebook\u2019s ability to serve your ads to the most relevant users in each audience. This isn\u2019t a problem if you <em>know<\/em> most of an audience is comprised of bona fide prospects, but don\u2019t hustle backwards when you can avoid it. Instead, use the most valuable sources you\u2019ve got to create lookalike audiences. Leverage the Facebook Pixel and proprietary data from your CRM to distinguish between your \u201coh neat, a link [click] eh\u201d people and those who have already paid for your product or service.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re an experienced advertiser with boatloads of data, you can take this discerning attitude a step further. Distinguish between customers and <em>great<\/em> customers (top spenders, etc.) and make lookalike audiences of <em>both<\/em> groups. The former can function as a broad audience. The latter, a specific audience. As soon as they populate, you\u2019re cookin\u2019 with gas.<\/p>\n<h2>Tip #3: Quality Is More Important than Size (Particularly with Custom Audiences)<\/h2>\n<p>This ties in with my last point, but it\u2019s worth repeating: quality beats quantity. Period. One key way of determining quality (outside of, you know, conversions and revenue) is by checking Relevance Scores.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5f4376cf-99dc-4ac5-8d5f-19012375e1b0\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-relevance-score-audience-targeting.png\" alt=\"relationship between relevance score and audience in facebook\" width=\"758\" height=\"498\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/14\/facebook-relevance-score\">Relevance Score<\/a> is Facebook\u2019s measure of the quality and engagement level of your ads.
