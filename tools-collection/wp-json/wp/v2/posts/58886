This is the maximum amount you\u2019re willing to pay for a click on that keyword\u2019s ad. It\u2019s important to know that this isn\u2019t necessarily what you will actually pay\u2014it could be less, but never more (more on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/14\/how-does-google-ads-work\">how the Google Ads auction works here<\/a>). This strategy gives you total control, but be careful, as setting your bid too low could limit your performance.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Automated bidding:<\/strong> With an automated bidding strategy, you\u2019ll let Google determine your max CPC bids for a bit. Just keep an eye on the data to get an idea of how much clicks will cost.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I\u2019ll use a personal anecdote to explain why automated bidding would be helpful. When I first started snowboarding, I had the rental shop pick my gear because I had no idea how I\u2019d handle different types of terrain or what my personal preferences would be. Now that I have experience, I use a specific type of board because I know what works for me. Automated bidding is just like that.

By default, Google will prefer the best-performing ads.

With the right match types, you can save yourself the headache and keep your keyword count to the bare minimum.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Match types<\/h3>\n<p>When you input your keywords, you\u2019ll also need to indicate which match type you want. This is because there are many searches a person could perform (called queries) that aren\u2019t identical\u2014but are still super relevant to\u2014 your keywords. Match types help Google understand which of these variations of your keyword you\u2019re looking your ads to show for.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll want to mix up your match types to give yourself flexibility. Here are the three match types from least to most restrictive:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Broad match:<\/strong> allows your ad to show for any query that relates to your keyword.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Phrase match:<\/strong> picks up queries that include the same meaning as your keyword.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Exact match: <\/strong>only allows your ad to show when a query has an identical meaning to your query.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/keyword-match-type-chart.webp\" alt=\"keyword match types in google ads\" width=\"722\" height=\"477\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87112 size-full\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Pro tip: <\/strong>There is no right or wrong match type, as these will depend on your goals. My best advice is to try out all three and see what works best when <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2010\/04\/14\/keyword-optimization\">optimizing your keywords<\/a>. If you\u2019re completely unsure, though, phrase match is a safe bet.

(Negative keywords)<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/06\/negative-keyword-guide\">Negative keywords<\/a> are terms you select that you don\u2019t want your ads to show for. For example, if I\u2019m advertising CDL classes, the term \u201cCDL\u201d could easily apply to folks looking for jobs within the industry. SoI might negate \u201cjobs,\u201d \u201cpositions,\u201d and \u201copenings\u201d to avoid people looking for jobs rather than education.<\/p>\n<p>You should have some negative keywords to start, and once you\u2019re up and running, you can use the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/16\/google-ads-search-terms-report-changes\">Search Terms Report<\/a> to see which queries you\u2019ve shown for and build your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/04\/negative-keyword-list\">negative keyword list<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"create-your-ad\"><\/div>\n<h2>Step #9: Create your ad<\/h2>\n<h3><em>Plating presentation<\/em><\/h3>\n<p>Alright, everything is prepared and cooked.

This is because everything set live on Google Ads goes through an automated review process. If you notice under the <strong>status<\/strong> column that an ad has been disapproved or limited, the first thing you\u2019ll want to do is check the policy listed to see if it\u2019s easily fixable.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if your ad gets disapproved for grammar and punctuation, you could then click into the ad and check the copy. You might be able to adjust your copy and resave your ad to get it reapproved immediately.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, though, the default review process is fully automated on Google\u2019s end\u2014which potentially means your ads could be compliant and still get flagged incorrectly. If your disapproval or limitation is a larger issue with a not-so-easy fix, or one you don\u2019t understand or think might be a mistake, you\u2019ll want to select<strong> appeal<\/strong> when you hover over the status column flag. From there, you can fill out a form to start the appeal process and get your ads reapproved.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/google-ads-policy-appeal.webp\" alt=\"how to run google ads - google ads appeal policy process\" width=\"557\" height=\"371\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90278 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/google-ads-policy-appeal.webp 557w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/google-ads-policy-appeal-480x320.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 557px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>How much should I spend on Google Ads?<\/h3>\n<p>How much you spend on Google Ads will depend on your business\u2019s total <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-budget\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing budget<\/a> as well as your goals, industry competition, and more.<\/p>\n<p>Our latest Google Ads benchmarks report found that the overall <strong>average cost per click in Google Ads is $4.66<\/strong> and the overall <strong>average cost per lead is $66.59<\/strong>.
