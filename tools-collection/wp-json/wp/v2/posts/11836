While some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/18\/covid-19-google-ads-data\">industries are seeing increased volume during COVID19<\/a>, many aren\u2019t and many more businesses may not have the budget to increase their marketing during this crisis\u2014 even if they desperately need new customers.<\/p>\n<p>Google seems to have heard that lament and <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/shopping\/its-now-free-to-sell-on-google\">yesterday announced plans<\/a> to help retailers find more customers online\u2014for free. Beginning later this month, Google will allow merchants to show their products across Google Shopping, which reaches hundreds of millions of shoppers a day. For searches on the Google Shopping tab, results will be primarily free listings, much like on the Google search results page. Google Shopping ads will also still appear in these search results like they do today.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3c527c74-5911-49e7-8c22-32a57350b6e7\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/free-google-shopping-listings.jpg\" alt=\"free Google Shopping listings example\" width=\"466\" height=\"818\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Interestingly, this isn\u2019t Google\u2019s first time offering these product listings for free. Back in 2012, Google first began offering shopping listings to retailers for free before they ultimately transitioned these listings into a paid ad space with<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/04\/google-shopping-campaigns-tips-tricks\"> shopping ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>How do I list my products on Google Shopping?<\/h2>\n<p>In order to have your products appear on Google, you\u2019ll need to create a free <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/retail\/solutions\/merchant-center\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Merchant Center<\/a> account. From there, you\u2019ll also need to create a feed for each of your products. A product feed is simply a spreadsheet of data information about your products that Google uses to create your listing and match it to relevant searcher\u2019s queries. Each product in your feed will need to have the following attributes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/merchants\/answer\/6324405\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I<\/a><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/merchants\/answer\/6324405\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>D<\/strong><\/a><strong>:<\/strong> An alphanumeric ID that is unique for each item you sell.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/merchants\/answer\/6324415\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Title<\/a><\/strong><strong>:<\/strong> Your product\u2019s name, which will serve as the main link text from your listing.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/merchants\/answer\/6324468\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Description<\/a><\/strong><strong>:<\/strong> Up to 5,000 characters to describe your product, what makes it unique, helps match your product to a user\u2019s specific search.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/merchants\/answer\/6324416\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Link<\/a><\/strong><strong>:<\/strong> Your product landing page.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/merchants\/answer\/6324350\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image link<\/a><\/strong><strong>:<\/strong> The URL of your product\u2019s main image.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/merchants\/answer\/6324371\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Price<\/a><\/strong><strong>:<\/strong> Your product\u2019s price as listed on your landing page.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/merchants\/answer\/6324351\">Brand<\/a><\/strong><strong>:<\/strong> The brand name of your product<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/merchants\/answer\/6219078\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GTIN<\/a>:<\/strong> Your product\u2019s Global Trade Item Number, used by manufacturers to identify their products across retailers.

Optimizing attributes within your Google Shopping feed will help both your free Google Shopping listings and your Google Shopping ads. Start by focusing on:<\/p>\n<p>1. <strong>Perfect your product title: <\/strong>Your product title is the largest text that will appear alongside your product and is weighed heaviest in Google\u2019s ranking of your product. Your product can only have one name \u2013 so be sure to optimize it for what your customers would most likely search for. If you\u2019re not seeing the amount (or quality) of traffic from a product, try testing a new product title!<\/p>\n<p>2. <strong>Test different images: <\/strong>An image can really help your product stick out on a busy SERP, so pay attention to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/26\/product-photography\">product photography<\/a>. Avoid low-resolution images or stock photography. Search for your product and observe how all the other products look? Are they all against a blank background? Are they all the same color? Are any of them shown in use? Being the exception to the norm can help your product quickly stand out!<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6bc94a67-63ad-4149-b634-4d970e29b8d4\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/free-google-shopping-listings-examples.jpg\" alt=\"Google Shopping listings\" width=\"804\" height=\"662\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Results for \u201cWeighted Blanket\u201d searches on Google Shopping. You likely notice Baloo Living &amp; Layla\u2019s listings first, despite their higher price and lower position in the results.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>3. <strong>Provide as much detail as possible: <\/strong>Although your product listings only need to have a few attributes to show, providing more information will help Google match your items to a user\u2019s search and help it show in filtered product searches. Include as many <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/merchants\/answer\/7052112?hl=en\">relevant feed attributes<\/a> as you can, such as your product category, product type, color, condition, size, and color!<\/p>\n<p>Note that as of May 11, Google has also made it easy to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/13\/google-curbside-pickup-promotions\">indicate curbside pickup options in your Google Shopping ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>How will this change impact my Google Shopping ads?<\/h2>\n<p>Retailers can continue to show their paid ads alongside these new <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/listings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free organic listings<\/a>. This will allow retailers more flexibility in how they chose to promote their full inventory across Google. Once their products are approved in Google Merchant Center, a retailer can create a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/19\/google-shopping-infographic\">Google Shopping campaign within Google Ads<\/a> and promote specific items across Google, paying only when a searcher\u00a0arrives at their site.<\/p>\n<p>Current Google Shopping advertisers will continue to show their ads on the Google Shopping tab, primarily towards the top and bottom of the pages. Nonpaid (organic) listings will take the remaining real estate within that tab.<\/p>\n<p>The shopping results from the Google search results page, partner search engines, Google images, the Google Display Network, Gmail, and YouTube will still only feature paid shopping ads at this time, so advertisers won\u2019t expect to lose much of their shopping ads traffic.<\/p>\n<p>For more cost-effective marketing ideas, check out our post <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/22\/free-marketing-during-covid-19\">11 Free Ways to Reach Your Audience During COVID-19.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google has announced that free Google Shopping listings in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
