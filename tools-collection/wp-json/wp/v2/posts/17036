The slogan of the campaign was \u201cA BMW rally with two nearby service centers.

Case in point, another classic ambush marketing example of a company leveraging Apple\u2019s advertising to its own ends.<\/p>\n<p>Back in 2010, Apple\u2019s colorful iPod Nano was among the most popular MP3 players on the market (just typing this makes me feel ancient). To advertise its iPod Nano line, Apple erected a billboard ad next to the Jacques Cartier Bridge in Montreal displaying the vividly colorful MP3 players in a satisfying rainbow-ribbon arrangement.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ambush-marketing-rona-paint-apple-ipod.jpg\" alt=\"Ambush marketing Rona paint Apple iPod billboard\" width=\"800\" height=\"439\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.coloribus.com\/adsarchive\/ambient\/leftover-paint-collection-program-rona-chromatic-13277405\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Coloribus<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Sensing an opportunity, Canadian paint and hardware firm Rona seized its chance. Rona soon erected its own billboard ad directly beneath Apple\u2019s iPod ad to advertise the company\u2019s new paint recycling program. The ad, which bore the slogan \u201cNous r\u00e9cup\u00e9rons les restes de peinture,\u201d or \u201cWe collect leftover paint,\u201d was brilliantly simple, and the ad remains one of the best and most creative examples of ambush marketing in recent memory.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Use Ambush Marketing?<\/h2>\n<p>Now that we know what ambush marketing is, let\u2019s take a look at some of the advantages of this type of advertising campaign.<\/p>\n<h3>Ambush Marketing Campaigns Can Be Very Clever<\/h3>\n<p>Something I personally love about ambush marketing campaigns is how cheeky they can be and the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/06\/local-marketing-ideas\">creative flexibility<\/a> these campaigns offer.<\/p>\n<p>Since most ambush marketing campaigns directly respond to or otherwise leverage an existing campaign by a close competitor, ambush campaigns can \u2013 and often, have to \u2013 be extremely creative. This includes everything from visual trickery to witty wordplay. As a result, ambush marketing campaigns are often a lot more memorable than a typical ad precisely because they\u2019re unusually entertaining or clever.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ambush-marketing-newcastle-brown-ale-vs-stella-artois.jpg\" alt=\"Ambush marketing Newcastle Brown Ale chalice campaign\" width=\"320\" height=\"480\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Subtle references and sly jokes are often integral to the success of ambush marketing campaigns. As we saw in the Audi vs. BMW example above, ambush campaigns often respond directly to one another, which can turn visual humor into a vital competitive edge.<\/p>\n<p>Even if one ad is \u201cbetter\u201d than another, the funnier or cleverer ad <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/10\/08\/funny-ads\">will often be much more memorable<\/a>, as Newcastle Brown Ale proved in the example ambush campaign above.<\/p>\n<h3>Ambush Marketing Campaigns Can Go Off-Script<\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to display advertising \u2013 online or IRL \u2013 cohesion is crucial. From enormous, towering billboards in Times Square to a mobile sidebar ad, brands have to ensure that their campaigns <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/10\/15\/multi-channel-marketing\">look, feel, and sound the same across all platforms<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Ambush campaigns, however, can get a little more creative.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ambush-marketing-fiat-volkswagen-google-maps.jpg\" alt=\"Ambush marketing Fiat photobombs Volkswagen Swedish headquarters Google Maps\" width=\"603\" height=\"398\" \/><\/div>\n<p>One of the key advantages of ambush marketing is that it allows brands to go off-script from their regular advertising campaigns, whether in <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/31\/brand-voice\">style, tone, or content<\/a>. Brands can and frequently do employ techniques that may be beyond the scope of a company\u2019s established brand or advertising guidelines, affording the ambusher a great deal more creative freedom and flexibility.<\/p>\n<p>Italian car manufacturer Fiat leveraged this principle to great effect in an impromptu ambush campaign back in 2013 when Fiat somehow managed to park a red Fiat 500 hatchback car on the front steps of Volkswagen\u2019s Swedish headquarters \u2013 just in time for a Google Maps car to pass, which preserved Fiat\u2019s little stunt for years in Google Maps results. (The offending little red Fiat is no longer immortalized in Maps results, as Google refreshed the old image with a newer image that was taken in June of 2017).<\/p>\n<h3>Ambush Marketing Can Change Consumer Perceptions<\/h3>\n<p>Another benefit of ambush marketing is that, done well, it can actually help brands cultivate and exhibit new <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/15\/website-copy\">brand attributes and values<\/a> that consumers may not necessarily already associate with that advertiser.<\/p>\n<p>Take South African airline Kulula, for example. To coincide with the 2010 World Cup, Kulula launched an ad campaign branding itself as the \u201cUnofficial National Carrier of the You-Know-What,\u201d a not-so-subtle reference to the forthcoming soccer tournament. The World Cup\u2019s governing body, FIFA, demanded that Kulula cease the campaign immediately, claiming that the airline sought \u201cto gain a promotional benefit for the Kulula brand by creating an unauthorized association with the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ambush-marketing-sepp-blatter-boston-terrier.jpg\" alt=\"Ambush marketing Sepp Blatter Boston Terrier\" width=\"575\" height=\"384\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Sepp Blatter, the real MVP<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Though unhappy with FIFA\u2019s decision, Kulula reluctantly complied with FIFA\u2019s order. However, the airline wasn\u2019t done quite yet. Shortly after the ads were pulled, Kulula said it would fly anyone named Sepp Blatter \u2013 the name of FIFA\u2019s then-president \u2013 for free. Eventually, the airline located <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/seppthedog\">a Boston Terrier<\/a> that shared a name with FIFA\u2019s former president, and made the improbably named pup an unofficial mascot.<\/p>\n<p>This campaign serves as a great example of how ambush marketing can help brands cultivate new brand values. Air travel is an insanely competitive industry, but Kulula\u2019s ambush campaign not only gained the airline some invaluable publicity, but also advanced the idea that Kulula isn\u2019t just another dry, boring airline.<\/p>\n<h2>What Are the Disadvantages of Ambush Marketing?<\/h2>\n<p>So, we\u2019ve looked at how and when ambush marketing can work well, but this approach is not without its downsides.<\/p>\n<h3>Ambush Marketing Can Be Very Expensive<\/h3>\n<p>The main drawback of ambush marketing is that it has the potential to be very expensive.<\/p>\n<p>Take the very public spat between Audi and BWM in Santa Monica above, for example. For the sake of argument, let\u2019s assume that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1993\/03\/08\/business\/the-media-business-rarefied-billboard-air-of-the-sunset-strip.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a billboard in Santa Monica costs $10,000 per month<\/a> (not including actual design or printing costs). The fight between Audi and BMW lasted for several months and resulted in four separate billboard ads running simultaneously in the same geographic location, which almost definitely drove costs up even further. Then BMW went and put a zeppelin above all four billboards, which can cost anywhere between $500,000 and $5 million. So far, we\u2019re talking almost $100,000 on the billboards alone, plus the cost of BMW\u2019s blimp, plus all design and production costs.<\/p>\n<p>Not exactly small change.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ambush-marketing-hindenburg-disaster.jpg\" alt=\"Ambush marketing Hindenburg disaster\" width=\"657\" height=\"524\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>The Hindenburg, also known as \u201cyour advertising budget\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Ambush marketing might seem like a great way to piggy-back on another brand\u2019s efforts \u2013 and it can be \u2013 but it also demands a certain level of spend that puts this approach beyond the reach of smaller companies or newer, less established brands. That\u2019s why ambush campaigns tend to be launched by well-funded brands at major international events like the Olympics or the Super Bowl \u2013 it\u2019s so expensive, the return has to be worthwhile.<\/p>\n<h3>Calculating the ROI of Ambush Marketing Is Very Difficult<\/h3>\n<p>Another problem with ambush marketing campaigns is that <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/21\/calculate-roi-offline-transactions\">calculating the ROI<\/a> of such a campaign can be very difficult, if not actually impossible.<\/p>\n<p>Take our Samsung hijacking example from earlier. In terms of the upfront overhead costs, Samsung\u2019s little stunt in Sydney wasn\u2019t that expensive. There was the cost of refurbishing the pop-up store itself and the wages of the Samsung employees who manned the store during the event.<\/p>\n<p>The <em>real<\/em> cost of this ambush marketing campaign was the massive hit that Samsung took on each individual Galaxy SII device sold during the event.<\/p>\n<p>Time for some napkin math!<\/p>\n<p>First, we need to establish the base cost of a Galaxy SII device. For the sake of example, let\u2019s say that a Samsung Galaxy SII cost $499, which is what the device retailed for at launch in many regions.<\/p>\n<p>Next, we need to determine how many Galaxy SII devices Samsung sold during its ambush marketing event. For our purposes, we\u2019ll say that the Samsung pop-up store sold 750 Galaxy SII devices that day.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ambush-marketing-samsung-pop-up-store-sydney.jpeg\" alt=\"Ambush marketing Samsung vs. Apple Sydney pop-up store iPhone 4S launch\" width=\"420\" height=\"280\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Fans wait outside Samsung\u2019s pop-up store in Sydney in 2011. Image via<\/em><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/apple\/2011\/10\/12\/samsung-plays-dirty-ambushes-apples-iphone-4s-launch-in-sydney\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>The Next Web<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Finally, we need to figure out how much it cost Samsung to put on its event in Sydney. Let\u2019s say Samsung hired two people to staff the pop-up store, paid each of them $15 per hour (ha!), and asked them to work for eight hours each. This means our staffing costs would be $240. Now let\u2019s say that it cost Samsung $10,000 to actually refurbish the store. Using these figures, we can say that Samsung\u2019s ambush marketing event cost $10,240.<\/p>\n<p>If this were a typical ad campaign, we might use the following formula to come up with some numbers:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Value of a Galaxy SII<\/strong> <em>multiplied by<\/em> <strong>Number of devices sold<\/strong> <em>minus<\/em> <strong>Event overhead costs<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Since we know that a Galaxy SII costs $499, that Samsung sold 750 devices during the event, and spent $10,240 to actually put on the event itself, the formula above would look like this:<\/p>\n<p>499 x 750 \u2013 10,240 = 364,010<\/p>\n<p>So, using the monkey math above, we could say that Samsung\u2019s ambush marketing campaign generated $364,010 in revenue \u2013 not bad for a pop-up store!<\/p>\n<p>But wait a minute \u2013 wasn\u2019t Samsung was selling its Galaxy SII devices for just $2? Now our math looks a lot less attractive:<\/p>\n<p>2 x 750 \u2013 10,240 = -8,740<\/p>\n<p>Going by the actual numbers, <strong>Samsung actually lost almost $9,000 in revenue<\/strong> because it was selling its Galaxy SII devices for just two bucks..<\/p>\n<p><em>This<\/em> is how much it really cost Samsung to put on its event in Sydney.<\/p>\n<p>For our purposes, we\u2019re not actually interested in that figure. For a global brand like Samsung, $364,000 is couch change. What we want to know is whether the ambush marketing campaign was worth $364,000 \u2013 and this is where it gets complicated.<\/p>\n<p>You can\u2019t assign numerical values to intangible factors such as <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/06\/brand-advertising-for-conversions\">brand awareness<\/a> or positive consumer sentiment, which makes it very difficult to effectively gauge the ROI of an ambush marketing campaign. It\u2019s easier to gauge the overall reception of an ambush campaign by monitoring mainstream and social media for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/04\/25\/social-media-roi\">mentions, links, and other engagement metrics<\/a>, but when you get down to brass tacks, proving the financial ROI of an ambush marketing campaign can be <em>very<\/em> difficult.<\/p>\n<h3>Time and Space Are Factors in Ambush Marketing<\/h3>\n<p>Another problem with ambush marketing campaigns is that in addition to the potential costs involved, these campaigns often require a relatively quick response or coordinated planning (or both) if they\u2019re to work effectively or successfully leverage the target campaign to achieve its goal. To complicate matters further, the availability and price of advertising inventory can make or break an ambush marketing campaign before it even gets off the ground.<\/p>\n<p>Take Newcastle Brown Ale\u2019s \u201cchalice\u201d campaign above, for example. Although these ads were quite memorable, their effectiveness relied solely upon the neighboring Stella Artois ads they mocked; by themselves, Newcastle Brown Ale\u2019s ads would only be memorable because they wouldn\u2019t make any sense (and for potentially confusing American passersby with their use of the word \u201cbollocks\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>This means that time and space are crucial factors in many ambush marketing campaigns. Unless you can be sure that the target of your ambush campaign will be there for a while \u2013 such as a sports stadium with a corporate sponsor or something similarly semi-permanent \u2013 you need to move quickly.<\/p>\n<h2>It\u2019s a Trap!<\/h2>\n<p>Ambush marketing isn\u2019t a viable marketing strategy for most businesses. The costs involved can be prohibitively expensive to all but the wealthiest of brands, but the underlying strategies beneath ambush marketing as a concept can be easily applied to your campaigns, from PPC campaigns on the search network to primarily visual campaigns on Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully, this post has given you some creative inspiration for new approaches you can take to your existing ads.
