In the case of a small business, their level of brand awareness may not reach eponym status (e.g. asking for a Kleenex instead of a tissue), but simpler forms are counted as success. This could mean:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consumers having knowledge of what your business is known for.<\/li>\n<li>A social media user knowing your ad is going to be funny when they come across you in their feed.<\/li>\n<li>Customers choosing your brand specifically over others, even if there are cheaper options.<\/li>\n<li>Search engine users typing your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/23\/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name\">business name<\/a> or other <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/03\/19\/why-bid-on-branded-terms-ppc\">branded terms <\/a>into search.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>ThriveHive is now a part of the WordStream family, but you can see in the example below that one of the top queries that led to their site traffic was their brand name.

For example, if you see the Dunkin Donuts pink and orange letters up ahead, before even making out the words, you\u2019d automatically recognize it as Dunkin Donuts.<\/p>\n<p>Brand awareness takes brand recognition a step further. It involves recalling not only the business name <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/08\/business-name-ideas\">(ideas for creative business names here!)<\/a>, but also the general feeling of the business, information about its products and services, and other experiential details. When a business has a level of brand awareness, their marketing and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/13\/best-advertising-campaigns\">advertising campaigns<\/a> mean something to their audience. They elicit feelings and emotions in the consumer.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Brand awareness is all about what the mind state your ideal clients enter when they see or hear your company\u2019s name.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><em>Related:<\/em> Our friends at LocaliQ cover <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/lead-generation-vs-brand-awareness\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">brand awareness vs. lead generation<\/a> here.<\/p>\n<div id=\"importance-of-brand-awareness\"><\/div>\n<h2>The importance of brand awareness<\/h2>\n<p>No matter the quality of your products and services, no matter how <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/21\/how-much-does-adwords-cost\">much you spend on advertising<\/a>, and no matter how much you <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/19\/social-media-for-small-business\">post to social media<\/a>, your business isn&#8217;t likely to get very far if it doesn&#8217;t have a brand to set itself apart.

Referral programs<\/h3>\n<p>Users will gladly spread word of your product or service when they know they\u2019ll get an added perk. Dropbox is a great example of how smart referral programs can <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/06\/02\/growth-hacking\">growth hack<\/a> a business. Dropbox gives existing users 500 MB of extra storage space for every friend they refer (up to 16 GB). Back when Dropbox was still new, this referral program helped generate tons of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/26\/word-of-mouth-marketing\">word-of-mouth<\/a>, delivering a huge number of sign-ups and saving Dropbox countless advertising dollars.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-generate-leads-referral-marketing.png\" alt=\"how to generate leads - referral program example\" width=\"500\" height=\"605\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-67971\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-generate-leads-referral-marketing.png 500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-generate-leads-referral-marketing-480x581.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>2. Impressive guest content<\/h3>\n<p>Another great way to get your brand known on the web is to deliver ultra valuable, gorgeous looking content to share on other blogs. Guest posting (despite what some might tell you) is still a powerful way to get your name known in your industry.<\/p>\n<p>However, run-of-the-mill content won\u2019t cut it \u2013 you need to be guest publishing high-quality stuff.

Infographics<\/h3>\n<p>Infographics are a bright and colorful way to display interesting marketing data and statistics. These content powerhouses often get shared far and wide, making them a great tool for brand building and thought leadership.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/november-marketing-ideas-shoplocal-infographic-sonoma.png\" alt=\"small business saturday - reasons to shop local\" width=\"410\" height=\"1024\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-65703\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/november-marketing-ideas-shoplocal-infographic-sonoma.png 410w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/november-marketing-ideas-shoplocal-infographic-sonoma-120x300.png 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>4. Freemium with credit<\/h3>\n<p>Many awesome online products allow users to choose from a free version, which includes a watermark or credit line, or the option to upgrade to the paid version, which allows users to remove the mark or replace it with their own logo. While many users will opt for the free version, they\u2019ll also be promoting your brand to others users. Some of those new users who see your product will go with the paid version! Providing a freemium product means getting yourself in front of more eyeballs, building your brand and bringing in paying customers.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/brand-awareness-newsletter-signup.png\" alt=\"Brand awareness newsletter signup\" width=\"655\" height=\"277\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>5. Local partnerships<\/h3>\n<p>Another great brand building strategy is to get involved with local partnerships (this is <em>tremendously <\/em>important for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/06\/local-business-marketing\">local-oriented businesses<\/a>, but can be applied for other businesses as well). <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/26\/partner-marketing\">Partner with other local businesses<\/a> to hold join intro seminars or festivals. Sponsor local sports teams and donate to charity events. Getting your brand plastered around festivals and events will do big things for your brand.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Car wraps<\/h3>\n<p>A classic tried-and-true strategy for building your brand is getting a car wrap! Car wraps are customized designs that can cover your entire car (don\u2019t worry, you can still see through the windows)! They can attract a hefty amount of attention, and it\u2019s a great way to ensure that wherever you go, people are becoming more familiar with your brand. Wrap your company car or even your own personal vehicle!<\/p>\n<h3>7. Freebies<\/h3>\n<p>Everyone loves free stuff! Put your brand name on koozies, pens, Frisbees, etc, then give away your items at local festivals.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/brand-awareness-giveaways1.jpg\" alt=\"Brand awareness giveaways and freebies\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Koozies from Philly Phaithful<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>8. Social media contests<\/h3>\n<p>Run a social media contest in which contestants submit a photo or video, with other users voting for their favorites. Contestants will share the link with friends and family to get more votes, building your brand awareness as a result.<\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Instagram-hashtags-example-contest.png\" alt=\"Instagram hashtags - Instagram giveaway post\" width=\"720\" height=\"401\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76202\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Instagram-hashtags-example-contest.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Instagram-hashtags-example-contest-480x267.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>9. Social media marketing<\/h3>\n<p>With the number of social networks constantly increasing, trying to do active <a href=\"\/social-media-marketing\">social media marketing<\/a> on all of them is a fool\u2019s errand. If your business is best suited to a particular network, then don\u2019t be afraid to put the majority of your energy into a few sites.<\/p>\n<p>For example, photo-heavy sites might focus on Instagram and Pinterest. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/23\/ppc-for-b2b-software-companies\">B2B companies<\/a> often do best on Twitter, whereas small businesses in creative industries (like <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/11\/12\/etsy-marketing\">craft marketing<\/a>) can do well on Instagram. Know where your audiences hang and focus on those networks. You won\u2019t want to totally abandon the other social sites, but save your biggest efforts for what you <em>know<\/em> works. Not sure about your core network? Start digging into analytics to see where your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/23\/referral-traffic-links\">referral traffic<\/a> is coming from.<\/p>\n<h3>10. LinkedIn publishing<\/h3>\n<p>We already talked a bit about the value of guest posting, but there are also other methods to get published and spread your name across the web. Recently, LinkedIn began letting all users publish posts right to LinkedIn via the publishing tool. If your posts get enough attention, it could wind up in the LinkedIn home stream for many users. As an added bonus, having posts attached to your LinkedIn account also helps <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/09\/influential-ppc-expert-traits\">establish you as a thought leader<\/a>! Of course you can also always set up your own company blog and post there \u2013 just make sure you share and promote your posts after publishing.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/brand-awareness-larry-kim-inc-magazine.png\" alt=\"Brand awareness get published\" width=\"604\" height=\"509\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>11. Pro storytelling<\/h3>\n<p>Want to be a memorable brand? Start with stellar storytelling. If you can create emotionally moving, compelling stories that connect deeply with users, they won\u2019t soon forget your name. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/12\/05\/business-storytelling\">Here are some storytelling tips<\/a> to get you started<\/p>\n<h3>12. Developing a unique brand personality<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.envato.com\/blog\/branding-trends\/\">Branding trends<\/a> come and go, but giving your brand a fun, unique brand identity is a timeless strategy. If you work in an industry where a little dose of comedy or personality is appropriate, being outrageous can make your brand extremely memorable.<\/p>\n<p>A few major examples of businesses who inject humor and comedy into brand promotion include Old Spice, Poopouri, and Dollar Shave Club.<\/p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/JGgpPQvXUE0?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Not only did these hilarious ads leave an impression with audiences \u2013 they also became viral sensations, shared across the web and driving sales.<\/p>\n<h3>13. Podcasts<\/h3>\n<p>Starting your own industry podcast where you interview industry experts is a great way to build your brand while also developing relationships with others in your field. Some industries, like marketing, already have a hefty number of podcasts that would be tough for a beginner to compete against. (Here are a few of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/06\/10\/best-marketing-podcasts\">our favorite marketing podcasts<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>However, for niche industries where there isn\u2019t much on the airwaves, you could easily make yourself a household name. You could also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/05\/podcast-advertising\">try podcast advertising<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/brand-awareness-podcasts.png\" alt=\"Brand awareness podcasts\" width=\"824\" height=\"410\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>14. PPC advertising<\/h3>\n<p>With SEO becoming more competitive every day, while organic Google real-estate shrinks, PPC is a smart solution for getting your brand seen on Google. With targeted keyword research, you could be <a href=\"https:\/\/thrivehive.com\/how-to-get-to-the-top-of-google\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">showing up at the top of Google<\/a> for relevant searches. Even if users don\u2019t end up clicking on your PPC ad, seeing your name at the top of the search results makes an impression and is incredible for building brand awareness.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-real-estate-example-ads.webp\" alt=\"google ads for real estate ads example in serp\" width=\"703\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76236\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-real-estate-example-ads.webp 703w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-real-estate-example-ads-480x409.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 703px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div><strong>\ud83d\udcd7 Free guide:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLPPC101.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_PPC101_Download\"><strong>PPC 101: The Beginner&#8217;s Guide to PPC<\/strong><\/a><\/div>\n<h3>15. Remarketing campaigns<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/12\/04\/adwords-remarketing-best-practices-guide\">Remarketing<\/a> is a pro strategy for boosting that good ol\u2019 brand awareness. Why? Remarketing involves showing ads to users who visited your site, but left before converting. Remarketing ads are placed all across the web on sites your customers visit. Soon they\u2019ll be seeing your business everywhere \u2013 on their favorite blogs, while shopping online, etc. This gives the impression that your brand is much larger (and has a much bigger ad budget) than it really is. And it&#8217;s a great way to increase your conversion rate.<\/p>\n<h3>16. Paid social advertising<\/h3>\n<p>Organic social marketing is becoming more difficult by the day, leading more businesses to turn to paid social advertising. Facebook and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/28\/twitter-ads\">Twitter ads<\/a> are relatively cheap and help get your brand seen on social. Whether or not users convert immediately, every added piece of familiarity counts when users finally are ready to make a purchase.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/brand-awareness-paid-social.png\" alt=\"Brand awareness paid social\" width=\"842\" height=\"494\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>17. Controversy<\/h3>\n<p>While this strategy isn\u2019t for everyone, one way to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/13\/get-your-website-noticed-on-google\">get your brand noticed<\/a> is by <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/19\/contrarian-content-marketing\">being controversial<\/a>. Take an unlikely stance on a hot industry topic, and you may find yourself attracting quite a bit of attention. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/19\/most-controversial-ads\">Whether it\u2019s good or bad attention<\/a> depends on the subject matter and your approach. Then again, there\u2019s no such thing as bad press (so they say anyway).<\/p>\n<h3>18. Influencer marketing<\/h3>\n<p>Getting friends in high places is another easy way to boost your brand awareness.
