Then, let\u2019s look at a few ways to make your new account more professional and engaging so it attracts and converts more customers.<\/p>\n<h2>What is a Facebook Business Page?<\/h2>\n<p>A Facebook Business Page is a public page that represents a company, organization, or public figure (like a celebrity or politician).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-what-is.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook business page - screenshot of Wordstream business page\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-74809 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-what-is.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-what-is-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Brands can post pictures, videos, and text\u2014just like on personal pages\u2014for their fans to view, like, comment, and share. However, unlike most personal pages where people connect with a select group of friends and family, Business Pages are designed to promote an organization to its wider audience.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook Business Pages are also distinguished by the content they share. Posts may include promotions about products, services, and sales. Posts may be educational or they may introduce followers to important people in the organization. Compare that with the cute cat pics and informal tone of most personal pages.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to place ads or run a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/25\/social-shopping\">Facebook Shop<\/a>, you\u2019ll need to set up a Facebook Business Account and page. So, let\u2019s get started.<\/p>\n<h2>7 easy steps to create a Facebook Business Page<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve broken down the setup process into eight steps and, pinky swear, they\u2019re all really easy.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 1: Create a new Facebook Business Page<\/h3>\n<p>To get started, click over to Facebook\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/create\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Create a Page<\/a> and choose which kind of Business Page you want to create.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-create-page.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook business page - create a page screen\" width=\"868\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-74810 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-create-page.jpg 868w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-create-page-480x331.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 868px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not logged into Facebook already, it\u2019ll ask you to do so. That\u2019s because you need to link your Business Account to a personal page.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t worry, your personal information won\u2019t be visible on your Business Page. But if you really want to keep work and personal life separate, you can create a second personal account using your work email. Then use that to open your Business Account.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 2: Enter basic information<\/h3>\n<p>The first screen you see is a blank version of your page with a few places to enter information on the left.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-instructions-name.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook business page - screenshot of adding name page\" width=\"936\" height=\"523\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-74811 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-instructions-name.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-instructions-name-480x268.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Name:<\/strong> The most obvious option is to use your business name. If there\u2019s already business by the same, try adding a location or business type to differentiate. So \u201cLarry\u2019s\u201d becomes \u201cLarry\u2019s Restaurant\u201d or \u201cLarry\u2019s of Chicago.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Category:<\/strong> Pick from the category that most closely matches <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-brainstorm-business-ideas\">what your business does<\/a>. You can change this later, so don\u2019t stress it too much.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Description:<\/strong> This is the first chance you have to tell the world about your business. Be concise and descriptive, but don\u2019t shy away from a bit of boldness.<\/p>\n<p>Click \u201cCreate Page\u201d and your new Facebook Business Account is official, if still a bit bland.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 3: Complete the details<\/h3>\n<p>Now Facebook will ask you for some basic information about your business.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-instructions-complete-details.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook business page - adding details your business page\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-74812 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-instructions-complete-details.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-instructions-complete-details-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This part\u2019s pretty self-explanatory. Just know that all these fields are options so only fill out what you want to go public.<\/p>\n<p>Click \u201cNext\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Step 4: Add images<\/h3>\n<p>Your next stop is where you\u2019ll add images to your page.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-instructions-add-images.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook business page - screenshot of page to add images\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-74813 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-instructions-add-images.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-instructions-add-images-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Facebook gives you lots of ways to spruce up your Business Page so it stands out to busy scrollers. Your cover picture is the most visible of all. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/09\/social-media-images\">Pick images<\/a> that tell the world what you do while matching your brand.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-example-banner-image.jpg\" alt=\"facebook business page - screenshot of Wordstream's Facebook banner image\" width=\"927\" height=\"521\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-74814 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-example-banner-image.jpg 927w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-example-banner-image-480x270.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 927px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You have many options for your profile picture (that smaller image that sits at the lower left of your profile pic). If you\u2019re a one-person show, try a pro headshot. Or consider a photo of your product, store, or an action shot of you doing what you do.<\/p>\n<p>One thing to remember about your profile pic is that it\u2019ll get cropped to fit the circular shape of its placement.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-image-comparison.jpg\" alt=\"facebook business page - profile picture comparison\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-74815 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-image-comparison.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-image-comparison-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Make sure the pic you pick fits in the center of the circle.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 5: WhatsApp, friends, and notifications<\/h3>\n<p>Next, Facebook will take you through three pages asking for some choices. All three are optional. You can tap the \u201cSkip\u201d button at the bottom to bypass them.<\/p>\n<p>The first asks you to add your WhatsApp account. Only do that if you want customers to message you.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-instructions-whatsapp-1.jpg\" alt=\"facebook business page - screenshot of where to add whatsapp info\" width=\"927\" height=\"562\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-74816 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-instructions-whatsapp-1.jpg 927w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-instructions-whatsapp-1-480x291.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 927px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The next two ask if you\u2019d like to invite friends to follow your page and if you want notifications. Make your selections or skip.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 6: Add an action button<\/h3>\n<p>An action button (often called a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/20\/call-to-action-buttons\">call to action<\/a>, or CTA, button) is a shortcut you give to visitors so they can do something you really want them to do.<\/p>\n<p>To add a CTA button to your page, click \u201cAdd an action button.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-instructions-CTA-1.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook business page - screenshot of business page with the call to action button highlighted\" width=\"826\" height=\"573\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-74817 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-instructions-CTA-1.jpg 826w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-instructions-CTA-1-480x333.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 826px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Once you click it, Facebook will give you several CTA options.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-instructions-Tabs.jpg\" alt=\"facebook business post - screenshot of list of action button options\" width=\"510\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-74818 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-instructions-Tabs.jpg 510w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-instructions-Tabs-480x565.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 510px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Depending on what you choose, you\u2019ll need to connect a phone number, website, or service (like a food ordering app or ticket booking platform).<\/p>\n<h3>Step 7: Add more contact details<\/h3>\n<p>This is a simple but very important step. Especially if you\u2019re a local business with regular hours of operation and a physical location.<\/p>\n<p>To add information that helps people find you online and in person, click the \u201cAbout\u201d tab.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-instructions-contact-details.jpg\" alt=\"facebook business page - screenshot of place to enter contact details\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-74819 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-instructions-contact-details.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-instructions-contact-details-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Then fill in whatever information you\u2019d like people to see when they visit your Facebook Page.<\/p>\n<p>And voila! You\u2019ve completed the setup of your Facebook Business Page. You can start sharing all the wonderful things happening at your business through posts.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p>Pro tip: Once you set up your Page, you can start running paid Facebook ads.

We want to make sure it\u2019s looking great and turning visitors into customers. Here are a handful of ways to level-up it up.<\/p>\n<h3>Create and pin a welcome post<\/h3>\n<p>When people first visit your page, they\u2019ll likely read a post or two to decide if you\u2019re worth following. You want your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/10\/facebook-post-ideas\">most engaging and convincing post <\/a>to be what they see. Do that by writing a welcome post, then pinning it so it keeps its spot at the top of your Page.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook will ask if you want to write a welcome post. You can follow that link or just write a post where it asks \u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve written something welcoming, pin it to your Page by clicking \u201cManage\u201d in the Featured section.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-instructions-welcome-post.jpg\" alt=\"facebook business page - screenshot of place to enter a new welcome post\" width=\"936\" height=\"511\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-74821 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-instructions-welcome-post.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-instructions-welcome-post-480x262.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll get a popup window showing your recent posts. Pic your welcome message and it\u2019ll pin for you.<\/p>\n<h3>Customize your Page tabs<\/h3>\n<p>Page tabs are how visitors navigate around your Facebook Business Page. You automatically get several on the visible tab bar and a bunch more in the dropdown menu.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-instructions-tab-dropdown.jpg\" alt=\"facebook business page - screenshot of tab dropdown menu\" width=\"936\" height=\"528\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-74822 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-instructions-tab-dropdown.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Facebook-Business-Page-instructions-tab-dropdown-480x271.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You only want to keep the ones that are relevant to your business so it\u2019s easier for people to find what they want. To make those selections, click \u201cManage sections.\u201d You\u2019ll get another popup window that lets you unclick tabs to remove them from your page.<\/p>\n<h3>Turn on reviews<\/h3>\n<p>Reviews are critical for building trust with potential customers. To make sure this feature is turned on for your new page, go to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your account by clicking on your profile picture in the upper right<\/li>\n<li>Settings and Privacy from the dropdown<\/li>\n<li>Settings from the next drop down<\/li>\n<li>Privacy from the left-side menu<\/li>\n<li>Page and Tagging from the left side menu<\/li>\n<li>Make sure \u201cAllow others to view and leave reviews on your Page\u201d is toggled on<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When your Page is new, you won\u2019t have any reviews yet.

Just like personal pages, there is no charge to create a Facebook Business Account. You can post, share, and comment from your free account. What does cost money are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/best-facebook-ads\">Facebook Ads<\/a> and boosted posts.<\/p>\n<h3>Is there a difference between a personal and a business Facebook account?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, a business account and a personal account on Facebook have a few differences. For example, a business account has many more tabs that allow you to add a menu, a shop, and several other features not available on a personal account.<\/p>\n<h3>Does a Facebook Business Account need to be attached to a personal account?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, you can\u2019t get a freestanding Facebook Business Account. You first need to establish a personal account that links to your Business Page.<\/p>\n<p>You can create a new personal account using a different email address, like one from work, and use that to create a Business Page if you\u2019d like to keep it separate.<\/p>\n<h2>Promote your Facebook Business Page<\/h2>\n<p>A Facebook Business Page is a big leap in expanding your online presence. But a Page without promotion is like a storefront without a sign. Sure, anyone could stumble in by accident, but they\u2019d probably never find you on purpose.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/31\/how-to-advertise-on-facebook\">Facebook ads<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/social-media-marketing\">social media marketing<\/a> are how you turn a shiny new Facebook Page into a lead-generation tool that accelerates your business growth. And compared to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/05\/online-advertising-costs\">digital marketing costs<\/a> in general, Facebook ads are an affordable option within reach of most organizations.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your Facebook Business Page is one of the most important online properties for your business.
