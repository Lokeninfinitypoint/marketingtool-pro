Mobile shopping is expanding rapidly, which means as marketers, we have to keep up.

Yelp<\/h3>\n<p>As a friend arrogantly declared after moving into the city, \u201cAll businesses need Yelp. If you don\u2019t have Yelp, I\u2019m not buying your stuff\u2014especially because I\u2019d have nowhere to complain if it\u2019s bad.\u201d Tbh, I agree.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/search?find_desc=&amp;find_loc=Boston%2C+MA&amp;ns=1\">Yelp<\/a> boasts an average of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/factsheet\">92 million unique mobile users per month<\/a>, with 102 million reviews. 72% of total page views and 60% of all content (reviews and photos) come from mobile. That\u2019s crazy, but believable. Before I walk into a restaurant I\u2019ve never been before, I do my research. I find veterinarians on Yelp, painters, even DMVs. You should absolutely be claiming your local business, setting up a page to respond to reviewers, and even consider paying for sponsored advertisements so you aren\u2019t missing out on a huge section of potential customers.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"9e5fa74f-69cc-4ebb-8bf0-298a01bfb74e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Yelp-mobile-marketing-tool.jpg\" alt=\"Yelp Mobile Marketing\" width=\"750\" height=\"368\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>#2.

Luckily, combined with the power of Facebook ad targeting, you can access that audience in a meaningful way with this marketing tool.<\/p>\n<p>Similar to Facebook advertising, Instagram has a plethora of options.

WordPress\/Medium<\/h3>\n<p>If you run a website or blog\u2014or are looking to start one\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.com\/\">WordPress<\/a> and Medium are both great mobile-friendly platforms. In February, WordPress rolled out <a href=\"https:\/\/en.blog.wordpress.com\/2016\/02\/24\/amp-for-wordpress-dot-com\/\">Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)<\/a> to improve the load time of pages on tablets and phones on their own site and self-hosted sites. WordPress also has a comprehensive mobile app that will allow you edit existing posts or create new ones from your mobile phone.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/about.medium.com\/\">Medium<\/a>, created by some of the guys who created Twitter, is becoming popular for all kinds of bloggers. The site itself and all posted pages are mobile-friendly and Medium also has an app that allows you to read, edit and create posts, and react by responding to others\u2019 posts. You can use this platform to repost content that is already on your own site\u2019s blog, or create a new post on the go.

Even better, your posted content won\u2019t just sit there unnoticed; 80% of visitors come to the site through specific searches, leading them directly to the type of content they are looking for and giving you exposure.<\/p>\n<p>Not buying it? SlideShare has shareable social buttons, a comment section for questions or compliments, and shows the day the slides were published (which is great to make sure the data is relevant!).<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7d18771c-61aa-4b02-adac-61a9e0b5c21b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/mobile20marketing20tools20slideshare20resized.jpg\" alt=\"slideshare mobile marketing tools\" width=\"800\" height=\"554\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Tools for Mobile Website Management<\/h2>\n<h3>#6. Google\u2019s Mobile-Friendly Testing Tool<\/h3>\n<p>Do you remember when Google told us that mobile-responsiveness would affect how your landing pages show up on google search? This isn\u2019t breaking news, <a href=\"https:\/\/webmasters.googleblog.com\/2014\/11\/helping-users-find-mobile-friendly-pages.html\">it has been in effect since 2014<\/a>, but continues to be relevant in different ways. To help sites analyze usability on mobile, Google introduced a Mobile-Friendly Test and a Mobile usability report. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/webmasters\/tools\/mobile-friendly\/\">Mobile-Friendly test<\/a> is simple:\u00a0 enter your webpage URL and Google will spit out a basic report saying \u201cAwesome! This page is mobile-friendly!\u201d (or not so much) and a screenshot of how it looks on a mobile device.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/webmasters\/tools\/mobile-usability\">Mobile Usability Report<\/a> is similar, but more in-depth look at how major mobile issues occur across the entire site, not just one page.

Not only does the suite allow you to track everything that occurs on mobile, you can track it from your mobile device.<\/p>\n<p>The app helps you check metrics in your customized reports, monitor real-time data, build and save your own reports to the dashboard with any metrics, dimensions, and segments you care about. Google is constantly updating any bugs they discover, but most recently rolled out an update which added support for custom metrics and dimensions, added several default segments, and expanded support to all languages on iOS.<\/p>\n<p>Really, Google Analytics makes miracles happen\u2014I could go on forever about it. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/analytics\/mobile\/\">Check it out for yourself!<\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"8316c401-303e-40b9-8ea6-d5988ce7a494\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/GA-marketing-tool.png\" alt=\"Google Analytics Mobile App\" width=\"603\" height=\"1023\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>#8.

One of their best tips\u2014that all website optimizers and managers will agree with\u2014is to\u00a0<em>be quick. <\/em>Consumers expect instant gratification more than ever and the patience they once had with a slow-loading app or mobile site is disappearing.
