Telemedicine<\/h2>\n<p>Telemedicine isn&#8217;t exactly a new field, nor are the underlying technologies particularly revolutionary.\u00a0 It has, for years, allowed individuals living in remote regions to gain access to medical advice and diagnoses which they might otherwise be unable to receive. With the fears surrounding the spread of COVID-19, however, telemedicine has seen an even sharper upturn in usage than collaboration software.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4c020e75-4166-4fdb-9a89-346688fec144\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/SaaS-Businesses-Likely-to-Thrive-in-a-Post-COVID-World-trustradius-1.png\" alt=\"saas businesses likely to thrive in a post-covid world trustradius\" width=\"800\" height=\"497\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.trustradius.com\/vendor-blog\/covid-19-software-industry-data-and-statistics\"><em>Image Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>In April, for instance, software &amp; services review site <a href=\"https:\/\/www.trustradius.com\/vendor-blog\/covid-19-software-industry-data-and-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TrustRadius<\/a> measured the number of impressions each SaaS category had received since the beginning of the pandemic. Telemedicine led the pack by a massive margin, seeing a 613%\u00a0increase in usage. Although the site acknowledged that this sharp growth had likely already reached its peak, it will remain an incredibly useful tool even <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/18\/post-covid-19-customers\">post-COVID<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To that end, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ama-assn.org\/practice-management\/digital\/after-covid-19-250-billion-care-could-shift-telehealth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">American Medical Association<\/a> has predicted that moving forward, virtual healthcare could account for approximately $250 billion of health insurance spending in the United States, up from an estimated $3 billion. For many, telehealth is a matter of significant convenience, allowing us to phone in from the comfort of our own home instead of waiting for several hours in a doctor&#8217;s office. It will also allow mobility-impaired far easier access to physicians and by association the medical care they require.<\/p>\n<p>The AMA also reported that, according to consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company, 57%\u00a0of healthcare providers view telemedicine in a more favorable light than before the pandemic, whilst 64%\u00a0indicate that they would be more comfortable using it in their own practice.<\/p>\n<p>As such, although the barrier for entry into the SaaS telemedicine space is relatively high and saddled with myriad regulatory requirements, it nevertheless has incredible <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/28\/growth-strategy\">potential for growth<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Gaming and media<\/h2>\n<p>We need not tell you how much online gaming and media streaming services increased in usage during the pandemic. You have likely experienced this surge firsthand, at least in part. After all, when one is stuck in their own home, what else is there to do but find solace in digital entertainment?<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6cbff930-9d6b-4985-b232-82edd246c3f8\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/SaaS-Businesses-Likely-to-Thrive-in-a-Post-COVID-World-video-game-streaming-1.png\" alt=\"saas businesses likely to thrive in a post-covid world video game streaming\" width=\"800\" height=\"476\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>A major decline for theaters as streaming platforms grow (<\/em><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.jpmorgan.com\/insights\/research\/media-consumption\">Image Source<\/a>).<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Analyst and consulting firm Deloitte <a href=\"https:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/be\/en\/pages\/technology-media-and-telecommunications\/articles\/online-media-streaming.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">predicted early in the pandemic that<\/a> media streaming services would greatly benefit from the pandemic, noting several significant increases in both viewership and usage. Multinational financial services firm J.P. Morgan, meanwhile, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jpmorgan.com\/global\/research\/media-consumption\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">noted the increasing expansion of the streaming landscape in May<\/a>, with countless new streaming platforms coming to market. Video games, too, received a mention in the firm&#8217;s analysis, with both increased usage and increased viewership on streaming platforms like Twitch.<\/p>\n<p>It is important to note here that not all game developers and publishers count as SaaS companies.\u00a0 At the same time, however, SaaS has strong roots in the games industry, from digital distribution platforms like Steam to online games like <em>World of Warcraft<\/em> and <em>League of Legends<\/em>. And given that the vast majority of gaming is making the shift from offline and single-player to online and multiplayer, the future of gaming and SaaS are inextricably linked \u2014 and gaming is, by association, a fast-growing SaaS sector with a great deal of revenue potential.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"fd1174db-aab3-40a2-b23f-cc923acb9994\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/SaaS-Businesses-Likely-to-Thrive-in-a-Post-COVID-World-video-game-streaming-jump-1.png\" alt=\"saas businesses likely to thrive in a post-covid world video game streaming\" width=\"800\" height=\"426\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>A pandemic-fueled jump in video game streaming (<\/em><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.geekwire.com\/2020\/twitch-sets-audience-record-october-pandemic-continues-fuel-livestreaming-growth\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image Source<\/a>).<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Many of the associated apps have uses beyond this space, as well. Apps like Netflix Party and Discord, for example, help people experience movies and media together. And more people are<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/23\/content-marketing-trends\"> creating digital content<\/a> than ever before. Online content creation was already reaching a fever pitch, and COVID-19 has resulted in a surge like never before \u2014meaning there is an opportunity for content hosting here, as well.<\/p>\n<p>Again, once the worst of the pandemic has finally passed, we may see a slight decline in usage for both gaming and streaming media. At the same time, with such considerable surges in users and viewership, the outlook for these two entertainment sectors is highly positive. As we move from 2020 into 2021, expect digital entertainment to continue along its current growth path.<\/p>\n<h2>Adapting to a newly digital world<\/h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/13\/covid-19-response\">coronavirus pandemic didn&#8217;t just change the world<\/a>. It <em>continues <\/em>to do so. As a direct result of COVID-19, we&#8217;ve seen the rise and fall of multiple industries and sectors, alongside a massive shift in how we both live and work.<\/p>\n<p>These shifts, as are many of the changes that result from periods of great turmoil, are permanent. Just as the recent Great Recession led to the creation of companies like Uber, Airbnb, and Venmo, COVID-19 will see the rise and fall of many new businesses, and lasting changes across many industries. The SaaS businesses described above are the clear <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/28\/resilient-digital-agencies-2020\">winners in this shift<\/a>, but they are not the only victors.<\/p>\n<p>SaaS businesses of every category likely have a positive outlook moving forward. As does any organization that can effectively leverage SaaS. This software is, after all, one of the driving factors in digitization, and will continue to support our march towards a virtual future, even once the pandemic is finally behind us.<\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">About the author<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Christopher Moore is the Chief Marketing Officer at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.quietlightbrokerage.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quiet Light Brokerage<\/a>, an entrepreneur-led organization that aids in the preparation, marketing, negotiation, and closing on sales and acquisitions of six, seven, and eight-figure online businesses.
