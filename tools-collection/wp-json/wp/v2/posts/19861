You might as well toss out the effort you spent writing it and setting up your campaign.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no sense in dedicating any time to creating content or running ads if your headlines aren\u2019t compelling.

When using words that are bland, uninspiring, or unknown by most, your potential readers are going to be turned off.<\/p>\n<p>Instead stick with language that is simple, but powerful. For example, try turning your headline into a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/07\/call-to-action-marketing\">call-to-action<\/a> with words such as \u201cTry\u201d or \u201cClick,\u201d or addressing the reader directly by using the word \u201cYou.\u201d Transform a generic headline with a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/13\/power-words-ad-writing\">power word<\/a> like \u201cnever.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f54de35f-79f8-49c9-b481-3f60d7712077\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/positive-vs-negative-headlines-outbrain.png\" alt=\"negative headlines in ad writing\" width=\"1395\" height=\"998\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Positive vs. negative headlines<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Keeping the language simple will be your best bet to getting more eyes on your post.

Every headline you write should target a specific keyword with significant <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/23\/keyword-search-volume\">search volume<\/a> \u2013 this not only ensures that your headline is optimized to drive targeted traffic through organic or paid search, but it proves that people are actively looking for information related to the topic. Is the keyword you\u2019re targeting something that people are actually searching for? If the answer is <em>no<\/em>, then it\u2019s useless.<\/p>\n<p>There are plenty of tools you can use to find high-volume keywords to use in your headlines, from <a href=\"\/keywords\">WordStream\u2019s Free Keyword Tool<\/a> to paid tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/mozpro\/lander\/keyword-research\">Moz\u2019s Keyword Explorer<\/a>. If you have an AdWords account, you can use their <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/04\/25\/keyword-planner\">Keyword Planner<\/a> (under \u201cTools\u201d &gt; \u201cKeyword Planner\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>Type in some potential keywords to get an idea of their volume, and target terms with medium to high search volume. Just keep in mind that for keywords with very high search volume, the competition is going to be much steeper, and your content will have to be that much more amazing to rank on the SERP.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1315228b-be46-4d8e-bcad-90ecaf6eb166\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/high-search-volume-headline-writing.png\" alt=\"keyword research for headline writing\" width=\"1140\" height=\"478\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Using Keyword Planner to research keyword volume for \u201ctropical vacations\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Tip #3: Make a Bold Statement<\/h2>\n<p>Introducing a shock factor into your headline will almost always ensure <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/10\/google-ctr\">high click-through rates<\/a>. Think about ways to spice your title up, and word it in a way that instantly draws readers in. Making a bold, opinionated or <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/19\/contrarian-content-marketing\">controversial<\/a> statement is a sure way to do this.<\/p>\n<p>One brand that absolutely kills their headline game time and time again is Refinery29, an online publication that caters to women readers. I have to actively resist opening their email newsletters, since I\u2019ll end up spending 30 minutes more then I planned to on my phone (but it\u2019s hard because their subject lines are so enticing!).<\/p>\n<p>The reason Refinery29 excels at this is because their headlines are typically very opinionated, and leave the reader wanting more.

How can you make yours better?<\/p>\n<p>These are the types of questions you should be asking in order to write more compelling headlines.

All three of them are intriguing, and all of them leave the reader wanting to learn more.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"25730ea6-03c4-469f-920a-5064cbd40a4c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/today-trending-headlines.png\" alt=\"great headline writing\" width=\"1137\" height=\"396\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>For example, the first headline reveals that Jimmy Kimmel has an update on his baby, but we aren\u2019t sure what that update is. The second headline implies that Chrissy Metz wore a tight dress to the MTV movie awards, but we can\u2019t see the full dress, and we\u2019re also not given the message she delivered to body shamers. Finally, the third headline doesn\u2019t tell us whether talcum powder causes cancer or not. We have to click to get the answers!<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a fine line, though, between too much and too little information, so make sure you\u2019re giving enough information to build interest, but not so much that the reader feels fully informed just by reading the headline.<\/p>\n<p>(Protip: This technique also works if you&#8217;re trying to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/08\/how-to-write-an-introduction\">write a great introduction<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<h3>Examples of great headlines that will make you oh-so-curious:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>17 Facts You Won\u2019t Believe Are True \u2013 via <a href=\"https:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/jessicamisener\/17-facts-that-sound-completely-fake-but-are-actually-true?utm_term=.wpaXaLG4Jw#.ab82PvplDj\">Buzzfeed<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Three Job Interview Mistakes You Think You Avoided But Actually Didn\u2019t \u2013 via <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/40420295\/three-job-interview-mistakes-you-think-you-avoided-but-actually-didnt\">Fast Company<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Earthworms are more important than pandas (if you want to save the planet) \u2013 via <a href=\"http:\/\/theconversation.com\/earthworms-are-more-important-than-pandas-if-you-want-to-save-the-planet-74010\">The Conversation<\/a><\/li>\n<li>7 Reasons the Best Employees Quit, Even When They Like Their Job \u2013 via <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inc.com\/lolly-daskal\/7-reasons-the-best-employees-quit-even-when-they-like-their-job.html\">Inc.<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Here\u2019s Why You Should Never Get Up To Pee In The Middle Of The Night \u2013 via <a href=\"https:\/\/www.littlethings.com\/waking-up-in-the-middle-of-night\/\">Little Things<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Tip #9: Write Multiple Headlines and Vote on the Best<\/h2>\n<p>This is a strategy I\u2019ve used ever since I started writing headlines for articles and titles for presentations.
