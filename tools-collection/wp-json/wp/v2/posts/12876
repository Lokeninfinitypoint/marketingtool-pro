Sure, I might circle it so I remember, but I don\u2019t feel vindicated. If anything, I feel bad. When it\u2019s in a blog post I\u2019ve edited, I\u2019m bummed I made a mistake.<\/p>\n<p>But I\u2019d rather content I\u2019ve edited have a missing period or an extra capital letter than have logical flaws or offer questionable value any day. The missing period and extra capital letters are mistakes, sure, but they\u2019re easy fixes. Rethinking the structure of a guide or making a supporting example stronger? Those are much harder improvements to make and, frankly, they\u2019re much more important for the reader.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-editing-bible-typo.jpg\" alt=\"picture of Bible page with &quot;Thou shalt commit adultery&quot;\" width=\"770\" height=\"433\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Okay, admittedly, you could argue <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/mentalfloss.com\/article\/70170\/rare-pro-adultery-sinners-bible-heads-auction\"><em>this typo<\/em><\/a><em> could be bad for the reader.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In order to make sure your whitepapers, blog posts, ebooks, and more are ready to share with your readers, you need to make sure these higher-order content concerns are addressed first. In other words, you need a round of <strong>content editing<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>In this guide, I\u2019ll cover everything you need to know to get the most out of content editing, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What content editing is<\/li>\n<li>Why it\u2019s important for marketers<\/li>\n<li>How to prioritize your content editing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Let\u2019s get started.<\/p>\n<h2>What is content editing?<\/h2>\n<p>Content editing is a stage and style of editing with the goal of <strong>reviewing writing to check how effective, cohesive, and understandable it is<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>But what does that mean in practice? If you\u2019re content editing, you\u2019ll pay attention to how the writing fits with your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/31\/brand-voice\">brand voice<\/a>. You\u2019ll read a whitepaper looking for logical holes or missing pieces, you\u2019ll make sure the tips in an email are useful and applicable, and you\u2019ll want to make sure the scope of a blog post fits a reader\u2019s needs and works for your business.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also pay attention to how well the content delivers on the promise of the headline and subheads. If this \u201cWhat is content editing?\u201d section, for example, didn\u2019t include a definition, you\u2019d notice that during content editing and delegate back to the writer\u2014but more on figuring out when to jump in and when to delegate shortly.<\/p>\n<h3>Content editing vs. copy editing<\/h3>\n<p>So what\u2019s the difference between content editing and copy editing? Here\u2019s a simple break down. Content editing ensures that writing is effective, cohesive, and understandable. This means checking the strength and logic of the argument, the quality of the sources or examples, the match with your brand voice, and the scope of the piece.<\/p>\n<p>Copy editing, on the other hand, identifies and corrects more surface-level mistakes. This means checking spelling, grammar, punctuation, syntax, and style guide agreement. It could also mean double-checking graphs, charts, and image placement, and proofreading the title, meta descriptions, and captions.<\/p>\n<h2>Why is content editing important for marketers?<\/h2>\n<p>In content marketing, this type of editing is often grouped into the final copy editing or <a href=\"https:\/\/contentmarketinginstitute.com\/2017\/10\/proofing-editing-content\/\">proofreading<\/a> stage. It\u2019s clear why this happens: We\u2019re busy, and when you have a list of blog posts to edit for next week, a folder of emails to review, and still want to eat lunch, grouping these two editing tasks together seems like the best way to finalize all that content and still manage to leave your desk.<\/p>\n<p>But that doesn\u2019t mean it always works.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-editing-blog-post-typo.jpg\" alt=\"blog post screen shot with &quot;Here five&quot; typo\" width=\"729\" height=\"340\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Sad example of my own rushed editing.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Establishing and maintaining copy editing standards for your content improves the quality and authority of your content and your brand\u2014-but your audience won\u2019t care about clean, legible copy that doesn\u2019t make sense and your boss won\u2019t care about content that doesn\u2019t align with your overall marketing objectives. <strong>Marketers need content editing to make sure they\u2019re generating high-quality content that provides value to readers <em>and<\/em> contributes to business goals.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now, let\u2019s get into how to do that.<\/p>\n<h2>How do you figure out what to prioritize for content editing?<\/h2>\n<p>This, friends, is the challenge. You don\u2019t want to waste time re-working a section of a guide to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/18\/google-merchant-center\">Google Merchant Center<\/a> that would better as its own blog post. You don\u2019t want to spend hours retrofitting a guest post to a keyword that doesn\u2019t relate to your business.<\/p>\n<p>And you still really, really don\u2019t want to publish a blog post riddled with silly, embarrassing typos.<\/p>\n<p>During content editing you need to consider two things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does the content meet quality standards?<\/li>\n<li>Does the content accomplish its purpose?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For content marketing, the overarching purpose of the content, at least, is almost always defined well before its creation\u2014especially if your company has a content marketing mission statement. Your content should contribute to your marketing goals.<\/p>\n<p>Quality standards will depend more on the form of the content\u2014email, blog posts, guides\u2014and your brand standards. But all high-quality content will be readable, actionable, and shareable.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have the focus of your content editing clear, you can use a quick tool to prioritize.<\/p>\n<p>You might be familiar with the Eisenhower Decision Matrix, the productivity tool that might be the best thing to remember from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/ericjackson\/2012\/07\/24\/the-only-thing-you-need-to-remember-about-the-seven-habits-of-highly-effective-people\/#29a3682a67f7\">Stephen Covey\u2019s <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/ericjackson\/2012\/07\/24\/the-only-thing-you-need-to-remember-about-the-seven-habits-of-highly-effective-people\/#29a3682a67f7\"><em>7 Habits of Highly Effective People<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-editing-eisenhower-decision-matrix.jpg\" alt=\"Eisenhower decision matrix\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eisedo.com\/blog\/forget-other-productivity-hacks-the-eisenhower-matrix-is-all-you-need\/\"><em>Image Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The use for this is simple: Consider the tasks at hand and group them into the four quadrants in this matrix. Your Q3 goals due, well, yesterday? Urgent and important, do those now. Weekly 1:1 with your boss? Not urgent but important, schedule a time to do that. Link building for recent blog posts? Delegate. Helping out with planning for the marketing team holiday video? Not important and not urgent yet\u2014say no for now and eliminate it.<\/p>\n<p>See how quickly the matrix can help prioritize a list of tasks? That\u2019s ideal for productivity in general. It\u2019s also ideal for content editing.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a content editing version of this matrix to help you determine where to focus your time and attention just as quickly:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-editing-decision-matrix.jpg\" alt=\"content editing decision matrix\" width=\"703\" height=\"538\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This will help guide the same rapid-fire prioritizing to make your content editing not only easier to tackle, but also more effective. Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at each of these categories will mean in practice.<\/p>\n<h3>Do now: High importance, high impact<\/h3>\n<p>This is the worst quadrant, but that\u2019s okay\u2014ideally, these edits will come up least often. These are issues that impact both the quality of the content and its ability to contribute to your marketing goals.<\/p>\n<p>If an infographic has a misattributed customer quote, for example, this needs to be fixed before anything else happens. You don\u2019t want to impact the customer relationship or publish inaccurate information. That\u2019s a do now.<\/p>\n<p>These issues should be rare, but when they do come up, these are first priority.<\/p>\n<h3>Delegate: High importance, low impact<\/h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s consider a few examples here. A content marketer wrote a blog post about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/14\/ppc-ad-copywriting\">ad copy<\/a> without including an image of an ad anywhere in the piece. A copywriter sent over some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/12\/video-scripts\">video scripts<\/a> that\u2019s relying on tongue-twisting jardon. A product marketer drafted a one-sheeter for a product launch that uses internal and external messaging\u2014there\u2019s no clear audience.<\/p>\n<p>In these instances, the quality of the content is impacted by these misses; this content hasn\u2019t even made it to impacting your business goals yet. Make note of what\u2019s missing or not working in the copy and explain what revisions need to happen to improve the piece. Then, send it back to the writer for revising.<\/p>\n<h3>Do later: Low importance, high impact<\/h3>\n<p>With these edits, the content is strong and clear, and with that high-quality content, there\u2019s opportunity to edit for high-impact business value. Include links to other relevant content. Find a keyword\u2014even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/26\/low-volume-keywords\">low-volume keywords<\/a> can help your SEO. While you\u2019re at it, revise headings for better SEO. Resize images. Include a CTA for your upcoming <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/08\/event-landing-pages\">event<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>At this stage, you have high-quality content already, so you\u2019re looking to make it do more for your business goals.<\/p>\n<h3>Final edit: Low importance, low impact<\/h3>\n<p>Spending time catching comma splices only to go back and cut those extra sentences later. Changing the capitalization of subheadings only to realize halfway through they\u2019re not parallel and need to be rewritten. Adding up all the figures in a table only to figure out it needs to be represented as a graph. Correcting punctuation errors throughout an introduction that doesn\u2019t set accurate expectations for the reader. The immediate gratification of productivity is tempting, but wasting that time\u2014and, worse, doing it all over again\u2014is frustrating. So don\u2019t do that yet.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-editing-blog-mistake-33-39.jpg\" alt=\"blog post typo with &quot;33%&quot; instead of &quot;39%&quot; in accompanying graphic\" width=\"594\" height=\"359\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Just be sure to go back and fix it before publishing a mistake like this.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Skip over correcting grammar or checking figures for now, and then go back in with your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/10\/content-style-guide\">content style guide<\/a> handy.<\/p>\n<h2>Build content editing into your process<\/h2>\n<p>If you want to ensure that your content is working for you, you need to make a point to add content editing to your content creation process. If you\u2019re in charge of editing, add it as a step in your process documentation and block off time on your calendar for to get used to the step. If you don\u2019t have a clear editing step\u2014or an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.convinceandconvert.com\/content-marketing\/why-next-level-content-needs-a-managing-editor\/\">editor<\/a> at all\u2014for your content, talk to your coworkers about establishing a peer editing step.
