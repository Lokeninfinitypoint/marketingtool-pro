Create a cross-channel experience<\/h3>\n<p>A brand community isn&#8217;t limited to its primary platform. If your community thrives on your website, snippets of vibrant discussions, testimonials, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/28\/user-generated-content\">user-generated content<\/a> can be highlighted on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/01\/09\/social-media-marketing-strategies\">social media platforms<\/a>, creating a web of interconnected touchpoints that reinforce the brand&#8217;s messaging and values.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Adopt a customer-centric approach<\/h3>\n<p>The heart of any brand community is its members.<\/p>\n<p>Their needs, desires, and feedback should be at the forefront. A successful brand community should provide a platform for users to voice their opinions and make <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/06\/cater-to-your-customers\">customers feel valued and heard<\/a>. Exclusivity, in terms of offers or information, can make community members feel like VIPs, fostering stronger brand allegiance.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Act on customer feedback<\/h3>\n<p>Open channels of communication mean customer feedback will flow abundantly. And what truly matters is the brand&#8217;s responsiveness and adaptability. Demonstrating that you value and act upon user feedback can turn casual users into brand evangelists, creating organic promoters within the community.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Empower active participation<\/h3>\n<p>Communities thrive on engaged participants.<\/p>\n<p>Allow users to have a say in product development or other brand initiatives. This tactic will help you source fresh ideas and give users a stake in your brand&#8217;s journey, deepening their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/03\/emotional-marketing-copy\">emotional connection<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>9.

For instance, a fashion brand\u2019s community can offer its members the opportunity to create their own designs, shop from exclusive designer lines based on their likes, and watch behind-the-scenes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/03\/video-marketing-ideas\">videos<\/a> for upcoming collections.<\/p>\n<p>While Uniqlo doesn\u2019t have a \u201ccommunity,\u201d it offers a unique look at new designer collections to fashion-conscious consumers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/brand-community-wordstream-example-unique.webp\" alt=\"Brand community - Unique brand website\" width=\"936\" height=\"529\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-78751 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/brand-community-wordstream-example-unique.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/brand-community-wordstream-example-unique-480x271.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uniqlo.com\/in\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>10.

The brand\u2019s meteoric growth during the pandemic can be largely attributed to its loyal user base sharing their personal experiences with the brand.<\/p>\n<p>Peloton\u2019s Chief Marketing Officer Dara Treseder shared their approach to brand building with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/10\/07\/how-peloton-builds-a-community-around-health-and-wellness.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CNBC<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c&#8230;for us, that intentional cultivation of community is really focused on finding where there are organic sparks of connection within our member base, and then kind of pouring fuel on that &#8230; shining a spotlight on those things.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The company also uses its famous team of instructors to frequently connect with members across social <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/11\/most-popular-social-media-platforms\">media platforms<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Transitioning to a &#8216;brand community-at-the-core&#8217; model<\/h2>\n<p>By positioning your brand community at the heart of business operations and weaving it seamlessly into the customer support framework, you can enhance user experience. Use intelligent search tools to ensure that community-driven insights are easily accessible, often preempting the need for customer support channels.<\/p>\n<p>But beyond these strategies, the key lies in genuine, wholehearted commitment. Remember these steps to build a brand community that your most important customers want to be a part of:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ensure strategic alignment<\/li>\n<li>Dedicate ample resource<\/li>\n<li>Choose the right platform<\/li>\n<li>Leverage your website<\/li>\n<li>Create a cross-channel experience<\/li>\n<li>Adopt a customer-centric approach<\/li>\n<li>Act on customer feedback<\/li>\n<li>Empower
