Or is it truly a revolutionary step forward for businesses marketing online? Perhaps the answer lies somewhere in the middle.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s latest venture into this realm of automation, Performance Max Campaigns, were released in November of last year and have been built up to be the next evolutionary step in digital advertising on the platform, but is it everything that it was hyped up to be? Is more automation the best decision for you or your business?

That means you can run ads on Search, Maps, Display, YouTube, Gmail, and Discovery networks all from a single campaign.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/google-ads-performance-max-networks.png\" alt=\"google ads performance max - networks\" width=\"720\" height=\"327\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-60272\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/google-ads-performance-max-networks.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/google-ads-performance-max-networks-480x218.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>How do Performance Max campaigns work?<\/h2>\n<p>Performance Max essentially takes responsive ads and smart campaigns to the next level, combining these features all in one place.

The quick answer is no. Performance Max is best used as a supplement to your pre-existing efforts. And since it is a goal-based campaign type, it is best used when you have specific conversion goals (conversion goals is a relatively new feature from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/10\/google-ads-updates\">November 2021)<\/a> like driving<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/03\/increase-sales-online\"> online sales<\/a> or generating leads) and when you aren&#8217;t limited by which channel your ads appear on.<\/p>\n<p>In his review on Performance Max, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.deanlong.io\/blog\/google-performance-max-campaign\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dean Long<\/a> says this campaign type is also best for advertisers who:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don&#8217;t have time or resources to optimize for each channel.<\/li>\n<li>Find it challenging to optimize various campaign types for one location.<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t have much budget but want exposure to all Google Ads inventory.<\/li>\n<li>Have an unlimited budget and want to unlock new, unexpected customer segments.<\/li>\n<li>Wish to explore new geo markets.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/google-ads-performance-max-campaign-setup.png\" alt=\"google ads performance max campaign setup\" width=\"720\" height=\"411\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-60276\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/google-ads-performance-max-campaign-setup.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/google-ads-performance-max-campaign-setup-480x274.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>The pros &amp; cons of Performance Max<\/h2>\n<p>The surface objective here\u2014to make advertising on Google&#8217;s networks easier and more accessible\u2014is enticing to the novice user who isn&#8217;t quite familiar on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/21\/how-to-run-google-ads\">how to run Google Ads<\/a> and is overwhelmed by the plethora of options available. So does it work and if so, does it work better than the alternative? Let\u2019s run through some pros and cons of Performance Max campaigns.<\/p>\n<h3>Pros of Performance Max<\/h3>\n<p>Feedback that I have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/performance-max\">heard about on Performance Max<\/a> has been generally positive with many of the drawbacks being the ones that I will mention next.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Makes advertising on Google easier for novice users:<\/strong> The idea of one campaign where you can achieve all of your marketing goals without having to set up several other campaigns appeals to those who want to circumvent the learning curve.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Allows advertisers to focus on strategic performance drivers:<\/strong> Creative optimization, campaign planning, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/07\/ppc-reporting\">PPC reporting<\/a> are much easier to obtain using Performance Max. With a multi-campaign strategy, you may have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/10\/responsive-search-ads\">responsive search ads<\/a>, responsive display ads, etc. with varying creative and messaging that you&#8217;d have to compile from different places or analyze individually. With Performance Max you can test and assess all of these things from one place, allowing you to make strategic marketing decisions faster.<\/li>\n<li><strong>When used correctly, could provide impressive results:<\/strong> I caveat this one with \u201cwhen used correctly\u201d because if you have the correct inputs in place with clearly defined goals then Performance Max should work for you (in theory). By correct inputs, I\u2019m mostly referring to what you tell Google to look for in regards to audience targeting. I would suggest using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/12\/first-party-data\">first-party data<\/a>\u2014that is, if you have a list of existing customers, give that to Google instead of relying on the AI to learn who your target audience is.

This also applies to the quality of ads or feeds. The AI is not going to make your ads magically better than your competitors, you have to do everything in your power to place the best creative inputs into the system.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Less control: <\/strong>The basis of many of the criticisms surrounding smart campaigns, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/19\/google-ads-automated-bidding\">automated bidding<\/a>, or anything remotely automated is that it takes control away from the advertiser in some respect. Those who like to have control over every detail of how their ads are being served may be resistant to the continued automation of their jobs.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Limited visiblity:\u00a0<\/strong>Though Google is gradually adding new reporting features, the general consensus here is that it&#8217;s hard to get individual insights on each campaign or asset combination.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Machine learning doesn\u2019t mean full automation:<\/strong> Relying too much on machine learning or believing that it will do the job with minimal effort on your end is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/07\/google-ads-mistakes\">mistake you don&#8217;t want to make in Google Ads<\/a>. If you are not diligent with how you set up Performance Max you will see yourself wasting quite a bit of money. I have included this as a \u201ccon\u201d because I believe there is a discrepancy between how Google markets these products and the expectations of novice users.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_blog_InContentTextLink\"><strong><em>Are you wasting money in Google Ads? Find out fast with the free Google Ads Performance Grader.<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Polarized perspectives on Performance Max<\/h2>\n<p>Whenever more automation is introduced to digital marketing platforms, there are three major avenues that people within the space typically go:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Those who love it and look to adopt it to help them either manage themselves or clients easier.<\/li>\n<li>Those who hate it because they hate change or fear that clients inevitably won\u2019t need their expensive expertise anymore.<\/li>\n<li>Those who see through a lot of what these tech giants claim to be about.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here is a look at the two ends of that spectrum.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/15\/ai-marketing\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Perspective #1: It just needs a little time<\/h3>\n<p>A lot of the angles or arguments you may get from folks like me who have been working within these digital platforms professionally for many years may err on the side of cynicism but does that mean we\u2019re right or just stuck in our ways?<\/p>\n<p>I recall a time when Facebook sunset its Power Editor tool and blended it into the core Ads Manager. At the time I was furious but as the years have passed the memory of Power Editor has faded and if I were to revert back to it I would probably have a bone to pick.<\/p>\n<p>Power users who have been running ads for a long time are comfortable with the platforms as they exist and aren\u2019t always receptive to radical changes that alter their day-to-day management. But it is possible that Performance Max is actually good for the long run. If it becomes proven to work for clients or the marketers themselves, these criticisms will fade and there will be a greater acceptance that these tools are superior to controlling every button and switch yourself.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/08\/ppc-influencers\">PPC influencer<\/a> Jyll Saskin Gales is one such proponent of this school of thought.

However, with automation, it has never been easier to spend more money, deliver some form of return, and continue to use the platform.<\/p>\n<p>So it\u2019s not that users are just throwing money away now; the argument is that they have less control to spend it exactly how they intend to. Therefore the platforms themselves are still effective, yet how much of the money is being spent efficiently and exactly how is more unclear than ever.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AmaliaEFowler\/status\/1471294388298862592\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/google-ads-automation-tweet.png\" alt=\"google ads performance max - tweet about automation taking control\" width=\"600\" height=\"612\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-60279\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/google-ads-automation-tweet.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/google-ads-automation-tweet-480x490.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dealership\/status\/1394535337368506369\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">View the Tweet here.<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>The verdict?<\/h2>\n<p>I don\u2019t believe <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/15\/ai-marketing\">AI in marketing<\/a> or automation within digital marketing platforms is necessarily good or bad.
