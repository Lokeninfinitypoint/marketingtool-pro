We hear it from our customers every day. And one of the biggest pain points we hear among our small business clientele is a sheer lack of healthy modeling. How are my peers and competitors structuring their accounts? In which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/06\/18\/marketing-channels\">channels<\/a> are they allocating spend? Do they have similar goals, and are they experiencing similar roadblocks? Or am I in this alone?<\/p>\n<p>So to give our customers and our broader readership a better idea about where they fit into the big world of online advertising, we decided to put together a report that nailed down the Online Advertising Landscape in 2019. We polled hundreds of WordStream customers about their strategies, the makeup of their businesses and marketing teams, and the unique challenges they face on a day-to-day basis. In this report, we ask questions like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is your biggest roadblock to growing your business?<\/li>\n<li>In which channels are you spending your advertising budget?<\/li>\n<li>Which campaign types are you using on Facebook?<\/li>\n<li>Which ad formats are you using on Facebook?<\/li>\n<li>What\u2019s your biggest roadblock to optimizing for mobile?<\/li>\n<li>Do you incorporate video into your advertising strategy?<\/li>\n<li>And much, much more!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We ended up with tons of online advertising stats around what businesses like yours are doing with their ad budgets this year.

Animated creative is super important! What <em>did <\/em>surprise us was that only 33% of Facebook advertisers use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/24\/facebook-lead-ads\">Facebook lead ads<\/a>.

Content marketing (3.12) somewhat surprisingly beat out paid social (3.13) and email marketing (3.66), both of which are typically more associated with revenue.
