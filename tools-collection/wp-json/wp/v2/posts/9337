This rings true as of February 18, 2021 when Google <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/10434300\">announced<\/a> that <strong>Responsive Search Ads (RSAs) will now be the default ad type<\/strong> when you\u2019re looking to create ads for a Search campaign.<\/p>\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/RSA-google-ads-default-header-1.png\" alt=\"RSA-google-ads-default-header\" width=\"762\" height=\"346\" \/><\/div>\n<p>What does this mean for advertisers and Google Ads moving forward? In this post, we\u2019re going to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clarify what\u2019s changing for advertisers.<\/li>\n<li>Compare RSAs to the former default ad type (Expanded Text Ads).<\/li>\n<li>Walk you through how to set up RSAs.<\/li>\n<li>Share input, tips, and best practices from the PPC community.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Our hope is to help you to better understand and adapt to this change so your ads can keep performing their best.<\/p>\n<h2>What does this change mean?<\/h2>\n<p>The change in default ad type from Expanded Text Ads (ETAs) to Responsive Search Ads (RSAs) means that when you click to make a new ad, there are now only two options: Responsive Search Ads or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/01\/google-call-only-ads\">Call Ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean that Expanded Text Ads (ETAs) are completely going away (at least not yet\u2014more on that later) or that your ETAs are all of a sudden going to stop performing. On the contrary, having two ETAs and one RSAs per ad group still remains the recommended <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/26\/expanded-text-ad-best-practices\">best practice by Google<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>ETAs will still be an option to create as well, though it is a bit hidden. You\u2019ll have to click to create an RSA, and then click the blue text at the top to \u201cSwitch back to text ads\u201d in order to continue creating ETAs. So, this change does indicate to us that RSAs have now taken the seat on Google\u2019s throne of the default Search ad type.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/rsa-google-ads-default-switch-to-eta-1.png\" alt=\"rsa-google-ads-default-switch-to-eta\" width=\"800\" height=\"333\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>Why the switch?<\/h2>\n<p>Google provides a few reasons for the change in the default ad type from ETAs to RSAs:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Machine learning allows for improved performance<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve seen a pattern emerge with Google\u2019s recent updates in favor of a shift toward automation. While many advertisers feel this gives them less control over their campaigns, Google takes the stance that machine learning can <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/24\/google-ads-optimization\">improve campaign performance <\/a>in terms of flexibility, clicks, and conversions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Better adaptability with changing consumer behavior<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a known fact that consumer needs and priorities are in a state of constant change, and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/18\/post-covid-19-customers\">more so than ever before as the pandemic progresses<\/a>. Google\u2019s reasoning for the push toward RSAs is that it gives advertisers a better way to adapt to shifting market trends without having to create individual static ads and test them out manually.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Streamlined account management and optimization<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Google essentially wants more advertisers to use RSAs (particularly novice advertisers) because it gives their machine learning mechanisms more to work with. This allows Google to make more recommendations related to account performance and helps streamline the account management experience.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p><strong>Are you missing out on opportunities to optimize your Google Ads account?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Find out instantly the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Free Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">A refresher on Responsive Search Ads<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Okay, so now that there will be a greater push toward <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/10\/responsive-search-ads\">Responsive Search Ads<\/a>, let\u2019s go over the basics to make sure you\u2019re up to speed. The main benefit of this ad type, which was introduced back in 2018, is that of allowing more variety in ad copy by giving you room for up to 15 headlines and 4 descriptions. Google then takes those assets and dynamically combines them live during each search auction.<\/p>\n<p>Think of the spread of all the different headlines and descriptions within an RSA similar to how songs might shuffle through on a playlist.\u00a0 Essentially, the RSAs dynamically rotate through various headlines and descriptions to show a combination to best fit the individual searcher\u2019s query each time.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/how-responsive-search-ads-work.png\" alt=\"how responsive search ads work\" width=\"720\" height=\"481\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59791\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/how-responsive-search-ads-work.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/how-responsive-search-ads-work-480x321.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">Showdown: RSAs vs ETAs<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Smell that? It\u2019s the stench of jealousy emitting off the good ol\u2019 tried and true (and former default ad type)<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/25\/google-expanded-text-ads\"> Expanded Text Ads<\/a> (ETAs). Just kidding. But let\u2019s take a look at how the two compare. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/22\/new-expanded-text-ads\">ETAs<\/a> only allow for up to three headlines and two descriptions, and those never change position. With the components in your ETA anchored in place, you have slightly more control over your ad copy.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, RSAs give you lots more to play with by allowing you to create up to fifteen different headlines and four descriptions. This sounds great because you\u2019re able to fit various headlines and descriptions to match up better to queries, but the tradeoff is that you\u2019ll slightly lack control on RSAs as you\u2019ll never know exactly which combination of headlines and descriptions Google will choose to serve at any given time.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/RSA-defaut-google-ads-rsa-vs-eta-1.png\" alt=\"RSA-defaut-google-ads-rsa-vs-eta\" width=\"800\" height=\"421\" \/><\/div>\n<p>While RSAs give you more headlines\/descriptions to play with, the character count for these fields remain the same as ETAs (up to 30 characters for headlines and up to 90 characters for descriptions).<\/p>\n<p>All in all, both RSAs and ETAs have their advantages and drawbacks, so it\u2019s best to test out both.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/RSA-defaut-google-ads-RSA-ETA-venn-1.png\" alt=\"RSA-defaut-google-ads-RSA-ETA-venn\" width=\"800\" height=\"446\" \/><\/div>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">The pros and cons of RSAs<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>By dynamically cycling through <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/02\/ppc-ad-headlines\">headlines<\/a> and descriptions, RSAs clearly have different features and capabilities that set them apart from ETAs.\u00a0However, like we just mentioned, all that glitters is not gold when it comes to RSAs, as their variety also causes a lack of control in ad copy and their expansive nature may cause you to carve out a little extra time to create these.<\/p>\n<p>While you may be able to whip up an\u00a0ETA in no time with just a couple of descriptions and few headlines (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/12\/13\/expanded-text-ads-deadly-sins\">while avoiding these mistakes<\/a>), we\u2019ve noticed that RSAs take a bit more time to complete since you have to come up with many more lines of copy. Luckily, Google helps us out by providing suggestions when we\u2019re creating these ads.<\/p>\n<p>You do have a pin option for RSAs for up to three headlines and two descriptions. Here, you can choose a specific headline or description to be guaranteed to show when space on the SERP allows. However, pinning isn\u2019t recommended unless absolutely necessary, as it will restrict the automatic variant testing Google runs through on your Responsive Search Ads.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a quick pros and cons list to sum up what we\u2019ve learned about RSAs so far:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/RSA-default-google-ads-pros-cons-1.png\" alt=\"RSA-default-google-ads-pros-cons\" width=\"800\" height=\"313\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>How to set up and optimize your Responsive Search Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Okay, so you\u2019ve read through everything and now you\u2019re ready to set these ads up.

These include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/mark-irvine-42\">Mark Irvine<\/a>, Director of Paid Media at Search Labs Digital, and <a href=\"\/brett-mchale-3561\">Brett McHale<\/a>, founder of Empiric, LLC.<\/p>\n<h3>Leverage RSAs to regularly test out a diverse mix of messages<\/h3>\n<p>Irvine points out that \u201cthe fundamental problem that Google is trying to solve here is not a new challenge to the industry\u2014advertisers should be constantly updating and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/13\/adwords-ad-variations\">testing multiple versions <\/a>of their ads.\u00a0 Although this is an age-old best practice, a lot of advertisers don&#8217;t commit to it regularly and their accounts suffer for it.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/11\/25\/copy-testing\">Ad copy testing<\/a> not only helps advertisers improve their ads overall, but it also allows Google (and Bing and Facebook) to better match a message to a particular search or user. Constantly creating three plus\u00a0ads in each ad group just isn&#8217;t a habit for some advertisers, and Google&#8217;s Responsive Search Ad type picks up the slack there. In lieu of asking advertisers to write multiple variants of their ads, RSAs automatically take their headlines and descriptions and test out a more diverse mix of messages for the advertiser.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Continue creating and testing ETAs<\/h3>\n<p>While the emphasis on RSAs can encourage more testing and better ads overall, Irvine advises advertisers to continue <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/08\/create-expanded-text-ads\">creating ETAs<\/a> while using RSAs as a supplement:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRSAs are a better testing mechanism than not testing at all, but it shouldn&#8217;t surprise people to hear that a &#8220;handwritten&#8221; ad can often outperform Google&#8217;s machine-written variants. Google&#8217;s change to default ad creation to RSAs is a bold one to encourage their adoption, especially among novice advertisers who might not understand the difference. Overall, I&#8217;d encourage advertisers to supplement their ad groups with Responsive Search Ads but to continue to test two to three ETAs in each ad group. This will both allow you to continue to practice and optimize your ad copy while benefiting from Google&#8217;s machine learning-driven ad copy testing at scale.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/rsa-default-google-ads-standard-vs-expanded-1.png\" alt=\"rsa-default-google-ads-standard-vs-expanded\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>A Standard Text Ad vs an Expanded Text Ad (<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/instapage.com\/blog\/google-adwords-expanded-text-ads\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><em>)<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Experiment with pinning headlines<\/h3>\n<p>While it was stated earlier in this post that pinning isn\u2019t recommended unless absolutely necessary, McHale mentions that the shift toward RSAs as the default ad type may change this up:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of advertisers want specific headlines in certain positions, and they can essentially make text ads out of RSAs by pinning headlines in the first, second, and third position. This practice is often advised against because it limits the variations that can be served but I&#8217;ve seen ads with pinned headlines (not all headlines, however) perform very well.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/rsa-default-google-ads-pin-1.png\" alt=\"rsa-default-google-ads-pin\" width=\"600\" height=\"698\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.storeya.com\/2019\/04\/google-responsive-search-ads\/\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Use Google\u2019s tools<\/h3>\n<p>Google also provides some tips for creating strong RSAs:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use their <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/9921843\">Ad strength<\/a> tool.

When RSAs were first introduced, they were more so a way of generating traffic and testing headlines and descriptions for Expanded Text Ad iterations.\u00a0Now, especially with match types getting more broad and a greater shift toward\u00a0AI and Smart Bidding strategies across\u00a0the\u00a0board, RSAs are crucial to make sure\u00a0you\u00a0are leveraging\u00a0the\u00a0right messaging to\u00a0the\u00a0right audience. Since RSAs\u00a0can\u00a0take search history &amp; intent into account when showing different headlines and descriptions, they have\u00a0a big advantage over Standard Text Ads.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Are ETAs being phased out?<\/h2>\n<p>The experts we talked to have mixed opinions as to the fate of Expanded Text Ads. Irvine believes they\u2019re not going anywhere anytime soon:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe good news for advertisers who might be turned off by this change is that Google&#8217;s shared no plans to end the Expanded Text Ad. Even if it&#8217;s now a little hidden in the Google Ads interface, it&#8217;s still supported and easy to create in Google Ads, Editor, and other common tools.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also not in Google&#8217;s interests to stop supporting these ETAs anytime soon. If you look back to 2016 when Google first introduced ETAs, many assumed the 90-character Standard Text Ad would stop serving shortly after. Although Google eventually stopped allowing new Standard Text Ads to be created nine months later, the format never officially stopped serving. If Google hasn&#8217;t ended an old text ad format after five years, I wouldn&#8217;t say that ETAs run the risk of going extinct this year either.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Brett McHale, founder of Empiric Marketing, LLC, has a different outlook:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhile advertisers will still be able to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/26\/build-expanded-text-ads-now\">create and run Expanded Text Ads<\/a>, it\u2019s more difficult to do so. My opinion is that regular Expanded Text Ads will be phased out of the platform in favor of RSA&#8217;s as it is clear Google wants advertisers to rely more on its algorithm to make decisions. They&#8217;ve already had auto-generated RSA&#8217;s as an option in the recommendation section for some time.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>RSAs as the default ad type: key takeaways<\/h2>\n<p>Just as is the case with any change made within the Google Ads platform, the ultimate impact will become more clear as time goes on, but with the knowledge and tips we have available to us, we can work to mitigate any negative impact on our performance. Let\u2019s finish off with the key takeaways from this post:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Responsive Search Ads have replaced Expanded Text Ads as the default campaign type in Google Ads.<\/li>\n<li>You can still create Expanded Text Ads by clicking into the RSA creation window and then selecting \u201cSwitch back to text ads.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>You <em>should<\/em> still create and test Expanded Text Ads.
