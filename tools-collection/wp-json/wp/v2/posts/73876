They generate awareness, traffic, leads, and conversions. That\u2019s true of sidewalk sandwich boards and seven-figure ad campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>So how do you write copy that converts?<\/p>\n<p>After a decade of professional writing, I\u2019ve found some copywriting skills to be fundamental for choosing words that compel action\u2013whether copywriting is a central focus of your job or just something you dabble in. I\u2019ve listed them here and ranked them, starting with the most important.<\/p>\n<p>Master these skills and your copy will do big things for your business. And if you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;ll enjoy the heck out of writing it.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Curiosity<\/h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/03\/copywriting-examples\">best copywriters<\/a> I\u2019ve ever read aren\u2019t always the best \u201cwriters.\u201d They\u2019re people who genuinely want to understand how something works and are excited to explain it to others.<\/p>\n<p>Famed adman David Ogilvy was the epitome of curiosity. He obsessed over understanding everything about the products he marketed and the people who bought them.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Copywriting-skills-example-ogilvy.jpg\" alt=\"Copywriting skills - copy of a David Ogilvy ad for a car\" width=\"721\" height=\"595\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73879 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Copywriting-skills-example-ogilvy.jpg 721w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Copywriting-skills-example-ogilvy-480x396.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 721px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Curiosity is the fuel that energizes every other skill on this list. If you\u2019re curious, you\u2019ll naturally be more empathic. You\u2019ll want to learn marketing strategy. And you\u2019ll be a crazy good interviewer.<\/p>\n<p>You can even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/10\/curiosity-gap\">leverage your audience\u2019s curiosity<\/a> to generate more awareness.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why I consider curiosity to be the most important copywriting skill.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Empathy<\/h2>\n<p>Empathy is an important <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/copywriting-101\">copywriting skill<\/a> because it gives us the power to imagine what a customer is battling with so we can explain our solution in a more relevant way.<\/p>\n<p>With a little empathy, you won\u2019t write that a family SUV has a state-of-the-art entertainment system. Instead, you\u2019ll say it has \u201cenough distraction that no one will ask \u2018are we there yet?\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Molly Maids gets it. They use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/22\/power-words\">power words<\/a> like \u201cchaos\u201d and \u201cstress\u201d to empathize with busy parents trying to hold it together during school break.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Copywriting-skills-pyramid-2.jpg\" alt=\"Copywriting skills - screenshot of a Molly Maids ad\" width=\"475\" height=\"595\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73880 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Copywriting-skills-pyramid-2.jpg 475w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Copywriting-skills-pyramid-2-239x300.jpg 239w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Empathy is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scn.ucla.edu\/pdf\/Rameson(2009).pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">neurological response<\/a>, so most of us have it naturally. But you can <a href=\"https:\/\/ideas.ted.com\/5-exercises-to-help-you-build-more-empathy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sharpen the skill<\/a> with practice.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\ud83d\ude0a Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite120WordsforMarketingWithEmotion.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_120WordsPhrases_Download\">Best Words &amp; Phrases for Marketing with Emotion<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<h2>3. Goal setting<\/h2>\n<p>When writing, it\u2019s easy to get lost in turning fun phrases and overusing alliteration. But it\u2019s important to remember that copywriting, by nature, needs a specific goal. It may be to increase awareness of your brand or to have people click a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/20\/call-to-action-examples\">call-to-action button<\/a> in an ad.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Copywriting-skills-example-manpacks.jpg\" alt=\"Copywriting skills - ad for ManPack underwear\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73881 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Copywriting-skills-example-manpacks.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Copywriting-skills-example-manpacks-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Either way, the goal is your destination and copywriting is how you get there.<\/p>\n<p>Goal setting is an important copywriting skill because, without it, you won\u2019t likely be aligned with your organization&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-plan-goals-objectives-for-small-businesses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing objectives<\/a>. Maybe you write copy targeting the wrong type of customers. Or you might be aiming for clicks when the real need is <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/lead-generation-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new leads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Since the goal determines how you\u2019ll research and write copy, goal setting lands high up on this list.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Understanding marketing<\/h2>\n<p>I\u2019ve yet to be in a situation where something I wrote wasn\u2019t part of a larger <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/02\/b2b-marketing-strategies\">marketing strategy<\/a>. The more I learn about other disciplines like <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/local-marketing-lab\/ppc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PPC<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/local-marketing-lab\/local-social-media-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media marketing<\/a>, the more effective I am at writing copy that makes those initiatives successful. That\u2019s how understanding marketing makes its way to the number four spot of important copywriting skills.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/01\/content-marketing-funnel\">Sales funnels<\/a> are a foundational concept for marketers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Copywriting-skills-marketing-funnel-1.jpg\" alt=\"Copywriting skills - marketing funnel\" width=\"526\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73882 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Copywriting-skills-marketing-funnel-1.jpg 526w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Copywriting-skills-marketing-funnel-1-480x547.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 526px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Once I understood how customers moved through a sales funnel, I was better able to write copy that made each transition smoother. It was especially helpful when I got into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/25\/email-copywriting-tips\">writing email marketing copy<\/a>. I stopped trying to convert every reader and started educating and entertaining people who weren\u2019t ready to buy. Open rates went up and subscriber churn went down.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Applying the four Cs of copywriting<\/h2>\n<p>The four Cs that describe good copywriting are: clear, credible, concise, and compelling. When you apply them to your copy, it naturally gets better.<\/p>\n<p>The real copywriting skill here though is to know in which order to apply the four Cs.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how I consider it:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Copy should always be clear.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Above all else, a reader needs to understand your message. Whatever else you do, make sure it\u2019s clear.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Copy should be credible, as long as it remains clear.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/03\/ad-copy-examples\">Copywriting needs to build trust.<\/a> Add customer stories, mention awards, etc. to show you\u2019re good at what you do.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Copywriting-skills-example-FAB.jpg\" alt=\"Copywriting skills - Marked up ad highlighting social proof and image\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73883 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Copywriting-skills-example-FAB.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Copywriting-skills-example-FAB-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Just make sure those additions don\u2019t muddy the message.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Copy should be concise, as long as it\u2019s still clear and credible.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t have much time to get your point across. So cut any words or phrases that don\u2019t serve that purpose. That said, you don\u2019t want to remove so many words that people don\u2019t know what you mean.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Copy should be compelling as long as it\u2019s still clear, concise, and credible.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Copy needs to motivate people to think or do something. You can use some power words, a sense of urgency, or analogies to bring it all home.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a thin line between compelling and pushy, though. If you can&#8217;t add more compelling copy without losing credibility (or without making it too long), then trim it down and focus on the other points.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Explaining the complex simply<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s a phrase in education and marketing called explain it like I\u2019m five (ELI5). The idea is to break down complex topics and present them in a way a five-year-old could understand. That\u2019s an incredibly useful skill for a copywriter since you\u2019re often the translator between technical people that make a product and non-technical people who use it.<\/p>\n<p>There are lots of ways to use ELI5. You can use a conversational tone, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/16\/copywriting-formulas\">use copywriting formulas<\/a>, or add <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/20\/copywriting-techniques\">bridge phrases<\/a> to keep readers engaged.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Interviewing like a detective<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s an old detective TV show called Columbo. In it, the title character kindly, yet incessantly, asks suspects \u201cjust one more question\u201d until he understands exactly what happened on the night of the murder.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Copywriting-skills-meme-columbo-2.jpg\" alt=\"Copywriting skills - meme featuring Columbo\" width=\"677\" height=\"594\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73884 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Copywriting-skills-meme-columbo-2.jpg 677w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Copywriting-skills-meme-columbo-2-480x421.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 677px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Interviews aren\u2019t interrogations. But when you approach a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/customer-feedback-questions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">customer<\/a> or subject matter expert with the drive to get the whole picture, you\u2019ll ask that one more question that exposes a killer story.<\/p>\n<h2>8. Applying psychology<\/h2>\n<p>One of my biggest regrets is not minoring in psychology. Not because I want to know how to hack people\u2019s brains to sell more. But to better understand how people process information and to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/21\/emotional-ad-copy-examples\">write better emotional ad copy<\/a>. That\u2019s a skill any copywriter would benefit from.<\/p>\n<p>In lieu of registering for formal classes, copywriters can learn about<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/01\/psychology-copywriting-tips-examples\"> specific psychological principles<\/a> and practice folding them into their copy. There are also plenty of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/13\/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing\">existing examples of emotional copy<\/a> to study.<\/p>\n<h2>9. Prioritizing like a journalist<\/h2>\n<p>Are you familiar with the inverted pyramid? It was one of the first principles I learned in my Journalism 101 class. Essentially, it\u2019s how reporters place the most important information at the top of the page, and then add supporting details after.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/inverted-pyramid-structure.jpg\" alt=\"Copywriting skills - Inverted pyramid graphic\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-73896\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/inverted-pyramid-structure.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/inverted-pyramid-structure-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In other communication disciplines, it\u2019s called BLUF (bottom line up front).<\/p>\n<p>Either way, it\u2019s a really useful skill for writing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/14\/ppc-ad-copywriting\">Google Ads copy<\/a> and anything optimized for small screens where most of your message is below the fold.<\/p>\n<h2>10. Checking your ego<\/h2>\n<p>I learned early in my career that ego is the killer of great copy for several reasons.<\/p>\n<p>First, copywriting is a team sport. The best work happens when people with various experiences collaborate. That means being open to ideas from people who don\u2019t have a writing background.<\/p>\n<p>Second, you sometimes have to delete your favorite bits of copy. The unflattering term is \u201ckilling your darlings,\u201d and it means removing really well-written copy that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/16\/copywriting-mistakes\">doesn\u2019t match the tone<\/a> or target of the piece.<\/p>\n<p>And finally, you&#8217;ll often <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/15\/copywriting-tips\">need to write something bad<\/a> to get to something good. When I first started writing, I would bang away at the keyboard, aggressively hit backspace, then pound the keys even harder while trying a new angle. Eventually, I learned to just let a bad version flow first, even if it hurts my pride. There are always rounds of edits to make it great.<\/p>\n<h2>11. Understanding SEO basics<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019re getting toward the bottom of the list, but I don\u2019t want to give the impression that SEO isn\u2019t important. Even now in the age of zero-click posts and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/ai-content-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI-powered everything<\/a>, a lot of traffic comes from those search engine results pages. And often, it\u2019s people in the middle of looking for things you sell.<\/p>\n<p>Copywriting for SEO is its own skill. You need to know <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">how to find keywords<\/a> and fit them into your copy organically. You also should understand things like page structure and alt tags. It takes a little time to master, but SEO copywriting skills are an important arrow in a marketer\u2019s quiver.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re learning this skill, these<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/12\/03\/seo-copywriting\"> 9 SEO copywriting tips<\/a> will help you get pages ranked high on Google and Bing.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\u26a1\ufe0fSpeaking of ranking higher\u2026download our free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite10WaysFirstPageGoogle.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_10WaysFirstPageGoogle_Download\">How to Get on the First Page of Google<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<h2>12. Focusing on value<\/h2>\n<p>I first learned about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/06\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells\">FAB (feature, advantage, benefit)<\/a> in a class on sales, years before I started writing. The point of the class was to teach us the difference between a characteristic of a product (feature), how it helps (advantage), and why that will make a customer\u2019s life better (benefit).<\/p>\n<p>The lesson was, to make a product more relevant and valuable, highlight the benefit.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Copywriting-skills-FAB.jpg\" alt=\"Copywriting skills - marked up add highlighting the feature and benefit of a product.\" width=\"936\" height=\"348\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73886 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Copywriting-skills-FAB.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Copywriting-skills-FAB-480x178.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For example, the feature of a new mop could be its spring-loaded wringer. The advantage is that it needs less force to push dirty water out of the mop head. But we\u2019d lead with the benefit, \u201cless effort, faster cleaning.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>13. Keeping your attention on detail\u2026<\/h2>\n<p>My first grownup job was as a sales manager for a large retail chain. Our mantra for putting up new displays or stocking shelves was \u201cretail is detail.\u201d While the rhyme falls apart, being detail-oriented is a clutch skill for copywriting as well.<\/p>\n<p>There are dollars behind why paying attention to detail is important. Companies with frequent grammar and spelling mistakes on their website lose <a href=\"https:\/\/martechseries.com\/sales-marketing\/programmatic-buying\/website-speling-grammer-mistakes-cost-us-businesses-millions-lost-customers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">double the amount<\/a> of customers than businesses without those errors. Plus, Google Ads with typos get <a href=\"https:\/\/www.agilitypr.com\/pr-news\/public-relations\/website-spelling-and-grammar-errors-are-costlier-than-you-may-think\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fewer clicks and cost more per click<\/a> than other ads.<\/p>\n<h2>14. \u2026while being comfortable enough to break grammar rules<\/h2>\n<p>Tools like Grammarly and even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/03\/06\/how-to-use-chatgpt-for-small-business-marketing\">ChatGPT<\/a> make getting grammar right pretty easy. The real challenge is adeptly going against the rules when it helps your copy.<\/p>\n<p>As the great Ann Handley put it in her book <a href=\"https:\/\/annhandley.com\/everybodywrites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Everybody Writes<\/a>, \u201cI encourage you to safely and fearlessly break those rules and to make those mistakes in writing\u2014but only when doing so lends greater clarity and readability.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So fire up your spell and grammar checkers. But learn from the things they correct. Then, when the opportunity presents itself, you can blur grammatical lines to write better copy.<\/p>\n<h2>Gain copywriting skills from the experts<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/website-copywriting\">Copywriting<\/a> isn&#8217;t just for full-time, professional marketers.
