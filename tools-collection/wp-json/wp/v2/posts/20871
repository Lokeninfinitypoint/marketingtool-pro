We\u2019ll be focusing on these concepts primarily from an SEO perspective, but we\u2019ll also be dipping into some PPC-related topics, too.<\/p>\n<h2>What Is Keyword Search Volume?<\/h2>\n<p>As the term implies, keyword search volume refers to the volume (or number) of searches for a particular keyword in a given timeframe. Keyword search volume is typically averaged over a set timeframe to provide marketers with a general idea of a search term\u2019s competitiveness and overall volume. This data is often contextualized within specific timeframes to allow SEOs and marketers to see how certain keywords drive traffic over time.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/09\/adwords-tips-for-seasonal-businesses\">Seasonality<\/a> often plays a significant role in keyword search volume. Yes, the most diligent bargain-hunters may begin their search for \u201cChristmas gift ideas\u201d in July, but most people will wait until October or November before conducting this kind of search.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/keyword-search-volume-seasonal-keywords.png\" alt=\"Keyword Search Volume seasonal keywords example\" width=\"1266\" height=\"670\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Keyword Seasonality (Image via Energy Circle)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Other search terms are \u201cevergreen,\u201d meaning there\u2019s no seasonal or timeliness associated with them, and their search volume stays steady over time.

However, keyword search volume should be part of the foundation upon which your efforts should be built \u2013 but how do you know which range of volumes you should be targeting?<\/p>\n<h3>Balancing Volume with Competition<\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to keyword search volume, there are two primary factors to take into consideration: volume and competitiveness. Keywords with higher volumes mean more potential exposure (or <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/10\/28\/adwords-impression-share\">impression share<\/a>), but will likely be much more competitive. This, in turn, makes it harder to rank for these terms as you\u2019ll probably be going up against well-established publishers and sites, or higher CPCs if you\u2019re bidding on these terms as part of a paid search campaign.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/keyword-search-volume-averages-competition.png\" alt=\"Keyword search volume comparing average volume with competition\" width=\"763\" height=\"531\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Evaluating the average monthly search volume for an ad group vs. the competition<br \/>\nof its keywords<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Knowing which types of terms to target depends largely on your situation and goals. If you\u2019re a brand-new website, you may want to begin by targeting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/26\/low-volume-keywords\">low-volume, low-competition keywords<\/a> as a starting point to establish some domain authority. Alternatively, if you\u2019re a well-established site with strong organic rankings, you may want to delve into slightly more competitive territory to maintain your edge.<\/p>\n<h2>How Site Authority Should Inform Your Targeting Strategy<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to SEO, there are potentially thousands of factors that can impact your rankings, not least of which include your location, the nature of your site or business, and the quality of your content (more on this shortly).<\/p>\n<p>However, among the most important of these factors is your domain authority. Before we get into the weeds of how your site authority should inform your targeting strategy, let\u2019s take a lightning-quick look at some of these terms.<\/p>\n<h3>What Is Domain Authority?<\/h3>\n<p>Although <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/learn\/seo\/domain-authority\">domain authority<\/a> is a general SEO concept, it\u2019s also a defined metric created by our friends at Moz that evaluates the strength of a website (or domain) on a logarithmic scale of 0-100. The higher the score, the stronger the site.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/keyword-search-volume-moz-domain-authority.png\" alt=\"Keyword search volume BBC domain authority example\" width=\"600\" height=\"139\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Sample data for the domain authority of bbc.co.uk. Image via Moz.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Moz uses around 40 ranking signals, such as the total number of links to a given domain, to determine a site\u2019s domain authority.<\/p>\n<h3>What Metrics Affect Domain Authority?<\/h3>\n<p>While Moz examines around 40 signals to determine domain authority, one of the most important is a site\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/help\/guides\/moz-pro-overview\/links\/link-analysis\">link profile<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/keyword-search-volume-moz-link-profile.gif\" alt=\"Keyword search volume Moz link profile data example\" width=\"446\" height=\"253\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Examining link profiles using Moz<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Moz\u2019s data (and independent research by leading SEOs around the world) strongly suggests a direct correlation between strong link profiles and higher organic rankings. Your site\u2019s link profile is impacted by both the number of external links to your site \u2013 links to your website from other websites \u2013 and the quality of those links.<\/p>\n<p>An external link from a well-known and respected domain such as a .gov domain or a site such as BBC News is worth significantly more than a link from a tiny upstart blog hosted on WordPress.com, for example. More high-quality links means a stronger link profile.<\/p>\n<h3>Which Keywords Should I Be Targeting?<\/h3>\n<p>Now that we know a little more about domain authority, it\u2019s time for the $64,000 question \u2013 which keywords should you be targeting?<\/p>\n<p>The answer? It depends.<\/p>\n<p>I know that\u2019s not the answer you were hoping for, but unfortunately, as with virtually everything in digital marketing, there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all solution. Ultimately, the keywords you choose to target will be affected by your domain authority, your goals, and the search volume and competitiveness of the keywords you\u2019re going after.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/keyword-search-volume-low-competition-keywords.png\" alt=\"Keyword search volume low competition keywords\" width=\"800\" height=\"349\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>This screenshot, taken from a Russian AdWords account, shows that the query<br \/>\n\u201cjpg to pdf\u201d has a healthy average search volume and low competition<\/em><\/p>\n<p>However, that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t any rough guidelines you can use when it comes to SEO. Newer sites or those with lower domain authority may want to target <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/07\/low-search-volume-keywords\">lower-volume<\/a>, less competitive keywords to attract external links and establish more authority in your space. Over time, you can become more confident and\/or aggressive in how you target keywords, but don\u2019t forget to ensure that the keywords you\u2019re targeting are relevant to your business and your website as a whole.<\/p>\n<p>But what if you\u2019ve set your sights on a highly competitive keyword with enormous search volume?
