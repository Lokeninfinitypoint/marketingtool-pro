There\u2019s never such a thing as too much info. And\u00a0from what I can tell, one of the best insights tools out there is widely underutilized.\u00a0LinkedIn Website Demographics. This feature within the LinkedIn Campaign Manager allows you to view your ad traffic segmented by profile targeting parameters\u2014job function or company size, for example.<\/p>\n<p>The tool unlocks invaluable information that can be used to build better campaigns,\u00a0improve on existing ones, and get the most out of your budget. And yet as I mentioned, it&#8217;s hardly discussed.\u00a0Today\u2019s post will be my attempt to remedy that a bit and help you achieve better performance out of your LinkedIn campaigns.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"53436d03-c5c2-48e3-b6e7-804f52d89de1\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/linkedin20website20demographics20linkedin20ad20example.jpg\" alt=\"linkedin website demographics linkedin ad example\" width=\"602\" height=\"514\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>From our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/05\/linkedin-advertising\">LinkedIn Advertising Guide<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>In particular, I&#8217;m\u00a0going to outline\u00a0three things you can do with the\u00a0data from the LinkedIn Website Demographic tool to optimize your campaign performance:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Understand, segment, and create better audiences.<\/li>\n<li>Identify top-performing audience segments to focus on.<\/li>\n<li>Optimize existing LinkedIn ad campaigns.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Using LinkedIn Website Demographics to identify ideal audiences<\/h2>\n<p>Although we all feel like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/18\/beginners-guide-to-target-markets\">we know our target audience <\/a>pretty well, it\u2019s important to know how the platforms see them. We might think someone has a certain level of seniority or a certain job function, but LinkedIn could view it a different way. For this reason, it\u2019s important to review how your audience stacks up in LinkedIn\u2019s eyes so you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/27\/prospecting-strategies-during-covid-19\">build prospecting campaigns<\/a> accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>To find this data, go to the\u00a0LinkedIn Campaign Manager, and in\u00a0the dark blue upper portion of the top navigation, you\u2019ll find a link for the Website Demographics section of the interface.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6166e205-b10f-43a4-a556-2f02897dd292\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/website20demographics20linkedin20dashboard.png\" alt=\"website demographics tab in linkedin dashboard\" width=\"800\" height=\"195\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Here you\u2019ll see the user information from your website, but broken down by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/25\/linkedin-interest-targeting\">LinkedIn targeting options<\/a>. So let\u2019s go through this feature to\u00a0outline all we can do with it.<\/p>\n<h3>View website visitors by job function<\/h3>\n<p>LinkedIn Website Demographics\u00a0shows you the percent of page views on your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/websites-landing-pages\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">website<\/a> broken down by Job Function. \u00a0Are sales team members most interested in your ads? Or perhaps you attract\u00a0more business\u00a0development folks. Knowing the job functions of your audiences, you can cater your ad copy and messaging for better results.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ecdea68e-cec3-4c8f-b250-c9c8d43c6190\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/website20demographics20linkedin20website20demographics20section.png\" alt=\"linkedin website demographics\u2014screenshot of reporting by job function\" width=\"800\" height=\"523\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Further segment by pixel<\/h3>\n<p>In the &#8220;B2B\u00a0site&#8221; example above, you can see below\u00a0that I&#8217;m viewing &#8220;all visitors,&#8221; but if you click on the dropdown, you can change the audience to be any audience from your website pixel\u00a0users. If there\u2019s not an audience listed that you want to see, you can easily create it right from this view.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"dce4bea0-fae5-4f21-9baa-6ad0359d17cc\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Website20demographics20linkedin20audience20filtering_0.png\" alt=\"linkedin website demographics\u2014screenshot of audience filtering option\" width=\"280\" height=\"362\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Compare audiences<\/h3>\n<p>In addition to segmenting audiences, you can also compare them. On the right, next to that audience dropdown tab, there\u2019s a \u201cCompare to website audience\u201d dropdown where you can choose a second group to view at the same time.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"b6b0772b-f6d1-42f6-b8c5-1cef873cb256\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/website20demographics20linkedin20compare20to20website20audience.png\" alt=\"linkedin website demographics\u2014screenshot of report comparing job function and conversions\" width=\"800\" height=\"421\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve selected your second audience, you can see the differences between their makeups with two-color bar charts. This is great because\u00a0if one audience is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/07\/linkedin-lead-generation\">performing better <\/a>than another or intrinsically has higher value, you can see how they are represented on LinkedIn and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/17\/remarketing-audiences\">craft target audiences<\/a> to focus on those better, higher value lists.<\/p>\n<p>For example, in the image above, I\u2019ve added a &#8220;converting users&#8221; list to compare to a general page visitors list. Here I can see that I\u00a0have a high share of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/11\/get-more-conversions\">conversions<\/a> coming from the Business Development Job Function group,\u00a0 but a group like Support sees a decent number of page views and no conversions. So maybe I exclude the Support Job Function from my campaigns moving forward.<\/p>\n<h3>Customize views by date range<\/h3>\n<p>Additionally, we can continue to adjust the view to be a little more customized to our needs. You\u2019ll notice there\u2019s a date range picker in the upper right of the LinkedIn Website Demographics interface that allows you to choose from a list of presets\u00a0or create a custom timeframe.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3acfed15-79f1-47d1-8049-5afd87ea8b11\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/LinkedIn20Website20Demographics20date20range.png\" alt=\"linkedin website demographics\u2014screenshot of customizing date range\" width=\"800\" height=\"577\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>This can be immensely useful, especially if you made any changes to branding or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/28\/cross-channel-lead-generation\">other acquisition channels<\/a>, as the makeup of these audiences could be drastically different depending on the date range.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1d22eb47-46c8-488f-8fab-37fba6fac1a7\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/website20demographics20linkedin20job20function.png\" alt=\"linkedin website demographics\u2014screenshot of job function in drop down list\" width=\"150\" height=\"296\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Analyze by more than just job function<\/h3>\n<p>Job function isn\u2019t the only demographic you can look at with LinkedIn Website Demographics.

But the LinkedIn Website Demographics tool does not stop being useful once you hit launch. You can also review demographics data for your individual campaigns and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/24\/facebook-insights\">use the insights to improve performance<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a6cafa56-dea5-46fc-826a-2a36128e480a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/linkedin20website20demographics20improve20campaign20performance.png\" alt=\"linkedin website demographics\u2014individual campaign reporting option\" width=\"800\" height=\"292\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>To use the LinkedIn Website Demographics feature for a particular campaign, just click the check box next to the campaign name and click the &#8220;Demographics&#8221; button in the top navigation. From there, you\u2019ll have views that are relatively similar to the other demographics interface, but with a couple key differences:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, there aren\u2019t ways to compare audiences since there\u2019s only one audience per campaign.<\/li>\n<li>Second, and most importantly, this page has a number of more stats as it\u2019s focused on showing the performance for each segment within the campaign. This is where you can get some really good insights on how your LinkedIn campaign is performing and find some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/24\/google-ads-optimization\">strategies for optimization<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f13628d6-6d3b-4bc3-ba13-c8958bdfae00\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/linkedin20website20demographics20insights20and20optimization20.png\" alt=\"linkedinwebsite demographics\u2014example of individual campaign report\" width=\"800\" height=\"395\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The page will almost always default to show top line metrics for Job Function. As with the image above, you\u2019ll be able to see Impressions, Clicks,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/11\/average-click-through-rate\"> Average CTR<\/a>, Conversions, and Conversion Rate for each of these Job Functions.<\/p>\n<p>One thing to note about this page is that the Impressions, Clicks, and Conversions won\u2019t always add up to the full total of the campaign. There is a \u201creporting minimum\u201d LinkedIn uses to help keep some user privacy, so if your campaign has 15 conversions and you only see 12 accounted for in the report, they\u2019re likely spread too thin between the other values for LinkedIn to share.<\/p>\n<p>Just like the other demographics portion, you can change the date range for your campaigns and you can also choose <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/23\/google-display-ads\">different display options<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Using LinkedIn Website Demographics to optimize ad performance<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you know the data you can see using the LinkedIn Website Demographics tool, let\u2019s get into how you can use it.<\/p>\n<p>The way I approach<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/29\/linkedin-advertising-during-covid-19\"> LinkedIn advertising<\/a>\u00a0optimization through the demographics insight report is to review the performance for the same type of targeting I\u2019m using. Since LinkedIn sometimes prohibits you from excluding audiences that aren\u2019t using the same targeting options, it\u2019s important to make sure you\u2019re looking at actionable data.<\/p>\n<p>So\u00a0if I\u2019m targeting users with Job Function, I\u2019ll start there. But\u00a0if I\u2019m targeting with Job Titles, that\u2019s where I\u2019ll focus.<\/p>\n<p>Based on the data\u00a0you can see in LinkedIn Website Demographics, you can then either exclude low-performing segments or create new campaigns to better focus on a top-performing group.<\/p>\n<p>Think of this just like you would any other advertising platform where we want to focus on the best performing audiences and make sure you&#8217;re speaking to them in the way that gives them the most benefit and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/04\/nurture-marketing\">increases your chances of landing them as a customer<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Start using the LinkedIn Website Demographics tool for better ads<\/h2>\n<p>There are lots of ways we can optimize our LinkedIn campaigns, whether it\u2019s through bid strategies, ad copy adjustments, or by adjusting our audience before launch or after by focusing on the most important demographics. Use the LinkedIn Website Demographics tool to help ensure you\u2019re not only targeting the right audience, but also the one that performs the best. There&#8217;s a lot to know about this tool, so let&#8217;s recap:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The LinkedIn Website Demographics feature\u00a0allows you to see LinkedIn ad traffic to your website, broken down by your LinkedIn targeting criteria. You can use it to:<\/li>\n<li>Segment your audience\u00a0by job function, company size, geography, and more.<\/li>\n<li>Compare audiences to see your highest converting groups.<\/li>\n<li>View deeper metrics within each job function for individual ads.<\/li>\n<li>Get a\u00a0better understanding of who is clicking on your LinkedIn ads to better target your campaigns and messaging.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This post covers three ways to use the Linkedin Website Demographics tool to improve your ad performance, including better understanding and creating ideal audiences;
