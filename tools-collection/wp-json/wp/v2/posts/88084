The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ai-overviews\">reactions and results<\/a>\u2014both positive and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-overviews-breaking-search\">negative<\/a>\u2014rolled in rapidly. This year, expect Google to expand its use of AIOs and other generative AI features to more queries.<\/p>\n<p>The appearance of AI Overviews is increasing. In June last year, they showed up in about <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/google-ai-overviews-visibility-new-low-444048\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">7%<\/a> of searches. By November, that number jumped to nearly <a href=\"https:\/\/seranking.com\/blog\/ai-overviews-2024-recap-research\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">20%<\/a>. For some informational-intent heavy industries, like business and technology, over a third of SERPs had an AIO.<\/p>\n<p>Google is also testing other <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ai-mode\">applications for AI<\/a> on SERPs.

Answer engines may become top non-Google traffic sources<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019ve already talked about how AIOs are expanding. But other big AI players are also growing in the search answer engine space, and they\u2019re attracting more search users along the way. That\u2019s driving an uptick in non-Google search <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/11\/29\/referral-traffic#:~:text=Referral%20traffic%20refers%20to%20traffic,site%20that%27s%20not%20your%20own.\">referral traffic<\/a> that will accelerate in 2025.<\/p>\n<p>OpenAI launched <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/chatgpt-searchnoopener\">ChatGPT search<\/a> at the end of 2024.

That may be a small slice, but it\u2019s from a <em>very<\/em> large pie.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Perplexity, one of the first true answer engines to use up-to-date online information, has amassed over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessofapps.com\/data\/perplexity-ai-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">15 million<\/a> users. While that pales in comparison to Google\u2019s roughly three billion regular users, it does show a significant quarterly growth trend.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/seo-trends-wordstream-perplexity.webp\" alt=\"SEO trends - Perplexity result.\" width=\"691\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88091 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/seo-trends-wordstream-perplexity.webp 691w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/seo-trends-wordstream-perplexity-480x417.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 691px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Perplexity places citations prominently at the top of the page, driving its growth in referral traffic.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The big news here is the swift acceleration of referral traffic coming from these two new answer engines.

Community search results are an ongoing SEO trend<\/h3>\n<p>Heman Patel, senior SEO analyst at LocaliQ, sees online communities as a big focus area for SEOs in 2025. \u201cCommunity search results are here to stay,\u201d he said. \u201cGoogle will continue to show search results from forums and communities like Reddit and Quora. Businesses should engage with communities where their customers hang out.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>We saw forums, especially <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/drive-traffic-from-reddit\">Reddit<\/a>, get a huge lift from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/august-2024-google-core-update\">August core update<\/a>. That\u2019s when Google really began prioritizing forum content in SERPs.

That may be through direct engagement in those forums or by optimizing content and publishing it there.<\/p>\n<div id=\"optimizing-for-sales-in-seo\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Optimizing for sales becomes more important<\/h3>\n<p>Another interesting SEO trend started to emerge towards the end of 2024. SEOs and marketers began talking a lot more about how to optimize down-funnel content for search. So, instead of hyper-focusing on high-level informational content, there is a new push to distribute mid and bottom-of-the-funnel content through search engines.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/samdunning\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sam Dunning<\/a>, founder of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.breakingb2b.com\/b2b-seo-agency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">B2B SEO agency<\/a> Breaking B2B and host of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.breakingb2b.com\/blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Breaking B2B podcast<\/a>, sees this as a big opportunity in the coming year. \u201cOptimising for search and sales so content enables your sales team by leveraging customer research, questions, and objections from sales calls is important. That way, it not only ranks but also resonates, builds trust, and converts clients.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A study of 50 brands from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.seoworks.co.uk\/how-brand-impacts-seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Seoworks<\/a> suggests that Google may actually favor websites with a high percentage of branded content.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/seo-trends-wordstream-performers-chart.webp\" alt=\"SEO trends - Seoworks graph of search results.\" width=\"859\" height=\"431\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88094 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/seo-trends-wordstream-performers-chart.webp 859w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/seo-trends-wordstream-performers-chart-480x241.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 859px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.seoworks.co.uk\/how-brand-impacts-seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a negative to adding a little product or brand promotion to your SEO content. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to weave in \u2018a-ha\u2019 moments of product into articles that you hope to drive leads and revenue from,\u201d Sam said. \u201cFor example, add video, gifs, and demos so content can sell for you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sam also mentioned that brands driving the most pipeline revenue from SEO are the ones who \u201cquickly identify and approve money bottom-funnel keywords.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/andrew-holland-seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Andrew Holland<\/a>, director of SEO at JBH, wrote about why \u201cSEO content needs a business-first mindset.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That means, \u201cWhen you create content for SEO, it must always be linked to business goals. Because sadly, there is way too much content in SEO that was created for traffic as a vanity metric,\u201d Andrew said.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re seeing more pros share how they use SEO to convert customers, not just attract them. For example, this <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/emotion-driven-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article by copywriter Tasmin Lofthouse<\/a> on the Moz blog explains how to use \u201cEmotional SEO\u201d to increase your sales.<\/p>\n<p>While marketers may be on edge about a potential drop in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/03\/organic-traffic\">organic search traffic<\/a>, it\u2019s clear they\u2019re thinking about how to shorten the journey buyers take from SERPs to purchase. If these early trials net more customers faster, you can bet we\u2019ll see more sales copy find its way into SEO content.<\/p>\n<div id=\"first-hand-experience-in-seo-top-trend\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. First-hand experience becomes a critical SEO trend in 2025<\/h3>\n<p>For years, Google has called out the need to bake first-hand experience and expertise into SEO content. But the prevalence of AI-generated content and users\u2019 search for authenticity have made those qualities critical for anyone trying to rank content in 2025 and beyond.<\/p>\n<p>Google claimed that experience, expertise, authority, and trust (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/14\/google-e-e-a-t\">E-E-A-T<\/a>) were at the center of its quality rater guidelines\u2014the rules its human reviewers use to qualify good content. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-algorithm-documents-leak\">Google API leak<\/a> that circulated in 2024 referenced \u201cOriginalContentScore\u201d as a ranking factor. This means Google does indeed consider how novel the information on a webpage is before deciding where to place it in the SERPs.<\/p>\n<p>Like we mentioned before, users are also turning to forums for more original content filled with personal experiences and expert input. Marketers who attempt to flood SERPs with AI-only content won\u2019t rank in the long term. It\u2019s brands that can mine their internal data, expert network, and user surveys for new ideas that will rise in the rankings in 2025.<\/p>\n<p>What does this elevated experiential content look like?

The shift to user-centric SEO crystalizes<\/h3>\n<p>Another important SEO trend for 2025 is the shift from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">keyword-focused optimization<\/a> to user-focused optimization. In other words, we\u2019ll need to address<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-intent\"> intent<\/a> and answer the granular questions users now ask instead of highly optimizing for one specific keyword.<\/p>\n<p>Consider this: Only<a href=\"https:\/\/surferseo.com\/blog\/ai-overviews-study\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> 5.4%<\/a> of Google AIOs contained an exact query match in one large-scale study. That\u2019s not a surprise since one of AI\u2019s superpowers is understanding the context of natural language. But since AIOs are a bellwether for search as a whole, it\u2019s a point of proof that, more than ever, SEO needs to focus on user intent over exact phrase matching.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/seo-trends-wordstream-google-visit-thailand-result.webp\" alt=\"SEO trends - Example of a AIO without matching keyword.\" width=\"809\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88096 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/seo-trends-wordstream-google-visit-thailand-result.webp 809w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/seo-trends-wordstream-google-visit-thailand-result-480x356.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 809px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/surferseo.com\/blog\/ai-overviews-study\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Surferseo<\/em><\/a><em> used this example to show that intent, not keyword matching, matters more now.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The Google API leak and what we learned from the<a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/former-googler-google-using-clicks-in-rankings-432401\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Google antitrust trial<\/a> backed this up. Specifically, we saw that Google\u2019s Navboost system considers not just click count but a variety of click types, like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>badClicks<\/li>\n<li>goodClicks<\/li>\n<li>lastLongestClicks<\/li>\n<li>unsquashedClicks<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/seo-trends-wordstream-google-api-leak.webp\" alt=\"SEO trends - Google API leak screenshot.\" width=\"730\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88097 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/seo-trends-wordstream-google-api-leak.webp 730w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/seo-trends-wordstream-google-api-leak-480x395.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 730px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sparktoro.com\/blog\/an-anonymous-source-shared-thousands-of-leaked-google-search-api-documents-with-me-everyone-in-seo-should-see-them\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This means Google cares about how its users engage with your content, not just if they click into it, which brings us back to meeting the real intent of a search, not just matching a keyword.<\/p>\n<p>Now, consider how AI chatbots and answer engines provide information. They\u2019re like Google\u2019s featured snippet on steroids. You&#8217;ll need to provide more concise answers to granular questions to get cited in Google\u2019s AIOs (and other answer engines).<\/p>\n<p>Bernard Huang <a href=\"https:\/\/www.clearscope.io\/blog\/ranch-style-seo-content-strategy#reason-1-shift-from-keyword-centric-to-topic-centric-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">provided<\/a> an interesting perspective here. He suggests that \u201cRanch Style\u201d SEO content is the replacement of the old skyscraper post. Instead of creating one giant asset that ticks all the keyword boxes, SEOs should produce several shorter, more focused pieces that interlink.<\/p>\n<p>Bernard said each of those pieces should include some experience and information others don\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/seo-trends-wordstream-ranch-seo.webp\" alt=\"SEO trends - Ranch style SEO graph.\" width=\"879\" height=\"534\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88098 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/seo-trends-wordstream-ranch-seo.webp 879w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/seo-trends-wordstream-ranch-seo-480x292.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 879px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.clearscope.io\/blog\/ranch-style-seo-content-strategy#reason-1-shift-from-keyword-centric-to-topic-centric-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>As we move deeper into 2025, we\u2019ll learn even more about which types of content are successful for both SEO and AEO. But the trends suggest that over-focusing on keywords is out while user and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-intent\">intent focuses<\/a> are in.<\/p>\n<div id=\"need-to-address-zero-click-searches\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. We\u2019ll need to address zero-click searches<\/h3>\n<p>The threat of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/23\/google-zero-search-results\">zero-click searches<\/a> has loomed large since Google first rolled out featured snippets. We\u2019ll likely see them become a bigger portion of searches this year. Marketers who currently rely on search traffic for growth will need to account for this new reality in their 2025 strategy.<\/p>\n<p>In July of 2024, Rand Fishkin <a href=\"https:\/\/sparktoro.com\/blog\/2024-zero-click-search-study-for-every-1000-us-google-searches-only-374-clicks-go-to-the-open-web-in-the-eu-its-360\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reviewed clickstream data<\/a> for Google users. He found that just over 41% of US searches ended up in a click. However, once you remove clicks going to Google-owned properties (e.g., Google Flights), only 360 of every 1,000 searches resulted in a click to open the web.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/seo-trends-wordstream-google-traffic-fishkin.webp\" alt=\"SEO trends - Fishkin's Google results graphic.\" width=\"755\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88099 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/seo-trends-wordstream-google-traffic-fishkin.webp 755w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/seo-trends-wordstream-google-traffic-fishkin-480x381.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 755px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sparktoro.com\/blog\/2024-zero-click-search-study-for-every-1000-us-google-searches-only-374-clicks-go-to-the-open-web-in-the-eu-its-360\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that this data confirms an upward trend. A <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/zero-click-study-semrush-389067\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2022 study<\/a> showed that zero-click results made up just a quarter of all searches.<\/p>\n<p>Could this be the effect of AIOs? Probably not, since AIOs weren\u2019t showing up in a ton of searches in July. But that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t have an effect in the future.<a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/generative-ai-impact-website-rankings-traffic-443624\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Search Engine Land speculated<\/a> an increase in overall searches but a decrease in referral traffic due to AIOs. The jury\u2019s still out, but if AIOs have any effect, it\u2019ll be to increase zero-click searches, not decrease them.<\/p>\n<p>The growth of answer engines and the increasing use of social media sites as search platforms add to the zero-click trend. Perplexity, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc., work hard to keep users from clicking away from their platforms.<\/p>\n<p>There are still plenty of organic clicks to be had (even 30% of billions of searches is a lot). But we are also finally at a place where we can\u2019t ignore zero-click searches. That means in 2025, we\u2019ll all need some zero-click search strategies in our marketing plan.<\/p>\n<div id=\"saying-seo-is-dead-dies\"><\/div>\n<h3>8. Saying \u201cSEO is dead\u201d finally dies<\/h3>\n<p>For years, we\u2019ve heard the chorus that adaptations like zero-click searches and evolving algorithms would be the death of SEO. The data proves otherwise, and the tune is finally changing. Leading voices point out that search is thriving\u2014it just looks different and is happening in other places.<\/p>\n<p>Neil Patel Digital recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/posts\/neilkpatel_despite-what-everyone-thought-when-google-activity-7274822699070148608-Soz2?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ran a test<\/a> on 30,000 websites.
