It\u2019s a chance to celebrate great reviews and rectify the less-than-flattering ones.<\/p>\n<div id=\"network-with-complimentary-businesses\"><\/div>\n<h2>3. Network with complementary businesses<\/h2>\n<p>Other businesses in your sphere need clients, too. You can help each other out by trading referrals.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you focus on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/13\/content-marketing-strategy\">content marketing<\/a>, but one of your clients needs help running <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/ppc\">PPC campaigns<\/a>. Offer the lead to a PPC agency you trust and ask that they return the favor sometime.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/05\/linkedin-advertising\">LinkedIn<\/a> is an amazing place to build your professional network. Message complementary businesses and let them know you\u2019ll look out for them if they do the same.<\/p>\n<div id=\"turn-employees-into-ambassadors\"><\/div>\n<h2>4. Turn employees into ambassadors<\/h2>\n<p>Each of your employees has a network and a sphere of influence. As they work in their field longer, their influence grows. Tap into this network by helping your employees become ambassadors for your agency.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/how-to-get-clients-wordstream-example-ambassador-5.webp\" alt=\"Get more clients - example of an agency employee's post on Linkedin.\" width=\"476\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-78272 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/how-to-get-clients-wordstream-example-ambassador-5.webp 476w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/how-to-get-clients-wordstream-example-ambassador-5-238x300.webp 238w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 476px) 100vw, 476px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Even if it\u2019s just reposting content your agency creates, employees can introduce your agency to lots of new audiences.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>An easy way to do this is to ask your team to post about important company milestones on their social media accounts. Maybe it\u2019s your 100th client, 10-year anniversary, or the company retreat. Posts like this help build your brand without pushing a hard sell\u2014something many people would be reluctant to do on their personal feeds.<\/p>\n<p>Another option is to send employees to conferences. Junior team members can benefit from the educational and networking experience. Senior employees could be speakers or panelists. In either case, you\u2019ll have people out in the field drumming up awareness for your business.<\/p>\n<div id=\"share-your-secrets\"><\/div>\n<h2>5. Share your secrets<\/h2>\n<p>Most people will run marketing in house before they turn to an agency. Teach people how to do it themselves, and your agency will be at the top of the list when it\u2019s time to hire.<\/p>\n<p>That may sound counter-intuitive, but some of the biggest modern businesses grew rapidly using that exact technique.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/how-to-get-clients-wordstream-example-tiktok.webp\" alt=\"Get more clients - Screenshot of TikTok about PPC ads.\" width=\"422\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-78273 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/how-to-get-clients-wordstream-example-tiktok.webp 422w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/how-to-get-clients-wordstream-example-tiktok-211x300.webp 211w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>TikTok is a sleeper hit for educating prospective clients with quick, fun videos.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The good news is, there are plenty of formats and channels to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/13\/content-marketing-strategy\">educate<\/a> your future clients.

Present fixes to prospect\u2019s problems<\/h2>\n<p>This is an underrated tactic for getting new clients. Google companies in your target niche and see what their existing ad campaigns look like. Make a list of what you\u2019d do differently, then email the company with ideas for them to improve.<\/p>\n<p>This strategy works great for any type of marketing agency because advertising is, by nature, public. You can also use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/06\/digital-marketing-tools\">tools<\/a> like Ahrefs or Moz to learn more about what\u2019s working or not with your prospect\u2019s marketing efforts.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, some will take your thoughts and run with them.

Let\u2019s break this down.<\/p>\n<p>Do you offer a truly a premium option with white-glove service? Then your pricing should be a little higher than your average competitor. Not just to cover the costs of the additional service, but also to signal to clients that what you do is different.<\/p>\n<p>Alternatively, if your niche is helping fledgling businesses get a foothold online, and you do it at scale using automation, then your pricing might be lower. Again, it\u2019s not just about the cost-plus-profit calculation.

An ICP will help you find the clients that help you be more successful while filtering out those that\u2019ll drain your agency&#8217;s resources.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few steps you can use to create a basic ICP for your agency:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>List client traits you want to have on your ICP:<\/strong> For agencies, it\u2019ll be things like marketing goals, business model, company size, and industry.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Review past clients:<\/strong> Where do successful and less successful clients fall in these categories?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Create a point system:<\/strong> Assign points to each trait (so if your dental clients are always successful and construction clients aren\u2019t, then dental prospects get 3 points and construction prospects get 0).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Place all of this on a spreadsheet.
