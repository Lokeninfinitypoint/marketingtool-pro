The average monthly customer churn rate across industries is around 5%. That number doesn\u2019t seem massive on its face, but consider your growth rate.

Gather feedback and NPS scores<\/h3>\n<p>Our first actionable strategy to improve customer experience is arguably the most important: gather feedback and NPS scores. It\u2019s nearly impossible to improve your business processes, products, customer service, and marketing without understanding where you stand with your existing customers.<\/p>\n<p>NPS, or Net Promoter Score, is sort of a North Star <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-metrics\/\">metric<\/a> for customer satisfaction. It gauges how likely your customers are to recommend your products or services to their peers (read: <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/lead-generation-ideas\/\">get you more business<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>NPS is based on a simple survey question: &#8220;On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend our company\/product\/service to a friend or colleague?&#8221; Based on the responses, customers are classified into three categories:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Promoters (score 9-10): These are <strong>highly<\/strong> satisfied customers and brand advocates.<\/li>\n<li>Passives (score 7-8): These are <strong>moderately<\/strong> satisfied customers who may or may not recommend your company.<\/li>\n<li>Detractors (score 0-6): These customers are <strong>dissatisfied<\/strong> and unlikely to recommend your company.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/customer-experience-strategy-nps.webp\" alt=\"customer experience strategy - nps scale and how to calculate\" width=\"936\" height=\"370\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76345\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/customer-experience-strategy-nps.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/customer-experience-strategy-nps-480x190.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Your aggregate NPS score is measured by the <strong>percentage of detractors, subtracted from the percentage of promoters<\/strong>. Resulting scores can range from -100 to +100.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s a good NPS? The creators of NPS, Bain &amp; Company, say that an NPS score above 0 is good, above 20 is great, and above 50 is amazing. Anywhere above 80 is the top percentile.<\/p>\n<p>NPS is a great benchmark to get a feel for how positive an experience you\u2019re providing for your customers, but it\u2019s just one metric, and it doesn\u2019t give you detailed insight into what needs to change. If you want to go deeper, you need to incorporate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/10\/best-online-survey-tools\">customer surveys<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Leverage customer surveys<\/h3>\n<p>Utilizing surveys can help you identify (and improve upon) both positive and negative trends in your customer service that, ultimately, determine whether or not your customers are satisfied.<\/p>\n<p>Customer experience is too often a one-sided proposition. Between marketing and sales, it\u2019s easy to spend 95%-100% of your time <em>telling<\/em> customers how they should feel about your business and its products.<\/p>\n<p>Surveys open up a dialogue with your customers and make that proposition two-sided. Crucially, they give customers an anonymous platform through which to provide honest and valuable feedback\u2013without which, it would be extremely difficult to make meaningful optimizations.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/customer-experience-strategy-customer-surveys.webp\" alt=\"example of customer satisfaction survey\" width=\"601\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76346\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/customer-experience-strategy-customer-surveys.webp 601w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/customer-experience-strategy-customer-surveys-480x478.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 601px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A simple and effective customer satisfaction survey.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Here are a few straightforward ways to leverage <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/customer-feedback-questions\/\">customer feedback surveys<\/a> to solicit feedback:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Website pop-ups<\/strong>. Use a tool like Hotjar (or any good pop-up tool) to add a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/02\/banner-ads-examples\">simple banner<\/a> that asks customers what would improve their experience with your website or brand.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Email surveys<\/strong>. Sending surveys to your customers&#8217; inboxes in the form of a basic <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/small-business-email-examples-and-templates\/\">email marketing campaign<\/a> or post-purchase follow-up is a great way to connect directly with customers and ensure strong feedback numbers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>In-app or in-product surveys<\/strong>. If you\u2019re a SaaS business, or if you have a mobile app, there\u2019s no better way to improve your product than to ask customers <em>in the product <\/em>what they would like to see more (or less) of.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Customer service follow-ups.<\/strong> Once issues have been resolved, have your customer service team ask for feedback on their experience.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There\u2019s no wrong way to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-get-customer-feedback\/\">ask for feedback<\/a>\u2013the important thing is that you\u2019re consistently giving customers the ability to provide a frank assessment of how well you\u2019re serving them.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Personalize every touchpoint<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s counterintuitive, but so much of customer satisfaction happens before your customer ever tries your product. Yes, it\u2019s the job of your customer service team to assuage concerns that come in after the fact. Yes, it\u2019s the job of your product team to take feedback that comes in and use it to make the product better.<\/p>\n<p>But what about that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/18\/welcome-email\">intro email<\/a> that you sent to your customer before they purchased when they were still just a newsletter subscriber? Did you use the customer\u2019s name in the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/email-subject-lines-for-sales\/\">subject line<\/a>? And what about the demo that your inside sales rep ran with them? Did your rep take a deeper look into the customer\u2019s needs and cater the demo around features that they would find useful?<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/customer-experience-strategy-personalization.webp\" alt=\"example of personalized marketing touchpoint\" width=\"585\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76347\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/customer-experience-strategy-personalization.webp 585w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/customer-experience-strategy-personalization-480x492.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 585px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Get to know your customers, and they\u2019ll reward you in the long run.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This is why <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/06\/personalized-marketing\">personalization<\/a> is so critical. From their first interaction with your brand, customers should feel like you know them and value them. Doing so ensures that your relationship gets off on the right foot, and makes customers feel as if you have their backs\u2013even when things go wrong (and inevitably, they\u2019ll go wrong!).<\/p>\n<p>From your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/landing-page-best-practices\/\">landing pages<\/a> to your email copy, to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/13\/chatbot-examples\">chatbot on your website<\/a>, your order confirmation emails, and more\u2013if you take the time to personalize each touchpoint in the funnel, your customers will reward you with loyalty and advocacy.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\u26a1\ufe0f Speaking of landing pages&#8230;download our free guide: <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLiQContentDLHowToMakeGreatLandingPages.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_LandingPages_HowToMakeGreatLandingPagesGuide_Download\">How to Make Great Landing Pages (with Crazy High Conversions!)<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<h3>4. Cultivate a strong company culture and employee satisfaction<\/h3>\n<p>It can be difficult enough for businesses to look inward and make adjustments based on the feedback they get from customer surveys and NPS scores. But even <em>more <\/em>difficult is realizing that company culture and employee satisfaction go a <em>very<\/em> long way in determining how satisfied your customers are going to be and in improving the customer experience.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s right\u2013regardless of how many steps you put in place to offer customers the best experience, if your own employees\u2019 experience is wanting, they\u2019re not going to be able to offer the kind of service you need to succeed.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/customer-experience-strategy-employee-satisfaction.webp\" alt=\"employee review showing employee satisfaction\" width=\"637\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76348\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/customer-experience-strategy-employee-satisfaction.webp 637w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/customer-experience-strategy-employee-satisfaction-480x452.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 637px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Cultivate strong employee satisfaction, and you\u2019ll get a lot of reviews like this one.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>How do you cultivate a strong company culture? <em>Lead by example. <\/em>Company leaders play a crucial role in shaping and embodying the desired culture. Leaders should consistently demonstrate the values and behaviors they expect from employees. If they make mistakes, they should always own them (rather than passing them down the chain). And if their employees perform positively, they should never hesitate to recognize them.<\/p>\n<p>Also, consider your values. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/09\/company-core-values\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Core values<\/a> should be clearly defined, continuously harped on, and should align with your mission. Communicating these values to your employees, and ensuring they understand how they relate to their work, will ensure that every customer interaction lives up to the standards you\u2019ve set for the entire organization.<\/p>\n<p>One final way to cultivate a strong culture? <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/recruiting-challenges\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hiring<\/a>. You can save yourself a <em>lot <\/em>of trouble by prioritizing candidates who not only have the necessary skills to succeed but also align strongly with your company&#8217;s values.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Educate at every step of the customer journey<\/h3>\n<p>We talked a bit about the importance of personalization <em>at every touchpoint. <\/em>Similarly, every member of your organization should have an eye on education first when they\u2019re talking to prospects and customers.<\/p>\n<p>Nothing stimulates churn like a customer who bought a product before they were ready, before they knew what they were buying, or before they knew how to properly use said product. Just making a sale is great. But making a customer for life is so much better. And you can ensure that each customer you earn has strong <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/10\/cac-vs-clv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lifetime value<\/a> by educating at every step of the journey.<\/p>\n<p>Just look at these statistics:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/customer-experience-strategy-customer-education.webp\" alt=\"customer education statistics\" width=\"936\" height=\"551\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76349\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/customer-experience-strategy-customer-education.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/customer-experience-strategy-customer-education-480x283.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.northpass.com\/customer-education-statistics#:~:text=A%20TSIA%20study%20found%20that,work%20more%20independently%20when%20trained.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>What does product education look like? Take the following examples:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A thorough <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/06\/irresistible-blog-post-titles\">blog post<\/a> that details how your product solves a common problem experienced by your customers.<\/li>\n<li>An active <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-for-free\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube channel<\/a>, support community, or forum that shows customers how to properly use, and troubleshoot problems with, your product.<\/li>\n<li>A sales team that seeks to educate <em>while <\/em>they sell, giving prospects personalized and detailed demos that leave the customer confident they can use your product to improve their lives.<\/li>\n<li>An up-to-date, and prominently displayed list of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resource-center\">learning resources<\/a> on your website.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These are just a few examples, but each goes a long way in nurturing educated prospects and reducing churn.
