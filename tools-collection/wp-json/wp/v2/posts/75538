The event was huge\u2014with over 20 announcements on how Google Ads would be enhancing its new search experiences, AI features, measurement, and ad creatives. But one announcement, in particular, stood out on its own\u2014the introduction of a new campaign type called Demand Gen campaigns.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-google-marketing-live.jpg\" alt=\"google ads demand gen campaigns - google marketing live recording screenshot\" width=\"986\" height=\"518\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75547 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-google-marketing-live.jpg 986w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-google-marketing-live-980x515.jpg 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-google-marketing-live-480x252.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 986px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Demand Gen campaigns were created to help businesses reach consumers outside of the text-heavy search engine results page on more visual and entertaining placements like YouTube, Discovery, and Gmail.<\/p>\n<p>With over 3 billion monthly users on these Google-owned placements, we\u2019ve seen that they\u2019ve become a powerful place to influence potential new customers before they even begin to search. Google reports that <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/ads-commerce\/new-ai-powered-ads-to-drive-demand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">91%<\/a> of consumers have taken action after discovering a new brand on these properties.<\/p>\n<p>After months of waiting, <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/13859703?sjid=18050058259286287018-NA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google recently announced<\/a> that its new Demand Gen campaigns would be available to advertisers in an open beta. One surprise though\u2014Demand Gen campaigns would be replacing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/09\/google-discovery-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Discovery Ads<\/a>, starting later this year.<\/p>\n<h2>What are Google Ads Demand Gen campaigns?<\/h2>\n<p>Unlike its flagship search ads, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/23\/google-marketing-live#:~:text=3.%20Demand%20Gen%20campaigns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Demand Gen campaigns<\/a> are designed to reach users before they even think to actively search for a brand. Instead, Google Demand Gen campaigns are designed to reach new audiences and generate interest from users of Google\u2019s more visual and entertaining properties. Google Demand Gen campaigns serve ads across the Google Discovery Feed, Gmail, and YouTube\u2014including the YouTube feed, In-Stream, and Shorts within the same campaign.<\/p>\n<p>This new Demand Gen campaign type feels like a natural expansion to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/local-marketing-lab\/local-social-media-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social marketers <\/a>who use similar visual creative and audience targeting settings across popular platforms like <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/local-marketing-lab\/facebook-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook ads<\/a> or TikTok ads. However, Google already has released and had success with a similar type of campaign, called Discovery Ads.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-placement.jpg\" alt=\"google demand gen campaigns - placement examples\" width=\"921\" height=\"423\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75557 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-placement.jpg 921w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-placement-480x220.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 921px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s the difference between Google Ads Demand Gen Campaigns and Google Discovery Ads?<\/h2>\n<p>Google\u2019s new Demand Gen Ads are similar to its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/17\/discovery-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Discovery Ads<\/a>. Both campaigns reach new audiences across Gmail, YouTube, and the Google Discovery Feed. They also both serve visually impressive ads that swipe, look, and act like common social ad formats.<\/p>\n<p>Since their introduction in mid-2020, many advertisers have used Google Discovery Ads as an inexpensive way to reach and convert a large audience with their existing social creative across these Google properties.<\/p>\n<p>So, why is Google replacing its already successful Discovery Ads with new Demand Gen campaigns? Google Demand Gen campaigns offer a few major enhancements:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-versus-discovery-ads-chart.jpg\" alt=\"google demand gen campaigns - comparison with discovery ads chart\" width=\"900\" height=\"498\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75546 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-versus-discovery-ads-chart.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-versus-discovery-ads-chart-480x266.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/13859703?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>1. Expanded reach on YouTube<\/h3>\n<p>Google Discovery Ads currently reach users across the Discovery Feed, Gmail, and parts of YouTube, such as the Home Page and YouTube Feed. That\u2019s impressive on its own\u2014but Google Discovery Ads miss the biggest opportunity on YouTube: within its massive video content.<\/p>\n<p>Demand Gen campaigns include all the reach of Google Discovery Ads as well as YouTube In-Stream and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-make-youtube-shorts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube Shorts<\/a>. This additional mix of both short-form and long-form video ad content will significantly increase the reach of these campaigns across YouTube.<\/p>\n<h3>2. More video ad formats<\/h3>\n<p>Within Google Discovery Ads, advertisers could feature either product images or custom image ads across Gmail, YouTube, and Discovery. But Demand Gen campaigns adding reach across YouTube video content means advertisers can now also include up to five videos within their campaigns, in addition to multiple <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/13704860\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">images, headlines, descriptions, logos, and calls to action<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>These videos will be shown throughout current Google Discovery and YouTube formats. These video ad formats will show different assets and act differently across Google\u2019s different properties and screen sizes, so be sure to include varying lengths and aspect ratios so that your videos can fit in natively across all the new video inventory.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-ad-buildout.jpg\" alt=\"google ads demand gen campaign - ad buildout screen\" width=\"900\" height=\"424\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75545 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-ad-buildout.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-ad-buildout-480x226.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>3. New ad creative experiments and tools<\/h3>\n<p>Many campaigns allow advertisers to preview how their different text, image, and video assets might look across different ad placements. But since Google\u2019s new Demand Gen campaigns are designed to <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite30BestWaysToPromote.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Marketing_The30BestWaysToPromoteYourBusiness_Download\">promote your business<\/a> across the most visual and immersive content in Google\u2019s ecosystem, Google has introduced a new ad preview tool specifically for Demand Gen campaigns, which allows advertisers to freely preview how different creatives will look across different screens and placements.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond just previewing how your assets will look before you launch your campaigns, advertisers can also create <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/13719071\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A\/B experiments<\/a> to test different image and video creatives in their Demand Gen campaigns.

Additional bidding options<\/h3>\n<p>Google\u2019s Discovery campaigns were designed to help advertisers reach and convert new audiences. As such, they worked best with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/04\/17\/how-to-set-up-google-ads-enhanced-conversions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">enhanced conversion tracking<\/a> and only supported <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/06\/broad-match-smart-bidding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">smart-bidding<\/a> options such as &#8220;maximize conversions&#8221; or &#8220;maximize conversion value&#8221; that come with the ability to either set a target CPA or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/02\/target-roas\">ROAS<\/a> goal.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Demand Gen offers the same smart-bidding options, but also allows advertisers to use \u201cmaximize clicks\u201d as a bid strategy. This may be more appropriate for advertisers who might have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/08\/attribution-models\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">longer or more complicated conversion paths<\/a>, aim to drive offline sales, or simply just <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">promote more traffic to their website<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/google-ads-pricing-automated-bidding-vs-smart-bidding-e1692728180344.png\" alt=\"google ads pricing - automated bidding strategies\" width=\"716\" height=\"395\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-57765 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/google-ads-pricing-automated-bidding-vs-smart-bidding-e1692728180344.png 716w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/google-ads-pricing-automated-bidding-vs-smart-bidding-e1692728180344-480x270.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 716px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>5. More reporting options<\/h3>\n<p>Demand Gen campaigns are designed to drive direct action and conversions\u2014but they\u2019re capable of more than just that. Advertisers have seen countless times that after they&#8217;ve launched ads to a new audience across Display, YouTube, or Social, they soon notice an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/13\/cross-network-advertising-brand-search-lift\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">increase in searches and conversions from their brand campaigns<\/a>. Google\u2019s Demand Gen campaigns offer more insight into this uplift with their Brand Lift, Search Lift, and Conversion Lift reports.<\/p>\n<h3>6. New audience targeting<\/h3>\n<p>Google Ads finally <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/12\/13\/google-sunsetting-similar-audiences\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sunset its popular Similar Audiences<\/a> targeting recently for all campaign types\u2014but Demand Gen campaigns offer something very\u2026similar.<\/p>\n<p>Demand Gen campaigns will have access to a special <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/13541369\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lookalike audience segment<\/a>. Lookalike segments are audiences that share similar characteristics and behaviors as those from one of your existing first-party audience segments (such as a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/11\/05\/google-ads-remarketing-lists\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">remarketing list<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/11\/02\/adwords-customer-match-setup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">customer list<\/a>). Advertisers can refine these lookalike audiences to be:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Narrow: <\/strong>Reaching the <em>5%<\/em> of users in your target location that are most similar to your original seed list.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Balanced:<\/strong> Reaching the <em>5%<\/em> of users in your target location that are most similar to your original seed list.

It may take Google a few weeks to process your submission and enable access within your account. Once enrolled in the beta, any active Discovery campaigns will automatically upgrade to Demand Gen campaigns. You won\u2019t lose any historical data or learnings, but you will no longer be able to manage your Discovery Ads like you did before.<\/p>\n<p>Google announced that in October 2023, all advertisers will have access to create new Demand Gen campaigns. Additionally, advertisers will have the option to upgrade their Discovery campaigns to Demand Gen campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>Then in January 2024, all remaining Discovery campaigns will be automatically upgraded to Demand Gen campaigns. All Discovery campaigns are expected to be automatically upgraded to Demand Gen campaigns by the end of March 2024. During this transition, no action is required from the advertiser. Campaigns will continue to serve, and historical data and learnings will be preserved.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-ads-demand-gen-campaign-timeline.jpg\" alt=\"google ads demand gen campaign s- timeline of switch from discovery ads \" width=\"770\" height=\"458\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75543 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-ads-demand-gen-campaign-timeline.jpg 770w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-ads-demand-gen-campaign-timeline-480x286.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 770px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h1>Best practices for Google Demand Gen campaigns<\/h1>\n<p>Here are some tips to prepare for the sunset of Discovery campaigns in favor of Demand Gen campaigns:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Plan your migration early<\/h3>\n<p>Google will upgrade any Discovery campaigns you have active, even if you don\u2019t take any action. Although this isn\u2019t likely to interrupt your ads from running or negatively impact your performance, you\u2019re missing out on all the best features of Demand Gen campaigns by doing nothing.<\/p>\n<p>Plan ahead and spend a few minutes upgrading your Discovery campaigns to take advantage of the extra reach across YouTube and upload new video formats to your campaigns. There\u2019s a huge advantage for advertisers to get access to all this new reach at a discount before others make the migration in early 2024!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/ads-commerce\/new-ai-powered-ads-to-drive-demand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here<\/a>, Google highlighted businesses that have participated in the beta version of Demand Generation campaigns early on:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-ads-demand-generation-campaigns-testimonial.jpg\" alt=\"google ads demand generation campaigns - beta testimonial\" width=\"664\" height=\"370\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75559 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-ads-demand-generation-campaigns-testimonial.jpg 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-ads-demand-generation-campaigns-testimonial-480x267.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>2. Prepare and refresh your creatives<\/h3>\n<p>Demand Gen campaigns will feature your ads in very visual, scrolling, immersive settings\u2014like YouTube, Gmail, and Discover. Make sure you set the right impression by providing several <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/13704860\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contrasting images and videos.<\/a> Google recommends repurposing high-quality image and video creatives from your email and social campaigns to help your branding stick in these new placements.<\/p>\n<p>For your new video assets, be sure to grab the attention of your audience within the first 5 seconds of the ad. Most users will skip your In-Stream ad or YouTube short within the first 5 seconds\u2014so make sure that you include your solution, brand name, or problem statement early on to leave an impression.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Build your audiences<\/h3>\n<p>Google\u2019s lookalike segments have a huge potential for these new Demand Gen campaigns, but they first require you to build the original seed audiences using your own first-party data\u2014such as a remarketing audience or customer list. Remember, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/12\/first-party-data\">first-party data<\/a> is any information your organization owns:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/zero-first-second-third-party-data-e1692730268585.png\" alt=\"zero, frist, second, third-party data\" width=\"719\" height=\"421\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-57202 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/zero-first-second-third-party-data-e1692730268585.png 719w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/zero-first-second-third-party-data-e1692730268585-480x270.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 719px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>An audience must have at least 1,000 unique matched users to be used for targeting or generating a lookalike audience, so smaller businesses may need to prepare in advance to build up those lists. For example, you may need to focus on increasing traffic to your website first so that you can collect enough data to create a list for a lookalike audience.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, note that (once your list is large enough to be eligible) lookalike audiences may take a few days to populate.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>Get ahead on building your Demand Gen audience lists! Use the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/website-grader\/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LocaliQ website grader<\/a> to identify ways to improve your website and get more traffic fast.<\/div><\/div>\n<h3>4. Revisit your conversion tracking<\/h3>\n<p>Particularly after the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/07\/google-analytics-4-event-tracking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recent GA4 migration<\/a>, it\u2019s wise to review that your conversion tracking is firing correctly and completely. Demand Gen campaigns are designed to target prospects who may be newer to your brand or solution and are likely more \u201cmid-funnel\u201d than your search campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>With that in mind, Google recommends optimizing for \u201clightweight conversion events (such as \u2018add to cart\u2019) instead of necessarily larger events\u2014like making a large purchase or filling out a complex form.&#8221; These smaller conversion actions help feed valuable signals to Google\u2019s bidding and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/21\/google-ads-audience-targeting-cheat-sheet\">targeting systems<\/a> in these campaigns so that they can begin to learn and optimize faster.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Budget for success<\/h3>\n<p>Although Google Demand Gen campaigns can be created and run for as little as $1 a day, lower budgets can make optimizing your results a long, difficult process.<\/p>\n<p>Google recommends that advertisers who are using its smart-bidding set a budget at least 15 times their target CPA to allow their Demand Gen campaign to grow and quickly optimize. So, while a lower budget may be effective, it will take longer to optimize toward your overall goals.<\/p>\n<p>That said, advertisers with smaller <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/28\/small-business-budget\">marketing budgets<\/a> may benefit from using the maximize clicks bidding strategy to get started and collect lots of data quickly.<\/p>\n<h2>Goodbye Discovery Ads, hello Demand Gen campaigns<\/h2>\n<p>Google Demand Gen campaigns could be a powerful campaign type and complement your existing search and social campaigns. Just be sure to migrate early and take advantage of the new video ad inventory across YouTube, Discover, and Gmail.
