This can perhaps be understandable when we\u2019re marketing to a large group of people and only have time to look at highly-performing campaigns on the surface, without digging deeper into the effect they have. However, this could prove to be the undoing of some businesses as the news of a COVID-19 vaccine has sparked optimism at a return to something that resembles normality.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"90cbae74-3135-42d5-b6b8-8b491beef4bd\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/optimzing20funnel20with20psychographic20data20covid20vaccine20race-1.png\" alt=\"optimzing funnel with psychographic data covid vaccine race\" width=\"500\" height=\"709\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Insights into consumer <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/28\/behavioral-segmentation\">behavior<\/a> form the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/01\/bottom-funnel-conversions\">cornerstone of successful conversions<\/a>, but from 2021 onwards, the behavior that we\u2019re used to seeing may change.
