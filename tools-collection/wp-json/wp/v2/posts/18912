Well, I\u2019d estimate that I spend half of my paycheck on Amazon Prime.

If you\u2019re all over Google Shopping, the Display Network, Facebook, and Instagram, well, there\u2019s no better time to break into one of the largest remaining online ad networks. For <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/16\/compete-with-amazon-ebay\">e-commerce businesses<\/a>, Amazon ads should be a no-brainer.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve created this guide to walk you through the basics of getting started with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/01\/amazon-advertising-tips\">Amazon ads<\/a> to get more eyes on your products, and ultimately higher returns!<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>A multi-channel ecommerce strategy is an effective ecommerce strategy. <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLWebAnyInContentBannerEcommerceShopping101.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentBanner_Ecommerce_Shopping101_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Download our free guide to Google Shopping<\/a> and start spreading your brand today!<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>What Are Amazon Ads?<\/h2>\n<p>Similar to <a href=\"\/articles\/what-is-google-adwords\">how Google search works<\/a>, when you type in a keyword in the Amazon search box and results appear, some of the top results will be sponsored posts \u2013 these are considered Amazon ads. They are denoted with subtle \u201csponsored\u201d or \u201cad\u201d text like in the image below.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/beginners-guide-to-advertising-on-amazon-sponsored-results-1.png\" alt=\"Beginner's guide to advertising on Amazon sponsored results example\" width=\"1179\" height=\"640\" \/><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/30\/ecommerce-brand-bidding\">Advertisers who want to gain more visibility<\/a> to their products on Amazon can pay for these positions by bidding on specific keywords, which will lead to higher visibility in the Amazon SERPs. The advertiser will then be charged when a shopper clicks on their ad. You can essentially see Amazon\u2019s advertising platform as the Amazon version of AdWords.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon ads can also appear on individual product pages. For example, when looking at the water bottle below I can see an add for sunglasses on the far right hand side of the page.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/beginners-guide-to-advertising-on-amazon-sidebar-ad-example.png\" alt=\"Beginner's guide to advertising on Amazon sidebar ad example\" width=\"1236\" height=\"555\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As I scroll down the page, I\u2019ll find even more ads!<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/beginners-guide-to-advertising-on-amazon-sponsored-related-results.png\" alt=\"Beginner's guide to advertising on Amazon sponsored related results\" width=\"939\" height=\"329\" \/><\/div>\n<p>However, there are many types of Amazon ad options beyond these sponsored search posts, some of which we\u2019ll explore in this guide.<\/p>\n<h2>Should I Advertise on Amazon?<\/h2>\n<p>Are you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/23\/selling-on-amazon\">selling a tangible product<\/a> that consumers can purchase online? If the answer is yes, then the answer is yes, you should be advertising on Amazon! Amazon will just supply you with another way to get more eyes on your products and likely more buyers.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re hesitant, then start small with a product that you already know sells well online. For instance, if you sell sports gear and tennis rackets have always been your top-selling online product, start with an ad for your top-selling racket. Once you start to see an ROI with this ad, incorporate more brands and types of rackets to expand your campaign.<\/p>\n<p>Another compelling reason to advertise on Amazon is that if you\u2019re doing Amazon PPC, your organic Amazon rankings will likely improve as well. \u201cWe\u2019ve repeatedly seen that organic ranking has been considerably improved for those keywords that were used successfully in Amazon PPC ads,\u201d says <a href=\"https:\/\/sellics.com\/amazon-ppc-guide\">Sellics<\/a>. \u201cThis is in part due to extra sales that have been generated by \u2018Amazon AdWords\u2019 enhancing the sales history of the product. Sales history is a very strong ranking factor. If a product sells better, then Amazon will place it higher up in the ranking of search results.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So not only is it possible to boost your product sales by investing in Amazon ads, but it could also boost the organic rankings of your products. Could life get much better?<\/p>\n<h3>Amazon Advertising Costs<\/h3>\n<p>So how much do ads on Amazon run?<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.practicalecommerce.com\/Are-Amazon-Sponsored-Products-Ads-Worth-It\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rob Sieracki at Practical Ecommerce<\/a>, the average cost per click on Amazon is rarely more than $0.35, making it more cost-effective on a CPC basis than search ads on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/29\/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks\">AdWords<\/a> or <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/06\/bing-ads-performance-benchmarks\">Bing Ads<\/a> and comparable to some of the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/28\/facebook-advertising-benchmarks\">lowest CPC&#8217;s on Facebook ads<\/a> or Google display. Considering that Amazon searches show a lot of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/30\/commercial-intent-keywords\">commercial intent<\/a>, those are promising numbers! (Later in this guide, we&#8217;ll share some tips to help lower your Amazon advertising costs.)<\/p>\n<h2>Self Serve Ads vs. Premium Ads<\/h2>\n<p>When you begin exploring <a href=\"https:\/\/advertising.amazon.com\/\">Amazon\u2019s public advertising information pages<\/a> you might be a bit confused on the difference between self-serve and premium ads in the two sidebars shown below:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/beginners-guide-to-advertising-on-amazon-self-serve-ads.png\" alt=\"Beginner's guide to advertising on Amazon self-serve ads\" width=\"994\" height=\"404\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The simplest way to explain the difference is that self-service ads function like Google search ads displaying on the search result pages (like the screenshots I included above), where premium ads function more like display ads. While premium ads can still be found on Amazon, they show up as more visual banner and side bar ads like the one below. They can also appear on other websites, similar to how Google\u2019s Display Network works.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/beginners-guide-to-advertising-on-amazon-display-ad-example.png\" alt=\"Beginner's guide to advertising on Amazon display ad example\" width=\"447\" height=\"304\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>Getting Started with Amazon Ads<\/h2>\n<p>To start advertising on Amazon you\u2019ll first need to sign into your seller or vendor account.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/beginners-guide-to-advertising-on-amazon-get-started.png\" alt=\"Beginner's guide to advertising on Amazon getting started\" width=\"793\" height=\"352\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have either of these accounts you can check out their various pricing and plans to fit your needs <a href=\"https:\/\/services.amazon.com\/content\/sell-on-amazon.htm\">here<\/a>. If you\u2019re a first-party seller then you\u2019ll want to sign-up as a vendor, which is unfortunately by invitation only. If you\u2019re selling via Amazon Seller Central you\u2019re considered a third-party seller. Seller Central has pricing options for pay-as-you go for independent sellers vs. a pro option for those with higher sale volume. Pro merchant sellers also have the option of letting Amazon manage shipping, returns, and customer service, which is not a bad perk! Lastly, Amazon has a <a href=\"https:\/\/vendorexpress.amazon.com\/\">Vendor Express<\/a> option that might be worth exploring if you\u2019re interested in going the vendor route, but are lacking an invitation.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019re logged into you\u2019re signed up for the correct plan, you can log in to your Amazon account you start setting up your ad campaigns!<\/p>\n<h2>Types of Amazon Ads<\/h2>\n<p>So you have some nice banner ads for branding purposes from your creative team that you\u2019d love to promote, but you\u2019re also looking to simply <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/07\/ecommerce-sales-product-pages\">drive more e-commerce sales<\/a> with Google Shopping like ads. Luckily, you\u2019ve come to the right place because Amazon provides options! There are three main types of ads you can configure through Amazon including sponsored products ads, headline search ads, and product display ads.<\/p>\n<h3>Amazon Sponsored Product Ads<\/h3>\n<p>Sponsored product ads operate similar to ads run through the Google Shopping Network. These are the ads that drive Amazon searchers directly to a specific product you\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/27\/top-reasons-to-sell-on-amazon-2021\">selling on Amazon<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>When shoppers click on your sponsored product ad, they\u2019ll be directed to the ads product detail page. Sponsored product ads are typically displayed above or below the search results page, as well as on other product detail pages. These ads are keyword-targeted, and advertisers have the option of choosing from exact, phrase, or broad match types. Advertisers also have the control of setting a daily budget, as well as the campaign duration. While the campaign can be paused at any time it must run for at least 1 day.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/beginners-guide-to-advertising-on-amazon-ad-examples.png\" alt=\"Beginner's guide to advertising on Amazon ad examples\" width=\"957\" height=\"501\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Headline Search Ads<\/h3>\n<p>Headline search ads display in the search result pages as headline banner ads always above the result listing, like the example below. These ads are cost-per-click, and lead searchers to any specified page on Amazon.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/beginners-guide-to-advertising-on-amazon-headline-search.png\" alt=\"Beginner's guide to advertising on Amazon headline search ads\" width=\"1051\" height=\"392\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This landing page is typically a customized branded page like the one below that Casper Sleep directed me to when I clicked on their headline ad.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/beginners-guide-to-advertising-on-amazon-casper-mattress-example.png\" alt=\"Beginner's guide to advertising on Amazon landing page example\" width=\"1198\" height=\"661\" \/><\/div>\n<p>These ads are also keyword targeted, and can be used to promote 3 or more products together. Headline search ads also use a cost-per-click method where the minimum bid per keyword is $0.10. There are also only two keyword match-types supported for headline search ads \u2013 exact and phrase match. Lastly, the minimum campaign budget for these ads is $100, with a limit of $1 spent per day. Campaigns can be scheduled to run up to four months in advance.<\/p>\n<h3>Amazon Product Display Ads<\/h3>\n<p>Lastly, we have product display ads that work a bit differently then the two ad formats above. These ads are not keyword targeted, but rather interest or product targeted display ads. They drive shoppers to the products detail page and are also priced by a cost-per-click method.<\/p>\n<p>Advertisers can select from a long list of products (for example, similar products to what you\u2019re selling) or interests (for example, if the shopper is interested in running) to target these ads to relevant shoppers. It\u2019s important to note that each campaign is limited to one target type. These ads can appear to the right or at the bottom of the search results, on the customer reviews page, at the top of the offer listings page, as well as in Amazon marketing emails.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/beginners-guide-to-advertising-on-amazon-product-display-ads.png\" alt=\"Beginner's guide to advertising on Amazon product display ads\" width=\"771\" height=\"463\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>How to Optimize Your Amazon Ads: 6 Tips<\/h2>\n<p>Among all of the products on Amazon, you might be doubting that the platform could yield your business a return. Luckily, there are a few things you can do to stand out from the competition in the massive Amazon marketplace. It just requires going into it with an informed Amazon advertising strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Here are six tips to get you started on the right foot.<\/p>\n<h3>#1: Create Well-Structured Campaigns by Product Category<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re an experienced AdWords advertiser this is something you\u2019ve likely already mastered. You can use your AdWords organizational skills to structure your campaigns and ad groups with Amazon\u2019s ad platform. The best strategy here is to have a separate campaign of each of your main product categories, and then under each campaign create ad groups that are more specific. For example, let\u2019s say you sell women\u2019s athletic wear; you might decide to start with three of your top-selling products:<\/p>\n<p>1) Women\u2019s workout pants<\/p>\n<p>2) Women\u2019s workout shirts<\/p>\n<p>3) Women\u2019s sports bras<\/p>\n<p>Under each campaign you should create ad groups around more specific categories. For example, in campaign #1 you might have three ad groups \u2013 women\u2019s yoga pants, women\u2019s running pants, and women\u2019s lounge pants. Then you\u2019ll want to create a list of relevant keywords for each ad group (I\u2019d recommend staying between 15-30 keywords per ad group). Finally, you\u2019ll craft relevant ads for each keyword grouping.<\/p>\n<p>A solid account structure will ensure your ads are relevant, which will in turn save you money and increase your ROI. This tip is an extremely critical one to reap the benefits of advertising on Amazon.<\/p>\n<p>Check out this guide on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/02\/adwords-account-structure-guide\">AdWords account structure<\/a> if you\u2019re new to the game.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/beginners-guide-to-advertising-on-amazon-adwords-account-structure.png\" alt=\"Beginner's guide to advertising on Amazon AdWords account structure\" width=\"943\" height=\"556\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>#2: Create Compelling &amp; Urgent Ad Copy<\/h3>\n<p>Ensure your ad text is not only accurate in terms of what you\u2019re selling, but try and insert some creativity and humor into your ads if possible. Standing out is more important then ever amongst the cluttered search results of Amazon. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/05\/how-to-increase-urgency\">Instilling a sense of urgency<\/a> can also be helpful. For instance, if you\u2019re running a sale or promotion make sure to highlight this in your ad like the one below.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/beginners-guide-to-advertising-on-amazon-gillette-example.png\" alt=\"Beginner's guide to advertising on Amazon Gillette display ad example\" width=\"421\" height=\"299\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>#3: Ensure Your Ad Copy is as Specific as Possible<\/h3>\n<p>Your ad copy should also be very specific in terms of what you\u2019re selling. For example, if you\u2019re selling a water bottle I want to know how many ounces\/cups of water it holds, if it\u2019s BPA free, if it keeps my water cold for up to a certain number of hours etc. While it might be hard to expose all of this information in the ad text, it\u2019s important to jam the most important information in there. The ad below is a great example of one that does this well because I know the weight, height, and what this product comes with from reading the headline.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/beginners-guide-to-advertising-on-amazon-tripod-example.png\" alt=\"Beginner's guide to advertising on Amazon tripod ad example\" width=\"976\" height=\"454\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>#4: Bid on Popular Brands That Sell Similar Products<\/h3>\n<p>When brainstorming keywords to bid on, don\u2019t forget about your well-known competitors. For instance, if you sell backpacks you should be bidding on terms like \u201cL.L. Bean backpacks\u201d and \u201cNorthface backpacks\u201d because these are well-known brands that are commonly searched for and purchased. This will allow you to gain exposure and pursue someone to buy your much cooler, less well-known brand name backpack.<\/p>\n<p>To find your top competitors, do a generic search on Amazon for products in your vertical \u2013 say, \u201cbackpacks\u201d \u2013 and see which brands come up the most in your search results.<\/p>\n<h3>#5: Experiment with All Three Ad Formats<\/h3>\n<p>While sponsored product ads might appear to yield the fastest and most visible ROI, headline search ads might lead to more loyal, repeat buyers. It\u2019s worth experimenting with all three ad types to see which yields the highest returns, and then once your statistics can paint a clear picture you can re-allocate your budget based of the results of your campaign.<\/p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/03\/amazon-buy-box\">More: Why You Need the Amazon Buy Box, and How to Get It<\/a>]<\/p>\n<h3>#6: Use Negative Keywords (&amp; Be Conservative with Match Types)<\/h3>\n<p>Just like when advertising on Google, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cpcstrategy.com\/blog\/2016\/03\/amazon-negative-keywords\/\">negative keywords<\/a> are key to reducing wasted spend from irrelevant clicks. For example, if you\u2019re selling musical flutes, and bidding on the word \u201cflutes\u201d with broad or phrase match then someone could type in champagne flute and your ad could still populate. If they then accidently click on your ad you\u2019ll be charged for a click from someone searching for a $10 glass rather than a quality musical instrument.<\/p>\n<p>It can also help to be more conservative with your match types, steering clear of broad match, and putting a higher emphasis on phrase and exact match. Make sure to conduct some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/23\/amazon-keyword-research\">keyword research<\/a> to ensure you\u2019re targeting the right words as well.
