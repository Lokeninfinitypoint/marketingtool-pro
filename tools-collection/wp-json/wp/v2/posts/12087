Check for drops in traffic\u2014clicks and impressions\u2014in Google Analytics and Google Ads.

There is a lot of misinformation being spread and certain fear-based comments can detract potential customers.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Communicate changes<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/21\/client-communication-during-covid-19\">Communicating effectively and efficientl<\/a>y is going to be key to maintaining your customer relationships. \u201cIn all cases, advertisers should look to build trust with current and potential customers through proactive communication via email and\/or information directly on their site,\u201d Tyler says. \u201cIn cases where events or store locations need to postpone operations, businesses should consider their long-term relationship with customers and know that a refund or reschedule could be a relief point for those who may experience stress or hardship during these times.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Account Manager Holly Niemiec also recommends communicating these changes online as soon as possible. \u201cIf your business is affected, Google recommends <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/business\/answer\/9773423?p=covid_19&amp;visit_id=637194021457344571-48127973&amp;rd=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">updating your business hours and description<\/a> in your Google My Business profile.

This is especially important if you have any <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/13\/creative-ad-extensions\">callout extensions<\/a> stating your business hours.<\/p>\n<h2>Adjust your strategy<\/h2>\n<p>There has been a lot that has happened as a direct or indirect result of COVID-19. As people are being encouraged to wash their hands to prevent the spread of germs, there has been a shortage of hand sanitizer, bleach and cleaning wipes, and other similar products. A lot of work culture will be temporarily changed as companies start to deploy mandatory work from home policies, and travel and tourism will be affected as our government temporarily bans travel to certain places where cases of the virus are high.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of these changes can be stressful, but the best thing that we can do as marketers is to look forward and to calm the nerves of consumers as best we can by having clear, concise, and accurate messaging.<\/p>\n<p>Holly noted that keeping your ads up to date with your stock is crucial. \u201cIf your business does sell some of the \u2018hot ticket\u2019 items that have been flying off the shelves, make sure you are not still advertising products that may be out of stock. In order to prevent this, you can temporarily exclude these products from your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/12\/google-shopping-campaign-structure\">shopping campaigns<\/a>, that way you are not at risk of showing an ad for a product that you no longer have.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For brick-and-mortar businesses, adjusting your strategy might mean limited budgets or pausing certain campaigns. \u201cSome clients are worried about the decline in leads or foot traffic that they are experiencing,\u201d Tyler says. \u201cMy recommendation at this point has been to either lower budgets for or even pause non-essential campaigns at the moment for certain industries, and then to focus ad spend on branded terms due to the higher quality traffic they naturally receive. For those SMBs that have tight annual budgets, the reallocation of ad spend toward more effective marketing periods could be essential to their success.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For more help, check out our post <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/25\/covid-19-facebook-advertising\">6 Strategies for Facebook and Instagram Advertising During\u00a0COVID-19<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>A note on the travel industry<\/h3>\n<p>If you are in the travel and tourism industry, things are changing by the day.

Knowing this, focus strategy on the long term. Advertise trips or activities in low-risk areas, and provide additional content about what trips and activities are still safe.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Tyler agreed that shifting your messaging to long-term travel can help. \u201cI have heard from one client in the travel industry that they are experiencing a massive shift in their customer base for 2020 travel to 2021 travel,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cSo we are planning to revise some messaging in both the website and our ads regarding something along the lines of: \u2018Book Your 2021 Travel Today\u2019 or \u20182021 Travel Options Available.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To learn more, check out this post:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/18\/covid-19-google-ads-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How COVID-19 Has Impacted Google Ads Results for 21 Industries [Data]<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Keep checking in<\/h2>\n<p>COVID-19 has unfortunately affected the health and wellbeing of communities worldwide, and keeping communities safe should be our first priority.
