Consider these takeaways from experts in the marketing and advertising community.<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-chrome-sale-root-problem\"><\/div>\n<h3>1. Selling Chrome might not solve the root problem<\/h3>\n<p>The impact of the proposed changes is uncertain. Selling Chrome may not necessarily cause a major decrease in Chrome\u2019s market share or Google\u2019s monopoly.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI&#8217;m not sure to what extent selling Chrome would break up Google&#8217;s monopoly. It would have some impact, for sure, but Google still has a number of free products (Gmail, Search, Maps, YouTube, etc.) all of which keep users in its garden. Users might still end up using Chrome to access Google&#8217;s services even if the browser is owned by someone else,\u201d said Ajdin Perco, Head of Content at <a href=\"http:\/\/animalz.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Animalz<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-chrome-sale-credibility\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Whether this would help (or hurt) Chrome\u2019s credibility is unclear<\/h3>\n<p>The general sentiment around the potential Chrome sale from the SEO and PPC communities has been mixed. On one hand, Google\u2019s monopoly of the search market needs to change. On the other, questions have been raised about what other type of organization would be large enough to acquire Chrome for the billion dollars (or more) it would sell for.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf Chrome were to be purchased it seems that only a company comparable to Google would be able to afford it. If it is purchased, how are we to trust them with our data and security any more than we do with Google?\u201d said Cliff Sizemore, Senior Growth Marketing Manager at LocaliQ.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/posts\/navahhopkins_we-need-to-talk-about-the-doj-pushing-for-activity-7264665431758532608-NWHk?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This LinkedIn post<\/a> from Navah Hopkins, PPC evangelist at Optmyzr, outlines the two sides of the coin. She acknowledges Chrome\u2019s currently massive market share but goes on to say that the wrong owner could end up manipulating approved, ranking content.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf the browser suddenly played favorites with processing power or UI choices, there is a real risk content that isn&#8217;t flattering to the owner will be pushed down, while content that may or may not be accurate is given preferential treatment because it&#8217;s positive&#8230; If bad actors manipulate Chrome in such a way that only approved content renders fast enough to be consumed (if at all), there&#8217;s a real risk there,\u201d said Navah.<\/p>\n<p>The other alternative of the government one day stepping in to claim Chrome as a public utility, isn\u2019t ideal, either.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAside from the existing tech giants, there really isn&#8217;t anyone large enough to come up with the multi-billion dollars (if not more) needed to acquire Chrome. Should the government step in and seize it as a public utility, that puts us in a China-adjacent environment,\u201d said Navah.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/google-chrome-sale-navah-tweet.webp\" alt=\"google chrome sale - navah linkedin post\" width=\"592\" height=\"291\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87848 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/google-chrome-sale-navah-tweet.webp 592w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/google-chrome-sale-navah-tweet-480x236.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 592px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"google-chrome-sale-ad-targeting\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. The outlook for Google\u2019s ad targeting capabilities could be negative<\/h3>\n<p>Chrome is a major user data source for Google. Selling Chrome could cause the platform to have less effective ad targeting options.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOf the numerous potential ripple effects of a Chrome sell-off, small businesses need to be wary of how the separation of key user intent data from Google&#8217;s ad products will ultimately impact advertising effectiveness,\u201d said Jake Cox, Product Manager, Media Products, at LocaliQ.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen leveraging <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-smart-bidding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google&#8217;s Smart Bidding<\/a> automated strategies, you\u2019re tapping into a massive volume of user intent signals to identify when to deliver the most impactful ad at the most opportune time to drive some form of action. If those intent signals are severed, or at the very least, diminished, how will Google backfill those key insights to still drive comparable campaign performance?\u201d said Jake.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to Google Ads and its machine learning, this change might impact other related Google platforms as well, such as GA4.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf Google doesn&#8217;t have sufficient user data that they have historically leveraged through Chrome, then how are we to trust reporting via GA4 or decisions made through something like Smart Bidding? On the surface it may seem simple but there are far-reaching negative effects and that&#8217;s my concern,\u201d said Cliff.<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-chrome-sale-competition\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Increased search market competition could benefit users and advertisers<\/h3>\n<p>Some marketers and advertisers see the potential change as a net positive.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think introducing more competition in the search market is much needed. It would benefit end users by forcing companies to innovate faster and deliver more value. We&#8217;re seeing how companies innovate rapidly in the AI space where there&#8217;s still no clear winner. I hope a similar level and pace of innovation happens in search as well,\u201d said Ajdin.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGoogle has been relying on user data to improve their algorithm for a long time to reinforce their position in the market. The proposed break-up would take away this advantage and be a huge win for both their competitors as well as privacy advocates,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/geoff-meakin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Geoff Meakin<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/healthcare-seo.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">healthcare SEO consultant<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-chrome-sale-impact\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. The sale of Chrome would be noticeable to both users and advertisers<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s no question when it comes to the gravity of the DOJ\u2019s proposals.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bold move. Google\u2019s dominance, especially through Chrome, has become such a huge part of how we experience the internet that splitting it off sounds almost unthinkable. But I get where the DOJ is coming from. Chrome isn\u2019t just a browser; it\u2019s the front door to Google\u2019s entire empire\u2014ads, search, and a ton of user data. Breaking that link could shake things up and open the door for more competition, which isn\u2019t a bad thing,\u201d said Goran Mirkovic, Chief Marketing Officer at <a href=\"http:\/\/Freemius.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Freemius<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat said, I think this kind of move needs to be handled with care. If it\u2019s not done right, it could create headaches for users\u2014think compatibility issues or slower innovation. It\u2019s like trying to fix one problem but potentially creating others along the way. So while the idea of breaking up the monopoly is intriguing, the devil\u2019s in the details,\u201d said Goran.<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-chrome-sale-tips\"><\/div>\n<h2>What this could mean for businesses\u2014and how to prepare<\/h2>\n<p>While we don\u2019t know exactly what will happen yet, you don\u2019t just have to wait and wonder. Here is how to prepare for the continuation of the Google antitrust trial as these potential changes develop.<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-chrome-sale-cross-channel\"><\/div>\n<h3>1. Implement a cross-channel marketing strategy<\/h3>\n<p>While search marketing will continue to be a key lever for businesses looking to grow, it\u2019s important to incorporate other <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/26\/marketing-channels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing channels<\/a> into your strategy for a full-funnel, <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/always-on-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">always-on<\/a> approach.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUltimately, I think the downstream impact of this could result in more parity across the paid search landscape. Whether we see traditional search engines like <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/replicate-google-ads-on-bing\/\">Microsoft&#8217;s Bing<\/a> steal market share or if other next-gen challengers (TikTok, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/chatgpt-search\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SearchGPT<\/a>) take a dramatic leap forward, it will be very interesting to monitor over the next couple of years,\u201d said Jake.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor advertisers, it will be important to take a more platform-diverse approach in the near future to ensure that they are actively testing multiple channels and optimizing toward what&#8217;s driving the value,\u201d said Jake.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/marketing-channel-mix-wordstream-1024x791.webp\" alt=\"marketing channel mix\" width=\"1024\" height=\"791\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85428 size-large\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"google-chrome-sale-online-presence\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Build out your online presence<\/h3>\n<p>As Chrome evolves, you\u2019ll want to prepare for all other ways users might find your business. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/17\/increase-online-presence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Increasing your overall online presence<\/a> will help you show up in searches\u2014no matter what tool people use to find you. For example, having a high-quality website could make it easier for AI tools to pull in information about your business.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf Google loses the insights it currently gets from Chrome, then that can only weaken its position in the market and lead to a faster uptake of alternative search products. Proactive small businesses are already considering how best to optimize for AI search and the large language models (LLMs) that are poised to take market share from Google,\u201d said Geoff.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udca1 Uncover all the best ways you can market your business on Google and beyond<\/strong> with our free guide to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/online-marketing-tips?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_130marketingtips_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">130+ of the best online marketing tips<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-chrome-sale-strategy\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Consider other tools to supplement your strategy<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s more important than ever for businesses to rely on resources they have on hand, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/12\/first-party-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first-party data<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI PPC tools<\/a>, to get ahead of ad campaign targeting and optimization.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOn the bright side, more competition might mean more advertising options, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/2024-google-ads-benchmarks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">potentially better pricing<\/a>, and less reliance on Google for everything. That could be a big win, especially for small businesses with tight budgets. Having a more level playing field sounds great,\u201d said Goran.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut here\u2019s the catch: a breakup could also make life more complicated, at least in the short term. A lot of small businesses rely on Google\u2019s ecosystem because it\u2019s so seamless\u2014ads, analytics, search, everything works together. If that ecosystem gets fragmented, businesses might need to juggle new tools and platforms, which could cost more time and money,\u201d said Goran.<\/p>\n<p>This means relying on your own data and campaign optimization tools can save you from headaches during any major transition.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo, while the long-term impact might be positive, there\u2019s likely to be some turbulence along the way. It really depends on how this all plays out and whether the new landscape makes things easier or harder for smaller businesses,\u201d Goran.<\/p>\n<h2>Will Google divest Chrome? Stay tuned<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s important to remember that nothing is set in stone yet. Your best bet right now is to stay in the loop on the latest news as it evolves as much as you can.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, these developments can be a lesson in themselves to stay ahead of any potential upsets on one platform by implementing a holistic marketing strategy that covers all your bases across all platforms.<\/p>\n<p>While managing your search strategy on top of tons of other channels can seem like a challenge, you don\u2019t have to do it all alone.
