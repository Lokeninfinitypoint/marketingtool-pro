Even if you&#8217;re selling audience is<\/p>\n<h3>1. Make it easy to read<\/h3>\n<p>Copy that sells isn\u2019t impressive. It\u2019s easy. Your reader shouldn\u2019t have to stop reading to make sense of what you\u2019re saying, even if just for a nanosecond. The more your copy flows, the longer you\u2019ll keep their attention and the easier it will be for them to get the important points you\u2019re making.<\/p>\n<p>Take a look at this public school&#8217;s copy, targeting public high schoolers and their parents.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We provide a multifaceted educational program to our students, using the most effective pedagogical approaches that intertwine progressive thinking skills, vocational events, and modular courses as deemed important by the educators and community.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Now take a look at Harvard Business School copy, targeting [really] smart college grads:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells-HBS-easy-reading-level-1.png\" alt=\"example of copy that sells\u2014harvard business school copywriting\" width=\"720\" height=\"287\" \/><\/div>\n<p>See what I mean?<\/p>\n<p>Note: Readable doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean removing fancy words. As long as you&#8217;re using terms your audience is familiar with, they&#8217;ll be able to move along. Which brings us to our next point.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Use keywords (not just for SEO)<\/h3>\n<p>Although <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/19\/get-on-first-page-google\">showing up on the first page of Google<\/a> is a selling point in and of itself, you should also be using keywords everywhere\u2014not just <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/12\/03\/seo-copywriting\">SEO copywriting<\/a>. Remember, these are the words and phrases <em>your audience<\/em> is using. When you speak their language (and not yours), your copy will clearly convey the value of your offerings in a way that resonates with them.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you&#8217;re a web design\/SEO provider for small business owners, this landing page copy will not sell:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>We optimize all our websites for Google search using keyword-targeted metadata, lazy loading, and minified CSS.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>These <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">keywords<\/a> would be easy reads if your clients were web design\/SEO agencies looking to outsource their own. But for the small business owner audience, this is a better sell:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>We make technical optimizations to speed up your website and use keyword-targeted content to help you rank higher on Google.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells-use-keywords-1.png\" alt=\"ahrefs keyword volume results\" width=\"400\" height=\"210\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Keywords = <strong>their<\/strong> jargon, not yours.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>3. Write FABulously<\/h3>\n<p>Did I just come up with the cheesiest thing ever? Yes. But do I secretly like it? Also yes. Copy that sells should always be answering these two questions: <strong>What&#8217;s in it for me and how do I know I&#8217;ll get it? <\/strong>And the key to this is writing with <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/21\/features-vs-benefits\">features and benefits<\/a> in mind. Aka FABulously.<\/p>\n<p>You know to use it in your product or <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/15\/ppc-agency-pricing\">pricing<\/a> page copy:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells-features-benefits-product-description-1.png\" alt=\"example of sales copy with features and benefits\" width=\"720\" height=\"199\" \/><\/div>\n<p>But you can also use it in your blog posts:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells-features-benefits-blog-post-intro-1.png\" alt=\"example of copy that sells\u2014features and benefits in blog post intro\" width=\"720\" height=\"281\" \/><\/div>\n<p>And email subject lines:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells-email-subject-line-FAB-1.png\" alt=\"example of copy that sells\u2014features and benefits in email subject line\" width=\"651\" height=\"331\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>4. Address objections directly<\/h3>\n<p>Feature-benefit copy may sell your reader on actions that <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/15\/lead-magnet-ideas\">move them through your funnel<\/a>, but as they move closer to the actual dollar sale, they&#8217;re going to be putting more careful thought into their decision. Questions change from &#8220;what&#8217;s in it for me?&#8221; to &#8220;but what if&#8230;?&#8221; These objections (conscious or not) are barriers to selling. And while some aspects of your copy will organically speak to them, you should also directly addresses them somewhere.<\/p>\n<p>Not only does this type of copy demonstrate transparency and an understanding of the customer, but it&#8217;s also a way to reinforce your features and benefits and show your subject matter expertise.<\/p>\n<p>But in the name of being concise (which is our next section), reserve this copy for an FAQ section at the bottom of your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/02\/landing-page-copywriting\">landing pages<\/a> with expandable sections, or its own blog post or page.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells-address-objections-directly-1.png\" alt=\"how to write copy that sells\u2014website copy addressing objections directly\" width=\"720\" height=\"403\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/copywritingcourse.com\/copywriting-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>5. Use bullets and lists (strategically)<\/h3>\n<p>Wait! Before you skip over this one\u2014there&#8217;s a strategy within the strategy. According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/cxl.com\/blog\/serial-position-effect\/#:~:text=The%20serial%20position%20effect%20is,and%20the%20middle%20items%20worst.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">serial position effect<\/a>, people tend to recall the first and last items in a series the best. So when you\u2019re using bullet points, make sure you place the MVPs accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>This may be more applicable to longer lists, but here&#8217;s a small example.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells-bullets-1.png\" alt=\"how to write copy that sells\u2014example of bulleted list\" width=\"400\" height=\"117\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If I only remember the first and last bullets, my clear takeaway from this <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/19\/webinar-landing-pages\">webinar landing page <\/a>is that I&#8217;m going to learn lead scoring best practices (feature) so I can understand my prospects\u2019 engagement (benefit).

Remove redundant or empty adverbs<\/h3>\n<p>These not only add unnecessary words to your copy, but they also sound more desperate than authoritative. Let&#8217;s have a look.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Unnecessary adverbs:<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>carefully curated \u2192 curated<br \/>\nstressful crisis \u2192 crisis<br \/>\nimportant priorities \u2192 priorities<br \/>\nover exaggerate \u2192 exaggerate<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Unnecessary and desperate adverbs: <\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>critically important \u2192 critical<br \/>\npowerfully effective \u2192 powerful<br \/>\nextremely helpful \u2192 helpful<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Adverbs aren&#8217;t altogether bad.

I&#8217;m interested.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In these cases, the extra words are effective, not destructive. Just make sure you deliver on your promise<\/p>\n<h3>7. Replace adjectives with stronger nouns<\/h3>\n<p>Another great <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/15\/copywriting-tips\">copywriting tip<\/a>: Replace adjective-noun pairs with just one, more powerful noun.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>difficult situation \u2192 dilemma<br \/>\ntough spot \u2192 bind<br \/>\nspecific group \u2192 niche<br \/>\nsmall difference \u2192 nuance<br \/>\nclose connection \u2192 rapport<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>One less word. Lots more power. Speaking of power, have you seen our list of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/22\/power-words\">over 350 power words<\/a>?<\/p>\n<h3>8. Remove nonwords<\/h3>\n<p>The SERP for &#8220;nonwords&#8221; is rough. I may or may not have had an <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/11\/06\/content-editing\">editorial<\/a> identity crisis while I was in there.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells-identity-crisis-1.png\" alt=\"steve harvey\" width=\"400\" height=\"327\" \/><\/div>\n<p>But you have to remember that we&#8217;re not talking about essays or news articles here.

Say ta-ta to tauto(logy)<\/h3>\n<p>Turns out there&#8217;s a technical term for fluff. Tautology is the practice of saying the same thing more than once but with different words to try to look like you&#8217;re not. Let&#8217;s call it black-hat redundancy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This, for example, is tautology at its finest:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7883eadc-8c7a-4ba9-8138-a3d2e1831d2f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells-tautology-fluff-1.png\" alt=\"tautological copywriting example\" width=\"709\" height=\"359\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>121 words that tell me you have no idea what you&#8217;re talking about. <\/em><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells-tightened-copy-1.png\" alt=\"example of copy that sells\u2014tightened paragraph\" width=\"692\" height=\"141\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>44 words that convince me I need personalization in my ecommerce strategy. Sold.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>10. Save it for another page<\/h3>\n<p>First of all, &#8220;world-class&#8221; is not a selling point. It&#8217;s an empty adjective (also something we&#8217;ll get to later). Intellum (cringe) uses this on its homepage:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells-world-class-1.png\" alt=\"example of copy that doesn't sell\u2014world-class empty adjective\" width=\"550\" height=\"216\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Now if you are actually world-class (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellum.com\/solutions\/consulting-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">which Intellum is<\/a>), back it up\u2014but not in your home page, solutions page, or landing pages. Say it in a sentence and then use a &#8220;learn more&#8221; button to show credibility and link to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/05\/longform-content\">long-form<\/a> (but also concise!) copy that proves it.<\/p>\n<h3>11. Be blunt<\/h3>\n<p>Take concision to the extreme with one or two-word sentences. For example:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells-blunt-simple-copy-1.png\" alt=\"ad headline using plain and simple words\" width=\"500\" height=\"76\" \/><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>&#8220;Video Editing Software.

Avoid empty testimonials<\/h3>\n<p>While this isn&#8217;t copy you write, it&#8217;s copy that sells. We&#8217;ve all seen <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/16\/get-more-google-reviews\">5-star reviews<\/a> or testimonials like &#8220;ServicePro was great. I&#8217;ll definitely use them again.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Positive? Yes. Credible? No.<\/p>\n<p>In the example below from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.akvertise.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Akvertise<\/a> website, you get a specific person complimenting a specific employee on specific actions.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells-detailed-testimonial-example_0-1.png\" alt=\"example of copy that sells\u2014detailed testimonial\" width=\"400\" height=\"366\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Instead of just <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">asking for a review<\/a>, ask through email if you can get a quote from them for your website. Beause there&#8217;s no on-the-spot pressure and they&#8217;re typing it out, they&#8217;ll put more careful thought into it, and knowing that it will appear on your website, they&#8217;ll make sure it makes them look good too.<\/p>\n<h3>13. Share statements, not opinions<\/h3>\n<p>Outwardly trying to convince with your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/06\/26\/product-descriptions\">product description<\/a> copywriting has the opposite effect. Stick with simple statements.<\/p>\n<p>For example, you might use an adjective like &#8220;fastest installation&#8221; in a header to attract your visitor, but plain Jane statements like &#8220;one day installation&#8221; and &#8220;24 hours&#8221; work better in the feature breakdown.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells-24-hrs-bath-fitters-1.png\" alt=\"example of copy that sells\u2014bathfitters using &quot;24 hours&quot; instead of &quot;quick&quot;\" width=\"450\" height=\"119\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>14. Replace adjectives with verbs<\/h3>\n<p>Rather than describe your product as all-in-one, easy to use, powerful, etc., to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/29\/how-to-promote-a-product\">promote your product or service<\/a>, use verbs to communicate exactly what they can do with your product.

Nix empty adjectives<\/h3>\n<p>Continuing on in this anti-adjective campaign, take a look at this example (adapted from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.davidmeermanscott.com\/blog\/2011\/10\/hospital_gobbledygook.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">David Meerman Scott<\/a>):<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We have assembled surgical and clinical expertise second to none, have a state-of-the-art trauma center, developed sophisticated minimally invasive techniques, and call on innovative training and technology to ensure the highest level of patient safety and quality of care. These clinical initiatives, a thriving research enterprise, and an unparalleled medical education program all enable [Hospital Z] to fulfill our mission.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells-confused-face-1.png\" alt=\"kristen wigg confused face\" width=\"250\" height=\"311\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This copy should be broken up into segments with credible information&#8230;perhaps bullets (tip #5)?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u2022 <em>Our trauma center uses minimally invasive techniques like laparoscopic surgery to shorten your recovery period.<\/em><br \/>\n<em>\u2022 With our in-house research teams and Harvard-trained surgeons, you can rest assured you&#8217;ll get the highest qua<\/em>lity of care.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Easier to read (tip #1), FABulous (tip # 3), and credible. Sold.<\/p>\n<h3>17. Don&#8217;t be afraid to get technical<\/h3>\n<p>As you can see from the bullets above, adjectives aren&#8217;t always bad. But if you&#8217;re going to use them, make them specific and factual. Words like \u201cdurable,\u201d \u201csecure,\u201d \u201chighly trained,\u201d and \u201cunique\u201d work, but can you get more specific to build more confidence in potential buyers? Y.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>strong \u2192 titanium-based<br \/>\ndurable \u2192 industrial-grade<br \/>\nsecure \u2192 NP2-encrypted (made that up)<br \/>\ntrained \u2192 DSFA-certified (that one too)<br \/>\nunique \u2192 proprietary<br \/>\nsafe \u2192 flame-retardent<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s technical, but this type of copy sells, even if customers don&#8217;t need to know what it all means.<\/p>\n<h3>16. Use data<\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to credibility, nothing beats data.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells-data-1.png\" alt=\"example of copy that sells using data\" width=\"720\" height=\"403\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Again, even if customers don&#8217;t know what these numbers mean, they see that cybereason has proof. Numbers sell.<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"compellingcopy\"><\/a>How to write COMPELLING copy that sells<\/h2>\n<p>Compelling copy is <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/15\/lead-magnet-ideas\">magnetic<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>(PS: In this section, adjectives are our friends.)<\/p>\n<p>PPS: You may also be interested in these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/01\/holiday-copywriting\">10 ways to avoid cliches in your copywriting<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>18. Read their minds<\/h3>\n<p>Think about the assumptions, hopes, doubts, or fears your buyer personas have, like:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>I&#8217;m not an online business so I don&#8217;t really need a website.<br \/>\nWhat the heck does amortize even mean?<br \/>\nIf I hear [buzzword, cliche, etc.] one more time&#8230;<br \/>\nNative ads are like display ads, right?<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Capture real thoughts your target audience has, and create an immediate personal connection that draws them in.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells-read-minds-1.png\" alt=\"example of copy that sells\u2014mind-reading statement\" width=\"720\" height=\"121\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Thoughts can be among the most compelling headlines.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>19. Make it urgent<\/h3>\n<p>Urgency is the hallmark of selling. As Ray Edwards puts it in his book <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Write-Copy-Sells-Step-Step\/dp\/161448502X\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to Write Copy That Sells<\/a>, \u201cYou need to place a dollar cost on this failure to solve the problem when at all possible.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This means not only using words like &#8220;now,&#8221; &#8220;today,&#8221; or &#8220;hurry&#8221; in your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2010\/09\/29\/unusual-effective-calls-to-action\">CTAs<\/a>, but communicating to your readers the cost of indecision or ignoring the problem.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells-cost-danger-1.png\" alt=\"example of emotional copy that sells\" width=\"299\" height=\"438\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>20. Use the power of emotion<\/h3>\n<p>Factual copy sells, but not all sales copy is factual. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/11\/09\/emotional-ads\">Emotions<\/a> hold equal power. And you can do even better than the fear-based ad above. No matter your product or service, it all comes down to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/28\/pain-points\">pain points<\/a> and desires, which come down to all kinds of emotions. For example:<\/p>\n<p>We sell: <em>marketing services.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>So our customers can: <em>grow their business.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Because they want to feel:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Confident<\/strong> <em>that they&#8217;re using the right strategies.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Excited<\/strong><em> about getting new customers.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Proud<\/strong> <em>of what they&#8217;ve built.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And they don&#8217;t want to feel:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Overwhelmed<\/strong> <em>at the number of strategies out there.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Worried<\/strong> <em>about missing opportunities.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Defeated<\/strong> <em>by competitors.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Translate your customers&#8217; pain points and desires into emotions they both want and don&#8217;t want to feel, then either elicit them with your copy or use the emotion word itself. This is particularly helpful for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/03\/storytelling-in-content-marketing\">storytelling<\/a> (which we&#8217;ll get into shortly).<\/p>\n<p>Like keywords (tip #2), <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/13\/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing\">emotional marketing copy<\/a> speaks your customers&#8217; language. When they feel like you <em>truly<\/em> understand their problems and desires, they&#8217;ll feel more confident that you can solve them. In other words, it&#8217;s an emotional way of gaining credibility.<\/p>\n<h3>21. Try out power verbs<\/h3>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a simple <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/15\/copywriting-tips\">copywriting exercise<\/a>. Write a plain sentence starting with &#8220;We sell&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Now, replace the word sell with captivating verbs like:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u2022 Eliminate<br \/>\n\u2022 Empower<br \/>\n\u2022 Level up<br \/>\n\u2022 Inspire<br \/>\n\u2022 Reduce<br \/>\n\u2022 Unlock<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells-unlock-1.png\" alt=\"example of powerful verb in home page header\" width=\"600\" height=\"154\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Continuing with our example above:<\/p>\n<p>We <strong>sell<\/strong> marketing services.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u2022 <em>We <strong>eliminate<\/strong> the guesswork of coming up with a marketing plan.<\/em><br \/>\n<em>\u2022 We <strong>empower<\/strong> business owners to compete with big businesses.<br \/>\n\u2022 We <strong>level up <\/strong>your online presence.<br \/>\n\u2022 We <strong>inspire<\/strong> business owners to make a mark in their community.<br \/>\n\u2022 We <strong>reduce<\/strong> the amount of time you spend on growing your business.<br \/>\n\u2022 We <strong>unlock<\/strong> your business&#8217;s full potential.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>You get the idea.

Pick out your favorites and fill in the blanks.<\/p>\n<h3>22. Make it about them<\/h3>\n<p>Notice in the example above, every statement starts with &#8220;we.&#8221; That was just an exercise to help you come up with compelling concepts, but the copy itself should be about your customers about 90% of the time.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>With our Builder\u2014a Google Chrome Extension\u2014you can create flows and track new events with a few clicks.

Later on when they&#8217;re doing their vetting, copywriting about what you offer and how you do it makes more sense.<\/p>\n<h3>23. Use storytelling (okay but what does that MEAN)<\/h3>\n<p>If copy that sells is concise and to the point, then how the heck does storytelling fit into the picture? <em>(See what I did there (tip #18).)<\/em> Enter<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/16\/copywriting-formulas\"> copywriting formulas<\/a>.

Try catchy statements<\/h3>\n<p>This could work with homepage headers or even <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/27\/facebook-ad-copy-tests\">Facebook ad copy<\/a>. You can use the contrast approach, such as with<em> &#8220;One source of truth.

Businesses use it to collect information and tasks in one place so that everyone has one source of truth.)<\/p>\n<p>More ways to write catchy copy include alliteration, rhyming (ideally subtle to reduce the cheese factor), or taking the &#8220;not this, but that&#8221; approach:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells-catchy-homepage-headline-1.png\" alt=\"example of copy that sells\u2014visme's catchy website headline\" width=\"720\" height=\"192\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>25. Final tip: be careful with assumptions<\/h3>\n<p>Okay so, we all know not to overtly patronize or belittle our prospects for obvious reasons. But words like \u201cwe all know\u201d and \u201cobvious\u201d can be subtly destructive if used in the wrong manner.<\/p>\n<p>I said it above because it\u2019s a cultural norm not to belittle or patronize. So this word choice serves to <em>not insult<\/em> your readers\u2019 intelligence. But in the case below, the same words can have the opposite effect.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Everyone knows that drip email campaigns can increase conversions, but how do you create them? What tools do you need?<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Maybe your reader doesn\u2019t know this. No, they aren&#8217;t going to feel consciously offended, but they might have a micro-moment of feeling inadequate or like they&#8217;re in the wrong place. Here\u2019s a better alternative:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>If you\u2019re like most marketers, you\u2019re always looking for ways to increase conversions with your emails. Drip campaigns make this possible. But how do you create them?<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So be careful with assumptive words and phrases that hold power to insult or acknowledge your readers\u2019 intelligence.<\/p>\n<h2>You now have what it takes to write copy that sells (anything)<\/h2>\n<p>The fifth in the five Cs is &#8220;call to action,&#8221; but if you&#8217;ve followed all the tips above, this will be the easy part.
