The Association for Consumer Research conducted a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.acrwebsite.org\/volumes\/7166\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study on the impact of music in ads<\/a> on TV and found that music in an advertisement improved overall ad effectiveness in many ways, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Higher purchase intent.<\/li>\n<li>Improved attitude towards the brand and the ad itself.<\/li>\n<li>Enhanced consumer persuasion and ad recall.<\/li>\n<li>Increased preference for the advertised product.<\/li>\n<li>Improved mental image memory of the product.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Why does music in advertising have such a strong impact?<\/h2>\n<p>Music\u2019s impact on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/23\/influence-buyers-marketing-psychology\">buying decisions\u00a0<\/a>has been studied for years, and the answer lies in the brain. Neuroscientists have analyzed the brain mechanisms related to memory, finding that words set to music are the easiest to remember. This is because <a href=\"https:\/\/www.soundstripe.com\/blogs\/the-psychology-of-music\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">music memory is stored in a few different parts of the brain<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/music-in-ads-brain-on-music.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" alt=\"music in advertising: brain's reaction to music\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>So music can increase ad recall, mood enhancement, and the likelihood of purchasing. And\u00a0given the fact that on average, it takes eight touchpoints with your brand for a prospect to become a lead with online advertising this is huge.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/music-in-ads-spongebob-meme.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"397\" alt=\"spongebob meme about music\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>But what about using music in ads online?<\/h2>\n<p>The results above are telling, but the study was done on TV ads. So, does music matter in the new age of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/05\/online-advertising-costs\">online advertising<\/a>? Absolutely. Consider these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/08\/video-marketing-statistics\">video marketing stats<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Marketers who use video <strong>grow revenue 49% faster<\/strong> than non-video users.<\/li>\n<li>Among consumers, <strong>70% purchased<\/strong> from a brand after seeing a branded video on social media..<\/li>\n<li>Instagram video ads receive <strong>3x more engagement<\/strong> than image ads.<\/li>\n<li>Adding a video to your website can <strong>double the conversion rate<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Social video generates <strong>1200% more shares<\/strong> than text and image content combined.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And think about TikTok.

And that\u2019s what this guide is for. So let\u2019s start with picking the right music for your ads.<\/p>\n<h2>How to pick the right music for ads<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s not enough to randomly choose <a href=\"https:\/\/www.soundstripe.com\/youtube-background-music\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">royalty-free background music<\/a> for your ads. We\u2019ve established that using the right song has the potential to make a positive impact on how consumers view your brand.<\/p>\n<p>However, using the wrong music can cause an unwelcome distraction from your message. So here are some things to consider when choosing music for your ads:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Brand:<\/strong> What is your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/31\/brand-personality-messaging\">brand\u2019s personality<\/a>? How does this music reflect your brand\u2019s voice?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Demographic:<\/strong> There is likely a correlation between your market and the type of music they listen to. Look at factors such as age, gender, and similar interests.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Content: <\/strong>Is there a voiceover or is music the main focus? Do you want people to notice the music straight away?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Message:<\/strong> What mood are you inspiring? What do you want the consumer to do? What <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/03\/emotional-marketing-copy\">emotions<\/a> do you want them to feel?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/music-in-ads-emotion-brand-appeal.png\" width=\"650\" height=\"253\" alt=\"correlation between emotions, persuasion, and brand appeal\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>Tips for successfully using music in ads<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">Once you\u2019ve found the right music, you\u2019ll want to make sure your ads are reaching a music-friendly audience. Here are some tips on how to do that. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>1. Focus on placements where users are more likely to have sound on:<\/h3>\n<p>While many Facebook users browse through their feed with the sound off, there are other social media platforms (and scenarios within Facebook) where sound is preferred, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facebook and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/07\/instagram-story-ads\">Instagram Story ads<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.yumyumvideos.com\/instagram-statistics-2019\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>70%<\/em><\/a><em> of Instagram users watch Stories on a daily basis, and <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/animoto.com\/blog\/news\/social-video-trends-consumers-2020\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>one in four<\/em><\/a><em> consumers have made a purchase after seeing a story on Instagram.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/31\/pre-roll-ads\">YouTube pre-roll ads<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/22\/instagram-reels-ideas-for-businesses\">Instagram Reels<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/22\/tiktok-ads\">TikTok ads<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Spotify<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>2. Target audio-focused audiences<\/h3>\n<p>Think outside the box and find ways to reach sound-friendly audiences. For example,<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Market to a lookalike audience of users who have watched a high percentage of a previous <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/11\/14\/facebook-video-ad\">video ad<\/a> that was audio-focused.<\/li>\n<li>Consider partnering with an independent musician or influencer who has an audio-focused market and ask them to share your content.<\/li>\n<li>Ask your audience to vote on audio for your next ad or video.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>3. Remind users to turn the sound on<\/h3>\n<p>Not everyone has their sound off because they\u2019re out in public or don\u2019t have headphones. Sometimes they just need to be prompted. Did you know that if a user taps the \u201csound on\u201d sticker placed in an Instagram Story, it will automatically turn their audio on?<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/music-in-ads-instagram-sound-on-sticker.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"570\" alt=\"music in ads: instagram story sound on sticker\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>4. Test out different sounds<\/h3>\n<p>Be sure to split-test to make sure you\u2019re getting the best results. Test out:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Songs<\/li>\n<li>Sound effects<\/li>\n<li>Male vs female voiceovers. This is highly dependent on your market, but generally, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.business2community.com\/video-marketing\/male-female-voice-matters-explainer-videos-01712050\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">female voices are preferred <\/a>by most users!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>5. Use captions regardless<\/h3>\n<p>If the sound in your ad is a voiceover, you\u2019ll still want to use captions, of course. This is a given, since videos in Facebook and Instagram feeds are on mute by default. This is also a best practice for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/12\/12\/web-accessibility-tips\">accessibility<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/30\/email-accessibility\">inclusivity<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>How to use music in ads legally: what is music licensing?<\/h2>\n<p>If 12-year-old Timmy uploads a YouTube video of his cat with Taylor Swift music playing in the background, the video may get flagged and monetized by T.Swift\u2019s label.<\/p>\n<p>And if a big company plays a Taylor Swift song in an ad to sell their product, well, she may sue you and write a song about it. (As someone who lives in Nashville, trust me, you don\u2019t want a Taylor Swift song written about you).<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/music-in-ads-taylor-swift-lawsuits.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"472\" alt=\"music in ads: taylor swift lawsuit headlines\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Bottom line: You REALLY need the legal all-clear to use music in your ads. This is where music licensing comes in.<\/p>\n<p>Music licensing is the means by which a publisher, advertiser, or even another musician gets legal permission to use someone else\u2019s music. Sounds simple, right? But there\u2019s much more to it.<\/p>\n<h2>Terms and misconceptions to know about when using music in ads<\/h2>\n<p>So, what the heck is the law with music licensing and how does it work for marketers?\u00a0Here are five terms to know:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Fair use<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Meaning:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/fair%20use\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fair use<\/a> is \u201ca legal doctrine that portions of copyrighted materials may be used without permission of the copyright owner provided the use is fair and reasonable, does not substantially impair the value of the materials, and does not curtail the profits reasonably expected by the owner.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Misconception:<\/strong> I want to use this song, it\u2019s only fair. I\u2019ll just use it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reality:<\/strong> You can only play the song if you\u2019re giving a commentary on the track. (This is a really gray area and you still might get sued, so talk to a lawyer first.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>2. Creative commons<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Meaning:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Creative Commons<\/a> is a nonprofit organization that makes digital media available for others to build upon legally and share.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Misconception: <\/strong>The song exists, so as long as I credit the artist in my content, I can use it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reality: <\/strong>An artist still has to grant permission for Creative Commons to be valid. Even still, there\u2019s always fine print around how you can use the music, and sometimes fine print under the fine print. (Hint: Advertising is usually not allowed!)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>3. Public domain<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Meaning: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.copyrightlaws.com\/what-is-the-public-domain\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Public domain<\/a> music is not protected by intellectual property laws such as copyright, trademark, or patents.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Misconception:<\/strong> This song is old and falls under public domain, so I\u2019ll use this track.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reality: <\/strong>While the original song may be under public domain, the track you\u2019re using was recorded by an orchestra that owns the master license. You\u2019re still gonna get sued \u2014 just not by the (possibly deceased) original artist.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/music-in-ads-creative-commons-royalty-free.png\" width=\"684\" height=\"386\" alt=\"music in ads: creative commons vs royalty free vs public domain\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>4. Royalty-free<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Meaning: <\/strong>Royalty-free music means the music is subject to copyright but does not require you to pay royalties (ongoing payments) or license fees.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Misconception:<\/strong> This song is free for me to use.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reality:<\/strong> You don\u2019t need to pay royalties on a per-use basis, but there may still be some fees involved to license and use the music.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Related:\u00a0<\/strong><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/14\/royalty-free-background-music\">11 Places to Find Royalty-Free Background Music<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>5. Copyright-free<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Meaning: <\/strong>This means the music is not protected by copyright.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Misconception: <\/strong>This song has no copyright owner so I can just use it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reality: <\/strong>A second party has acquired the right to use the work OR the copyright expired, but it still isn\u2019t \u201cfree\u201d for any use. (In fact, there\u2019s really no such thing as free music because licensing is a confusing web of rules and regulations.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What is a music licensing service?<\/h2>\n<p>As you can see, finding music for commercial use can be a headache. If you frequently use music in your marketing and advertising content, you may want to check out a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.soundstripe.com\/royalty-free-music\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">music licensing company<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>These are companies such as Soundstripe, Artlist, and Epidemic Sound with libraries of songs that you can legally use in your ads. Their terms and conditions are created specifically for this.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/music-in-ads-soundstripe.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"385\" alt=\"music licensing service - soundstripe platform screenshot\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Music licensing service pros:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You don\u2019t have to have a law degree to license music.<\/li>\n<li>No one gets sued.<\/li>\n<li>It\u2019s easy to find great music to enhance your ads.<\/li>\n<li>Pricing is relatively cheap (as low as $20\/month).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Music licensing service cons:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can\u2019t license Taylor Swift songs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Music licensing service cautions<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some \u2014 but definitely not all \u2014\u00a0companies have fine print around how you can use their music, so you still might need a lawyer to go through the details with you.<\/li>\n<li>Many companies require a subscription to license the music, and some are more expensive than others.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What to look for in a music licensing service<\/h2>\n<p>Even if pricing is relatively cheap, you\u2019re still paying money. So it\u2019s important to make sure whatever platform you invest in will get you the most\u00a0 bang for your buck. Here are some things to look for when vetting music licensing platforms:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Additional content: <\/strong>Some services also provide stock video and sound effects.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Original music: <\/strong>Some services\u2014like Soundstripe\u2014actually hire musicians to write music for ads.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Quality of music:<\/strong> Some services actually have Grammy-winning artists and producers they work with.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Tested music:<\/strong> Soundstripe, for example, actually tests music for conversion rates in its own ads.<\/li>\n<li><strong>\u201cSoundalike\u201d songs: <\/strong>While you can\u2019t license popular music you hear on the radio, there are \u201csimilar song\u201d search tools that allow you to find tracks similar to the one you had in mind.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Standardization:<\/strong> Every track is produced to the same specs, so you can easily transition from one to another.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Selective features: <\/strong>You can download stems for every song, so you can choose to mute the vocalist, drums, guitar, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Start using music in your video ads<\/h2>\n<p>At the end of the day, having music in your ad can yield some pretty significant results in your marketing efforts. You can expect to see more positivity around your brand, higher ad recall, and even more sales!<\/p>\n<p>Go check out some royalty-free music playlists, and be sure to review some video marketing best practices before publishing your next video ad.
