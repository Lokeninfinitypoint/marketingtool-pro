Here, we have some of the best AI photo generators you can use at no cost. They\u2019re quick, dependable, and easy to use. Some options have limited free tiers and more capabilities with a paid subscription. Others are completely free tools.<\/p>\n<h3>1. OpenArt<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/openart.ai\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenArt<\/a> has a few subscription tiers and plenty of capabilities in the free version. Like other tools on the list, it allows you to create and edit photos. OpenArt also has some very cool quick-start options, which let you choose a specific style. This helps save time and reduces the repetitive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-prompts\">prompts<\/a> you\u2019ll need to write.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the prompt I used: A photograph of a chunky ceramic blue coffee mug with the name CEILLIE on it, sitting on a table next to a pair of succulents in pots.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/best-AI-photo-generator-wordstream-blue-cup2.webp\" alt=\"Best AI photo generators - AI generated image of a post and cup on a table.\" width=\"625\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85717 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/best-AI-photo-generator-wordstream-blue-cup2.webp 625w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/best-AI-photo-generator-wordstream-blue-cup2-480x461.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 625px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now, my name is hard to spell, but I have to admit that I expected AI to get it right. This is another good reminder to always double-check your photo, especially when you\u2019re using it in your marketing materials.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Image Creator from Microsoft Designer<\/h3>\n<p>Microsoft\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bing.com\/images\/create\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image Creator<\/a> also allows you to create and edit images. I used the same prompt, asking for a blue coffee mug with my name on it, and I was impressed that the tool interpreted \u201cchunky ceramic\u201d closer to how I pictured it. My name wasn\u2019t spelled correctly, but at least it was a different misspelling.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/best-AI-photo-generator-wordstream-blue-cup.webp\" alt=\"Best AI photo generators - AI generated image of a cup with a plant in it.\" width=\"852\" height=\"432\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85716 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/best-AI-photo-generator-wordstream-blue-cup.webp 852w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/best-AI-photo-generator-wordstream-blue-cup-480x243.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 852px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The interface actually makes it very simple to generate an image and then use the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/25\/ai-content-generators\"> AI tools<\/a> to adjust it. In the image above, you can see the buttons to download or copy the image quickly, an option to use the image in a larger design, and an option to use Image Creator\u2019s AI editor to make some tweaks. It\u2019d be easy to drop the final product in a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-for-social-media\"> social media post<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udce3 <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteAllStarPlaybook.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_AllStarPlaybook_Download\">The All-Star Playbook to Online Advertising<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>3. ImageFX by Google<\/h3>\n<p>Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com\/tools\/image-fx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ImageFX<\/a> is an experimental tool powered by Imagen 2. It\u2019s completely free to use to generate text-to-image assets for your marketing needs. The interface has some great recommended options to include in your prompt to help guide the output, including 35mm film, photorealistic, film still, and cool tones.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/best-AI-photo-generator-wordstream-patio-1.webp\" alt=\"Best AI photo generators - AI generated image of a dog eating.\" width=\"851\" height=\"421\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85720 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/best-AI-photo-generator-wordstream-patio-1.webp 851w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/best-AI-photo-generator-wordstream-patio-1-480x237.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 851px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There are so many ads on this one, though, it can be harder to use than other platforms.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Pixlr<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/pixlr.com\/image-generator\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pixlr<\/a> is a photo editing platform with templates, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/social-media-image-sizes\">resizing options<\/a>, some light design assistance, as well as AI-powered editing options, and a text-to-image generator.<\/p>\n<p>I used the same prompt as I did with ImageFX above. The results were less literal (no puppies actively eating), but they are so adorable that I don\u2019t think I mind.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/best-AI-photo-generator-wordstream-puppies.webp\" alt=\"Best AI photo generators - AI generated image of dogs with food.\" width=\"809\" height=\"290\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85722 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/best-AI-photo-generator-wordstream-puppies.webp 809w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/best-AI-photo-generator-wordstream-puppies-480x172.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 809px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Pixlr offers a free trial with 250 credits, but this will last a while if you\u2019re creating images. Then, there are premium upgrades for unlimited generations and privacy options.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Adobe Firefly<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.adobe.com\/products\/firefly\/features\/text-to-image.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Adobe Firefly<\/a> offers text-to-image generation and generative image expansion, which is a very cool feature. The platform is also incredibly easy to navigate and straightforward to use. Unlike some other tools, you can see the settings, the generated images, and the prompt all at once, which is helpful for making adjustments for better output. That\u2019ll be helpful when you\u2019re creating assets for your marketing materials.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/best-AI-photo-generator-wordstream-yellow-flowers.webp\" alt=\"Best AI photo generators - AI generated image of a paper bag on a bench.\" width=\"865\" height=\"433\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85724 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/best-AI-photo-generator-wordstream-yellow-flowers.webp 865w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/best-AI-photo-generator-wordstream-yellow-flowers-480x240.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 865px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There is a free tier, and then you can get access to more AI-generated assets and more tools with a subscription to Adobe Firefly or the Adobe Creative Suite.<\/p>\n<div id=\"best-subscription-based-ai-photo-generators\"><\/div>\n<h2>Best subscription-based AI photo generators<\/h2>\n<p>The AI photo generators below require subscriptions but provide some extra bang for your buck, including stock photo libraries, usage rights, and more design platform capabilities. In some cases, you might already be subscribed to the tool and can start using the AI capabilities or add them on for a lower cost.<\/p>\n<h3>6. DALL-E 3<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/openai.com\/index\/dall-e-3\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DALL-E 3<\/a> is OpenAI\u2019s image generator. You might remember its predecessor, DALL-E 2, which captured the internet\u2019s attention <a href=\"https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/information-technology\/2024\/04\/when-ai-images-were-mind-blowing-early-users-recall-the-first-days-of-dall-e-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">back in 2022<\/a>.\u00a0 According to OpenAI, the latest version has stronger text and image matches and better image quality.<\/p>\n<p>Also, DALL-E 3 is available for Plus subscribers on the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/03\/06\/how-to-use-chatgpt-for-small-business-marketing\"> ChaptGPT<\/a> platform. Because it\u2019s integrated, you submit your<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/08\/chatgpt-prompts\"> ChatGPT prompt<\/a> and edits to refine your image in the same easy-to-use interface.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/best-AI-photo-generator-wordstream-red-tree.webp\" alt=\"Best AI photo generators - AI generated image of a white house with flowers growing on it.\" width=\"875\" height=\"530\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85723 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/best-AI-photo-generator-wordstream-red-tree.webp 875w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/best-AI-photo-generator-wordstream-red-tree-480x291.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 875px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>7. iStock AI Generator by Getty Images<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.istockphoto.com\/ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Getty&#8217;s iStock<\/a> AI Generator is powered by NVIDIA Picasso. Like other generators, you can create new images by writing out a text-based prompt. By subscribing to this tool, you also get access to iStock\u2019s stock Getty images library.<\/p>\n<p>You can manipulate these photos using AI to better suit your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/03\/best-marketing-strategies\">marketing strategy<\/a>. Use the tool to make more room for your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/03\/copywriting-examples\">copy<\/a>, create the sizes you need, remove objects, and even add your product.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Canva<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canva.com\/magic-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Canva<\/a> is an excellent design tool for non-designer marketers like myself who still need to edit images or create a quick graphic here and there. Canva also has a feature called Magic Studio that uses AI editing tools. It includes automation for resizing and object selection and options for photo and video edits.<\/p>\n<p>They also have Magic Media, an AI generator for text-to-image and text-to-video. Here\u2019s a quick image that I created with a very basic prompt: \u201cCreate an image of a deck overlooking rolling hills and a sunset. On the deck, there are chairs and a table set for an amazing summer meal.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/best-AI-photo-generator-wordstream-patio.webp\" alt=\"Best AI photo generators - AI generated image of a patio and table.\" width=\"610\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85721 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/best-AI-photo-generator-wordstream-patio.webp 610w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/best-AI-photo-generator-wordstream-patio-480x472.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 610px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>9. Photo Room<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.photoroom.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Photo Room<\/a> is an editing tool with a ton of AI-powered options, including text-to-image generation, automated background removal, object removal, and resizing.<\/p>\n<p>But one of the best use cases for Photo Room is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/26\/product-photography\">product photos<\/a>. The tool offers AI background removal, replacement, manipulation, and options to include text behind objects. With Photo Room, you can transform any snapshot of your product into a stylized, branded shot.<\/p>\n<p>Photo Room has free tools, but the AI background generator, text-to-image generator, and more are available with the subscription only.<\/p>\n<h3>10. DreamStudio<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/beta.dreamstudio.ai\/generate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DreamStudio<\/a> by Stability AI is powered with Stable Diffusion and can help create and edit images. The DreamStudio interface has fields for both a prompt and a \u201cnegative prompt.\u201d You describe what you\u2019re looking for and then have a designated space to say what you\u2019re definitely not looking for, which is almost as important in some cases.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/best-AI-photo-generator-wordstream-dream-studio.webp\" alt=\"Best AI photo generators - DreamStudio workstation.\" width=\"357\" height=\"573\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85718 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/best-AI-photo-generator-wordstream-dream-studio.webp 357w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/best-AI-photo-generator-wordstream-dream-studio-187x300.webp 187w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>DreamStudio\u2019s payment model is usage-based. It does come with a couple of free credits, but there isn\u2019t an entire free tier. It lets you generate up to 10 images with each prompt. It\u2019s nice to have options, especially with usage-based fees.<\/p>\n<div id=\"best-ai-photo-generators-for-professional-headshots\"><\/div>\n<h2>Best AI photo generators for professional headshots<\/h2>\n<p>Getting great headshots for your team is an investment many small businesses can\u2019t justify. And sometimes, with remote work and employee turnover challenges, it\u2019s impossible to get cohesive shots for everyone, even if you can work it into the budget. But those unprofessional cropped photos from weddings or study abroad trips aren\u2019t going to cut it. These AI photo generators can create headshots to help your team look professional and on brand.<\/p>\n<h3>11. Facetune<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facetuneapp.com\/features\/ai-headshot-generator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facetune<\/a> by Lighthouse is a photo editing tool that tons of people use for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/10\/facebook-post-ideas\">social media posts<\/a>. It\u2019s aimed specifically toward selfies or portrait mode photos, and its AI generator is also excellent for professional headshots. Once you have a casual, well-lit photo, you can swap the clothes and the background to create a professional headshot to use on LinkedIn, Slack, your website, and more.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/best-AI-photo-generator-wordstream-headshot.webp\" alt=\"Best AI photo generators - Side by side comparison of standard and processual headshots.\" width=\"610\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85719 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/best-AI-photo-generator-wordstream-headshot.webp 610w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/best-AI-photo-generator-wordstream-headshot-480x472.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 610px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Obsessed with this AI green suit here.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>So as long as you have a phone\u2014iOS or Android\u2014you can have a professional headshot.<\/p>\n<h3>12. MyEdit<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/myedit.online\/en\/photo-editor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MyEdit<\/a> has a bit more flexibility than Facetune, offering automated spot or overall retouches, outfit swaps, object removal, and AI headshot generation.<\/p>\n<p>MyEdit also has an option to enhance the quality of your image files, which is a time-saver, especially if you\u2019re collecting photos from a team to create headshots.<\/p>\n<h3>13. Dreamwave<\/h3>\n<p>Dreamwave is an amazing AI headshot generator. Its website boasts over 16 million headshots created for brands like Meta, Disney, and Apple. The platform is intuitive to navigate and use, and all you need to get started is your email and five photos of yourself.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the free options, there are \u201cphoto shoot\u201d packages. But this is a good place to start if you&#8217;re looking for team headshots for a website. You can set a defined style, whether it&#8217;s a casual session with your brand colors in the background or a suits-and-blazers photoshoot in front of an office wall. Then, you can get seats for each person on your team to manage their own headshot creation and selection within that defined theme\u2014all for way less time and money than an IRL photo shoot.<\/p>\n<h2>No excuses for bad images with these AI photo generators<\/h2>\n<p>You still want to have real photos whenever possible, at events, company milestones, customer meet-ups, and even team offsites. But AI photo generators are a great way to fill in the gaps and avoid going live with bad photos.<\/p>\n<p>Whether it\u2019s headshots for a distributed team (or team of one), website content, or more product photos to have on hand for your marketing materials, you can use AI to help.
