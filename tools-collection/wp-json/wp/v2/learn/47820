When you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/12\/10\/three-types-of-search-queries\">search something<\/a> on Google, those pages and pages of results can\u2019t just materialize out of thin air. In fact, they all come from Google\u2019s index, which you can visualize as an enormous, ever-expanding library of information \u2013 text, images, documents, and the like. It\u2019s ever-expanding because new web pages are created every single day!<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So, how do those new pages get into the index? Search engine spiders, of course.<\/p>\n<h2>How do search engine spiders work?<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Spiders, such as Googlebot, visit web pages in search of new data to add to the index. This is critical because Google\u2019s business model (attract consumers and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/paid-search\">sell ad space<\/a>) is reliant on providing high-quality, relevant, and up-to-date search results.<\/p>\n<p>The spiders are pretty smart, too. They recognize hyperlinks, which they can either follow right away, or take a note of for later crawling. Either way, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/link-building\">internal links<\/a> between pages on the same site function similarly to stepping stones, in that they pave the way for spiders to crawl and store new information.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/search-engine-spider-crawling-process-1.jpg\" width=\"368\" height=\"405\" alt=\"search-engine-spider-crawl\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Speaking of which\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>Why should I care about search engine spiders?<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/12\/13\/seo-hard-truths\">Search engine optimization (SEO)<\/a> is all about boosting your visibility in the organic search results. You\u2019re aiming to attain Domain Authority and get your site on page one for as many keywords as possible.<\/p>\n<p>A good first step towards page one: allowing the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/meta-search-engine\">search engine<\/a> to actually find your web pages. If your stuff isn\u2019t getting indexed, you\u2019re not even sniffing page 13.<\/p>\n<p>The good news: you don\u2019t have to work too hard to get your new pages crawled and indexed. Basically, as long as you link to your new content from some old content, the spiders will eventually follow those links to the new page and store it for indexation. Like we said earlier: internal links are crucial.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re anxious to get your new stuff indexed and in the search results as soon as possible, you can directly submit the new URL to Google and tell the spider to crawl it. Once you hit submit, it shouldn\u2019t be more than a few minutes.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/search-engine-spider-submit-to-google-1.jpg\" width=\"468\" height=\"262\" alt=\"search-engine-spider-manual-indexing\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Can I do anything to help the search engine spiders?<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Why, yes. Yes, you can.<\/p>\n<p>In essence, you want the spiders to see as much of your site as possible, and you want to make their navigation as seamless as it can be. Start with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/01\/22\/google-speed-update\">your site speed<\/a>. The spiders aim to work as quickly as possible without slowing down your site at the expense of user experience. If your site starts to lag, or server errors emerge, the spiders will crawl less.<\/p>\n<p>This, of course, is the opposite of what you want: less crawling means less indexing means worse performance in the search results. Site speed is key.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/11\/14\/what-is-a-sitemap\">Maintain an XML sitemap<\/a> to create a convenient directory for the search engines. This will tell them which URLs need regular crawling.<\/p>\n<p>A basic principle of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/information-architecture\">site architecture<\/a>: keep clicks to a minimum. To be more precise, no page on your site should be more than 3 or 4 clicks away from another. Anything more than that makes navigation cumbersome for users and spiders alike.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, reserve a unique URL for every single piece of content. If you assign several URLs to the same page, it becomes unclear to the spiders which they should use. Remember: a fundamental part of SEO is making the spiders\u2019 jobs easy. Don\u2019t belabor the spiders, and you\u2019ll be just fine.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A search engine spider, also known as a web crawler, is an Internet bot that crawls websites and stores information for the search engine to index.
