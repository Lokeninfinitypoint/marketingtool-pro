We\u2019ve got everything you need to know to get started.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are keyword niches?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Keyword niches are groups of closely related keywords. As an example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re using SEM to promote affordable hiking gear. While <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-research-tool\">conducting your initial keyword research<\/a>, you could create a niche of the following keywords: \u201chiking backpack,\u201d \u201cbackpack for hiking,\u201d \u201cbest hiking backpack,\u201d \u201ccheap hiking backpack,\u201d and \u201cbeginners hiking backpack.\u201d<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/free-keyword-niche-finder-hiking-backpack.png\" alt=\"free-keyword-niche-finder-hiking-backpack\" width=\"800\" height=\"653\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-51743 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/free-keyword-niche-finder-hiking-backpack.png 800w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/free-keyword-niche-finder-hiking-backpack-480x392.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although each of those keywords is unique, they\u2019re all closely related to one another. More importantly, they all signify the same basic intent. Whether someone searches for \u201chiking backpack\u201d or \u201cbackpack for hiking,\u201d their intent is going to similar\u2014they\u2019re interested in hiking and want to find the appropriate backpack.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/free-keyword-niche-finder-hiking-backpack-2.png\" alt=\"free-keyword-niche-finder-hiking-backpack-2\" width=\"800\" height=\"648\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-51742 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/free-keyword-niche-finder-hiking-backpack-2.png 800w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/free-keyword-niche-finder-hiking-backpack-2-480x389.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Recognizing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-intent\">the intent behind a keyword<\/a>\u2014as well as the common intent behind a group of keywords\u2014is fundamental to the creation of relevant ads and website content. Let\u2019s get more specific. We\u2019ll first zoom in on PPC and then transition to SEO.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The importance of keyword niches for PPC<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The basic <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/02\/adwords-account-structure-guide\">hierarchy of a Google Ads account<\/a>\u2014from the broadest level to the most narrow level\u2014is this: account &gt; campaigns &gt; ad groups &gt; keywords &amp; ads. You can check out the handy graphic shown below for a clearer illustration. For the purposes of this guide, the key piece of information is that your keywords and ads live inside your ad groups.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/free-keyword-niche-finder-google-ads-account.png\" alt=\"free-keyword-niche-finder-google-ads-account\" width=\"800\" height=\"424\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-51744 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/free-keyword-niche-finder-google-ads-account.png 800w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/free-keyword-niche-finder-google-ads-account-480x254.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Google Ads houses your keywords and ads together in your ad groups for practical reasons. If you\u2019re entered in the auction for a particular keyword and you win a placement, Google needs to know which of your ads to show to the user. By forcing you to house that keyword in the same ad group as, say, three specific ads, Google has a much easier time finding the right one.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Think of it this way: the keywords in your ad group are attached to the ads in your ad group. When a keyword is triggered, one of the ads it\u2019s attached to is eligible to show to users. Accordingly, you need to write your ads such that each of them matches the intent behind each of the corresponding keywords. Otherwise, you risk serving completely irrelevant ads to your potential customers. As we explain in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/negative-keywords\">our guide to negative keywords<\/a>, serving irrelevant ads leads to the lose-lose situation of wasted impressions and wasted money.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Keyword niches are incredibly valuable because\u2014unless you\u2019ve got the time to develop a successful <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/03\/the-case-against-skags\">SKAG strategy<\/a>\u2014it\u2019s likely that the number of keywords in your ad group will be greater than the number of ads. You may find yourself with an ad group that contains a dozen keywords and only three ads. If those keywords are closely related to one another, it\u2019s easy to make each of your three ads highly relevant. If those keywords aren\u2019t closely related to one another, you\u2019ll be at risk of serving irrelevant ads and wasting money.<\/p>\n<p>TL;DR \u2014 Keyword niches enable you to optimize your Google Ads account structure and serve the right ads at the right times.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The importance of keyword niches for SEO<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now that we\u2019ve covered the paid stuff, let\u2019s turn our attention to organic stuff\u2014SEO.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the macro level, your ability to rank highly in the organic search results depends on a multitude of factors. To name a few: your site has to be crawlable, you have to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/21\/b2b-link-building\">earn backlinks<\/a> from credible domains, and you need to structure your site in a logical manner.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/free-keyword-niche-finder-backlinks.png\" alt=\"free-keyword-niche-finder-backlinks\" width=\"800\" height=\"586\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-51745 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/free-keyword-niche-finder-backlinks.png 800w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/free-keyword-niche-finder-backlinks-480x352.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although there\u2019s a multitude of ranking signals at the micro level as well, one of the most important\u2014and the one we\u2019re most concerned with at the moment\u2014is keyword relevance. In the same way that keywords enable Google to connect search queries to relevant ads, keywords also enable Google to connect <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/search-term\">search queries<\/a> to relevant web pages\u2014homepages, product pages, blog pages, and so on. Because you want your web pages to feature prominently in the organic search results when a users\u2019 queries signify interest in your business, a fundamental part of on-page SEO is targeting specific keywords.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here\u2019s the catch: a single web page can rank for several keywords. For example, let\u2019s say you run a small business that sells health care products for dogs and SEO is your primary marketing channel. If you were to publish a well-structured, detailed blog post regarding the importance of brushing your dog\u2019s teeth, it could very well rank for both \u201cdo i have to brush my dog\u2019s teeth\u201d and \u201cbest way to brush a dog\u2019s teeth.\u201d Pretty cool, right?<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although there\u2019s certainly nothing wrong with inadvertently ranking for several keywords, it\u2019s best to be proactive. This is where keyword niches come into play once again. By targeting a group of closely related keywords within a single <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/23\/cornerstone-content-guide\">piece of content<\/a> or on a single web page, you improve your chances of ranking for each of the individual keywords.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">TL;DR \u2014 Keyword niches enable you to target several closely related keywords within a single piece of content, thus giving that content a better chance of ranking for multiple keywords.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How to find &amp; build keyword niches<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before you can start assembling your keyword niches, you need an initial set of keywords. If you don\u2019t already have a master list, our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a> is the perfect solution. Simply enter a topic, identify your industry or niche, select the country you do business in, and boom\u2014you\u2019ve got yourself a list of keywords you can target.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Got your list? Awesome. Now, it\u2019s time to start identifying those keyword niches. To begin, we recommend classifying each keyword according to two high-level characteristics: topic and intent. Topic, of course, simply refers to the general interest behind the keyword. For example, the topic behind the keyword \u201cbest way to brush a dog\u2019s teeth\u201d is dog hygiene. Intent refers to the goal the user is trying to achieve by searching on Google.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/free-keyword-niche-finder-brush-dogs-teeth.png\" alt=\"free-keyword-niche-finder-brush-dogs-teeth\" width=\"800\" height=\"326\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-51746 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/free-keyword-niche-finder-brush-dogs-teeth.png 800w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/free-keyword-niche-finder-brush-dogs-teeth-480x196.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Generally speaking, there are three types of user intent:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Informational: When the user wants to learn more about a topic.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Navigational: When the user wants to go to a specific website or web page.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/30\/commercial-intent-keywords\">Transactional<\/a>: When the user wants to buy something.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The intent behind the keyword \u201cbest way to brush a dog\u2019s teeth\u201d is most likely informational. Remember: you need the keywords within a given niche to signify the same basic intent so you can write the most relevant ads possible.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once you\u2019ve labeled each keyword according to topic and intent, you\u2019re going to need two more pieces of data: search volume and competition. Whereas search volume tells you how often the users in your target country search for a particular keyword, competition tells you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/12\/keyword-difficulty\">how difficult<\/a> (or easy) it is to rank for that keyword. With this information, you\u2019ll be able to quickly determine how valuable and viable each keyword is.<strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/free-keyword-niche-finder-brush-dogs-teeth-2.png\" alt=\"free-keyword-niche-finder-brush-dogs-teeth-2\" width=\"800\" height=\"215\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-51747 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/free-keyword-niche-finder-brush-dogs-teeth-2.png 800w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/free-keyword-niche-finder-brush-dogs-teeth-2-480x129.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now that you\u2019ve got those four key pieces of data for each keyword, you\u2019re ready to assemble your niches!
