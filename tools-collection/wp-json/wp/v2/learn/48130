Bid management is important because your bids are one of the factors that determine when and where your <a href=\"\/google-ads\">Google ads<\/a> show up in search results, as well as how much you <a href=\"\/cost-per-click\">pay per click<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Bid management can be tricky for beginners, and even advanced users can get overwhelmed if they&#8217;re working in very large ad accounts.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll provide some <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/11\/easy-adwords-bidding-strategies\">easy strategies for Google Ads bid management<\/a>, including tips from the experts.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Set Your Initial Google Ads Bids<\/h2>\n<p>The best way to start when it comes to bidding in Google Ads (formerly known as AdWords) is to use all the data at your disposal.<\/p>\n<p>One of the best places to get started is the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/04\/25\/keyword-planner\">Keyword Planner<\/a>. Not only does this free tool, available in your Google account, help you to <a href=\"\/keywords\">identify new keywords<\/a>, it also provides a \u201csuggested bid\u201d for each of these terms, based on your ad serving settings. To make the most of it, start by entering your custom targeting information into the Keyword Planner.<\/p>\n<p>We recommend that you start by viewing each keyword\u2019s estimated first page bid, then bump it up by 20-30% to aim for the middle of the page.<\/p>\n<p>This is a good way to make sure your ads have visibility, but aren\u2019t at the top right off the bat (which could drive up your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/21\/how-much-does-adwords-cost\">Google Ads costs<\/a>). From there, you can work your way to higher positions by working to <a href=\"\/quality-score\">improve Quality Scores<\/a> or gradually bumping up your bids.<\/p>\n<h2>Adjusting Your Google Ads Bids<\/h2>\n<p>Depending on your goals, your bidding strategies will differ drastically. One common goal when it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/17\/google-ads-bid-management\">bid management<\/a> is the desire to lower your cost per action, or CPA.<\/p>\n<p>Your CPA metric is how much your business pays in order to attain a conversion. Based on your sales, operating costs and margins, you should have a good idea of <a href=\"\/conversion-rate\">what you want to be paying per conversion<\/a>. Of course, even if you achieve this, it never hurts to aim for an even lower CPA.<\/p>\n<div data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"81399534-38ad-4393-92b9-c0e81e918b75\" data-langcode=\"und\" class=\"embedded-entity align-center\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/adwords-conversion-rate-bid-management-1.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1271\" alt=\"adwords bid management tips\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>To find your current CPA, all you need to do is divide your total costs by total conversions for a given period.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CPA = Cost \/ Conversions<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now let\u2019s break down that CPA formula\u2014cost is actually number of clicks multiplied by your CPC, and conversions are the number of clicks multiplied by conversion rate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cost = Clicks x CPC<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Conversions = Clicks x Conversion Rate<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If we remove clicks from the equation, you\u2019ll discover that CPA can also be found by dividing CPC by conversion rate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CPA = CPC \/ Conversion Rate<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Therefore, CPA multiplied by conversion rate will give you your CPC.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CPC= CPA x Conversion Rate<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Bottom line: If you know your <em>goal<\/em> CPA and your current conversion rate by ad group, you know what you should be willing to pay for a click to the keywords in that given ad group.

Of course, your actions will differ on a keyword-by-keyword basis, but here are a few examples.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>If a keyword\u2019s CPA is lower than your goal<\/strong> and is appearing in a low position, increase the bid. This will raise your ad position, giving your ad more visibility and likely more clicks and conversions.<\/li>\n<li><strong>If a keyword has a high CPA<\/strong> and is consistently appearing in a top position, it may be time to reduce your bids. While you&#8217;ll see fewer conversions come through, this step will drive down your CPAs considerably.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For more helpful advice on how to manage your Google Ads bids, check out our interview with <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/03\/14\/ppc-bid-management-guide\">18 top AdWords experts on how they manage bids<\/a>, whether or not to use automatic bidding, and more.<\/p>\n<p>For more help with managing your Google Ads account, try our <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Free Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a><\/strong> for an instant audit and actionable report!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google Ads bid management is the process of raising and lowering your keyword bids to ensure you&#8217;re making the most of your Google Ads budget.
