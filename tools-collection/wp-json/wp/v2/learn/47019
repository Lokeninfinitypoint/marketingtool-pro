It is so widely used, it has become synonymous with the term \u201cpaid search.\u201d The two terms are used interchangeably, even though other platforms such as Bing Ads work in a similar way.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/google-vs-facebook-adwords-concept-1.png\" alt=\"Google AdWords vs Facebook Ads AdWords concept illustration\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"1956\" height=\"1044\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Paid search focuses on the targeting of keywords and the use of text-based advertisements. Advertisers using Google bid on <a href=\"\/keywords\">keywords<\/a> \u2013 specific words and phrases included in search queries entered by Google users \u2013 in the hopes that their ads will be displayed alongside search results for these queries. Each time a user clicks on an ad, the advertiser is charged a certain amount of money, hence the name \u201cpay-per-click advertising.\u201d PPC bidding and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/01\/08\/bid-optimization\">bid optimization<\/a> is a complex topic, and beyond the scope of this guide, but essentially, users are paying for the potential to find new customers based on the keywords and search terms they enter into Google.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>How are your Google Ads REALLY performing?

With the highest number of monthly active users (or MAUs) of any social network in the world, Facebook has become a highly competitive and potentially lucrative element of many businesses\u2019 digital advertising strategies.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/google-vs-facebook-facebook-ads-concept-1.png\" alt=\"Google AdWords vs Facebook Ads concept\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"576\" height=\"401\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Although advertising on Facebook can be thought of as similar to Google Ads, in that advertisers using both platforms are essentially promoting their business via the Internet, this is where the similarities end. Unlike paid search, which helps businesses find new customers via keywords, paid social helps users find businesses based on the things they\u2019re interested in and the ways in which they behave online.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to the primary difference between Google and Facebook Ads, you can think of it this way: <strong>Google Ads helps you find new customers, while Facebook helps new customers find you.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now that we\u2019ve covered the elementary difference between Google and Facebook Ads (or paid search and paid social), let\u2019s examine the strengths of each platform and how these <a href=\"\/online-marketing-tools\">online marketing tools<\/a> can be leveraged effectively.<br \/>\n<a id=\"google\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>The strengths &amp; advantages of Google Ads<\/h2>\n<p>As the world\u2019s most popular and widely used search engine, Google is considered the de facto leader in online advertising. Fielding more than 3.5 billion search queries every single day, Google offers advertisers access to an unprecedented and unequaled potential audience of users who are actively looking for goods and services.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/seo-basics-search-engine-market-share.png\" alt=\"seo basics - search engine market share\" width=\"600\" height=\"506\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-56021\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/seo-basics-search-engine-market-share.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/seo-basics-search-engine-market-share-480x405.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nGoogle\u2019s advertising offerings are split across two primary networks \u2013 the Search network, and the Display network. The Search network encompasses the entirety of Google as a search engine, and advertisers can bid on millions of keywords and phrases to target prospective customers.<\/p>\n<p>The Google Display Network, which offers advertisers more visual ads such as banners, spans approximately 98% of the World Wide Web, making it a great choice for advertisers who want to accomplish marketing goals that aren\u2019t necessarily as conversion-driven as those of PPC ads, such as raising <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/10\/brand-awareness\">brand awareness<\/a>\u00a0on a large scale using\u00a0<a href=\"\/smart-ads-creator\">banner ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>1. An immense audience<\/h3>\n<p>One of the main advantages of using Google as an advertising platform is its immense reach. Google handles <a href=\"http:\/\/www.internetlivestats.com\/google-search-statistics\/\">more than 40,000 search queries every second<\/a>, a total of more than 1.2 trillion web searches every single year. As Google becomes increasingly sophisticated \u2013 in part to its growing reliance on its proprietary artificial intelligence and machine learning technology, RankBrain \u2013 this amazing search volume is likely to increase, along with the potential for advertisers to reach new customers.<\/p>\n<p>Put simply, no other search engine can offer the potential audience that Google can. This vast potential source of prospective customers alone makes Google an excellent addition to your digital marketing strategy, but when combined with Google\u2019s increasingly accurate search results, it\u2019s easy to see why AdWords is the most popular and widely used PPC platform in the world.<\/p>\n<h3>2. A level playing field<\/h3>\n<p>One of the biggest misconceptions among those new to PPC is that whoever has the largest advertising budget somehow automatically \u201cwins\u201d at <a href=\"\/google-ads\">Google ads<\/a>. Fortunately, nothing could be farther from the truth as Google Ads focuses primarily on the quality and relevance of ads, not how much advertisers spend.<\/p>\n<p>The more relevant an ad is to the user, the better the experience that user is likely to have \u2013 and, therefore, the more likely they are to continue using Google as their go-to search engine. For this reason, Google Ads rewards relevance and quality above all other factors. This is why smart advertisers with relevant, optimized, high-quality ads rarely have to bid as highly as advertisers with poorer ads\u2014making it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/11\/is-google-ads-worth-it\">well worth the investment<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Certain keywords may cost more than others \u2013 such as those in the financial industry, which are traditional <a href=\"\/articles\/most-expensive-keywords\">among the most expensive of any professional sector<\/a> \u2013 but how much advertisers have to bid will depend largely on the quality and relevance of their advertisements. Some metrics are more important to Google in its evaluation of quality and relevance than others, such as <a href=\"\/click-through-rate\">click-through rate<\/a>, which is considered a reliable indication of an ad\u2019s overall quality and appeal.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-does-google-ads-work-quality-score-definition.png\" alt=\"how does google ads work - quality score\" width=\"720\" height=\"385\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-57338\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-does-google-ads-work-quality-score-definition.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-does-google-ads-work-quality-score-definition-480x257.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nTo learn more about relevance and Quality Score, Google\u2019s system of evaluating ad quality, as well as an overview of <a href=\"\/articles\/what-is-google-adwords\">how Google AdWords works<\/a>, check out our free learning resources at <a href=\"\/learn\">PPC University<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>3. A wide range of ad formats<\/h3>\n<p>When AdWords first launched in 2000 (with a grand total of just 350 advertisers), the text-based ads that Google served alongside its search results were rudimentary, to say the least \u2013 but they <em>did<\/em> contain many of the same elements that can be seen in today\u2019s ads.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/google-vs-facebook-new-adwords-hotel-ads-1.jpg\" alt=\"Google AdWords vs Facebook Ads AdWords new hotel ads\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"960\" height=\"568\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A mobile PPC ad from New York Hilton Midtown<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Although PPC ads in AdWords remain text-based, advertisers can take advantage of an incredible number of features to make their ads more compelling and enticing to prospective customers. Ad extensions, sitelinks, social proofing such as user reviews, location targeting, Shopping ads, and a host of other features are available to advertisers, offering an unparalleled level of customization and control to advertisers. Google has even introduced ad formats tailored to the unique needs of specific types of businesses, such as vehicle manufacturers and hotels, which go far beyond the typical text-based ad experience and incorporate rich visual elements such as high-resolution images and interactive map data.<\/p>\n<p>No matter what you sell or to whom, the chances are good that there\u2019s an ad format or feature that will make your goods or services more appealing to your target market. Google is continually implementing new ad formats and features, further empowering advertisers to reach new audiences and drive new business.<br \/>\n<a id=\"facebook\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>The strengths &amp; advantages of Facebook ads<\/h2>\n<p>Compared to Google Ads, Facebook ads (as we know it today) is the scrappy newcomer, but in fact, Facebook has been refining and improving its advertising solution for several years. Today, Facebook Ads is a pioneer in the sphere of paid social and has become a central part of many businesses\u2019 digital marketing strategies.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p><strong>\ud83d\udcd8 Free guide:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLFBFundamentals.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FacebookFundamentals_Download\">7 Fundamental Facebook Advertising Tips\u00a0\u00a0<\/a><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h3>1. Unparalleled audience granularity<\/h3>\n<p>Similar to Google, Facebook boasts a truly vast global audience. With more than 1.55 BILLION monthly active users \u2013 more than one-fifth of the entire world\u2019s population, and that\u2019s not counting inactive or infrequently used accounts \u2013 Facebook has no rival when it comes to the enormity of its audience. However, rather than exposing advertisers and their messaging to this vast audience, the true strength of Facebook\u2019s immense audience lies in the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/10\/20\/facebook-audience\">potential granularity with which advertisers can target Facebook\u2019s users<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/google-vs-facebook-lookalike-audience-concept-1.png\" alt=\"Google AdWords vs Facebook Ads lookalike audience concept\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"530\" height=\"305\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/facebook-lookalike-audiences\">Facebook&#8217;s lookalike audiences<\/a> take advertising to an unparalleled granular level<\/em><\/p>\n<p>People share almost every conceivable detail of their lives on Facebook. From meeting and marrying partners to the birth of children or the celebration of new career moves, Facebook\u2019s users share the joys and accomplishments of life\u2019s milestones with their friends and networks every single day. They also search for and consume content that aligns with a huge range of personal interests, beliefs, ideologies, and values, presenting advertisers with a unique opportunity to tailor advertising messaging to target audiences in ways previously considered impossible, or even unimaginable.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most powerful applications of this functionality is the ability for advertisers to create what are known as \u201clookalike audiences.\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/13\/facebook-advertising-tips\">Facebook advertisers<\/a> can upload customer information from their own databases to Facebook, which then applies filtering based on its own data and information provided by third-party data brokers to match users whose information the advertiser uploads. This creates the \u201clookalike\u201d audience of users, allowing advertisers to effectively double the potential reach of their advertisements by targeting new customers who exhibit the same interests and consumer behavior as their existing customers.<\/p>\n<p>Many newcomers to paid social ask the same question, namely \u201c<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/25\/does-facebook-advertising-work\">Does Facebook advertising work?<\/a>\u201d By now, the answer should be clear \u2013 yes it does, and remarkably well. However, rather than view Facebook as the world\u2019s largest potential billboard, advertisers should consider Facebook as a way to get closer to their ideal customers than they ever thought possible.<\/p>\n<h3>2. An inherently visual platform<\/h3>\n<p>Unlike their comparatively dry, text-based PPC cousins, Facebook ads are powerfully visual. The very best Facebook ads blend in seamlessly with the videos, images, and other visual content in users\u2019 News Feeds, and this enables advertisers to leverage not only the strongly persuasive qualities of visual ads but to do so in a way that conveys the aspirational messaging that makes high-quality ads so compelling.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/google-vs-facebook-facebook-ad-example-1.png\" alt=\"Google AdWords vs Facebook Ads Facebook Uber ad example\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"494\" height=\"400\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A visually powerful Facebook ad from Uber<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Just as Google is constantly experimenting with the formatting of its text-based PPC ads, Facebook constantly evaluates how it can offer advertisers a superior marketing platform and users a satisfying, rewarding online experience. In the past, Facebook mandated that ads on its platform featured text that occupied no more than 20% of the total advertising area, a restriction it has since relaxed. However, despite this considerable change to its advertising governance, Facebook remains an inherently visual platform \u2013 a major selling point to many advertisers.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Incredible ROI<\/h3>\n<p>Businesses and marketers experimenting with Facebook Ads are often impressed by the granularity of its targeting options, as well as the tools they have at their disposal for creating beautiful, engaging ads. However, one element of Facebook Ads that consistently takes newcomers by surprise is the potential return on investment that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/03\/how-to-advertise-on-facebook\">advertising on Facebook<\/a> offers, and how far savvy advertisers can stretch a limited ad budget on the platform.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/google-vs-facebook-facebook-budget-example-1.jpg\" alt=\"Google AdWords vs Facebook Ads Facebook ad budget example\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"635\" height=\"323\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Facebook&#8217;s affordable budgeting = potentially sky-high ROI<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Although the budget of a Facebook advertising campaign will vary widely depending on a range of factors, such as scope, messaging, and overall campaign objectives, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/12\/facebook-ads-cost\">Facebook Ads are remarkably affordable<\/a>, especially when considering their potential impact and the granularity with which advertisers can target their ideal audiences. This highly competitive pricing makes Facebook Ads a very attractive proposition to small businesses and companies with limited resources \u2013 not just big brands with vast marketing budgets. Combined with the remarkable potential returns offered by the platform, Facebook Ads is one of the best-value online advertising solutions available today.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/facebook-advertising?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FBGrader_FBGrader\"><strong><em>How strong are your Facebook ads?

When evaluating each solution\u2019s strengths and potential applications, it\u2019s also apparent that the two platforms should be viewed in a complementary, rather than adversarial, way. Some people insist on comparing Facebook Ads to the Google Display Network, and while the two platforms share some similarities, the ways in which the two platforms have evolved independently of one another shows that Google and Facebook should be used in concert, not in opposition.<\/p>\n<p>Harnessing the power of both paid search and paid social is a remarkably effective advertising strategy. However, it necessitates a dual advertising strategy that aligns with the strengths of each respective platform. Although marketing messaging can \u2013 and arguably should \u2013 remain consistent across both Google and Facebook Ads, it\u2019s vital to understand how best to use each platform for maximum ROI and greater business growth.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about how to maximize the impact of your Google Ads and Facebook Ads campaigns, check out the free lessons at <a href=\"\/learn\">WordStream\u2019s PPC University<\/a>.
