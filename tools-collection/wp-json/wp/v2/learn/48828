An SEM strategy involves bidding on keywords that users of search engines like Google and Bing might enter when looking for certain products or services. This gives the advertiser a higher placement in the results for those search queries.<\/p>\n<p>These ads, often known by the term pay-per-click ads, come in a variety of formats. Some are small, text-based ads, whereas others, such as product listing ads or Shopping ads, are more visual, product-based search advertisements that allow consumers to see important information at-a-glance, such as price and reviews.<\/p>\n<p>Search engine marketing\u2019s greatest strength is that <strong>it offers advertisers the opportunity to put their ads in front of motivated customers who are ready to buy at the precise moment they\u2019re ready to make a purchase<\/strong>. No other advertising medium can do this, which is why search engine marketing is so effective and such an amazingly powerful way to grow your business.<\/p>\n<h2>SEM vs. SEO<\/h2>\n<p>SEM versus SEO: What&#8217;s the difference?<\/p>\n<p>Generally, &#8220;search engine marketing&#8221; refers to paid search marketing, a system where businesses pay Google to show their ads in the search results.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/30\/seo-basics\">Search engine optimization, or SEO<\/a>, is different because businesses don&#8217;t pay Google for traffic and clicks; rather, they earn a free spot in the search results by having the most relevant content for a given keyword search.<\/p>\n<p>Both SEO and SEM should be fundamental parts of your online marketing strategy. SEO is a powerful way to drive evergreen traffic at the top of the funnel, while search engine advertisements are a highly cost-effective way to drive conversions at the bottom of the funnel.<\/p>\n<h2>Keywords: The Foundation of Search Engine Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>Keywords are the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/website-marketing\/tips-building-solid-marketing-foundation\">foundation of search engine marketing<\/a>. As users enter keywords (as part of <em>search queries<\/em>) into search engines to find what they\u2019re looking for, it should come as little surprise that keywords form the basis of search engine marketing as an advertising strategy.<\/p>\n<h3>SEM Keyword Research<\/h3>\n<p>Before you can choose which keywords to use in your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/meta-search-engine\">search engine<\/a> marketing campaigns, you need to conduct comprehensive research as part of your <a href=\"\/keyword-management\">keyword management<\/a> strategy.<\/p>\n<p>First, you need to identify keywords that are relevant to your business and that prospective customers are likely to use when searching for your products and services. One way to accomplish this is by using WordStream\u2019s <a href=\"\/keywords\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Simply enter a keyword that\u2019s relevant to your business or service, and see related <a href=\"\/keyword-suggestion\">keyword suggestion<\/a> ideas that can form the basis of various search engine marketing campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>WordStream\u2019s Free Keyword Tool provides you with a range of valuable information, such as search volume for each individual keyword in Google and its general competitiveness.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/best-free-keyword-research-tools-wordstream-free-keyword-tool.png\" alt=\"best keyword research tools: wordstream free keyword tool\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-49521\" width=\"720\" height=\"406\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/best-free-keyword-research-tools-wordstream-free-keyword-tool.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/best-free-keyword-research-tools-wordstream-free-keyword-tool-480x271.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In addition to helping you find keywords you should be bidding on, thorough keyword research can also help you identify <em>negative keywords<\/em> \u2013 search terms that you should exclude from your campaigns. <a href=\"\/negative-keywords\">Negative keywords<\/a> aren\u2019t terms with negative connotations, but rather irrelevant terms that are highly unlikely to result in conversions. For example, if you sell ice cream, you might want to exclude the keyword \u201cice cream recipes\u201d, as users searching for ice cream recipes are unlikely to be in the market for your product.<\/p>\n<p>This concept is known as <em>search intent<\/em>, or the likelihood that a prospect will complete a purchase or other desired action after searching for a given term. Some keywords are considered to have <em>high commercial intent<\/em>, or a strong indication that the searcher wants to buy something. Examples of high commercial intent keywords include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buy<\/li>\n<li>Discount(s)<\/li>\n<li>Deal(s)<\/li>\n<li>Coupon(s)<\/li>\n<li>Free shipping<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Read more about commercial intent keywords in <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/30\/commercial-intent-keywords\">this blog post<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd0e Need help finding the right keywords?

For example, if you run a hardware store, one ad campaign could focus exclusively on autumnal products such as leaf blowers, rakes, and leaf bags, whereas another might focus on power tools and so on.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/ad-groups\">Ad groups<\/a> allow for each campaign to be further subcategorized for relevance. In our hardware store example, one ad group could be for different types of rakes or varying models of leaf blowers. For the power tools campaign, one ad group might focus on power drills, while another could focus on circular saws. This level of organization might take slightly longer to set up initially, but the rewards \u2013 namely higher CTRs at lower cost \u2013 make this effort worthwhile in the long run.<\/p>\n<p>\u26a1\ufe0f Is your Google Ads account set up for success?

Although a larger advertising budget can certainly be advantageous, especially when targeting highly competitive keywords, but it\u2019s far from a requirement for success with search engine marketing. This is because all ads go through a process known as the ad auction before appearing alongside search results. For the purposes of this explanation, we\u2019ll be focusing on the ad auction in Google AdWords.<\/p>\n<h3>How the Ad Auction Works<\/h3>\n<p>The ad auction process takes place every single time someone enters a search query into Google. To be entered into the ad auction, advertisers identify keywords they want to bid on, and state how much they are willing to spend (per click) to have their ads appear alongside results relating to those keywords. If Google determines that the keywords you have bid on are contained within a user\u2019s search query, your ads are entered into the ad auction.<\/p>\n<h3>How Ads \u2018Win\u2019 the Ad Auction<\/h3>\n<p>Not every single ad will appear on every single search. This is because the ad auction takes a variety of factors into account when determining the placement of ads on the SERP, and because not every keyword has sufficient commercial intent to justify displaying ads next to results. However, the two main factors that Google evaluates as part of the ad auction process are your maximum bid and the <a href=\"\/quality-score\">Quality Score<\/a> of your ads.<\/p>\n<p>Maximum bid is the maximum amount you have specified you are willing to pay for a click. Quality Score is a metric based on the overall quality of your advertisement. Google calculates these metrics during the ad auction to determine placement of advertisements. The result of this calculation is known as ad rank.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/search-engine-marketing-ad-rank-1.png\" alt=\"Search engine marketing ad rank\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"660\" height=\"421\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #333333; font-size: 22px;\">The Importance of Quality Score in SEM<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Given that <a href=\"\/google-adwords-quality-score\">Google AdWords\u2019 Quality Score<\/a> comprises half of the ad rank formula, it is one of the most crucial metrics search engine marketers can focus on. High Quality Scores can help you achieve better <a href=\"\/ad-position\">ad position<\/a> at lower costs, because Google favors ads that are highly relevant to user queries.<\/p>\n<p>In the table below, you can see that although Advertiser 1 has the lowest maximum bid, they have the highest Quality Score, meaning their ads are given priority in terms of placement during the ad auction:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/ad-auction-updated_4-1.png\" alt=\"Google Ads Auction\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"2843\" height=\"1672\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Quality Score is arguably the most important metric in search engine marketing.
