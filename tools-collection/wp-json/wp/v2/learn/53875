Digital marketing jobs are no different. You want to find the right fit. You want your skill set to be fully utilized. You want to get paid well. There are a ton of factors in play, and you want to consider them all.<\/p>\n<p>Still: spending too much time researching roles can be a little like getting lost in a pile of Amazon reviews. You want so badly to find the right salad bowl, or the best salad bowl, that you sit at your computer for hours. What happens? You walk outside and immediately see a guy with a way cooler salad bowl.<\/p>\n<p>Our purpose in writing this article is two-fold. One: we want to rid you of any buyer\u2019s remorse you might have after settling on a position. Two: we want to make sure you don\u2019t drive yourself crazy researching your next online marketing job. What we\u2019re providing you today is the right information to make a decision. It\u2019s more important that you choose something than choose the right thing, but hey\u2014if this is your first go \u2018round in the digital marketing world, why not be a little deliberate? Odds are, you\u2019re going to be here for a while.<\/p>\n<p>Our modus operandi will be the following: provide insight into several digital marketing disciplines, then run through the different roles you\u2019ll encounter in each discipline. We\u2019ll discuss what each role typically pays (per Glassdoor) in the United States, as well as the responsibilities and qualifications each digital marketing job entails. We\u2019ll also provide some sparkling insights from our own team of digital marketing professionals along the way.<\/p>\n<p>You can use this guide as a career roadmap as you rise through the ranks. Let\u2019s get into it!<\/p>\n<p>And remember\u2026<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s only cool because it\u2019s not yours.<\/p>\n<p>But first\u2026<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"entry-level\"><\/a>A Word About Entry-Level Marketing Jobs<\/h2>\n<p>Another false narrative those looking for entry-level marketing jobs tell themselves: \u201cI need a job to get experience, but I need experience to get a job.\u201d Not true at all. Not only are there plenty of entry-level marketing jobs that don\u2019t require experience, and will train on the job, but there are also tons of marketing internships. Marketing interns can be kind of like indentured servants; but they make consistent money, learn the tricks of the trade, and get on the inside track at their companies.<\/p>\n<p>Right.

Product marketers handle to-market positioning and messaging for new products and new product features. As such, they focus their efforts on both potential customers (prospects and leads) and existing customers. It\u2019s imperative that customers know how to use products, and know about new features. It\u2019s also imperative that sales teams know how to talk about the products they\u2019re selling. Product marketers make sure both of these operations run smoothly, and are consistent with one another.<\/p>\n<h3>Hear it from the expert<\/h3>\n<p><em>\u201cProduct marketing is the ultimate cross-functional marketing position. We own the positioning, messaging, and go-to-market strategy for our product. We also work with Sales and Customer Success to drive in-market demand and adoption.

For example, fashion brands looking to leverage social influencers might find the most success on Instagram; while a B2B SaaS company looking to get their blog posts more exposure might find the most success on Twitter.
