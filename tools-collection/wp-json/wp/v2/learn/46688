It is used to determine your <a href=\"\/cost-per-click\">cost per click<\/a> (CPC) and multiplied by your maximum bid to determine your ad rank in the ad auction process. Your Quality Score depends on multiple factors, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your\u00a0<a href=\"\/click-through-rate\">click-through rate<\/a>\u00a0(CTR).<\/li>\n<li>The relevance of each keyword to its ad group.<\/li>\n<li>Landing page quality and relevance.<\/li>\n<li>The relevance of your\u00a0<a href=\"\/ad-text\">ad text<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Your historical Google Ads account performance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These are the core Quality Score components. No one outside of Google knows exactly how much each factor \u201cweighs\u201d in the Quality Score algorithm, but we do know that click-through rate is the most important component. When more people who see your ad click it, that\u2019s a strong indication to Google that your ads are relevant and helpful to users. Accordingly, Google rewards you with:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Higher <\/em>ad rankings<\/li>\n<li><em>Lower <\/em>costs<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p>Find out how to lower costs in your account with the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Free Google Ads Grader<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h2>Benefits of Improving\u00a0Google Quality Score<\/h2>\n<p>By analyzing thousands of PPC accounts, we know that Quality Score has a direct correlation on your\u00a0success in Google Ads and Microsoft Ads. By <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/03\/26\/google-quality-score\">optimizing your Quality Scores<\/a>, you\u2019ll be setting yourself up for higher return on investment (ROI). That\u2019s because higher Quality Scores correlate with lower cost per conversion! Cost per conversion is different from cost per click. It\u2019s not how much you pay for each click, but how much you pay when someone takes the action you want them to take, whether that\u2019s signing up for a free trial or making a product purchase. Since not every click results in a conversion, cost per conversion is generally higher than cost per click.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, strong Quality Scores lower both your cost per click <em>and<\/em> your cost per conversion.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/quality-score-improves-cpc-1.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"378\" alt=\"Quality Score Impact\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Generally speaking, the higher your Quality Score in Google Ads and Microsoft Ads, the lower your cost per conversion. Remember, a high Quality Score is Google&#8217;s way of saying that your PPC ad meets your potential customers\u2019 needs. The better you are at meeting the prospect\u2019s needs, the less Google will charge you for the ad click.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/how-quality-score-impacts-cost-per-click-google-ads.png\" alt=\"how quality score impacts cost per click\" width=\"720\" height=\"523\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-61091\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/how-quality-score-impacts-cost-per-click-google-ads.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/how-quality-score-impacts-cost-per-click-google-ads-480x357.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>How Do You Increase Your Google Ads\u00a0Quality Score?<\/h2>\n<p>Since Quality Score in Google Ads and Microsoft Ads\u00a0determines where and how often your ads appear, it\u2019s important to boost your ratings by working consistently on your account. This can be achieved by focusing your efforts on several key areas:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keyword research<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 Discover new, highly relevant\u00a0<a href=\"\/keyword-opportunities\">keywords<\/a> to add to your campaigns, including long-tail opportunities that can contribute to the bulk of your overall traffic.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Keyword organization<\/strong> \u2013 Split your keywords into tight, organized groups that can be more effectively tied to individual ad campaigns. Use our <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLAccountStructure.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_LastAccountStructureGuide_Download\">guide to Google Ads account structure<\/a> for more help.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Refine ad text <\/strong>\u2013 Test out PPC ad copy that is more targeted to your individual ad groups. More effective ads get higher CTR, one of the best ways to improve Quality Score.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Optimize landing pages <\/strong>\u2013 Follow landing page best practices to create pages that connect directly with your ad groups and provide a cohesive experience for visitors, from keyword to conversion.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Add negative keywords<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 Continuously research, identify, and exclude\u00a0<a href=\"\/adwords-negative-keywords\">irrelevant search terms<\/a>\u00a0that are wasting your budget.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As you can see, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/19\/does-quality-score-still-matter\">Quality Score is primarily a measure of\u00a0<em>relevance<\/em><\/a>, and improving keyword Quality Score is a matter of structuring your PPC campaigns into small, well-organized, tightly-knit groups of keywords. Better keyword research and organization will also naturally improve the quality and specificity of your ads and website content, allowing you to target the <em>exact<\/em>\u00a0audience most likely to be searching for your offerings.<\/p>\n<p>Low Google Ads Quality Scores are primarily the result of a disconnect between keywords, ad groups, ad text, and landing page content. A high Quality Score comes naturally when a\u00a0Google Ads account contains organized keywords in appropriate keyword groups, ad text that corresponds with certain ad groups, and landing pages that connect with the ad text&#8217;s offer. While there is no easy, foolproof answer to improving your Quality Score formula, paying careful attention to relevance will greatly improve your scores.<\/p>\n<h2>More Google Ads Quality Score Resources<\/h2>\n<p>Want to learn more about how Quality Score works and how to increase your ratings?
