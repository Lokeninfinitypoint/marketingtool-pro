A website that is well optimized for search engines &#8220;speaks the same language&#8221; as its potential visitor base with keywords for SEO that help connect searchers to your site. Keywords are one of the main elements of <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/search-engine-optimization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, you need to know how people are looking for the products, services or information that you offer, in order to make it easy for them to find you\u2014otherwise, they&#8217;ll land on one of the many other pages in the Google results. Implementing keyword SEO will help your site rank above your competitors.<\/p>\n<p>This is why developing a list of keywords is one of the first and most important steps in any <a href=\"\/search-engine-optimization\" title=\"search engine optimization\">search engine optimization<\/a> initiative. Keywords and SEO are directly connected when it comes to running a winning search marketing campaign. Because keywords are foundational for all your other SEO efforts, it&#8217;s well worth the time and investment to ensure your SEO keywords are highly relevant to your audience and effectively organized for action.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/09\/seo-keywords-google-search-homepage.jpeg\" alt=\"seo keywords - google search bar\" width=\"647\" height=\"198\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-51299\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/09\/seo-keywords-google-search-homepage.jpeg 647w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/09\/seo-keywords-google-search-homepage-480x147.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 647px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nSettling on the right SEO keywords is a delicate process involving both trial and error, but the basics are easy to understand. Here we\u2019ll walk you through researching what your customers are looking for, discovering those keywords that will help you rank on a search engine results page (<a href=\"\/serp\">SERP<\/a>), and putting them to work in your online content.<\/p>\n<h2>Finding Your Best Keywords for SEO<\/h2>\n<p>Most beginning search marketers make the same mistakes when it comes to SEO\u00a0keyword research:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only doing SEO keyword research once,<\/li>\n<li>Not bothering to update and expand their SEO keyword list, or<\/li>\n<li>Targeting keywords that are too popular, meaning they\u2019re way too competitive.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Basically, SEO keyword research should be an ongoing and ever-evolving part of your job as a marketer. Old keywords need to be reevaluated periodically, and high-volume, competitive keywords (or \u201chead\u201d keywords, as opposed to <a href=\"\/long-tail-keywords\">long-tailed keywords<\/a>) can often be usefully replaced or augmented with longer, more specific phrases designed not to bring in just any visitor but exactly the <em>right<\/em> visitors. (Who visits your site \u2013 particularly if they\u2019re people who are actively looking for your services \u2013 is at least as important as how many people visit.)<\/p>\n<p>And you\u2019ve got to diversify. Here\u2019s a tongue-twister that\u2019s absolutely true: diversity is a key word in the keyword world. You\u2019re not going to stand out if you find yourself using all of the same keywords as your competitors. Not only should you try new <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/11\/keyword-search-tools\">keyword search tools<\/a> and keep track of the results, but you should feel free to experiment based on your own research \u2013 who else uses your keywords? And how do you make yourself stand out?

On the one hand, <a href=\"\/seo\" title=\" seo copywriting\">SEO<\/a>\u00a0best practices recommend that you include relevant keywords in a number of high-attention areas on your site, everywhere from the titles and body text of your pages to your URLs to your meta tags to your image file names. On the other hand, successfully optimized websites tend to have thousands or even\u00a0millions\u00a0of keywords. You can&#8217;t very well craft a single, unique page for every one of your keywords; at the same time, you can&#8217;t try to cram everything onto a handful of pages with keyword stuffing and expect to\u00a0<a href=\"\/keyword-ranking\" title=\" ranking keywords\">rank<\/a>\u00a0for every individual keyword. It just doesn&#8217;t work that way.<\/p>\n<p>So how does it work? The answer is\u00a0<a href=\"\/keyword-grouping-and-organization\" title=\" how to organize and group keywords\">keyword grouping and organization<\/a>. By dividing your keywords into small, manageable groups of related keywords, you\u2019ll cut down on your workload (significantly), while still creating targeted, specific pages.<\/p>\n<p>For example, let\u2019s say you were running the website of an online pet store. You might be wise to create one keyword grouping for all your dog-related products, then one for all of your parakeet-related projects, etc. The next step would be to segment each individual group into smaller subgroups (parakeet cages, parakeet toys, parakeet snacks) and then even smaller groups for each type of product (low-fat parakeet snacks, luxury parakeet snacks\u2026 you get the idea). Now your pet store can create individual pages optimized for each small keyword group.<\/p>\n<p>A marketer attempting to optimize a web page for the &#8220;gourmet parakeet snacks&#8221; keyword group should consider doing most if not all of the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using the keyword in the\u00a0<strong>title<\/strong>\u00a0of the page<\/li>\n<li>Using the keyword in the\u00a0<strong>URL<\/strong>\u00a0(e.g., online-petstore.com\/parakeets\/snacks\/gourmet)<\/li>\n<li>Using the keyword, and variations (e.g., &#8220;gourmet parakeet snacks&#8221;), throughout the\u00a0<strong>page copy<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Using the keyword in the\u00a0<strong>meta tags<\/strong>, especially the\u00a0<a href=\"\/meta-description\" title=\" meta tag description\">meta description<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Using the keyword in any\u00a0<strong>image file paths<\/strong>\u00a0and in the images&#8217; alt text<\/li>\n<li>Using the keyword as the\u00a0<strong>anchor text<\/strong>\u00a0in links back to the page from elsewhere on the site<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When optimizing your web pages, keep in mind that\u00a0<a href=\"\/keyword-relevancy\" title=\" keyword popularity\">keyword relevance<\/a>\u00a0is more important than\u00a0<a href=\"\/keyword-density\">keyword density<\/a>\u00a0in SEO.<\/p>\n<h2>Need Help Finding SEO Keywords?<\/h2>\n<p>Try our <a href=\"\/keywords\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a> today.
