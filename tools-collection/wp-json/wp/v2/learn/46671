You&#8217;re about to find out!<\/p>\n<h2>What Are Long-Tail Keywords, Exactly?<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Long-tail keywords <\/strong>are longer and more specific <a href=\"\/keyword\">keyword<\/a> phrases that visitors are more likely to use when they\u2019re closer to a point-of-purchase or when they&#8217;re using <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/14\/google-voice-search\">voice search<\/a>. Most long-tail keywords have lower search volume than short or &#8220;head&#8221; keywords. They\u2019re a little bit counter-intuitive, at first, but they can be hugely valuable if you know how to use them.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/long-tail-keywords-graph.png\" alt=\"how to increase website traffic - long tail keywords graph\" width=\"720\" height=\"544\" class=\"skip-lazy aligncenter size-full wp-image-60159\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/long-tail-keywords-graph.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/long-tail-keywords-graph-480x363.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image inspired by <a href=\"https:\/\/mangools.com\/blog\/long-tail-keywords\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mangools<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>How Do Long-Tail Keywords Work?<\/h2>\n<p>Take this example: if you\u2019re a company that sells classic furniture, the chances are that your pages are never going to appear near the top of an organic search for \u201cfurniture\u201d because there\u2019s too much competition (this is particularly true if you\u2019re a smaller company or a startup). But if you specialize in, say, contemporary art-deco furniture, then keywords like \u201ccontemporary Art Deco-influenced semi-circle lounge\u201d are going to reliably find those consumers looking for exactly that product.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_seopages_InContentTextLink_FKT\"><strong><em>Find your best long-tail keywords with our Free Keyword Tool.<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Managing long-tail keywords is simply a matter of establishing better lines of communication between your business and the customers who are already out there, actively shopping for what you provide.<\/p>\n<p>Think about it: if you google the word \u201csofa\u201d (a very broad keyword sometimes referred to as a \u201chead term\u201d) what are the chances you\u2019re going to end up clicking through to a sale? But if you google \u201celm wood veneer day-bed\u201d you know exactly what you\u2019re looking for and you\u2019re probably prepared to pay for it then and there.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, you\u2019re going to draw less traffic with a long-tail keyword than you would with a more common one, but the traffic you do draw will be better: more focused, more committed, and more desirous of your services.<\/p>\n<h3>The 80\/20 rule in long-tail keywords<\/h3>\n<p>The phrase \u201clong tail\u201d is a visual metaphor for the shape of a distribution graph. Say we were to create a graph of web-wide <a>keyword popularity<\/a>, a few words and phrases (Facebook, sex, Justin Bieber) would rack up an enormous number of searches.<\/p>\n<p>But here\u2019s the surprising part: those <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2011\/05\/25\/keywords-vs-search-queries\">keyword search terms<\/a>, the \u201chead\u201d of the dragon, in reality account for a surprisingly small percentage of all searches, about ten to fifteen percent, depending on how you measure. Another fifteen to twenty percent of searches come from mid-length keywords, meaning that <em>roughly seventy percent of page views<\/em> are the direct result of \u2013 that\u2019s right \u2013 long-tailed keywords. It\u2019s a Chinese dragon: the tail goes on and on and on.<\/p>\n<h2>Finding Qualified Searchers with Long-Tail Keywords<\/h2>\n<p>With shorter keywords, competition for rankings can be fierce, but visits can be scattershot and ROI can be low. With smart implementation of long-tail keywords, you may pull in less traffic, going purely by numbers, but the return on your investment will be proportionally much higher: you\u2019ll be attracting exactly the audience you\u2019re looking for, and that audience will be far closer to point-of-purchase than that of your less-savvy competitors.<\/p>\n<h2>Less Competition = Lower Costs<\/h2>\n<p>Long-tail keywords are valuable for businesses who want their content to rank in organic Google searches, but they\u2019re potentially even more valuable for advertisers running paid search marketing campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s because when you bid on long-tailed keywords, <em>the <a href=\"\/cost-per-click\">cost per click<\/a> is inevitably lower, since there\u2019s less competition<\/em>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/long-tail-keywords-cost-less-per-click-1.png\" alt=\"long tail keyword suggestions\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"716\" height=\"184\" \/><\/div>\n<p>By targeting longer, more specific long-tail keywords in your AdWords campaigns, you can get higher ad rankings on relevant searches without having to pay a premium for every click.<\/p>\n<p>The trick is to find a reliable, renewable source of long-tail keywords that are right for you and for your niche.
