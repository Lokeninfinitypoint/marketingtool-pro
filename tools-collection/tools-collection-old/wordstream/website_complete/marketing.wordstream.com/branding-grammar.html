                <h3 class="h3" id="headings">Headings and subheadings</h3>
                <p>Headings and subheadings should be used to help guide readers through blog posts and other written content for easier reading. These headings should always be used hierarchically.</p>

                <p>A few guidelines:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Use title case, with all important terms capitalized, for headlines.

                    </li>
                    <li>Use sentence case, with only the first word and proper nouns capitalized, for all other headings.

                    </li>
                    <li>Always use numerals for numbers in headings and subheadings.

                    <li>For headings that are numbered in a list, use the numeral and a period. If there is a word preceding the number (step or tip, for instance), use the pound sign, the numeral, and a colon.

                <h3 class="h3" id="paragraphs">Paragraphs</h3>
                <p>Paragraph length isn’t strictly enforced or regulated—we know that some topics will call for longer paragraphs, some shorter. However, a general rule is that paragraphs shouldn’t be longer than 3-4 sentences. Single-sentence paragraphs should also be used sparingly.</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <p>For conversion campaigns, stepping it up a notch with a stronger call to action such as “Shop Now” is effective in increasing your chances of a sale, as seen in the Nisolo shoe ad below. If you have a special promotion to share, this is a good time to incentivize.</p>

                <h3 class="h3" id="lists">Lists</h3>
                <p>When a list has complex items or gets too long to be easily readable in running text, use a bulleted or numbered list. Use only bullet points or numerals to mark these lists—no hyphens or other characters.</p>

                <p>Skip end punctuation if all items in the list are less than eight words. If one item requires end punctuation, use end punctuation for every item in the list.</p>

                <p>If the items in the list have a heading, make the heading (and the colon) bold and follow it with a colon.</p>

                        <li>Facebook offers three campaign objective options for advertisers: awareness, consideration, and conversion.</li>
                        <li>It is <em>crucial</em> that you don’t overlook your objective, optimization settings, bid strategy, or budget selections upon campaign creation.</li>
                        <li>The Facebook ad auction relies on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/13/learning-period">algorithmic learning</a> around these settings to make decisions.

                <h3 class="h3" id="numbers">Numbers</h3>
                <p>In general, spell out numbers nine and under, and use numerals for numbers 10 and above. For all numbers preceding units of measurement or in tables, use numerals.</p>

                <h4 class="h4">Dates</h4>

                <p>Use the month and date or the month, day, and year. Don’t include st, th, or rd for the day.</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <p>Feb. 28, 2019</p>
                </div>

                <h4 class="h4">Percentages</h4>

                <p>Always use the % symbol rather than spelling out “percent,” whether it’s in the body, heading, title, or a table.</p>

                <p>It’s okay if you use percentages to start a sentence.</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <p>47% of American internet users start their product searches on Amazon. 35% start on Google.</p>
                </div>

                <h4 class="h4">Ranges</h4>

                <p>For number or date ranges in a sentence, spell out the word “to.”</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <p>Your ad groups should have 10 to 20 keywords.</p>
                </div>

                <p>In graphs or lists with only numbers and no copy, use a hyphen.</p>

                <h4 class="h4">Money</h4>

                <p>Write monetary figures up to 1 million  in numerals, and include the currency sign.</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <p>Your CAC for that channel is going to be $100 ($400 divided by four new converted customers) for the month.</p>
                </div>

                <p>For figures in millions and billions, etc. use a numeral followed by the word million or billion, not capitalized (e.g., $9 million).</p>

                <h4 class="h4">Time</h4>

                <p>Use numerals and include a.m. or p.m. after writing a time. Don’t include the colon for times on the hour. Defer to standard number rules if it’s a unit of measuring time, like five minutes or two years.</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <p>8:15 a.m. or 9 p.m.</p>

                <h4 class="h4">Ampersands</h4>

                <p>Avoid using these in body copy and subheadings. In titles, use as needed to preserve space.</p>

                <div class="blockquote">

                <h4 class="h4">Colon</h4>

                <p>Colons can be used to introduce lists or connect related clauses. If the second clause is a complete sentence, the first letter after the colon should be capitalized.</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <p>This should sound familiar: Feed optimization works similarly to SEO.</p>
                </div>

                <h4 class="h4">Commas</h4>

                <p>Use serial commas in lists.</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <p>By including the brand, color, size, style, model, gender, measurements, and any other relevant attributes, you give yourself a better shot of capturing commercial intent.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Always use a comma after e.g. and i.e.</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <p>On the other hand, if your product is primarily used indoors (e.g., cookware), features small details (e.g., artwork), or is being sold on Amazon and Google Shopping, then artificial lighting is preferable to show off your product. Luckily knowing a few basics and building a simple studio setup can help you get over your intimidation of light.</p>
                </div>

                 <p>Otherwise, use commas as needed.</p>

                 <h4 class="h4">Dashes</h4>

                <p>To emphasize a break in a sentence or include an aside, use an em dash. The em dash should be placed between two words, with no space on either side. To create an em dash, press Alt+0151 on the number pad of a regular-sized keyboard.</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <p>Nonetheless, Display ads are powerful—and the proof is in the numbers.</p>

                </div>

                <p>No need to use en dashes for ranges or complex compound adjectives. Hyphens here are just fine.</p>

                <h4 class="h4">Ellipses</h4>

                <p>Ellipses are useful for effect, as long as they’re used sparingly. They shouldn’t be used to introduce a list. Treat ellipses like a word: Include a space on either side, but do not include spaces between the periods.</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <p>Or ... something like that.</p>

                </div>

                <p>When you’re discussing historical figures or authors, however, use the last name if it’s more recognizable. (Referring to Immanuel, for example, isn’t as clear as referring to Kant.)</p>

                <h4 class="h4">Job titles </h4>

                <p>If a person’s job is relevant, it’s okay to include a description of their role or their title, whichever is more useful for the audience. Follow AP style capitalization conventions with job roles and titles, too.</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <p>Director of SEO Sally Stevens</p>
                </div>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <p>Sally, an SEO and content marketer</p>
                </div>

                <h4 class="h4">Gendered terms</h4>

                <p>For describing jobs, avoid using gendered terms, like “waitress,” “sales guy,” “postman.” Choose a clearer, more inclusive word, instead.</p>

                <h4 class="h4">Pronouns</h4>

                <p>To stay casual and conversational, avoid the pronoun “one.”</p>

                <p>For pronouns in hypotheticals, use they/them/their, either singular or plural, not “he or she.”</p>

                <h4 class="h4">Place names</h4>

                <p>Make sure to separate compound geographic locations with a comma, and use another comma to separate the last term from the rest of the sentence.</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <p>I really like to go to Lincoln, New Hampshire, and hike in the White Mountains.</p>
                </div>

                <p>When abbreviating country and state names, don’t use periods: UK, not U.K.</p>

                <h4 class="h4">Companies</h4>

                <p>When using company names, maintain the same style the company uses as much as possible. If you’re unsure of how to style a company name, check their website or press releases.</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <ul>
                        <li>SEMrush</li>

                        <li>HubSpot</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>Remember that companies are singular entities, so be sure to use singular verbs.</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <p>Google is certain that these four new metrics are more insightful than average position, and the PPC community doesn’t seem all that sad to see the metric go—for the most part.</p>
                </div>

                <h4 class="h4">URLs</h4>

                <p>Avoid writing out URLs in content unless it’s necessary to demonstrate a concept. In those cases, don’t link to the website. All links should be embedded.</p>

                <h3 class="h3" id="titles">Titles</h3>

                <p>Titles should convey the purpose and scope of the blog post. The best titles do this in a fun, engaging way.</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <p>The Ridiculously Useful Guide to Snapchat Ads</p>

                </div>

                <p>Capitalization in titles should follow titles case rules. Always capitalize principal words in a headline or title, including nouns and verbs. (Yes, even short verbs like “is” and “be.”) Don’t capitalize prepositions, conjunctions, or articles unless they begin the title or are more than four letters long.</p>
