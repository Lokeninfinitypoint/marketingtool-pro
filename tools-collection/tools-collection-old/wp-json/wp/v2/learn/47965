This practice makes it much easier to create specific ads and landing pages targeted to your intended audience.

This can really harm your relevance\u2014you have no way of knowing if the general, popular keywords these tools spit out are truly relevant to your business and customers.<\/p>\n<p>Your own Web analytics and log files are a much better source of keyword data. These private sources tell you the actual words and phrases that real people use to find the products or services you offer. You&#8217;ll also have an accurate picture of which keywords drive the most traffic and <a href=\"\/conversion-rate-optimization\" title=\" CRO\">conversions<\/a>, so you can focus your PPC efforts on those areas first, without making guesses based on general global data.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\"><strong><em>Check in on your quality score with our\u00a0free Google Ads Performance Grader<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a id=\"creating-more-relevant-keyword-groups\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Grouping Keywords to Improve Quality Score<\/h2>\n<p>WordStream also helps you find the <a href=\"\/keyword-group-best\" title=\" best keyword group method\">best way to group your keywords<\/a> for an optimized Google Ads campaign structure. The key to high Quality Score ad groups is\u2014you guessed it\u2014<strong>relevance<\/strong>. All the keywords in an ad group should share a high degree of meaning.<\/p>\n<p>For example, let&#8217;s look at a pet store&#8217;s keywords. It&#8217;s obviously suboptimal to lump all your keywords into one group, and try to attract customers with a generalized advertisement for pet supplies. For one thing, a keyword like &#8220;pet supplies&#8221; is bound to be very competitive (and expensive). On the other hand, you can&#8217;t create a unique ad and landing page for every single keyword in your list\u2014you wouldn&#8217;t have time to do anything else.<\/p>\n<p>The solution is to <a href=\"\/keyword-group-theme\" title=\" using a keyword group theme\">group your keywords by theme<\/a>, and then segment those groups into subgroups, and so on, creating a hierarchy of small, manageable keyword groups.<\/p>\n<p>Now you can write a targeted ad and landing page for each group. This makes your life easier, <em>and <\/em>it helps you increase your Quality Score.<\/p>\n<p>WordStream simplifies the keyword grouping process with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/quality-score-tool\">Quality Score tools<\/a> that suggest segments based on a relevance algorithm, then do the sorting for you with the click of a button. Finding and sorting 20 closely related keywords in a database of thousands could take hours in a spreadsheet, but takes just seconds in WordStream.<\/p>\n<p><a id=\"writing-high-quality-adwords-ads\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Writing High-Quality Google Ads<\/h2>\n<p>To reiterate, your Google Ads Quality Score depends on several factors, including those related to your ad relevance score. Paramount among them:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The relevance of your ad to the keyword<\/li>\n<li>The relevance of your ad to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/great-landing-pages\">landing page<\/a><\/li>\n<li>The historical performance of your account<\/li>\n<li>The click-through rate of your ad<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Clearly, the quality and effectiveness of your ads is important.
