They do this by bidding on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword\">keywords<\/a> that are relevant to their ad.<\/p>\n<p>If their ad appears on the search engine results page, they&#8217;ll pay only when a user clicks on that ad. This is where the term \u201c<a href=\"\/pay-per-click\">pay-per-click advertising<\/a>\u201d comes from.<\/p>\n<h2>The Google Ads auction<\/h2>\n<p>How does Google decide which ads to show? <a href=\"\/articles\/what-is-google-adwords\">Google ads works like an auction<\/a>, but unlike a regular auction, it\u2019s not the highest bidder that wins. Google&#8217;s ad algorithm takes the quality and relevance of your into account, leveling the playing field for budgets big and small.<\/p>\n<p>You can<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/14\/how-does-google-ads-work\"> learn the details on how Google Ads works here<\/a>, but here&#8217;s a quick and helpful visual:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/google-ads-auction-quality-score-ad-rank.png\" alt=\"what is ppc - how the google ads auction works\" width=\"417\" height=\"677\" class=\"wp-image-64548 aligncenter\" \/><br \/>\nThe ad auction takes place every single time a searcher enters a keyword into Google, meaning that every single search for keywords you\u2019re bidding on represents an opportunity for your ads to be shown to prospective new customers.<\/article>\n<article><\/article>\n<article>And since those prospects are actively looking for what you\u2019re selling, you\u2019ll be showing up at the exact right moment. This is what makes advertising on Google so powerful, and one of the best ways to grow your business.<\/p>\n<h2>How to advertise on Google<\/h2>\n<p>Advertising on Google requires <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/08\/07\/how-to-set-up-google-adwords-account\">a Google Ads account<\/a>, which is free to create.

Although there are many ways to structure a Google Ads account, such as mirroring the structure of your website or by product categorization, the most effective and successful accounts all share the same qualities when it comes to organizational hierarchy. The following figure shows an optimal Google Ads account structure:<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/google-ads-account-structure-overview.png\" alt=\"google ads account structure overview\" width=\"720\" height=\"390\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-63816\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/google-ads-account-structure-overview.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/google-ads-account-structure-overview-480x260.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nThe account itself is the top-most level. Within each account are <a href=\"\/ad-campaigns\">campaigns<\/a>. Some advertisers only run a single campaign at any given time, whereas others run numerous campaigns simultaneously. Each campaign houses various <a href=\"\/ad-groups\">ad groups<\/a>, each of which, in turn, contain unique <a href=\"\/keywords\">keywords<\/a>, <a href=\"\/ad-text\">ad text<\/a>, and accompanying <a href=\"\/landing-page-optimization\">landing pages<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Campaigns are often organized by theme, such as a holiday promotion or back-to-school sale. Within each campaign, ad groups are often organized by products or services, such as Hanukkah merchandise or school stationery. Finally, individual products, such as menorahs or notebooks, have their own targeted keywords, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/20\/ppc-ad-copy\">unique ad copy<\/a>, and relevant accompanying landing pages.<\/p>\n<p>The structure of your Google Ads account may not reflect this hierarchy precisely, but organizing your account in this manner will allow you to keep things organized and tightly themed from the outset, factors that can have significant influence on PPC metrics such as <a href=\"\/quality-score\">Quality Score<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Download our <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLAccountStructure.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_LastAccountStructureGuide_Download\">free guide on Google Ads account structure<\/a> to learn more.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>Advertise on Google with WordStream<\/h2>\n<p>Aside from the technical aspects of setting up and running a PPC campaign using Google Ads, many advertisers struggle with the time commitment necessary to achieve success with paid search.
