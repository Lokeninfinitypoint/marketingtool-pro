The smartest paid <a href=\"\/search-marketing\">search marketing<\/a> campaigns are <a href=\"\/ppc\">pay-per-click<\/a>, or PPC campaigns, and the logic behind them can be summarized simply: you bid for ad placement in a search engine\u2019s sponsored links\u00a0for keywords related to your business, then you pay the search engine a small fee for each click.<\/p>\n<p>Paying for every click may sound like you\u2019ll end up paying a lot, but in a well-designed campaign, the opposite is true. <strong>Because your potential customers will see your ads <em>only<\/em> when they\u2019re searching for precisely the products or services you offer, they\u2019re far more likely than a casual browser to be at the point of purchase.<\/strong> And so, with the right research and a little tinkering, the paid search ads you place will actually end up earning you far more than it costs to place them.<\/p>\n<h2>How Paid Search Marketing Works Backstage<\/h2>\n<p>As you already know, Google and other search engines return two kinds of results to users: organic results and paid results.<\/p>\n<div data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"32f822d2-3ddd-41c9-9a37-39d31535f2eb\" data-langcode=\"und\" class=\"embedded-entity align-center\">\n<article><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/06\/paid-search-marketing-paid-results.png\" alt=\"paid search marketing - paid vs organic results\" width=\"720\" height=\"797\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58862\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/06\/paid-search-marketing-paid-results.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/06\/paid-search-marketing-paid-results-480x531.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Appearing in the sponsored links requires entering into an auction and competing with other bidders for advertising space. So, the million dollar question: why engage in paid\u00a0<a href=\"\/search-advertising\">search advertising<\/a> or hire a consultant when you can rank in Google&#8217;s organic results for free?<\/p>\n<p>First of all, organic search marketing, AKA <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/30\/seo-basics\">SEO<\/a>, isn&#8217;t free. It takes a lot of time, effort and knowledge to win <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/11\/14\/how-to-rank-for-a-keyword\">high organic search engine rankings<\/a>. Those resources are anything but free for your company. Especially for newer, less established sites, it can take quite a while to gain enough domain authority to get on the first few pages for your best\u00a0<a href=\"\/keyword\" title=\" keyword suggestion tool\">keywords<\/a>. And most people never click beyond the first page! In the meantime, you&#8217;re just sitting around waiting for qualified leads.<\/p>\n<p>And entering into the Google AdWords auction isn\u2019t as tricky as it sounds. It\u2019s simple math.<\/p>\n<h2>The Rules of Ad Ranking in Paid Search<\/h2>\n<p>Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/ppc-training\">PPC<\/a> platform is called Google AdWords, and though it may seem a bit complex, it\u2019s actually designed to provide maximum ROI to everyone involved: Google, your company, and searchers. The way it does this is by rewarding the most relevant, intelligently targeted pay-per-click campaigns by charging them less for ad clicks. So the more specific and useful your ads are, the better you\u2019ll perform. You\u2019re rewarded for drumming up interest in your own site.<\/p>\n<p>Every time a search is initiated, Google digs into the pool of advertisers and chooses a set of winners to appear in the ad space on its search results page. The \u201cwinners\u201d are chosen based on a combination of factors, including the quality and relevance of their keywords and ad campaigns, as well as the size of their keyword bids.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-does-google-ads-work-ad-rank-formula.png\" alt=\"how does google ads work - ad rank formula\" width=\"720\" height=\"356\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-57299\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-does-google-ads-work-ad-rank-formula.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-does-google-ads-work-ad-rank-formula-480x237.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"b83e1ac6-e64b-4588-b882-85c1b66141d7\" data-langcode=\"und\" class=\"embedded-entity align-center\">\n<article><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-does-google-ads-work-ad-rank-ad-position.png\" alt=\"how does google ads work - ad rank and serp\" width=\"720\" height=\"930\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-57303\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-does-google-ads-work-ad-rank-ad-position.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-does-google-ads-work-ad-rank-ad-position-480x620.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>More specifically, who gets to appear on the page is based on an advertiser\u2019s Ad Rank, a metric calculated by multiplying two key factors \u2013 CPC Bid (the highest amount an advertiser is willing to spend) and\u00a0<a href=\"\/quality-score\">Quality Score<\/a>\u00a0(a value that takes into account your click-through rate, relevance, and landing page quality).<\/p>\n<p>So how do you go about creating the most successful paid search marketing campaign you can? You begin with keywords.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p><strong>Are there opportunities for you to optimize your Google Ads account?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Find out instantly the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Free Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h2>Keywords Are Key in Paid Search Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>The first step in any search marketing campaign, including paid search, is\u00a0<a href=\"\/keyword-research\" title=\" how to keyword research\">keyword research<\/a>. In paid search, bidding on the wrong keywords is like throwing your advertising budget out the window.\u00a0This is why specialized keyword tools can be so useful. Here are a few things to keep in mind when building your paid search keyword list:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use negative keywords to your advantage<\/strong>: <a href=\"\/adwords-negative-keywords\">Negative keywords<\/a> enable you to filter out search terms that aren\u2019t relevant to your products and services, so your ads won\u2019t show up for those irrelevant searches. In the long run, this can save you a lot of money in wasteful clicks!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t go too broad<\/strong>: It\u2019s also worth paying special attention to the\u00a0<a href=\"\/long-tail\" title=\"long tail\">long tail of search<\/a>\u2014that is, the longer, less frequent keyword phrases that actually add up to a greater volume of visits than the few most common keywords. Long-tail keywords tend to show a high degree of\u00a0<a href=\"\/keyword-intent\" title=\"keyword intent\">intent<\/a>, so they can be excellent candidates for your paid search campaigns. For example, it&#8217;s a good bet that someone who searches on &#8220;organic dog food free shipping&#8221; is later in the buying cycle than someone who searches on &#8220;dog food&#8221; alone.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Stay relevant always!<\/strong> Another useful tip is to make sure your keywords match the text of the <a href=\"\/adwords-landing-page\">landing pages<\/a> you\u2019re linking to. Google keeps a close eye on that sort of accuracy (as they should) and keeps the least honest marketers from earning links to their carpet-cleaning service with ads reading \u201cLower Your Mortgage Today\u201d or \u201cPictures of Brad &amp; Angelina\u2019s Wedding Here!\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>The Road to Paid Search ROI<\/h2>\n<p>Bidding on the right keywords is only part of the paid search marketing battle. You also need to create relevant, compelling\u00a0<a href=\"\/ad-text\" title=\" text link ad\">text ads<\/a>. This will ensure that your ad shows up in the first place\u2014kind of important!\u2014but also that search engine users are drawn in to click. A high\u00a0<a href=\"\/click-through-rate\" title=\" adwords click through rate\">click-through rate<\/a>\u00a0(CTR) makes for more cost-effective paid search campaigns. You&#8217;ll lower your <a href=\"\/cost-per-click\">cost per click<\/a> while improving\u00a0Quality Score\u00a0and earning better ad positions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TIP:\u00a0<\/strong>The most clickable, Quality Score friendly ads for paid search are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Highly\u00a0relevant\u00a0<\/strong>to the user&#8217;s search query. Be sure your ad addresses the query directly and leads the user to an appropriate <a href=\"\/landing-page-optimization\">landing page on your website<\/a>. For instance, if the keyword is &#8220;natural dog food,&#8221; use those specific words in the ad and don&#8217;t lead the searcher to a general pet food page.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Eye-catching<\/strong>\u00a0without being spammy. Include a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/09\/call-to-action\">call to action<\/a> (entice them to buy your product or sign up for a free trial, for example) but don&#8217;t use all caps, multiple exclamation points or phrases like &#8220;Click here.&#8221; Such tomfoolery is better suited to the comments fields of political blogs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When designing a winning paid search campaign, you\u2019ll want to ask yourself other questions as well, of course, like exactly which pages are underperforming in \u201cnatural\u201d (i.e. unpaid) Google searches and exactly what content it\u2019s most crucial to win attention for. As time moves forward, you\u2019ll want to periodically review your campaign too, to make sure your original goals are being met and to weigh exactly which phrases are earning you the most love from customers. And if the keywords you originally selected aren\u2019t working as well as you\u2019d hoped, then it will be time to run some new ones up the flagpole and see\u00a0 who salutes.<\/p>\n<p>It takes care and a little practice, but once you get the hang of it, paid search marketing can be one of the most cost-effective and revenue-generating pieces of your marketing strategy.
