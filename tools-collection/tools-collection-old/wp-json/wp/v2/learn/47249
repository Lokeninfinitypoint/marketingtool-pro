Businesses who place ads in the search results pay a small fee every time somebody clicks on one of their ads (this is known as &#8220;<a href=\"\/pay-per-click\">pay-per-click<\/a>&#8221; advertising).<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/what-is-search-advertising-1.jpg\" width=\"796\" height=\"539\" alt=\"search advertising\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p><em>The results in red are examples of search advertisements<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Search advertising is a powerful form of advertising because people who search on Google reveal a lot about their <a href=\"\/keyword-intent\"><em>intent<\/em><\/a> (that is, what they want to do or buy) when they search. Advertisers have the ability to bid on <a href=\"\/keywords\">keywords<\/a> so that their ads show up when people are looking for exactly the kinds of things they sell.<\/p>\n<p>Think about it: This allows you to reach a much more targeted audience than you could with a billboard or a TV spot! For example, you could bid to place an ad in the search results when people in California search for a &#8220;divorce lawyer.&#8221; You can also tell the search engine the maximum amount you&#8217;re willing to pay when somebody clicks on your ad. There are lots of levers you can pull to make sure your ads only reach people who are likely to buy, which stretches your ad budget.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, you&#8217;ll learn more about how search advertising works and how to do it right.<a href=\"\/ppc-free-trial\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Types of search advertising<\/h2>\n<p>The most popular platform for search advertising is Google AdWords, since Google is the most popular search engine by a large margin, though smart advertisers also make use of Bing Ads (which gives them additional reach for lower costs).<\/p>\n<p>AdWords and other search advertising networks operate on an auction-like system, where businesses bid to appear in certain search results. When and where your ads appear, as well as how much you pay per click, is determined by a few factors, including your bid as well as your <a href=\"\/quality-score\">Quality Score<\/a>, a measure of the relevance of your ads to the keywords you are bidding on.<\/p>\n<p>The Quality Score system is important because it encourages advertisers to create high-quality ad campaigns that serve search engine users well. If you&#8217;re trying to &#8220;spam&#8221; the search results with irrelevant, low-quality ads, you&#8217;ll have a hard time making AdWords work for you.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/pay-per-click-marketing-ad-rank-formula-2.png\" width=\"722\" height=\"590\" alt=\"how search advertising works\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In addition to traditional search advertising, AdWords offers ways to place <a href=\"\/google-ads\">Google ads<\/a> on other Google properties, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/01\/gmail-ads\">Gmail<\/a><\/li>\n<li>YouTube<\/li>\n<li>The <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/18\/google-display-network-tips\">Google Display Network<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"\/articles\/what-is-google-adwords\">how search advertising works in this visual<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>How to make search advertising work for you<\/h2>\n<p>When done right, search engine advertising is a highly effective way to bring in new business and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/03\/increase-sales-online\">drive online sales<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>However, it&#8217;s important to be meticulous when building and managing your search campaigns. Seemingly small mistakes can cost you money and cut into your ROI.<\/p>\n<p>Search advertising best practices include:<\/p>\n<h3>A logical account structure<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to organize your search ads account in a logical way that allows you to optimize different types of ads and ad sets separately. For help with this important step, check out our <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/02\/adwords-account-structure-guide\">complete guide to Google Ads account structure<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/last-adwords-account-structure-guide1-4.png\" width=\"943\" height=\"556\" alt=\"Last guide to AdWords account structure you'll ever need optimal AdWords account structure diagram\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Smart keyword research<\/h3>\n<p>Search advertising starts with keywords.

Get creative and emotional. Put yourself in your customer&#8217;s shoes.

This can be accomplished through tactics like <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/11\/13\/adwords-geotargeting-local-ppc-guide\">geotargeting<\/a> (showing search ads only in specific locations) and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/30\/ad-scheduling\">dayparting<\/a> (only showing ads during business hours).<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/ad-scheduling-data-b2b-1.png\" width=\"697\" height=\"313\" alt=\"Ad scheduling data B2B ecommerce\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Ongoing optimization<\/h3>\n<p>You can&#8217;t run an effective search campaign on autopilot.
