The results that Google returns \u2013 whether they\u2019re organic results or paid advertisements \u2013 are there because they\u2019re relevant to the words in the search box. And if you want <em>your<\/em> ads to show up on the page, you have to bid on that <em>keyword<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, to <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLPPC101.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_PPC101_Download\">succeed at PPC<\/a>, you need to make sure you\u2019re bidding on the right keywords. This process includes a few moving parts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>PPC Keyword Research<\/strong> \u2013 Using <a href=\"\/keyword-research-tool\">keyword research tools<\/a> and analytics data to find a list of keywords that are highly relevant to your business offerings. The goal is to show up in the search results when people search for products or services that are relevant to your business.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Keyword Grouping and Organization<\/strong> \u2013 The most effective PPC accounts organize keywords into small groups of tightly <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/27\/lsi-keywords\">related keywords<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Negative Keywords<\/strong> \u2013 Negative keywords are a way of filtering out unwanted clicks. By setting a new negative keyword, you tell Google what searches you <em>don\u2019t<\/em> want your ads to display for.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Keyword Bid Optimization<\/strong> \u2013 Everyone has a limited budget, so it\u2019s important to focus your spending on your best-performing keywords, without paying more than necessary.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\ud83d\udd0e <strong>Need help finding the right keywords?<\/strong> Try our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>As you can see, PPC isn\u2019t <em>just<\/em> a matter of finding the right keywords. In order to get high ad rankings at low costs, you\u2019ll need to work at achieving relevance across your account. That means having:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>An organized account structure<\/li>\n<li>Targeted, compelling ads, and<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/landing-page-optimization\">Optimized landing pages<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All of these factors will contribute to your <a href=\"\/keyword-quality-score\">keyword Quality Score<\/a> \u2013 the key metric that determines where your ads are displayed and how much you pay for each ad click.<\/p>\n<p>You can learn more about all of these concepts later on in the coursework. For now, let\u2019s <strong>focus on keywords<\/strong> and how they function in your PPC account.<\/p>\n<h2>Keywords vs. Search Queries<\/h2>\n<p>In casual conversation, the terms &#8220;keyword&#8221; and &#8220;search query&#8221; are often used interchangeably, but there is actually a difference. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2011\/05\/25\/keywords-vs-search-queries\">What is the difference between a keyword and a search query?<\/a><\/p>\n<p>A <strong>keyword<\/strong> is an abstraction that we extrapolate from multiple search queries.<\/p>\n<p>A <strong>search query<\/strong> is the actual word or string of words that a search engine user types into the search box.<\/p>\n<p>As search marketers, what we target are <strong>keywords<\/strong>. For example, one of your target keywords might be \u201csunglasses.\u201d When you bid on the keyword <em>sunglasses<\/em>, the search queries that trigger your ad might include variations like \u201cwomen\u2019s sunglasses,\u201d \u201caviator sunglasses,\u201d or \u201csunglasses for small faces.\u201d These search queries all map back to your primary keyword.<\/p>\n<h2>The Importance of Keyword Grouping<\/h2>\n<p>Because search queries have so much variance, <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLAccountStructure.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_LastAccountStructureGuide_Download\">account structure best practices<\/a> dictate that PPC marketers group their keywords into related clusters.<\/p>\n<p>Effectively grouping and organizing your keywords improves your PPC strategy by en\u00adabling you to create more relevant, Quality Score-friendly ad groups, text ads and landing pages.<\/p>\n<p>The easiest way to get started is to use a keyword\u00a0tool to break a large list of keywords down into smaller groups by theme. You can then break those groups into even smaller groups, forming a hierarchy, or tree structure:<\/p>\n<div data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ad2c39ae-b363-4423-9a2c-293bf66290a0\" data-langcode=\"en\" class=\"embedded-entity align-center\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/cake-keyword-groups-2.png\" alt=\"Keyword Groups\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"718\" height=\"322\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>This structure will map to your Google Ads\u00a0campaigns and the ad groups within those campaigns.<\/p>\n<h2>How Keywords Work in Your PPC Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Your text ads need to be relevant to the keywords you\u2019re bidding on in order to earn high Quality Scores, which determine where your ad appears and your cost per click (CPC).<\/p>\n<p>The keyword you\u2019re bidding on should actually appear in your ad in order to show relevance to both Google and the searcher.

There are four keyword match types, from least restrictive to most restrictive:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Broad match<\/strong> \u2013 This is the default keyword match type. Google will match your ad against the greatest number of possible queries. For example, if you bid on the keyword \u201cmassage,\u201d your ads might show when people search on longer phrases that include \u201cmassage,\u201d like \u201cMiami massage\u201d or \u201cdeep tissue massage therapist.\u201d Your ads might also show for closely related searches like \u201chot stone therapy.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Phrase match <\/strong>\u2013 This match type allows you to tell Google to display your ad only when the search query includes a full phrase, such as \u201chot stone.\u201d (The words have to appear in that order.) Other words may be included in the search query before or after the phrase. As of February 2021, the phrase match keyword type has been expanded to match more queries, as the broad match modified keyword type gets retired and absorbed into phrase match).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Exact match <\/strong>\u2013 The most restrictive match type, exact match tells Google to only match your ads to queries that are exactly the same, word for word, as your keyword.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Broad match keywords have the advantage of allowing the maximum number of impressions and clicks \u2013 however, those clicks are less targeted and may be less likely to convert. The more restrictive the match type, the fewer clicks you\u2019ll receive, but that traffic will be more relevant and more qualified.<\/p>\n<h2>Keyword Resources\u00a0to Help You Along the Way<\/h2>\n<p>WordStream offers a\u00a0<a href=\"\/keywords\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a>\u00a0that makes it fast and easy to find the keywords your business needs to drive traffic through organic and paid search.
