There are three different keyword match types to choose from when advertising with Google Ads:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Broad match<\/li>\n<li>Phrase match<\/li>\n<li>Exact match<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>In this quick tutorial, you\u2019ll learn the three keyword match types available in Google advertising and how they differ, as well as why keyword match types are important to the success of your PPC ad campaigns.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the keyword match types?<\/h2>\n<p>When creating a text ad in your PPC campaign, you can select\u00a0<strong>broad match<\/strong>,\u00a0<strong>phrase match<\/strong>, or\u00a0<strong>exact match<\/strong>\u00a0for your keyword match type. Each match type in your Google Ads account\u00a0has its advantages and disadvantages.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/broad-phrase-exact-match-types-google-ads.png\" alt=\"google ads keyword match types compared\" width=\"720\" height=\"520\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-57622\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/broad-phrase-exact-match-types-google-ads.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/broad-phrase-exact-match-types-google-ads-480x347.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Broad match type<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"\/broad-match\" title=\"broad match\">Broad match<\/a>\u00a0is the default match type and the one that reaches the widest audience. When using broad match, your ad is eligible to appear whenever a user\u2019s search query includes <strong>any word in your key phrase, in any order, as well as any word that relates to your keyword<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you use broad match on &#8220;luxury car,&#8221; your ad might be displayed if a user types &#8220;luxury cars,&#8221; &#8220;fast cars,&#8221; or &#8220;luxury apartments,&#8221; as well as\u00a0 \u201cexpensive vehicles\u201d which doesn\u2019t include any of the terms in your keyword.<\/p>\n<p>Again, since broad match is the default match type, it\u2019s important to be very careful. Broad match keywords are a great way to drive lots of clicks, but advertisers need to keep a close eye on their search query reports to ensure that they\u2019re not paying for irrelevant traffic that doesn\u2019t convert.<\/p>\n<p>You can set up <a href=\"\/negative-keywords\" title=\"setting negative keywords\">negative keywords<\/a>\u00a0to help prevent your ad from showing on searches that aren\u2019t related to your business.

So if your phrase match keyword is &#8220;holidays in zambia,&#8221; your ad could show for\u00a0<em>holiday spots in zambia.<\/em> Here are some examples Google provides:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/broad-match-modifier-going-away-new-logic-1.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"459\" alt=\"broad match modifier going away new logic\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>Exact match type<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"\/exact-match\" title=\"exact match\">Exact match<\/a>\u00a0is the most specific and restrictive of the keyword match types. In previous years, with this match type, users would only see your ad when they typed your exact keyword phrase by itself. For example, if your keyword phrase was &#8220;black cocktail dress,&#8221; your ad would <em>only<\/em> be eligible to show up when a user searched for &#8220;black cocktail dress&#8221; (those words in that exact order) and not for &#8220;cocktail dress,&#8221; &#8220;black dress&#8221; or &#8220;expensive black cocktail dress.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>However, Google has recently made changes to the exact match type so that even when using exact match keywords, your ads might match to searches containing synonyms, plurals, or other variations on your keyword. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/07\/exact-match-keywords-even-more-variants\">Learn more about these changes in this article<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/new-exact-match-keyword-rules-2018-1.png\" width=\"895\" height=\"377\" alt=\"new exact match keyword rules in 2018\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>On the plus side, users who click on your ad when searching for that exact phrase are more likely to be interested in your product or service, so using exact match can reduce unwanted costs and keep conversion rates high. On the down side, you will have less traffic as a result of your restrictions, because these more specific search queries have lower search volume, and you won\u2019t get as many overall impressions. Like phrase match, exact match has also been updated to include synonyms and close variants, so you do have a bit more flexibility now with this match type.<\/p>\n<h2>How do match types affect your search ad results?<\/h2>\n<p>Match types can have a major impact on your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">account\u2019s performance<\/a>: they\u2019re the control you use to determine exactly which search queries you\u2019re bidding on. As you determine which match types to use for each keyword, there are a few key components to consider:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Performance to date<\/strong> \u2014 How a keyword or similar keywords have performed can give you insights into which match type will provide the best return on your investment.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Competitors <\/strong>\u2014 How your competitors bid on certain terms and structure their own accounts, as well as how their accounts have performed historically will all impact the return you see from certain match types.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bids<\/strong> \u2014 <a href=\"\/cost-per-click\">Cost per click<\/a> and cost per conversion are heavily impacted by bids \u2013 often advertisers employ various methodologies for manipulating bids and frequently bid more or less aggressively based on the match type \u2013 this can strongly influence which match type is most appropriate.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ad text &amp; account structure<\/strong> \u2014 Many advertisers will break out a \u201cmoney\u201d keyword and run it on broad, phrase and exact match types \u2013 perhaps even segmenting those match types out and writing specific ads for each. The way an advertiser <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/10\/google-ads-account-structure\">structures an account<\/a> can also have a massive impact on performance for different match types.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Choosing the right match types is crucial because it allows you to reach your target audience while avoiding unnecessary spend on irrelevant clicks.<\/p>\n<p>The first step, of course, is to have relevant keywords to begin with!
