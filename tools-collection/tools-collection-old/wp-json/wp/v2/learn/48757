For example, a company might create an ad campaign to meet one of the following business objectives:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>To create <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/10\/brand-awareness\">brand awareness<\/a> for a new product<\/li>\n<li>To <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/03\/increase-sales-online\">drive sales<\/a> of a product or service<\/li>\n<li>To <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/01\/lead-generation-ideas\">generate leads<\/a> by asking people to sign up for an email list or another free offer<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll be focusing on online advertising campaigns. <strong>Online ad campaigns are highly powerful because online activity is so measurable.<\/strong> The more data and metrics you can collect about the ways that people interact with your ads, the easier it is to optimize those ads to get better results for lower costs.<\/p>\n<h2>Some online ad campaign types<\/h2>\n<p>Some of the most popular types of online ad campaigns include:<\/p>\n<h3>Google Ads campaigns<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"\/articles\/what-is-google-adwords\">Google Ads<\/a> is a paid search advertising platform that allows businesses to place sponsored ads in search engine results, as well as on the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/18\/google-display-network-tips\">Google Display Network<\/a>, in Gmail, on YouTube and other placements. Google search ads in particular can be highly particular, because search terms reveal a lot of <a href=\"\/keyword-intent\">intent<\/a>: in other words, you can tell what a person wants by what words they use to search on Google. That allows you to create ad campaigns that really meet their needs.<\/p>\n<p>This is key, because Google Ads rewards advertisers who create highly relevant ads with better ad rankings and lower costs.
