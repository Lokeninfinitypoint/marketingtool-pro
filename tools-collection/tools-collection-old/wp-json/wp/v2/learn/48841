Content quality, keywords, and HTML tags are the key players for on-page SEO.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Off-page SEO: <\/strong>Getting other sites, and other pages on your site to link to the page you are trying to optimize.

How does this translate into traffic to your website? Let&#8217;s take a look at how SEO works.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google\u2019s search crawlers constantly scan the web, gathering, categorizing, and storing the billions of web pages out there in its index. When you search for something and Google pulls up results, it&#8217;s pulling from its index, not the web itself.<\/li>\n<li>Google uses a complex formula (called an algorithm) to order results based on a number of criteria (ranking factors\u2014which we&#8217;ll get into next) including the quality of the content, its relevance to the search query, the website (domain) it belongs to, and more.<\/li>\n<li>How people interact with results then further indicates to Google the needs that each page is (or isn&#8217;t) satisfying, which also gets factored into the algorithm.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/03\/seo-optimization-how-does-seo-work.jpg\" alt=\"chart showing how search engine optimization works\" width=\"761\" height=\"643\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-63451\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In other words, SEO works like a complex feedback system\u2014to surface the most accurate, trustworthy, and relevant results for any given search using input from you, Google, and searchers. Your role is to produce content that satisfies Google&#8217;s experience, expertise, authority, and trust requirements (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/14\/google-e-e-a-t\">E-E-A-T<\/a>), which satisfy its searchers&#8217; requirements.<br \/>\n<a id=\"ranking_factors\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>SEO ranking factors on Google<\/h2>\n<p>So what are those requirements? What actually constitutes quality, targeted, EAT-friendly, and SEO-optimized content? Well, there are hundreds of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/09\/google-ranking-factors\">Google ranking factors<\/a>, and Google is also constantly evolving and refining its algorithm to continue providing the best experience possible, but there are 12 that should be prioritized.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/firstpagesage.com\/seo-blog\/the-google-algorithm-ranking-factors\/\">FirstPageSage<\/a>, <strong>these are the top Google ranking factors and how they are weighted:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Consistent publication of high-quality content (26%)<\/li>\n<li>Keywords in meta title (17%)<\/li>\n<li>Backlinks (15%)<\/li>\n<li>Niche expertise (13%)<\/li>\n<li>User engagement (11%)<\/li>\n<li>Internal links (5%)<\/li>\n<li>Mobile-friendly\/mobile-first (5%)<\/li>\n<li>Page speed (2%)<\/li>\n<li>Site security\/SSL certificate (2%)<\/li>\n<li>Schema markup\/structured data (1%)<\/li>\n<li>Keywords in URL (1%)<\/li>\n<li>Keywords in H1 (1%)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>But make no mistake about the factors at the bottom of this list. As you can see in the below chart, &#8220;Other&#8221; factors, like unlinked mentions, social signals, domain history, outbound links, and site structure, carry 1% weight. But given that there are at least <a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/google-ranking-factors\">200 Google ranking factors;<\/a> that&#8217;s at least 189 &#8220;other&#8221; factors that collectively make up that 1%. In other words, those seemingly small factors, like keywords in URL, that on their own make up 1%, are not so small.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/search-engine-optimization-seo-google-ranking-factors.png\" alt=\"search engine optimization - google ranking factors\" width=\"720\" height=\"659\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63399\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/search-engine-optimization-seo-google-ranking-factors.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/search-engine-optimization-seo-google-ranking-factors-480x439.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\n<a id=\"on_page_seo\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>How to do SEO: On-page optimization<\/h2>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s time to talk about how to actually <em>do<\/em> SEO\u2014how to optimize your website for these factors so you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/06\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google\">rank higher on Google<\/a> and get more traffic. This requires a combination of on-page, off-page, and technical optimizations, so we&#8217;re going to organize the steps in that manner. Here are your on-page optimization steps:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Start with keyword research<\/li>\n<li>Create quality content targeting those keywords<\/li>\n<li>Place your keywords<\/li>\n<li>Optimize your titles<\/li>\n<li>Optimize your meta descriptions<\/li>\n<li>Include and optimize images<\/li>\n<li>Internal and external links<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>1. Start with SEO keyword research<\/h3>\n<p>The first step in search engine optimization is to determine what keywords you\u2019re optimizing for. These are terms that your ideal website visitors are likely to type into Google or other search engines, and each page on your site should target a different keyword cluster so they don&#8217;t compete with each other.<\/p>\n<h4><strong style=\"color: #009bff; font-size: 20px;\">How to do keyword research for SEO<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>These are your basic steps for finding the best keywords to target with your organic content:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Create your seed list:<\/strong> Start by listing out the words and phrases your ideal customers are typing into Google. Think about their interests, desires, pain points, and goals, and think in terms of the language they&#8217;re using, which may be different from what you (as the expert) use.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Plug them into a keyword research tool:\u00a0 <\/strong>Keyword research tools will give you data around these keywords so you can see which terms you can conceivably rank for and where the best opportunities actually lie. Metrics include:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Search volume: <\/strong>How many times that term is searched per month.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Competition: <\/strong>How difficult it is to rank for that keyword.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/how-to-use-google-ads-wordstream-free-keyword-tool.png\" alt=\"how to use google ads - wordstream's free keyword tool\" width=\"720\" height=\"477\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-62320\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/how-to-use-google-ads-wordstream-free-keyword-tool.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/how-to-use-google-ads-wordstream-free-keyword-tool-480x318.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\"><em>Try out WordStream&#8217;s (always) Free Keyword Tool<\/em><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sort and prioritize: <\/strong>Put the resulting terms and data into a spreadsheet. Now you can group them into core themes and also prioritize them. Ideally, you&#8217;ll want to target keywords with a high enough search volume to give you decent reach, but not so high that the keyword becomes too competitive to rank for. Better to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/19\/get-on-first-page-google\">show up on page one<\/a> for a lower volume, lower competition keyword than to not rank at all for a high volume, high competition keyword.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can refer to our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">more in-depth how-to on keyword research here.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>2. Create quality content targeting those keywords<\/h3>\n<p>Your main navigation pages (homepage, about us, contact, products, services) will target keywords, but the bulk of your keyword targeting will come from long-form content in the form of blog posts. Quality, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/01\/17\/seo-content-beginners-guide\">SEO content<\/a> is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Aligned with the keyword&#8217;s intent:<\/strong> Make sure your content provides the information people are seeking when they search this keyword. This is why you should always search the keyword on Google first.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Provides a good experience:<\/strong> It&#8217;s free of overly aggressive pop-ups or CTAs or other distracting elements; uses images to depict concepts, and loads quickly and properly on all devices (more on this later in the technical SEO section).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reads naturally: <\/strong>Don&#8217;t keyword-stuff. Write like a human being speaking to your audience; not a content writer trying to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/18\/content-optimization\">optimize for a search engine<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>In-depth:<\/strong> Google isn\u2019t interested in thin, duplicate, or low-value pages. This means 1,500-2,500 words of accurate, up-to-date, information.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Organized:<\/strong> Use your heading tags to indicate the hierarchy of information on the page.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/html-headings-in-seo-optimized-content.png\" alt=\"illustration of html headings in seo optimized content\" width=\"543\" height=\"434\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-63448\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/html-headings-in-seo-optimized-content.png 543w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/html-headings-in-seo-optimized-content-480x384.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 543px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>3. Place your keywords<\/h3>\n<p>In addition to naturally in the body of your content, you&#8217;ll want to place your keyword into specific spots on the page to indicate to Google what you\u2019re looking to rank for. This includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>SEO title (title tag)<\/li>\n<li>Page title (H1 tag)<\/li>\n<li>At least two H2 headings<\/li>\n<li>Image alt text<\/li>\n<li>Image file name<\/li>\n<li>Naturally in the body<\/li>\n<li>URL<\/li>\n<li>Meta description<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/how-to-increase-traffic-to-website-keyword-placement-checklist-on-page-seo-720.png\" alt=\"how to increase traffic to your website - on-page seo keyword placement\" width=\"720\" height=\"472\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-60153\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/how-to-increase-traffic-to-website-keyword-placement-checklist-on-page-seo-720.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/how-to-increase-traffic-to-website-keyword-placement-checklist-on-page-seo-720-480x315.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>4. Optimize your titles<\/h3>\n<p>For any page on your website, you actually have two titles. The title tag is the title that appears on the SERP and is the single most impactful place you can put your keyword. The H1 tag is the title that appears on the page when you click into it.

Optimize your meta descriptions<\/h3>\n<p>The meta description is the description that appears on the SERP below the title tag. Google doesn\u2019t always show the one you\u2019ve provided in the SERP; it likes to build its own based on the query, but it\u2019s still important to optimize for SEO. Google reads this description when crawling the page to understand what it\u2019s about.<\/p>\n<h4><strong style=\"color: #009bff; font-size: 20px;\">To optimize your meta description:<\/strong><\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Include the keyword<\/strong> and related keywords if you can do so in a natural and compelling way.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Keep it short: <\/strong>Ideal meta description length is 155-165 characters.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Make it compelling:<\/strong> Remember, showing up in search results is just the first step! You still need to get searchers to click. Include a concise description, a clear benefit, and a call to action, like ad copy!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example of a real-world meta description in search results:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/seo-meta-description-optimization.png\" alt=\"seo meta description optimization\" width=\"720\" height=\"308\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63402\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/seo-meta-description-optimization.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/seo-meta-description-optimization-480x205.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Meta descriptions = SEO &#8220;ad copy&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>6. Include and optimize images<\/h3>\n<p>Images are a key player in SEO optimization. They keep users engaged with your pages, enhance the quality of the information, and provide opportunities for you to rank and generate traffic to their host pages through image results. Plus, Google has increasingly been making the SERP more visual.<\/p>\n<h4><strong style=\"color: #009bff; font-size: 20px;\"> Here\u2019s how to do SEO optimization for images:<\/strong><\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>File name:<\/strong> Save the file name with the keyword, with dashes instead of spaces.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Add alt text<\/strong>: Alt text stands for the text alternative of an image, and it&#8217;s how Google \u201csees\u201d an image on a page and detects its relevance to the keyword. It also makes your site accessible for screen readers, and if images break, the alt text will still appear. Don\u2019t keyword stuff here. Imagine you\u2019re describing the image to someone who can\u2019t see it\u2014that\u2019s what it\u2019s there for!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Compress:<\/strong> Large images can slow down the speed of your site. Compress them to reduce file size and properly size them. You shouldn\u2019t need images much wider than 1000px, but every site is different.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>7. Internal and external links<\/h3>\n<p>When doing SEO for blog posts, you&#8217;ll want to add both internal and external links.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>External links:<\/strong> Find 1-3 pages relevant to the topic you&#8217;re targeting, on other sites that have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/12\/domain-authority\">high domain authority<\/a>, and link to them in your post. This helps to build trust with Google.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Internal links:<\/strong> Link to other blog posts on your site\u00a0 in the content of the post you&#8217;re writing\u2014just like I did in that last bullet, using &#8220;high domain authority&#8221; as my anchor text. This gives Google multiple pathways to any given post, making your site easier to crawl as a whole. How many to include here depends on the length of the post and the amount of other content you have available to link to. Keep the links relevant to the page and to the anchor text you use.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p><strong>\ud83d\udc46Pro tip:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong> <\/strong>It&#8217;s natural to add links to old blog posts in your new blog posts, but you should also go back into old blog posts and add in links to new posts.<\/p><\/div><\/div><br \/>\n<a id=\"off_page_seo\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>How to do SEO: Off-page optimization<\/h2>\n<p>All of the steps above are on-page SEO strategies. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/13\/off-page-seo\">Off-page SEO<\/a>, on the other hand, is what you do on other pages of your website, other websites, and even other platforms to help your page to rank. Here are some off-page SEO tactics<\/p>\n<h3>8. Earn and reach out for backlinks<\/h3>\n<p>Backlinks, or links to your site from other websites, are the third most important Google ranking factor. Backlinks from higher credibility sites are, of course, more valuable than those from lower credibility sites. The more high-quality backlinks you have, the higher you&#8217;ll rank.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/10\/link-building-secrets\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/seo-search-engine-optimization-top-ranking-pages-more-backlinks.png\" alt=\"search engine optimization - backlinking improves rank\" width=\"720\" height=\"550\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63412\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/seo-search-engine-optimization-top-ranking-pages-more-backlinks.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/seo-search-engine-optimization-top-ranking-pages-more-backlinks-480x367.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/off-page-seo-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>So how do you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/10\/link-building-secrets\">get more backlinks<\/a>? There are several strategies, but a few include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Producing original, authentic content worthy of getting backlinks.<\/li>\n<li>Proactively reaching out to sites for which a link to your content would be a useful addition.<\/li>\n<li>Guest posting<\/li>\n<li>PR coverage<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>9. Share your content on social media<\/h3>\n<p>In addition to linking to your homepage in social media profiles, you should also be regularly sharing your blog posts with your feed. This earns you referral traffic, and the more eyes on a post, the higher the chances of generating backlinks. Social media itself isn&#8217;t a direct google ranking factor, but your activity on the platforms and users&#8217; engagement with your content there send social signals to Google that influence your ranking.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Build your brand reputation<\/h3>\n<p>When determining how high to rank a particular page on your site, Google doesn&#8217;t just look at that one page. It takes into account your brand as a whole, which it does so by looking at other information about it across the web\u2014including reviews, ratings, listings, awards, and even unlinked brand mentions. As such, building your brand reputation by optimizing your listings, gaining positive press, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">asking for reviews<\/a> is essential for SEO. Much of this falls under the realm of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/12\/27\/eleven-seo-tips-for-local-search-optimization\">local SEO<\/a> but there are plenty of brand-building strategies that apply to non-brick-and-mortar businesses too.<br \/>\n<a id=\"technical_seo\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>How to do SEO: Technical optimizations<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/28\/technical-seo\">Technical SEO<\/a> optimizations are done on the back end of your website to make sure it meets Google&#8217;s site security and user experience requirements, as well as to make it as easy as possible for Google to do its job on your site. Here are some of the main technical optimizations to take care of:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Page speed:\u00a0<\/strong>In addition to image sizes, the code behind your website content and the order in which it loads can impact page speed.
