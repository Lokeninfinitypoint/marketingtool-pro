Let\u2019s say you\u2019re managing Google Ads campaigns for a luxury car dealership that only sells new cars.

Read on!<\/p>\n<h2><strong>What are negative keywords?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Negative keywords enable you to prevent your ads from matching to irrelevant<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/search-term\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> search queries.<\/a> For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re using PPC to advertise dance lessons for kids. With the help of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/geo-targeting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">geotargeting<\/a>, you\u2019re bidding on the modified broad match keyword +dance +lessons. If someone in your area uses Google to search for \u201cadult dance lessons,\u201d your ad will enter the auction. Because your ad is irrelevant to this person, one of two bad things will happen:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>She\u2019ll ignore your ad, thus diminishing its click-through rate (CTR).<\/li>\n<li>She\u2019ll click on your ad and subsequently realize that your business is irrelevant to her, thus costing you money.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>By adding adult as a negative keyword, you can prevent both of those scenarios from playing out. You can add negatives at the account level, the campaign level, or the ad group level. When doing so, you have three <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-match-types\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">match types<\/a> to choose from: broad, phrase, and exact.<\/p>\n<p>Negative broad match keywords (e.g., adult dance lessons) prevent your ad from showing when each part of the negative keyword is included in the query, regardless of the word order. So, although our example would keep the query \u201cdance lessons for adults\u201d from triggering your ad, it would not keep \u201cdance for adults\u201d from triggering it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/negative-broad-match-keyword-search-query-examples.png\" alt=\"negative-broad-match-keyword-search-query-examples\" width=\"678\" height=\"258\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-51672 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/negative-broad-match-keyword-search-query-examples.png 678w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/negative-broad-match-keyword-search-query-examples-480x183.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 678px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nNegative phrase match keywords (e.g., \u201cadult dance lessons\u201d) prevent your ad from showing when the negative keyword is included in the query in its specified order.

So, although our example would keep the query \u201cadult dance lessons\u201d from triggering your ad, it would not keep \u201cdance lessons for adults\u201d from triggering it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/negative-exact-match-keywords-search-query-examples.png\" alt=\"negative-exact-match-keywords-search-query-examples\" width=\"677\" height=\"247\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-51674 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/negative-exact-match-keywords-search-query-examples.png 677w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/negative-exact-match-keywords-search-query-examples-480x175.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 677px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nWhereas negative broad match keywords are highly restrictive, negative phrase match keywords are only moderately restrictive, and negative exact match keywords are barely restrictive at all. Because there are a lot of unique ways to search for adult dance lessons, negative broad match would be your best bet in this hypothetical scenario. Make sure to note, however, that being too restrictive can cripple your potential for reaching new prospects.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The importance of negative keywords<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As we\u2019ve already said, showing your ad to someone who\u2019s uninterested in your business will lead to either a wasted impression or a wasted click. We don\u2019t need to explain why wasted clicks are undesirable; because clicks cost money, it\u2019s a given that you\u2019d like to turn as many of those clicks into conversions as possible.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a bit more nuance to the undesirability of wasted impressions, however. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/click-through-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">click-through rate (CTR)<\/a> of your ad measures how often the people who see your ad actually click on it. The more often impressions turn into clicks, the higher your ad\u2019s CTR\u2014and vice versa. Accordingly, each time someone sees your ad and doesn\u2019t click\u2014because it\u2019s irrelevant to them, for example\u2014your CTR declines.<\/p>\n<p>Click-through rate = (clicks \/ impressions) x 100<\/p>\n<p>Why does this matter? Because the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/quality-score\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quality Score<\/a> assigned to the keyword that\u2019s attached to your ad is determined, in part, by expected click-through rate. The lower your expected CTR, the lower your Quality Score. In turn, a lower Quality Score yields a lower Ad Rank and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/articles\/what-is-google-adwords\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">higher cost per click (CPC)<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, a declining CTR\u2014as a result of your ad matching to irrelevant queries\u2014signals to Google that your ad isn\u2019t terribly relevant or helpful to the people you\u2019re trying to reach. As such, you\u2019re charged more money for visibility in the paid search results.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/negative-keywords-ad-rank-equation-final.png\" alt=\"negative-keywords-ad-rank-equation-final\" width=\"766\" height=\"359\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-51675 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/negative-keywords-ad-rank-equation-final.png 766w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/negative-keywords-ad-rank-equation-final-480x225.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 766px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nThat\u2019s why negative keywords are so important: because they keep your ads away from irrelevant queries and prevent unnecessary increases in CPC.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How to find &amp; add negative keywords<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>OK\u2014we\u2019re on the same page in terms of what negative keywords are and why they\u2019re important to your PPC marketing efforts. Now, let\u2019s talk about the strategies you can use to find and add negative keywords to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/02\/adwords-account-structure-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">your Google Ads account.<\/a> Broadly speaking, there are two ways to go about this: reactively and proactively. Neither is right nor wrong.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Reactively finding &amp; adding negative keywords<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The reason we describe this approach as reactive is that it involves combing through the search queries that are currently triggering your ads. Allow us to explain.<\/p>\n<p>Open up the Google Ads interface and click on the Keywords tab on the left.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/negative-keywords-tab.png\" alt=\"negative-keywords-tab\" width=\"144\" height=\"386\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-51676 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/negative-keywords-tab.png 144w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/negative-keywords-tab-112x300.png 112w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 144px) 100vw, 144px\" \/><br \/>\nOnce you\u2019re there, head to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/03\/google-search-terms-report-changes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search terms report<\/a> over on the right.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/negative-keywords-search-terms-tab.png\" alt=\"negative-keywords-search-terms-tab\" width=\"546\" height=\"352\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-51677 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/negative-keywords-search-terms-tab.png 546w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/negative-keywords-search-terms-tab-480x309.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 546px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>negative-keywords-google-ads-search-terms-tab<br \/>\nWith this handy report, you can see which search queries are triggering your ads. More specifically, you\u2019ll see three columns:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Search term: the queries that are triggering your ads<\/li>\n<li>Match type: whether each query matched to a broad, phrase, or exact match keyword<\/li>\n<li>Added\/excluded: whether each query has already been added as a keyword or a negative keyword<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/negative-keywords-search-terms-report.png\" alt=\"negative-keywords-search-terms-report\" width=\"543\" height=\"603\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-51680 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/negative-keywords-search-terms-report.png 543w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/negative-keywords-search-terms-report-480x533.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 543px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As you comb through the queries, you\u2019ll want to keep your eye out for those that are irrelevant. When you find one of these budget-killers, simply check the box to the left of the query and select Add as Negative Keyword from the option screen that pops up. That\u2019s it!<\/p>\n<p>As you can probably tell, this process is \u2026 tedious. Plus, as your eyes gloss over and your brain turns into oatmeal, your ability to make qualitative judgements dulls considerably. Fortunately, there\u2019s a far more quantitative way to reactively add negative keywords. Basically, you\u2019re going to filter your search terms report according to three crucial metrics: click-through rate, conversion rate (CVR), and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/cost-per-action\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cost per action (CPA)<\/a>. This way, you can see which search queries are driving subpar results for your business\u2014and potentially indicating that they should be added as negative keywords.<\/p>\n<p>To work some filtering magic, head back to the Search Terms report and click the funnel icon. Here, you can select the metrics you\u2019d like to filter by from a pre-populated list.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/negative-keywords-filter-icon.png\" alt=\"negative-keywords-filter-icon\" width=\"293\" height=\"61\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-51681 size-full\" \/><br \/>\nEach time you select a metric as a filter (e.g., <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/conversion-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">conversion rate<\/a>), Google Ads will prompt you to set some basic parameters. So, if you\u2019d like to see which queries are yielding CVRs below 10%, this is your chance to make it so.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/negative-keywords-filter-parameters.png\" alt=\"negative-keywords-filter-parameters\" width=\"264\" height=\"177\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-51682 size-full\" \/><br \/>\nAs a best practice, we recommend layering your filters\u2014that is, looking at more than one at the same time. For example, you can see which queries are driving high CTRs\u2014and, thus, costing you a lot of money\u2014but not converting well.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Are you wasting spend in Google Ads?

To do this, you\u2019ll have to build some negative keyword lists. As you can imagine, these are simply lists of negatives based on irrelevant search queries that may otherwise match to your keywords.<\/p>\n<p>As an example, let\u2019s return to the hypothetical scenario of a dance studio for kids. You don\u2019t need a search terms report to know that queries like \u201cdance lessons for adults,\u201d \u201call ages dance studio,\u201d and \u201csenior couple dance lessons\u201d could very well trigger your ads.
