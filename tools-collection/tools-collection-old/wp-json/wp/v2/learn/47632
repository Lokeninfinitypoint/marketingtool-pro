The paid results are the ads that appear at the top and the bottom of the page, and they are marked accordingly. The organic results are the unmarked results that appear in between the ads.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the core of an internet search is a keyword. In turn, keywords are at the hearts of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/search-engine-marketing\">search engine marketing (SEM<\/a>) and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/seo\">search engine optimization (SEO)<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Internet Searches and Search Engine Marketing (SEM)<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Search engine marketing, also known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/paid-search\">paid search<\/a>, is the practice of advertising on search engine results pages (SERPs). All the major search engines offer ad space, and the most prominent platform is Google Ads (formerly known as AdWords). Google Ads is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/ppc\">pay-per-click<\/a> platform: an advertiser pays every time someone clicks on its advertisement.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s talk more about a term we sort of brushed past: keyword. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword\">keyword<\/a> is any word or phrase within a search query that an advertiser considers relevant to its business.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/internet-search-keywords-1.png\" alt=\"internet-search-keyword-list\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"975\" height=\"588\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As such, search advertisers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/bid\">bid on certain keywords<\/a> in order to make their ads eligible for display when those keywords are searched. For example, say Nike bids on the keyword \u201crunning shoes.\u201d Whenever someone Google searches \u201cmens running shoes\u201d or \u201crunning shoes for kids,\u201d Nike is entered into an automated auction to determine which advertisers get the prime, top-of-page-one spots. You can read more about the Google auction <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/11\/16\/how-adwords-works\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As you can see, it all starts with the search query. If you\u2019re interested in paid search advertising, make sure to keep up with the WordStream blog to learn everything you need to know.<\/p>\n<h2>Internet Searches and Search Engine Optimization (SEO)<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can think of search engine optimization as unpaid search marketing \u2013 SEM\u2019s free cousin. Essentially, SEO is a collection of diverse practices with a single common goal: improving your performance in the organic (non-advertisement) search results. To put it even more simply, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/20\/seo-audit\">strong SEO<\/a> gets your website on page one. And if you\u2019re not on page one, what\u2019s the point?<\/p>\n<p>Once again, it all starts with a search query and a keyword. Similar to SEM, businesses that practice SEO focus on keywords relevant to them and try to rank as highly as possible.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Well, think about Google\u2019s business model. It attracts consumers by offering an immense, instantaneously accessible index of information. Then, it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/paid-search\">sells SERP real estate to advertisers<\/a>. Google\u2019s attraction of consumers rests on its capacity to produce high-quality, relevant search results. If the results aren\u2019t helpful, consumers abandon Google, and Google loses ad money.<\/p>\n<p>This is informative. In order to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/20\/seo-audit\">rank highly in the organic results<\/a>, you need to be a quality resource. To be more precise, you need to be an authoritative resource. In the eyes of Google, you attain Domain Authority every time a reputable website links to your website. The more links you earn from external resources, the more authoritative your website becomes, and the better you perform in organic search results.<\/p>\n<p>You need to be a relevant resource, too. Relevance to a particular search query comes from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/seo-keyword\">optimizing your content for a keyword<\/a> within that query. If you want your blog post to organically rank for the keyword \u201clawn care basics,\u201d you better make sure those words appear in the title, the URL, the headings, the subheadings, the body copy, the image names, and the alt texts. This ubiquity, as long as it\u2019s not overdone (keyword stuffing), signals to Google that your page is relevant to the search query. If you\u2019re authoritative, your blog will rank well.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>An internet search, otherwise known as a search query, is an entry into a search engine that yields both paid and organic results.
