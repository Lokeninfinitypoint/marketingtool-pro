Income targeting can be used by itself or in concert with other demographic targeting options to make your campaigns as granular (and effective) as possible.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/adwords-household-income-targeting-line-graph.png\" alt=\"adwords household income targeting displayed on a line graph in the new adwords experience\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"800\" height=\"424\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In this article, you\u2019ll learn what household income targeting is, how it\u2019s determined, and how you can implement it in your Google advertising account. But first\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>Why Use Household Income Targeting?<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you (or your client) sells high-end financial services to affluent individuals in the Greater Boston area. Obviously, you\u2019re going to use location-based targeting to ensure that your ads aren\u2019t served to people living in Montana searching for wealth management. That\u2019s no enough, though.<\/p>\n<p>You see, keywords in this vertical are prohibitively expensive.<\/p>\n<p>Household income targeting will allow you to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Target <\/strong>the top 10% of households in high-value, high-cost campaigns to ensure that top-converting keywords with high <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/30\/commercial-intent-keywords\">commercial intent<\/a> receive a large chunk of your overall budget.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Exclude <\/strong>low-income households from all campaigns.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Adjust <\/strong>bids within top of funnel search campaigns to concentrate budget on high-income searchers without dampening search volume.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&#8230;All of which will serve to maximize the value of your ad spend.<\/p>\n<p>While the example above focuses on lead generation for a service, you can use the same strategy if you sell luxury products.<\/p>\n<p>You could also reverse this tactic entirely, eliminating high-income searchers if your primary unique sales proposition is deeply discounted goods.<\/p>\n<p>Given enough account information, businesses in every vertical can benefit from the use of household income targeting for <em>bid adjustment<\/em>; if your business works explicitly with high- or low-income clients, you can focus all your ad budget on the right income demographic. It\u2019s an extremely versatile tool.<\/p>\n<h2>What Is Household Income Targeting in Google Ads?<\/h2>\n<p>Household income targeting allows businesses using Google ads to target and exclude audiences or adjust bids based on specific income brackets. Currently, it\u2019s only available in the U.S., Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. The seven available subsets for income targeting are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Top 10%<\/li>\n<li>11-20%<\/li>\n<li>21-30%<\/li>\n<li>31-40%<\/li>\n<li>41-50%<\/li>\n<li>Lower 50%<\/li>\n<li>Unknown<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Now, it\u2019s important to note that the \u201cUnknown\u201d group will always end up being the largest. This is because, while Google\u2019s data is far-reaching, they don\u2019t know everything about everyone (yet).<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, some sites on the Display network opt out of demographic targeting. As such, there are a number of searchers for whom Google has no way to identify age, gender, parental status, or household income (why isn\u2019t location on this list, you might ask? Because location isn\u2019t determined based on a searcher\u2019s profile or browsing history but, rather, where their device is at the time a search is conducted).<\/p>\n<p>Unless you\u2019re working with sizeable audiences and <em>really<\/em> expensive keywords, don\u2019t exclude the \u201cUnknown.\u201d Doing so will weed out valuable prospects, and nobody wants to do that!<\/p>\n<h2>How Does Google Determine Household Income?<\/h2>\n<p>With data, of course!<\/p>\n<p>When a prospect signs in, Google uses demographic information synthesized from account information, activity on Google properties, and third party data source from social networking sites to determine that account\u2019s characteristics.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-profile.png\" alt=\"google ads profile for individual user is how adwords determines household income tier\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"602\" height=\"264\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If a searcher isn\u2019t signed into a Google account, Google can <em>infer<\/em> demographic information based on the way a searcher used Google properties and the websites on the Display network they visit. This is done through the use of cookies. While less reliable across multiple devices\u2014if a searcher bounces between a laptop and smartphone, for example\u2014than actual account information, this inferred demographic information can still help you serve ads to more qualified prospects.<\/p>\n<h2>Using Household Income Targeting in Your Google Ads Account<\/h2>\n<p>In the old AdWords UI, household income targeting was added to a campaign via an advanced features menu buried within the location targeting interface (if you\u2019re using the old interface, this article on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/01\/killer-underused-adwords-features\">underused AdWords features<\/a> contains detailed instructions for implementing income targeting). As part of the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/25\/new-adwords-experience-features\">new Google Ads experience<\/a>, however, income targeting is front and center.<\/p>\n<p>To implements household income targeting in your Google Ads account, select the campaign in which you want to use it:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/adwords-ui-search-display-video-campaigns.png\" alt=\"adwords ui campaign type selection\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"203\" height=\"239\" \/><\/div>\n<p>From here, choose your desired ad group <em>or<\/em> add your household income targeting at the campaign level (if you\u2019re making broad bid adjustments or totally excluding an audience, we recommend doing so at the ad group level. This will ensure that you don\u2019t accidentally eliminate too many impressions).<\/p>\n<p>In the page menu (depicted below), choose \u201cDemographics.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/adwords-demographics-tab.png\" alt=\"adwords page tab demographic options\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"145\" height=\"610\" \/><\/div>\n<p>At the top of the page, you\u2019ll notice a list of available demographic options (note that if you\u2019re looking at a search campaign, this list will include age, gender, and household income; in display and video campaigns, parental status will be added to the list). Select \u201cHousehold Income.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/adwords-household-income-conversions-vs-conversion-rate.png\" alt=\"adwords household income targeting visualized on bar graph\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"800\" height=\"177\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Beneath the demographic options you\u2019ll notice a customizable graph like the one you see above. Make sure that you adjust the metrics plotted on the graph to reflect performance indicators you care about (if you\u2019ve got a limited budget, there\u2019s no sense in increasing bids by 100% for top-earning households because you noticed unreal engagement rates).<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/adwords-household-income-targeting-performance-metrics.png\" alt=\"adwords household income targeting performance metrics\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"350\" height=\"282\" \/><\/div>\n<p>For most advertisers, this will mean observing conversions and\/or conversion rates.<\/p>\n<p>Using this household income data, you can either increase or decrease bids at the ad group level by clicking the blank space in the bid adjustment column:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/income-targeting-bid-adjustments.png\" alt=\"adowrds household income targeting bid adjustments\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"315\" height=\"186\" \/><\/div>\n<p><em>Or\u00a0<\/em>exclude a household income bracket by selecting \u201cExclusions\u201d at the top of the page:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/adwords-household-income-campaign-exclusions.png\" alt=\"how to create income based exclusions in adwords\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"670\" height=\"121\" \/><\/div>\n<p>And exclude your (un)desired demographics accordingly:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/adwords-income-targeting-dont-exclude-unknown-group.png\" alt=\"do not exclude unknown income group when excluding household income brackets\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"750\" height=\"457\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Note that you can combine demographics to create a hyper-granular campaign. If you do this, I suggest duplicating your campaign. In version A, exclude demographics to create your desired audience; in version b, <em>only exclude the demographics active in version a<\/em>. This will save you from yourself, allowing you to capture less qualified traffic at a lower cost <em>and<\/em> hone your ad copy to speak to the income level, age group, and gender of your perfect prospects.<\/p>\n<p>And that\u2019s it! Now that you\u2019ve got a thorough understanding of what income targeting is and how it works, you can effectively implement household income targeting (and any other demographic targeting, for that matter) in your Google ads account.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While targeting searchers or adjusting your bids based on age, gender, and parental status can be extremely useful, some advertisers\u2014particularly those with high-end products or services\u2014require a bit more nuance.
