As more and more businesses invest in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/search-advertising\">search advertising<\/a>, competition for high-intent keywords increases. This leads to higher costs for keyword bids which drives up CPL.<\/p>\n<h3>Increased privacy restrictions<\/h3>\n<p>Privacy restrictions have also played a role in increasing CPL for many businesses. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-privacy-sandbox-update\">Cookie deprecation<\/a> (although the full rollout has been delayed multiple times) and iOS tracking limitations have made it more difficult for advertisers to track their customers\u2014which makes it more difficult to target them. This means you may be paying more to find the right audience for your ads.<\/p>\n<h3>AI-driven bidding strategies<\/h3>\n<p>While <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-smart-bidding\">Google Smart Bidding bid strategies<\/a> are highly effective at optimizing toward queries that are most likely to convert, the following campaign structure pitfalls can lead to poor cost-efficiency over time:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overly restrictive targeting and\/or match types<\/li>\n<li>Low volume of conversion signals<\/li>\n<li>Poor ad strength<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 <strong>Think your Google Ads aren&#8217;t performing like they should?<\/strong> Find out how to improve them with a free, instant audit &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"5-ways-to-cut-google-ads-cost-per-lead-in-2025\"><\/div>\n<h2>5 tips to keep Google Ads costs low<\/h2>\n<p>So, what can you do to keep costs low despite these extenuating circumstances driving up CPLs?
