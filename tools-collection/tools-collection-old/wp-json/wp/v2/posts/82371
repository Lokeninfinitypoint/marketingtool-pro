Learn them to stay in tune with customers and ahead of competitors.<\/p>\n<div id=\"Conversational-marketing-becomes-table-stakes-for-ecommerce-brands\"><\/div>\n<h3>1. Conversational marketing becomes table stakes for ecommerce brands<\/h3>\n<p>Conversational marketing is a strategy where businesses have two-way communication with customers in real time. Those one-to-one interactions can happen with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/08\/live-chat-rulebook\">live agents<\/a>, but a lot of conversational marketing growth will occur with AI-powered <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/chatbots\">chatbots<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For example, one study suggests that by 2028, around <a href=\"https:\/\/www.juniperresearch.com\/press\/retail-spend-over-chatbots-to-reach-12bn-globally\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$72 billion<\/a> in retail spending will happen through chatbot interactions. For context, that\u2019s a 470% increase compared to the $12 billion in chatbot sales from 2023.<\/p>\n<p>Two factors are fueling this ecommerce trend: generative AI and consumers\u2019 desire for fast answers.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/05\/generative-ai-in-digital-marketing\">Generative AI<\/a> models like ChatGPT use natural language processing to understand conversational queries. That\u2019s helped chatbots become highly successful sales agents that can guide website visitors through their buying journey.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-conversational-marketing-1.webp\" alt=\"Ecommerce trends - chatbot from Seattle Balloon company. \" width=\"434\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82400 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-conversational-marketing-1.webp 434w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-conversational-marketing-1-217x300.webp 217w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 434px) 100vw, 434px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/seattleballooning.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>For most consumers, the <a href=\"https:\/\/thechatbot.net\/statistics-chatbot-ai\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most significant upside<\/a> of using chatbots is the 24\/7 availability of information. Instead of waiting until regular business hours, shoppers can jump in when inspiration strikes and get all the information they need to make an informed purchase.<\/p>\n<p>The great news is chatbots are becoming less expensive and easier to launch, so expect to see them gain traction in <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/ai-in-marketing-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">smaller businesses<\/a>. You can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/04\/how-to-build-a-chatbot-your-brand\">launch your own chatbot<\/a> in a jiffy.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 Conversational marketing relies on great calls to action.

Ecommerce businesses will find new uses for AR<\/h3>\n<p>The virtual reality (VR) craze hit its peak when <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2021\/10\/facebook-company-is-now-meta\/#:~:text=Introducing%20Meta%3A%20A%20Social%20Technology%20Company&amp;text=Today%20at%20Connect%202021%2C%20CEO,find%20communities%20and%20grow%20businesses.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook rebranded as Meta<\/a>, a signal that the social media giant was turning its vast resources towards developing online worlds known loosely as the metaverse. Despite some optimistic forecasts, most of us still aren\u2019t guiding our avatars down digital promenades in search of the next digital deal. And with Meta still <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2024\/02\/01\/metas-reality-labs-loses-4point65-billion-in-q4-ahead-of-vision-pro.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">losing millions<\/a> on its big VR bet, it\u2019s unlikely to happen any time soon.<\/p>\n<p>However, an interesting movement in ecommerce is taking advantage of augmented reality, VR\u2019s cousin that overlays digital imagery on real-world environments in real time.<\/p>\n<p>AR has become very accessible, even offered as free features like stickers and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-do-a-poll-on-instagram\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">polls<\/a> on social media platforms. Expect to see online retailers and brands taking advantage of AR in new ways. For example, fashion brands use AR to help mobile shoppers see how they\u2019ll look in this season\u2019s styles.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-VR-1.webp\" alt=\"Ecommerce trends - screenshot of a VR eyeglass try on screen.\" width=\"936\" height=\"483\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82401 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-VR-1.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-VR-1-480x248.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smartbuyglasses.co.uk\/virtual-try-on\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Users snap a picture in the brand\u2019s app, and AR adds the products.

More sellers slide into their customers\u2019 DMs<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-dm-on-instagram\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Direct messaging<\/a>, like the DMs on your Instagram or TikTok account, is ideal for brands to interact with customers and fans one-on-one. You can send links, images, and product videos. Plus, it doesn\u2019t cost anything to send a DM. That\u2019s why we\u2019ll see more brands connect with their customers in direct message apps this year.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-DMs-two.webp\" alt=\"Ecommerce trends - Promotional direct message.\" width=\"348\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82389 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-DMs-two.webp 348w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-DMs-two-174x300.webp 174w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Because of their private nature, DMs are a great place to have <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-respond-to-negative-reviews\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">conversations about customer concerns<\/a>.

Live commerce bridges the gap between online and in-person shopping<\/h3>\n<p>If QVC and social shopping had a love child, it would be live commerce. During a live commerce event, a host interacts with viewers via video on a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/11\/most-popular-social-media-platforms\">social media platform<\/a>. Those viewers can then purchase the products on offer right from the video.<\/p>\n<p>Live commerce offers the best parts of in-store shopping without fighting traffic or searching for a parking space. Shoppers get instant answers from a knowledgeable brand representative or influencer right from their living room.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-live-shopping-one.webp\" alt=\"Ecommerce trends - live shopping example.\" width=\"462\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82393 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-live-shopping-one.webp 462w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-live-shopping-one-231x300.webp 231w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/business.instagram.com\/blog\/instagram-live-shopping-reach-customers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The most popular social media apps are participating in this trend.

Say you\u2019re launching a new line of cosmetics. You could have a launch party and let viewers buy what they see on their screens.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-live-shopping-two.webp\" alt=\"Ecommerce trends - Live shopping example on YouTube.\" width=\"357\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82394 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-live-shopping-two.webp 357w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-live-shopping-two-179x300.webp 179w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.youtube\/news-and-events\/youtube-shopify-integration-merch-shopping\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The live commerce trend is expected to grow significantly in the near term, with some suggesting it could account for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessdit.com\/live-commerce-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">20%<\/a> of all ecommerce sales. Since conversion rates at live shopping events can reach 30%, ecommerce brands would be wise to take advantage of this trend.<\/p>\n<div id=\"Subscription-services-solidify-customer-loyalty\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. Subscription services solidify customer loyalty<\/h3>\n<p>Buy almost any consumable from Amazon, and you\u2019ll be asked if you\u2019d like to save a few dollars by subscribing to auto-refill your order. The initial loss in profit to the seller is well worth the higher potential of repeat business. And the buyer sees the savings as a no-brainer since they\u2019ll need more of the product later.<\/p>\n<p>The trend goes beyond monthly dog food or cosmetics deliveries (although those are common). Now, you can get a regular delivery of all sorts of themed products, like miniature items for your doll house or train set.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-subscription.webp\" alt=\"Ecommerce trends - Promotional social post for a subscription deal.\" width=\"374\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82396 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-subscription.webp 374w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-subscription-187x300.webp 187w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Savings and customer loyalty are powerful win-wins that are likely to motivate sellers and shoppers to keep the trend going. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ebbo.com\/insights\/blog\/subscription-loyalty-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">77%<\/a> of consumers say they spend up to $499 annually on subscriptions, and 41% say they\u2019ll add more in the next year.<\/p>\n<div id=\"AI-fuels-customized-buying-journeys\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. AI fuels customized buying journeys<\/h3>\n<p>In general, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-marketing-trends-2024\">AI is a big trend<\/a> for all marketers. There are many ways ecommerce brands and marketers can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/05\/generative-ai-in-digital-marketing\">use artificial intelligence<\/a> to boost their businesses. One that\u2019s emerging as particularly useful is having AI create complex, personalized customer journeys.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example. Say you send marketing texts to your customers, reminding them of sales and new products. If each text of those campaigns were personalized to the individual based on their prior behavior, you\u2019d close a lot more sales. But it\u2019d be nearly impossible to do manually when you\u2019re promoting hundreds of products to thousands of customers.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s where <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-in-marketing\">marketing experts are applying AI<\/a>. Using its machine learning capabilities, AI can \u201cremember\u201d how customers reacted to previous messages, which products they bought, and how they interacted with your website. Then, it can create a custom campaign for each text subscriber.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-AI-journey.webp\" alt=\"Ecommerce trends - Example of a promotional SMS text flow.,\" width=\"698\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82398 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-AI-journey.webp 698w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-AI-journey-480x413.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 698px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.attentive.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Personalization is a well-documented marketing strategy that often lifts revenue by up to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/capabilities\/growth-marketing-and-sales\/our-insights\/the-value-of-getting-personalization-right-or-wrong-is-multiplying\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">25%<\/a>.

That\u2019s what <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/dynamic-landing-pages\">dynamic landing pages<\/a> and websites offer.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a simple example where someone considering your product sees a different home page than someone who bought it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-dynamic-website.webp\" alt=\"Ecommerce trends - two landing pages with different text for customers and prospects.\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82390 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-dynamic-website.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-dynamic-website-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Dynamic landing pages aren\u2019t new.

Some shoppers love the personalization it provides, while others are rightfully concerned about their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/11\/22\/customer-data-privacy\">privacy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In light of these concerns, lawmakers and big platforms are making it harder to collect data without direct user consent. Google has finally <a href=\"https:\/\/www.emarketer.com\/content\/google-turns-off-cookies-30-million-chrome-users-that-s-just-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ended the use of third-party cookies<\/a>. Some US states and European governments require websites to give visitors a choice to opt in or opt out of being tracked by cookies.<\/p>\n<p>With much less third-party data, ecommerce marketers will need to become really good at convincing shoppers to give up their information willingly, also known as zero-party data.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-data-types.webp\" alt=\"Ecommerce trends - Graphic showing types of data.\" width=\"936\" height=\"572\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82387 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-data-types.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-data-types-480x293.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In the coming months and years, we&#8217;ll see more creative campaigns designed to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/customer-data\"> collect data<\/a> from willing website visitors and customers ethically.

With the rapid development of new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-copywriting-tools\">AI marketing tools<\/a>, customers\u2019 shift to new sales channels, and potential regulations that can change how everyone does business online, it\u2019s nearly impossible to guess the future of ecommerce with 100% clarity.<\/p>\n<p>But if you look at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/2025-marketing-tips\">marketing trends<\/a> ramping up now, you\u2019ll see a few themes that hint at the future. Customers want in-store experiences from online shopping. They\u2019ll choose lower-friction purchase options over clicking through multiple apps and websites. And they\u2019d prefer personalized interactions as long as their privacy remains protected.<\/p>\n<p>While you mull over what\u2019s to come for ecommerce stores, have a look at these other marketing
