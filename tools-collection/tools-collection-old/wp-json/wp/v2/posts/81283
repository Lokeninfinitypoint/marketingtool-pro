The<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> audience selections for search campaigns<\/a> are the same as any other campaign on the Google network. You can choose from in-market or affinity audiences,<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-remarketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> remarketing<\/a>, YouTube Engagement, detailed demographics, and more.

With a Target CPA of around $400 in this account, I might adjust the bids as you see in the image above. Anything with CPAs well below the target may get a bid boost and ones over that mark get a discount.<\/p>\n<p>The only limitation here is the bid strategy you\u2019re using. As you can see in<a href=\"https:\/\/www.optmyzr.com\/blog\/which-bid-adjustments-work-with-my-bid-strategy-on-google-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> the chart below<\/a>, only the manual and enhanced CPC strategies will allow for bid modifications of audiences. If you\u2019re using any other strategy, these bid modifiers will be ignored.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/search-audiences-google-ads-bid-modification-chart.jpg\" alt=\"search ad audiences - google ads bid modification chart \" width=\"760\" height=\"473\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81296 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/search-audiences-google-ads-bid-modification-chart.jpg 760w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/search-audiences-google-ads-bid-modification-chart-480x299.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 760px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But that doesn\u2019t mean bid modification is the only reason we may want to have observation layers. If you notice a particular audience has very high or very low performance, it may be worthwhile for you to think about segmenting that audience to its own campaign for more granular optimization, or excluding it altogether.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/search-audiences-exclusions.jpg\" alt=\"search audiences - google ads audience exclusions screenshot\" width=\"785\" height=\"336\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81297 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/search-audiences-exclusions.jpg 785w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/search-audiences-exclusions-480x205.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 785px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>While the other bid strategies don\u2019t allow for bid modification, they do allow for exclusion.

Targeting and remarketing lists for search ads (RLSA)<\/h3>\n<p>If we want to start getting a little more creative with our audiences, we can switch from the &#8220;observation&#8221; setting and shift into &#8220;targeting.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/search-audiences-google-ads-targeting-options.jpg\" alt=\"search audiences - screenshot of targeting selected in audience section of google ads\" width=\"969\" height=\"229\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81298 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/search-audiences-google-ads-targeting-options.jpg 969w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/search-audiences-google-ads-targeting-options-480x113.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 969px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This means we\u2019ll be focusing ONLY on the audiences applied to the campaigns. All other users will be excluded. While that might sound restricting, and it is, limiting the audience you\u2019re using opens the door to many other strategies within search that might not be in the best interest of your account without those audience restrictions.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/search-audiences-sizes.jpg\" alt=\"search audiences - google ads audience segment requirements \" width=\"850\" height=\"402\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81299 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/search-audiences-sizes.jpg 850w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/search-audiences-sizes-480x227.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 850px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The biggest challenge is going to be ensuring you meet the audience minimum of 1,000 active users in the last 30 days.

Forgive the mismatch of platforms, but the customized search ads based on audiences are hard to find.

Since I\u2019m a regular on the advertising platform, they likely want to redirect my attention from Facebook and get back into spending money on their platform. Makes sense!<\/p>\n<p>But think about how you can use this for your potential customers. If they\u2019ve been to your site before and are still searching for services similar to yours, you could use your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/08\/15\/ad-copywriting-tips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ad copy<\/a> to offer a promotion, use specific benefit statements you don\u2019t use for first-time customers, etc.<\/p>\n<p>But this also applies to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/09\/18\/best-keyword-research-tools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keywords<\/a>. Maybe your regular search campaigns are focused on your core services, but if someone has been to your site before, you may feel comfortable extending to new terms that promote your less popular services or things that are reserved for returning customers.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd0d Get instant keyword ideas for more targeted and personalized ads using our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h3>Improved call-to-action strategies for funnel movement<\/h3>\n<p>Furthermore, the same theory applies to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/05\/best-call-to-action-phrases\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">calls to action<\/a>. I work with several software companies that have a fairly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/26\/sales-cycle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">long sales cycle<\/a>. For them, we may use our prospecting campaigns to promote video views or content downloads as the call to action, but for Remarketing Lists in Search Ads, we will shift to demo requests or something else a little further down the funnel as that user is already familiar with our offerings and may be ready to take the next step.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/sales-funnel-1.jpg\" alt=\"sales funnel image\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75752 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/sales-funnel-1.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/sales-funnel-1-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Remarketing lists can be created based on the actions users have taken on your site.

Answer: only the minimum audience size!<\/p>\n<h3>Tighter Dynamic Search Ads<\/h3>\n<p>In addition to manual keyword expansion, remarketing lists are also a great way to limit the reach of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/10\/dynamic-search-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dynamic Search Ads (DSAs)<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/search-audiences-dynamic-search-ads-example-graphic.jpg\" alt=\"search audiences - google ads dynamic search ads example graphic\" width=\"751\" height=\"364\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81301 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/search-audiences-dynamic-search-ads-example-graphic.jpg 751w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/search-audiences-dynamic-search-ads-example-graphic-480x233.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 751px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Dynamic Search Ads function differently than regular Search campaigns because you provide Google with your website URL or a page feed of your website, then Google will dynamically match to search terms that are relevant based on your site content and craft ad headlines for you.<\/p>\n<p>The benefit of using Remarketing Lists means that you can likely avoid most restrictions on the Dynamic Search Ads themselves, as the audience will do most of the qualifying work for you. Any time a relevant search is conducted by someone who has engaged with your brand before, a Dynamic Search Ad will show up with customized headlines and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/08\/landing-page-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">landing pages<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Using more broad match keywords successfully<\/h3>\n<p>In an expansion step beyond DSA, you could also start to leverage<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/06\/broad-match-smart-bidding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> broad match keywords with remarketing lists <\/a>as well.
