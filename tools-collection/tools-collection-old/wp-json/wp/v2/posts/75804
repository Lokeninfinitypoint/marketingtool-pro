(Adhering to the 80\/20 rule is a good guidepost here.)<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/80-20-rule-content-creation.jpg\" alt=\"80\/20 rule for content creation and promotion\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75806\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/80-20-rule-content-creation.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/80-20-rule-content-creation-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And finally, optimizing your content with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/popular-keywords\/seo-keywords\">relevant keywords<\/a> and key phrases throughout, including in the title, headings, and meta descriptions, is essential for improving its visibility on search engines.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have these foundations in place, you can leverage ChatGPT as a tool for SEO through content outlining and creativity, rather than solely relying on it as a content generator.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\u26a1\ufe0f Free download &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteAIinMarketingGuide.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_AIMarketing_Download\">The Emergency Guide to AI in Marketing<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<h2>How to use ChatGPT for SEO (the right way!)<\/h2>\n<p>Follow these tips and best practices for using ChatGPT for SEO.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Get help identifying the right content topics (but don&#8217;t forget to do your own research!)<\/h3>\n<p>Crafting content that provides value and answers questions is a crucial SEO strategy for businesses to attract and engage their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">target audience<\/a>. By anticipating what their potential customers are likely searching for, businesses can position themselves as trusted sources of information, building credibility and increasing the likelihood of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/03\/improve-conversion-rates\">conversions<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But coming up with the right topics can be a challenge.

Their team may use ChatGPT to come up with some helpful topics they can drill further into.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/chatgpt-seo-blog-post-topic-prompt.jpg\" alt=\"chatgpt seo blog post prompt for music school\" width=\"855\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75808\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/chatgpt-seo-blog-post-topic-prompt.jpg 855w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/chatgpt-seo-blog-post-topic-prompt-480x336.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 855px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>From here, the team can <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/local-keyword-research\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">do their own keyword research<\/a> to ensure their topic aligns with search intent.

The more information you can provide, the more tailored your response will be. One of the nice things about ChatGPT is that you can also continue the conversation to drill in further on specific points.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/chatgpt-seo-prompt-example-specific.jpg\" alt=\"chatgpt seo prompt example with specific directions\" width=\"936\" height=\"517\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75814\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/chatgpt-seo-prompt-example-specific.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/chatgpt-seo-prompt-example-specific-480x265.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Play around with the ChatGPT prompts until you find the level of information and data you need to get the output you&#8217;re looking for.<\/p>\n<h3>3.

Use ChatGPT as a creative tool<\/h3>\n<p>Instead of relying on ChatGPT solely as a content generator, approach it as a creative tool that helps you process your thoughts more efficiently.

Inject personal insights, experiences, and opinions<\/h3>\n<p>Adding your own voice to ChatGPT&#8217;s output is crucial to avoiding robotic and repetitive text that doesn&#8217;t reflect your individuality.
