I\u2019m often asked which makes the most sense to use and to be honest, it depends on your campaign structure.<\/p>\n<p>If all ad groups in the campaign are <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/29\/how-to-promote-a-product\">promoting the same product or service<\/a> and the image is relevant to all, then applying the images at the campaign level should suffice.<\/p>\n<p>If your ad groups advertise different products\/services and the images don\u2019t carry over well, then you\u2019re best setting them up at the ad group level.<\/p>\n<h2>Where can I get an image for ad extensions?<\/h2>\n<p>No matter which level of your account you apply them to, you first have to get image files uploaded into Google to be able to leverage them in your campaigns.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Upload from your computer<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The easiest way to get images in place for ad extensions is simply to upload an image from your computer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Website scan<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Just to the left of the Upload option in the editor, you\u2019ll see SCAN. If you navigate to that tab, Google prompts you to add in your website URL. Once you do that, it\u2019ll scan your website and pull in images for you to use for your ad extensions.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-image-extensions-scan-website-command.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"477\" alt=\"google ads image extension setup\u2014scan website option\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You can choose from the list of images they pull in, or you can use another feature I love.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Social images<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Just below the website scan, you may see a list of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/19\/social-media-for-small-business\">social profiles<\/a> that belong to you. When it scanned your site, Google also picked up your social profiles and worked on finding images from those platforms as well.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-image-extensions-url-scan-suggestions.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"277\" alt=\"google ads image extensions\u2014url scan suggestions feature\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Maybe your website isn\u2019t the prettiest and doesn\u2019t have lots of strong images on it, but if you\u2019ve been keeping up with your social channels, you can use those images for ad extensions in just the same way you use the ones from your site.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the Google Ads\u00a0image extension specs?<\/h2>\n<p>Dimensions for image extensions should be familiar to you if you do any sort of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/25\/social-shopping\">social advertising<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-image-extensions-size-quality.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" alt=\"google ads image extensions specs\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>I guarantee you that your design team will be really happy to hear they don\u2019t have to make lots of images with all sorts of crazy dimensions, unlike the Google Display Network banners.<\/p>\n<p>If you have <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/24\/design-facebook-ads-free\">top-performing social images<\/a>, just take out any of the logos or text overlays you have and use them as image ad extensions.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-image-extensions-image-selection.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"457\" alt=\"google ads image extension setup\u2014image selection window\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Another benefit is that Google lets you use the same images for one or both ratios if the image is suited to them and you can choose the portion of the image you want to use.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-image-extensions-ratio-level-performance.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"253\" alt=\"google ads image extensions placement ratios\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Each ad group and campaign is eligible to have up to 20 image ad extensions attached. Each ratio of an image you upload is counted as one. Even if you use the same image file for two different ratios, that will be counted as two\u00a0of the 20.<\/p>\n<h2>How can I view my image extension performance?<\/h2>\n<p>Once your image extensions have been for a while, you can see their performance at a ratio level within the ad extensions portion of the interface.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-image-extension-reporting.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"287\" alt=\"google ads image extension reporting by placement\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Just like when we went to add image extensions before, you just need to click on the Images card and it\u2019ll take you to a grid that shows whatever metrics you\u2019d like to see.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">To understand and improve performance for your entire account, use our Free Google Ads Performance Grader!<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>What happens when someone clicks an image extension?<\/h3>\n<p>You likely noticed that when we added images, there was no place to add any<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/23\/cool-landing-pages\"> landing page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Whenever someone clicks on an image extension, it\u2019s treated the same way as if they clicked on the main headline of the ad. They\u2019ll be driven to the ad level landing page, <strong>which is why it\u2019s important to align your image extensions with your campaign structure.<\/strong> If you deviate too much, you\u2019ll risk having a bad user experience when someone clicks on an image ad and can\u2019t find that image, product, or service on the landing page they\u2019re sent to.<\/p>\n<p>This same principle applies to being charged. If you\u2019re using a manual or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=I3X1iIMTx_Q\">enhanced<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=I3X1iIMTx_Q\"> bidding strategy<\/a>, you\u2019ll be charged the same cost per click that you would have paid on the headline click. For other bidding strategies, this will vary, but no matter what option you use, it\u2019ll all operate as if someone clicked on the main headline of the ad.<\/p>\n<h2>What are Google Ads image extension best practices?<\/h2>\n<p>Here are a couple of best practices I suggest employing when setting them up in your account:<\/p>\n<h3>Follow Google&#8217;s policy<\/h3>\n<p>The images you use must follow the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adspolicy\/answer\/10347108?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads image extension policies<\/a>. This means:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>No logo overlays<\/li>\n<li>No text overlays<\/li>\n<li>No GIFs<\/li>\n<li>No blurry or poorly cropped images<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-image-extension-allowed-vs-not-allowed.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"390\" alt=\"accepted vs not accepted image for google ad image extensions\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adspolicy\/answer\/10347108?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>So although you\u2019re <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/01\/brand-strategy\">really proud of your brand<\/a> and you\u2019d like to have some additional messaging in the images, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/23\/google-ads-disapprovals\">Google will disapprove them<\/a> if you use them.<\/p>\n<h3>Use multiple images<\/h3>\n<p>Since you\u2019re given up to 20 images, why not use as many different views as possible? Just like everything else in PPC, we never know what is going to work best. Test multiple images of the product at different angles, with different backgrounds, use some in-store and some lifestyle versions, etc. Mix and match and see what performs best.<\/p>\n<h3>Keep images simple<\/h3>\n<p>Image extensions will never show up in a large format on the page. Just like in the previews, they\u2019ll likely be a small square or rectangle off to the side of your ad. Choose images that have a single focal point and aren\u2019t \u201cnoisy\u201d so even someone giving them a quick scan can figure out what they are without having to work too hard.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-image-extension-example-carpet-cleaning.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"145\" alt=\"google ads image extension example\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Overall, image ad extensions aren\u2019t difficult to set up and they can be very impactful for your ads.
