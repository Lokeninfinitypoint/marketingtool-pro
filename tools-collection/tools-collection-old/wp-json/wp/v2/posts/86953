Most SMBs aren\u2019t investing in paid search<\/h3>\n<p>According to the report, only 40% of SMBs are investing in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/search-advertising\">search advertising<\/a>, which means the majority of small businesses are not running ads on top search engines like Google and Bing.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/marketing-trends-report-2025-current-marketing-channels.webp\" alt=\"marketing channels smbs are investing in according to localiq 2025 marketing trends report\" width=\"1501\" height=\"1594\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86955\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/marketing-trends-report-2025-current-marketing-channels.webp 1501w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/marketing-trends-report-2025-current-marketing-channels-1280x1359.webp 1280w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/marketing-trends-report-2025-current-marketing-channels-980x1041.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/marketing-trends-report-2025-current-marketing-channels-480x510.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1501px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Plus, only 39% of SMBs are investing in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/seo\">SEO<\/a>. This means that small businesses are largely missing out on the opportunity to capture high-intent, local searchers.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\ude80 <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/first-page-of-google?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_10WaysFirstPageGoogle_Download\">10 Tangible &amp; Free Ways to Get on the First Page of Google<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>2. Less than half of SMBs are investing in social ads<\/h3>\n<p>We were surprised to find that less than half of small businesses are investing in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/social-ads-101\">social media ads<\/a> on platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, and more.<\/p>\n<p>These platforms are important because customers spend so much time on social media and are increasingly relying on them to discover new businesses. In fact, TikTok is now the <a href=\"https:\/\/digitalmarketinginstitute.com\/blog\/is-tiktok-a-search-engine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fourth most popular search engine<\/a>, with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/do-gen-z-use-tiktok-search-more-than-google-thomas-haynes-idnye\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one in 10<\/a> Gen Zers more likely to use it than Google.<\/p>\n<p>By not running ads on popular social media sites, SMBs are missing out on ways to engage and convert customers where they\u2019re spending (a lot!) of time online.<\/p>\n<h3>3. But SMBs running paid search are satisfied with results<\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to how satisfied small businesses are with their marketing investments, search advertising topped the list as the tactic they are most satisfied with.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-channels-satisfaction.webp\" alt=\"how satisfied smbs are with their marketing channel investments according to localiq 2025 marketing trends report\" width=\"1501\" height=\"1399\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86956\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-channels-satisfaction.webp 1501w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-channels-satisfaction-1280x1193.webp 1280w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-channels-satisfaction-980x913.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-channels-satisfaction-480x447.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1501px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This makes sense to us! It\u2019s pretty easy to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-reports\">measure results for search advertising<\/a> compared to tactics like reputation management or social media marketing, so this could definitely be a factor. But we also know that search ads are effective for small businesses at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/17\/website-visibility\">driving website visits and conversions<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 <strong>How are your Google Ads <em>really<\/em> performing?<\/strong> Find out with a free, instant audit &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>4. SMBs are also not taking advantage of low-cost online presence strategies<\/h3>\n<p>Back to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/26\/marketing-channels\">marketing channels<\/a> and tactics SMBs are investing in\u2014we would be remiss if we didn\u2019t mention the lack of investment in strategies like reputation management, listings, and website chat.<\/p>\n<p>These strategies contribute to a strong web presence\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/03\/01\/business-directory-listings\">listings and reputation management<\/a> can help you capture and draw in potential customers on search engines and map apps while chat can help you capture website leads and convert them quicker.<\/p>\n<p>Many listings, reputation management, and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/chat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">website chat tools<\/a> or strategies are also fairly low-cost, making them a strong fit for small businesses.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Facebook is the most popular social platform SMBs are using for marketing<\/h3>\n<p>Facebook is not only the most popular social media platform for users\u2014it was also the most popular social platform for SMBs to use for marketing.<\/p>\n<p>Of those businesses investing in social media marketing or social ads, nearly 80% were doing so on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/02\/facebook-marketing-for-small-business\">Facebook<\/a>, followed by Instagram and LinkedIn.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/marketing-trends-report-2025-social-media-channels.webp\" alt=\"social media channels small businesses are investing in according to localiq 2025 marketing trends report\" width=\"1501\" height=\"1423\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86957\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/marketing-trends-report-2025-social-media-channels.webp 1501w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/marketing-trends-report-2025-social-media-channels-1280x1213.webp 1280w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/marketing-trends-report-2025-social-media-channels-980x929.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/marketing-trends-report-2025-social-media-channels-480x455.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1501px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>6. Smaller businesses have small budgets (unsurprisingly)<\/h3>\n<p>Okay\u2026duh? But understanding the typical <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-budget\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing budget<\/a> for your SMB competitors is really handy. LocaliQ found that only 5% of SMBs had no budget and 38% had monthly budgets under $2,500.<\/p>\n<p>And because the report was able to break down marketing budgets by business size, we were able to see a clear correlation between business size and budget. Which, again, isn\u2019t necessarily a surprise, but it should be validating to small businesses who are doing so much with not a lot.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-budget-breakdown.webp\" alt=\"monthly marketing budget breakdown for smbs according to localiq 2025 marketing trends report\" width=\"1501\" height=\"1749\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86958\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-budget-breakdown.webp 1501w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-budget-breakdown-1280x1491.webp 1280w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-budget-breakdown-980x1142.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-budget-breakdown-480x559.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1501px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This just shows the importance of adopting those <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-marketing-strategies\">low-cost strategies<\/a> we mentioned earlier and take advantage of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/12\/marketing-ideas\">creative marketing ideas<\/a> to get in front of potential customers.<\/p>\n<p>We have some you may like here:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/09\/free-and-low-budget-marketing-ideas\">27 Free &amp; Low-Budget Marketing Ideas for Any Business<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/15\/local-marketing-ideas\">42 Powerful Local Marketing Ideas That Work (+Examples!)<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/free-marketing-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10 Free &amp; Creative Marketing Ideas for Small Businesses<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>7. They&#8217;re also less likely to have dedicated marketing support<\/h3>\n<p>The smaller the business, the less likely they are to have staff dedicated to marketing. Which does make trying any new or additional marketing strategies a challenge\u2014those often take some kind of time commitment.<\/p>\n<p>But, the report also found that many SMBs aren\u2019t taking advantage of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wordstream-graders\">free tools<\/a> that could simplify some of these strategies for businesses strapped for time and resources.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Most SMBs are already using AI<\/h3>\n<p>Even though our team has been dabbling in AI, and our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/category\/artificial-intelligence\">AI-related articles<\/a> tend to be popular, we weren&#8217;t sure how much smaller businesses have embraced this new tech. But nearly 60% of SMBs are using AI for some part of their marketing! Most are using it to save time on activities like content creation, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-for-social-media\">social media management<\/a>, and more.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/marketing-trends-report-2025-ai-use-for-smbs.webp\" alt=\"percentage of small businesses using ai and how and why they use it according to localiq 2025 marketing trends report\" width=\"1501\" height=\"1392\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-86959\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/marketing-trends-report-2025-ai-use-for-smbs.webp 1501w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/marketing-trends-report-2025-ai-use-for-smbs-1280x1187.webp 1280w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/marketing-trends-report-2025-ai-use-for-smbs-980x909.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/marketing-trends-report-2025-ai-use-for-smbs-480x445.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1501px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>9.
