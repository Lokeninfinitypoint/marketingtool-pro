Product Attributes<\/h2>\n<p>Product attributes are one of the first places to look for scarcity in action.<\/p>\n<p>For example, notice how that third pair of boots stands out because of the temporary price break.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"8b0ac2f1-6be1-4942-95ed-2ae8ce9629dc\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/create-urgency-price-break.png\" alt=\"using product attributes to create urgency\" width=\"957\" height=\"840\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Now let\u2019s book a vacation.<\/p>\n<p>You pull up <a href=\"http:\/\/expedia.com\/\">Expedia<\/a>, punch in a city and some travel dates, and hit enter. What you\u2019re met with is a completely commoditized shopping experience. Hotels and vacations and flights are lined up like a cattle call. And you just scan the prices to determine which hotel looks good.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is that most people are just looking. There\u2019s no urgency. So people bounce without booking <a href=\"http:\/\/www.salecycle.com\/the-reasons-for-booking-abandonment\/\"><em>81% of the time<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"64ab5b84-1a6a-43dc-a96b-7e930a0f3333\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/why-customers-abandon-booking-process.png\" alt=\"purchase abandonment\" width=\"779\" height=\"681\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>How do you motivate them to take action?

There\u2019s star ratings. A little VIP icon. Microcopy from reviews like \u201cVery good!\u201d and \u201cExcellent!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s also red (danger!) text letting us know exactly how many other people are looking at booking these hotels (taking them from us!) in the last 48 hours.<\/p>\n<p>Not to mention, the little yellow notification over on the right that confirms this destination is popular with other travelers as well.<\/p>\n<p>Phew. That was exhausting just typing it all out.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ll analyze some of these specific techniques in more detail soon. However, just know that scarcity doesn\u2019t just mean \u201conly three products left.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>2. Hyper-Specific CTA\u2019s<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/thenextweb.com\/\">The Next Web<\/a> wanted to get more traffic to their deal pages. (\u2018Cause, you know, this is where the money\u2019s made.)<\/p>\n<p>The primary CTA (or call to action) on the site was a little text link in the main menu navigation. They tested two new versions of the CTA to 163,000+ visitors:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The first variation was simply \u201cDeals\u201d<\/li>\n<li>The second variation stated a specific number of deals (like \u201c104 Deals\u201d)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"0b08fa2c-07eb-42a8-9c0d-551357fbfc16\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/testing-cta-variations-for-urgency.png\" alt=\"urgent call to action\" width=\"961\" height=\"572\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The results?<\/p>\n<p><strong>The variation with a specific number of deals increased user engagement by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behave.org\/case-study\/specificity-affect-user-engagement\/\">257.8%<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The specificity, it was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.behave.org\/case-study\/specificity-affect-user-engagement\/\">hypothesized<\/a>, \u201cset visitors\u2019 expectations, thereby increasing the amount of traffic that would engage with the \u2018Deals\u2019 CTA in the navigation bar.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4358140\/overcome-fomo\/\">FOMO<\/a> was part of it. Just the simple inclusion of a number suddenly makes people realize what\u2019s in store, and they now understand the \u201clost value by not taking the action you want them to take.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>3. Site Overlays<\/h2>\n<p>They can be annoying. Even rude.<\/p>\n<p>But when you consider the alternatives for driving conversions, you quickly realize that options are running out.<\/p>\n<p>Nobody looks at banner ads today. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adotas.com\/2013\/03\/study-86-of-consumers-suffer-from-banner-blindness\">Haven\u2019t for years<\/a>.
