This marks a sizeable jump; only 25% of respondents reported using a percentage of spend model last year.<\/p>\n<p>In step with last year, 11% of agencies charge for paid search with billable hours. The percentage using an alternative model has fallen from 12% to 5% year-over-year. Ostensibly, many of those who used an alternative model in 2018 have made the switch to percentage of spend.<\/p>\n<p>The chief advantage of the percentage of ad spend model is that your revenue automatically jumps as soon as your client boosts their monthly budget. The big downside, though, is that some clients will change their budget every month\u2014thus forcing you to deal with some volatility in your revenue.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">2.

This year, that figure is down to one out of every seven.<\/p>\n<p>As was the case last year, nearly two-thirds of agencies charge their clients extra for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/05\/cro-toolkit\">landing page creation<\/a>. This makes sense, given the creative resources required to build visually appealing landing pages.<\/p>\n<p>Email marketing, display creative, and campaign creation are also commonly offered for additional fees.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">4.

Just like last year, we find that roughly two-thirds of agencies charge setup fees when onboarding new clients. We recommend doing so, as bringing on a new client requires learning more about their business, their goals, and their industry.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">5. How much does your agency charge for a setup fee?<\/h2>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5d6b3196-6cc6-4f85-a1d2-1d70e076a610\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/state-of-the-agency-set-up-fee.png\" alt=\"state-of-the-agency-set-up-fee-amount\" width=\"800\" height=\"557\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Among those agencies that <em>do<\/em> charge a setup fee, 58% charge less than $1,000. 25% charge between $1,000 and $2,499, and 9% charge over $2,500.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">6. Does your agency offer any of the following services?<\/h2>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"88b1bc33-85a0-4cf2-8ad6-cb41a4d2201b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/state-of-the-agency-additional-services-1.png\" alt=\"state-of-the-agency-other-services\" width=\"800\" height=\"537\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As far as offering services outside of paid search goes, we observe similar results for SEO, content creation, social marketing, email marketing, and creative services.<\/p>\n<p>But we find some substantial changes, too. Last year, 77% of agencies reported offering website development to their clients; this year, that figure is 85%. Plus, the percentage of agencies offering display marketing has fallen from 78% to 68% year-over-year.<\/p>\n<p>Considering <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/29\/ux-conversion-rates\">the importance of site optimization and user experience<\/a>, it\u2019s not surprising that more and more agencies are offering to take care of this for their clients. At the same time, as Google continues to improve <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/23\/responsive-display-ads\">Responsive Display Ads<\/a>, display advertising becomes more accessible to small business owners.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">7. Does your agency have employees dedicated to paid search full-time?<\/h2>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"cf05e7d2-13e9-4ac6-82d9-60c3988ff09e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/state-of-the-agency-full-time-ppc-employees.png\" alt=\"state-of-the-agency-full-timers\" width=\"800\" height=\"541\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The responses to this question are some of the most telling so far. Last year, 38% of agencies reported having one full-time paid search employee, and 28% reported having between two and five full-time paid search employees.<\/p>\n<p>This year, only 29% report a full-timer, and only 22% report between two and five full-timers. Correspondingly, whereas 31% reported having no full-time paid search employees in 2018, that figure is now 45%.<\/p>\n<p>This doesn\u2019t mean that paid search is any less important than it used to be, of course. We can attribute the decline in full-time paid search specialists to the demand for agency employees who can wear multiple marketing hats.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">8. Approximately what percentage of time does your agency spend on paid search?<\/h2>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c3534e9e-4056-451c-b61c-b60baa2ccc7a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/state-of-the-agency-time-spent-on-ppc.png\" alt=\"state-of-the-agency-time-spent-on-paid-search\" width=\"800\" height=\"547\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Compared to 48% last year, 57% of agencies say they spend less than 25% of their time on paid search\u2014presumably because they\u2019re busy with all the other stuff they do for their clients.<\/p>\n<p>It appears that, over the past year, a good number of agencies have moved from the 25-50% bucket to the less than 25% bucket.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">9.

On a more interesting note, it appears that agencies have become <em>less<\/em> dependent on upsells and <em>more<\/em> dependent on content and digital marketing. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/30\/cross-selling-upselling\">Upsells<\/a> are still slightly more common, but the gap between the two sources has closed considerably in the past year.<\/p>\n<p>Content isn\u2019t just a tool for client <em>acquisition<\/em>, though; it\u2019s a tool for client <em>education<\/em> as well.

Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, and Bing are also popular advertising platforms, and we expect to find them becoming even <em>more<\/em> popular in the coming year.<\/p>\n<p>Because <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/25\/quora-ads\">Quora Ads<\/a> is still in its infancy and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/11\/amazon-advertising\">Amazon advertising<\/a> is limited to ecommerce businesses, their low representation among agencies isn\u2019t too surprising.

Consistently, the hardship at the core of running an agency is balancing the need to drive results for <em>current<\/em> clients with the need to identify and pitch <em>prospective<\/em> clients.<\/p>\n<p>As was the case last year, the only other major concern among agencies is time management. In fact, whereas only 23% of agencies reported this as their biggest challenge in 2018, 31% have reported it this year.
