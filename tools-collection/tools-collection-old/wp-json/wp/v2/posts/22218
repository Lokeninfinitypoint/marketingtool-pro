That means those visitors are more likely to come back for more, and more likely to convert.

Barring that, make sure to use it in the post somewhere, in a heading, or at least in the meta description, so users searching for that exact question will clearly see that your content provides a relevant answer.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Check the search volume on the keyword<\/strong> &#8211; Use a keyword tool (like Keyword Planner, KWFinder, or our own <a href=\"\/keywords\">Free Keywod Tool<\/a>) to see if your question has decent search volume. If the full question doesn&#8217;t show a lot of searches, and it may not, try to align the question with a shorter phrase with very similar <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/26\/intent-marketing\">intent<\/a>. For example, &#8220;how much do facebook ads cost&#8221; has a lower monthly search volume than &#8220;facebook ads cost.&#8221; If you&#8217;ve got a site with a lot of domain authority, feel free to target high-volume keywords. If you&#8217;re a newer or smaller site, you might need to start with much less competitive, lower volume keywords.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Provide accurate, up-to-date, detailed answers to questions<\/strong> \u2013 Is this thing on? Did I already say that? I can\u2019t stress enough how important it is to provide the best answer to the question you\u2019re targeting if you want to rank. And keep your content up to date through frequent content audits and updates, or risk getting scooped when people target those same keywords with newer content. Consider implementing a \u201clast updated\u201d feature so people know your answers are still fresh and valuable.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/last-updated-feature-blog-post.png\" alt=\"last updated feature\" width=\"851\" height=\"338\" \/><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Try different content formats<\/strong> \u2013 Sometimes the best way to answer a question is with a video. (For example, all the results for the apparently popular keyword \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/#q=how+to+make+a+paper+gun+that+shoots\">how to make a paper gun that shoots<\/a>\u201d are videos.) Infographics or interactive data visualizations may be the best way to answer a question. You might need to provide a tool or an app. Don\u2019t feel limited to text-based articles and lists.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Include images and rich text formats <\/strong>\u2013 If the question implies that the user is looking for a visual or data or comparisons or a numbered list of steps (etc.) Google loves to include these directly in the featured snippet, so build those into your content. Make it as easy as possible for Google to feature your answer right there at the top of the SERP and you\u2019ll get awesome click-through. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/01\/content-marketing-images\">Keyword-optimize your images<\/a>, too.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-make-a-hat-keyword-content.png\" alt=\"google featured snippet seo\" width=\"658\" height=\"318\" \/><\/div>\n<p>That\u2019s it!
