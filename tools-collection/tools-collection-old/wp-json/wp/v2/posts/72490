That\u2019s where data sets like impression share, top impression rate, absolute top impression rate, and more can be a lifesaver.<\/p>\n<p>However, since impressions don\u2019t always equate to clicks or conversions, how important is impression share really to your overall account health?

Impression share is there to help you understand how much market share your ads control.<\/p>\n<p>While there are different types of impression share metrics that I\u2019ll get into shortly, there are a few core terms to know when discussing impression share:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Impression:<\/strong> When at least 50% of your ad is seen for at least one second.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Impression share:<\/strong> Percentage of potential impressions your ad campaign wins the Google Ads auction for.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Top impression rate:<\/strong> Percentage of how frequently your ad is above organic results (search campaigns only).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Absolute top impression rate: <\/strong>Percentage of how frequently your ad is the first ad on the page (search campaigns only).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Impression share lost to budget: <\/strong>Percentage of times your ad was not shown due to low budget, or in other words, your budget ran out too quickly or was not high enough to win the auction.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Impression share lost to rank: <\/strong>Percentage of times your ad was not shown due to low ad rank, or in other words, your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/19\/does-quality-score-still-matter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quality Score<\/a> wasn\u2019t high enough to win the auction.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"calculate\"><\/div>\n<h3>How do you calculate impression share?<\/h3>\n<p>Impression share is calculated based on the search volume for your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/keyword-research-for-ppc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PPC keywords<\/a>. Google takes into account all the times you<em> did<\/em> show and divides it by all the times you <em>could have<\/em> shown. Luckily, the platform does the work for us when it comes to calculating impression share.<\/p>\n<p>All you have to do is head to the campaign level of your account and add your impression share columns to see where your impression share and impression rates currently stand.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/google-ads-impression-share-columns.png\" alt=\"google ads impression share - custom columns screenshot \" width=\"899\" height=\"306\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-72496 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/google-ads-impression-share-columns.png 899w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/google-ads-impression-share-columns-480x163.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 899px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"types\"><\/div>\n<h3>Types of impression share<\/h3>\n<p>Impression share means different things depending on your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/05\/types-of-google-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">type of Google Ads campaign<\/a>. Let\u2019s review some notes for each of the campaign types that have impression share data available.<\/p>\n<p><strong>For Shopping campaigns<\/strong>, it\u2019s important to know that any reported impression share metrics are only taking into account Google search placements and not <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/16\/google-display-network-mistakes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Display Network (GDN)<\/a> or partner Shopping placements.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Display campaigns<\/strong> only have \u201cdisplay impression share\u201d metrics available. This makes sense as display ads don\u2019t show on the SERP. Display impression share is the same concept as search impression share, but for placements across the GDN.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Finally, for any travel and tourism businesses<\/strong>, hotel campaigns also have impression share metrics available. However, they are calculated a bit differently which Google breaks down <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/9244125\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>For the purpose of this post, I\u2019ll continue to evaluate the impact of impression share on standard search campaigns.<\/p>\n<div id=\"good\"><\/div>\n<h2>What is a good impression share?<\/h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, a common <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/09\/holiday-ppc-mistakes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PPC pitfall<\/a> is thinking that there\u2019s a black-and-white answer to anything involving Google Ads! While I wish there was a clear answer to what the standard <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/15\/google-ads-benchmarks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads benchmark<\/a> for impression share should be, every account is unique. So, depending on your competition, you might find that a lower or higher impression share is feasible for your business.<\/p>\n<p>At first glance, you might assume showing as much as possible to as many people as possible is the best impression share strategy. Instead, think of your impression share like a pool. Your targeting will determine how large or small your impression share pool is. The larger that pool, the more effort it will take to swim a full lap. You don\u2019t want to have to swim all the way to the bottom to find that one search that will convert for you.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/impression-share-pool.jpg\" alt=\"impression share pool graphic\" width=\"850\" height=\"478\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-72503 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/impression-share-pool.jpg 850w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/impression-share-pool-480x270.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 850px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>That said, you likely want to be showing more often than not. I\u2019ve typically found that an impression share of 60-80% is ideal and realistic for most businesses. As for absolute top impression rate, or being the very first ad on the page, this metric can be a bit harder to achieve. However, a business with a healthy search campaign might find its absolute top impression rate to be around 20%.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p>Not sure where your account stands in terms of key metrics like impression share?

Set your impression share goals<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll have to benchmark your current impression share metrics in order to track your progress. If you\u2019re not sure what impression share is realistic to shoot for, you won\u2019t know where to start when it comes to implementing the right impression share strategy.<\/p>\n<p>First, take note of all your current impression share metrics across your account. Next, <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-budget\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">evaluate your campaign budgets<\/a> to see if reaching a higher impression share percentage is feasible or not.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, for standard search and Shopping campaigns, advertisers may also want to look at the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/2579754?hl=en#:~:text=Auction%20insights%20data%20is%20available,for%20ad%20groups%20and%20campaigns.\">Auction Insights <\/a>report when setting impression share goals. Since Auction Insights show how you rank against competitors on the SERP, this report can help inspire your impression share goals.<\/p>\n<p>Looking at Auction Insights, your budget, and your current impression share and impression rates will help you get a better understanding of what\u2019s realistic for your business.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/google-ads-impression-share-auction-insights.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"936\" height=\"323\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-72497 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/google-ads-impression-share-auction-insights.png 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/google-ads-impression-share-auction-insights-480x166.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>2. Location, location, location<\/h3>\n<p>How do you make a higher impression share easier to achieve? You make your impression share pool smaller! A smaller location makes a higher impression share more feasible since you\u2019ll have fewer eligible users to show to depending on their physical location. This can be a great way for a local business to narrow in on audience members nearby with a higher likelihood of converting.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Refine your keyword list<\/h3>\n<p>Another way to tighten up your targeting so that you can increase youre impression share is to refine your keywords to only high-intent core terms. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/30\/commercial-intent-keywords\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Search intent<\/a> is critical when you\u2019re optimizing for a specific metric like impression share since you\u2019ll only want your ad to show when it matters most.<\/p>\n<p>When you focus on keywords with transactional intent rather than informational, you\u2019re narrowing your eligible impressions down to users who are further along in the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-the-buyers-journey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">buyer\u2019s journey<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/google-ads-impression-share-keyword-intent.jpg\" alt=\"google ads impression share - chart of keyword intent types\" width=\"782\" height=\"526\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-72499 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/google-ads-impression-share-keyword-intent.jpg 782w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/google-ads-impression-share-keyword-intent-480x323.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 782px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Blog_InContentTextLink_FKT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WordStream\u2019s Free Keyword Tool<\/a> can help you identify the best terms to maximize your impression share in seconds!<\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h3>4. Diversify your campaign types<\/h3>\n<p>This Google Ads impression share tip should not come as a surprise considering the rise in popularity of campaign types beyond the typical standard search or display campaigns. When you\u2019re considering your impression share, you\u2019ll want to look at your account holistically. Try to incorporate a variety of campaign types to fill in the gaps your impression share rates can\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>Leveraging multiple different strategies, like video, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/11\/google-local-services-ads-tips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Local Services Ads<\/a>, and more, will help increase your business\u2019s overall performance on Google Ads.

Elevate your ad copy<\/h3>\n<p>While you do want to try a few different campaign types to maximize your impression share overall, you should also still focus on ad quality over quantity. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/03\/how-to-write-exceptional-ppc-ad-copy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A strong ad<\/a> will show higher up on the SERP\u2013increasing your top and absolute top impression rates as well as overall impression share.
