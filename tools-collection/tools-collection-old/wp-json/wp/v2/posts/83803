It\u2019s also about effectively communicating that performance to your clients in a way that educates them and relates to their business goals.<\/p>\n<p>This is what quarterly business reviews (QBRs) are for. And when conducted properly, they serve to reassure your clients, convey your value, and strengthen the overall relationship.<\/p>\n<p>Read on to learn how to conduct a QBR that not only impresses your clients but also keeps them satisfied, engaged, and eager to continue working with you.

It can be done in person or over a conference call, and it\u2019s accompanied by a visual presentation, usually a slide deck.<\/p>\n<div id=\"why-is-a-qbr-important\"><\/div>\n<h2>Why QBRs matter<\/h2>\n<p>Quarterly business reviews are paramount for ensuring mutual success for both your agency and clients. Here are a few reasons QBRs matter:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><\/strong><strong>Strategize.<\/strong> While <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/07\/ppc-reporting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">weekly and monthly PPC reporting<\/a> informs tactical decisions and catches issues or anomalies early, quarterly check-ins use broader data sets to inform the bigger strategy.<\/li>\n<li><strong><\/strong><strong>Showcase.<\/strong>QBRs are also an opportunity to demonstrate the value you bring to your clients\u2019 business, not just in terms of KPIs and revenue but also in the education you provide and how you compare to competitors.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Strengthen<\/strong>. Quarterly check-ins are the best way to demonstrate transparency and make sure you\u2019re aligned with their goals and expectations\u2014which is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/21\/build-client-relationships\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how you build lasting client relationships<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"what-does-a-qbr-review\"><\/div>\n<h2>What to review in a QBR<\/h2>\n<p>A quarterly business review is more than just a run-down of the numbers. As I said above, it\u2019s a <strong>comprehensive<\/strong> assessment of all of the aspects of your work with your client. Here are the key things to review in a thorough QBR:<\/p>\n<h3>Performance metrics<\/h3>\n<p>First and foremost, you\u2019ll want to do an overview of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/19\/ppc-metrics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PPC metrics<\/a>, including click-through rates (CTR), conversion rates, cost per click (CPC), cost per acquisition (CPA), return on ad spend (ROAS), and overall campaign performance.<\/p>\n<p>Because you\u2019re looking at a broader data set, you can identify patterns, surface any external factors or<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-trends-2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> industry trends<\/a>, and identify both areas of success and opportunities for improvement.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also a good idea to compare your performance to industry benchmarks.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-ads-benchmarks-2024.webp\" alt=\"google ads benchmarks - 2024 google ads averages chart of all metrics\" width=\"1098\" height=\"925\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82731 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-ads-benchmarks-2024.webp 1098w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-ads-benchmarks-2024-980x826.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-ads-benchmarks-2024-480x404.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1098px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udea8 <strong>What results can your clients expect from Google Ads?<\/strong> Download our latest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/google-ads-industry-benchmarks?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2024GoogleAdsBenchmarks_Download\">Google Ads Benchmarks<\/a> to find out!<\/p>\n<h3>Goals<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll also want to revisit the goals you established at the beginning of the quarter. Did you achieve them? Why or why not? Of course, ideally, you\u2019ll want to have achieved them but it\u2019s also okay if a few areas fell short. When <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/21\/how-to-run-google-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">running PPC campaigns<\/a> there will always be factors outside of your control, and not every campaign is going to run perfectly. What matters is that you\u2019re transparent and that you have clear explanations.<\/p>\n<p>You can then use this information to make adjustments to these goals or to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/15\/marketing-objectives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">objectives<\/a> that tie into them.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/quarterly-business-review-qbr-goals-examples.webp\" alt=\"qbr - example quarterly business review goals chart\" width=\"664\" height=\"415\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83806 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/quarterly-business-review-qbr-goals-examples.webp 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/quarterly-business-review-qbr-goals-examples-480x300.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve gone over the overall metrics and goals, it\u2019s time to dive into the individual campaigns.

Gather feedback and input from your client and iterate on the strategy accordingly to make sure it\u2019s aligned with their priorities and goals. This is also a good time to surface new trends, features, campaign types, and ideas that they may be interested in.<\/p>\n<h3>Feedback and Q&amp;A<\/h3>\n<p>You should invite feedback and questions after every slide during the QBR. But you should also have one final slide at the end for overall feedback and questions. The goal here is to make sure the client is satisfied not just with the deliverables and performance but with the overall service and customer experience. This is also a time for questions about the contract and any expectation setting.<\/p>\n<p>And once that is done, you will find yourself wrapping up a very productive, very rewarding quarterly business review with a very happy client! Nice work.<\/p>\n<div id=\"qbr-tips\"><\/div>\n<h2>Final tips for conducting great QBRs<\/h2>\n<p>Before we get to the template, here are some final tips for running a QBR that keeps your clients coming back:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Prepare: <\/strong>Preparation is key to conducting an effective QBR. Prior to the meeting, gather all relevant data including:<\/li>\n<li><strong>Communicate clearly:<\/strong> Provide easy-to-understand data, clear explanations, and invite questions after every slide. Don\u2019t be afraid to reveal mistakes and areas of improvement.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Share the deck afterward: <\/strong>Don\u2019t share the deck before the meeting. Use the meeting to walk them through it so they can get the information in the right context. Then, send it out after for their records and reference.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Keep it connected: <\/strong>Consider each QBR to be a chapter in the overall story with your client. Each one should connect back to the previous quarter\u2019s goals and look forward to the next quarter.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Make it a narrative: <\/strong>As I just mentioned above, this is a story. Present it that way, with your client as the hero of their own narrative, and you\u2019ll have an engaging QBR that leaves an impression.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"qbr-template\"><\/div>\n<h2>QBR
