For those of you unfamiliar, TRL (Total Request Live) was a live broadcast from MTV studio in Times Square, where the one and only Carson Daly would count down the 10 most popular music videos in the country. I was so impressed by the fact that Carson and his guests were able to appear so calm, cool, and collected on LIVE television!<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trl-compressed.jpg\" alt=\"facebook live guide\" width=\"620\" height=\"400\" \/><\/div>\n<p>No, this post is not about my long-time obsession with TRL, but rather a new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/27\/youtube-live\">live video trend <\/a>for marketers: <strong>Facebook Live<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Nowadays <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/27\/youtube-live\">live video<\/a> is popular not just for large broadcasting networks, but also for small businesses. With live video becoming a trendy (and effective!) tool for digital marketers, this guide will teach you <strong>everything you need to know<\/strong> to grow your audience with Facebook Live.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLWebBlogInContentTextLinkAllStarPlaybook.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_AllStarPlaybook_Download\"><em>Want help with your Facebook ads? Get our (free) All-Star Playbook to Online Advertising<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>What is Facebook Live?<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/live.fb.com\/about\/\">Facebook Live<\/a> is a live video streaming <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/02\/new-facebook-features\">feature on Facebook<\/a> that allows you to broadcast a live video out to your audience through your company page or personal profile. Facebook Live was released in April of 2016, and while many marketers are still getting their heads around it, the ones who are using it seem to be reaping the benefits.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-live-guide.png\" alt=\"how to use facebook live\" width=\"650\" height=\"325\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Once a Facebook Live video is created it will reside on your page or profile for viewers who missed the live event to view. Videos are eligible to show up in an individual&#8217;s news feed during the live event, as well as after the event has ended. Yet, the chances of seeing a video while it\u2019s live are now higher since Facebook has <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.fb.com\/news\/2016\/03\/news-feed-fyi-taking-into-account-live-video-when-ranking-feed\/\">updated their ranking algorithm<\/a> to show more live videos that are streaming in real-time.<\/p>\n<p>Businesses using Facebook live on their pages have the ability to customize and control their audience once it has ended. Page followers and visitors may get a notification when a page or individual is going live.<\/p>\n<h2>Why (and How) You Should Use Facebook Live<\/h2>\n<p>By now, you have likely heard <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/08\/video-marketing-statistics\">how effective video marketing is<\/a>, but did you know <strong>Facebook Live videos receive <\/strong><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.fb.com\/news\/2016\/03\/news-feed-fyi-taking-into-account-live-video-when-ranking-feed\/\">3X higher <\/a>engagement than<\/strong>\u00a0a video that is no longer live? <strong>Facebook Live videos also receive 5X more than standard photo posts<\/strong>, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adweek.com\/digital\/rob-mccarty-popshorts-guest-post-facebook-video-facebook-live\/\">AdWeek<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re trying to raise brand awareness, get more leads in the door, or increase interactions with your current customers, Facebook Live is a tool you should be using. Below are five ways you should be using Facebook Live in your marketing campaigns:<\/p>\n<h3>#1: To Connect with Your Audience in the Most Genuine, Human Way Possible<\/h3>\n<p>Do you ever feel like your audience sees you as a corporate, stuffy robot? Well, there couldn\u2019t be a better way to connect with your followers and potential customers than live video. It\u2019s essentially like meeting your customers in person, since the event is happening \u201cface to face\u201d and in real time. Facebook Live gives you a chance to show there are real, caring humans behind your business, which in turn builds trust and leads to more business in the door.<\/p>\n<h3>#2: To Answer Questions in Real Time<\/h3>\n<p>Interacting with your followers doesn\u2019t have to be limited to when you happen to be checking back in on your company Facebook page. Facebook Live allows you to answer your followers\u2019 questions in real-time. This gives you an opportunity to engage with viewers when they\u2019re most interested.<\/p>\n<p>The best strategy to do this effectively is to create a recurring series. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pg\/sephora\/videos\/\">Sephora <\/a>provides a great example with their \u201cScouted by Sephora\u201d series, where they share information around less well-known makeup products, and answer questions as they come up.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sephora-facebook-live-q-a-example.png\" alt=\"facebook live examples\" width=\"700\" height=\"276\" \/><\/div>\n<p>To nail this strategy, be consistent with the time and day of week you go live, feature hosts that aren\u2019t afraid to show off their personalities, and ensure you have someone at the ready to monitor questions so you can answer them either in real-time in the comments or in the actual broadcast itself.<\/p>\n<h3>#3: To Showcase an Event to People Who Couldn\u2019t Attend In Real Life<\/h3>\n<p>Facebook Live is a great way to broadcast events and connect with your customers or leads who weren\u2019t able to attend. Perhaps you have a guest speaker come into your office or your CEO is speaking at a local event. As long as you have a strong internet connection and the permissions to stream the event live, you should absolutely do it!<\/p>\n<p>A small marketing agency headquartered in Sarasota, FL does a great job at promoting and streaming their live events. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pg\/nextinymarketing\/videos\/\">Check out the post below<\/a> where they broadcasted a guest speaker from HubSpot to ensure those who weren\u2019t able to attend in person could still get value out of her workshop on email marketing.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-live-for-events.jpg\" alt=\"using facebook live for events\" width=\"800\" height=\"312\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>#4: To Share Industry-Related Updates<\/h3>\n<p>Keeping your audience informed on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/12\/marketing-benchmarks\">industry trends<\/a> without being overly sales-focused is a much more natural way to build trusted followers on Facebook. People will start turning to you as their go-to source to stay informed on industry news, and you\u2019ll build a loyal and engaged following.<\/p>\n<p>Take social media management tool <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pg\/hootsuite\/videos\/\">Hootsuite as a solid example<\/a>. Hootsuite started a series called #HootLive where they broadcast the latest social media news Live on their feed.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/hootsuite-facebook-live-example.jpg\" alt=\"hootsuite facebook live video\" width=\"800\" height=\"319\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Hootsuite\u2019s #HootLive series shows their audience that they care about keeping them informed and sharing their knowledge, while being able to engage and answer their questions in real time.<\/p>\n<h3>#5: To Show Off Your Company Culture<\/h3>\n<p>Facebook Live is the ideal opportunity to show off the unique personalities and values behind your company, whether it be strolling around the office and showing off your space, interviewing employees, or sharing a sneak peek into a company outing or event. Sharing your culture with your audience has so many long-term benefits whether it be for recruiting new hires, or getting new followers interested in your genuine brand.<\/p>\n<p>At Wistia, we\u2019ve found that sharing our culture with our audience has been one of the most beneficial ways to grow the business and build brand advocates. Below, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pg\/wistia\/videos\/\">how our social team is using Live Video<\/a> to give our audience a sneak peek behind one of our video shoots. The comments really say it all.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-live-company-culture-videos-1.jpg\" alt=\"company culture videos\" width=\"800\" height=\"316\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This strategy worked particularly well because it was not only showing off our culture, but it\u2019s also relevant to the product, and helps give video creators an inside look into how we do things at Wistia.<\/p>\n<h2>How Do I Get Started with Facebook Live?<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you\u2019ve got some inspiration, it\u2019s time to get the wheels turning with Facebook Live. The good news is that it\u2019s quite simple to create your first live video. All you need is a mobile device or desktop computer that has a solid camera or webcam and microphone.<\/p>\n<p>Here are 5 easy steps to get started:<\/p>\n<h3>Step #1: Select the \u201cLive Video Button\u201d<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re on a mobile device or going live from your Facebook profile rather than a Facebook company page, a small button will appear when drafting a post that says \u201cLive Video.\u201d Select it to get started!<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-start-facebook-live-video.jpg\" alt=\"facebook live how to\" width=\"516\" height=\"175\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If you\u2019re going live from a Facebook page on your desktop, you\u2019ll see a box that says \u201cLive Video\u201d below the post box, like the one below.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/start-a-live-video-on-facebook.jpg\" alt=\"facebook live tips\" width=\"503\" height=\"414\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Step #2: Write a Click-Worthy Description<\/h3>\n<p>Your description and video thumbnail are by the far the most important pieces of your video. Without compelling copy to entice your viewers, your live video isn\u2019t going to get much if any traction.<\/p>\n<p>When writing your copy, ensure it\u2019s direct, actionable, and informative, with a hint of mystery to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/10\/curiosity-gap\">spark curiosity<\/a> in your viewers.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-live-video-description-tips.jpg\" alt=\"facebook live video description\" width=\"353\" height=\"126\" \/><\/div>\n<p>For additional tips on writing click-worthy headlines, check out this post on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/17\/how-to-write-great-headlines\">9 Tips for Writing Great Headlines in 2017<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/great-clickable-headlines-facebook-live.jpg\" alt=\"great facebook copy\" width=\"838\" height=\"537\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Step #3: Get in Position &amp; Hit \u201cGo Live!\u201d<\/h3>\n<p>Put on your finest ball-gown, and style your hair! Or you can go the more casual, authentic route (recommended) like the image of me below working from my parents\u2019 dining room (I swear my hand is not that large in real life).<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/tips-for-using-facebook-live-for-brands.jpg\" alt=\"facebook live video for brands\" width=\"800\" height=\"421\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>PRO TIP<\/strong>: If you\u2019re filming a recurring series like the examples above from Hootsuite and Sephora, try to maintain an air of consistency. While you don\u2019t necessarily need to wear the same outfit in every episode, use the same \u201cset\u201d and set up your camera in the same place and distance away from the episode hosts in each post. It may also be worth looking into purchasing an external microphone to improve sound.<\/p>\n<h3>Step #4: Click \u201cFinish\u201d Once Your Post is Done<\/h3>\n<p>Be aware of where the \u201cfinish\u201d button is (at the bottom of the page) so you can give a proper sign-off.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-live-finish.jpg\" alt=\"guide to using facebook live\" width=\"191\" height=\"77\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Step #5: Post Your Live Video on Your Page &amp; Make Any Desired Edits<\/h3>\n<p>Once you\u2019re no longer live, your video can still live on for fashionably late viewers to enjoy. Share your video on your page, and make any edits you need to the description, thumbnail, add caption, etc.!<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/editing-facebook-live-videos.jpg\" alt=\"edit facebook live video\" width=\"212\" height=\"144\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>16 Facebook Live Best Practices<\/h2>\n<p>Aside from the obvious tips, like having a strong and dependable internet connection, you may be curious how else you can set your Facebook Live video on the path to video viewing success.<\/p>\n<p>Here are 16 easy tips to improve your Facebook Live video recording, leading to more eyes on your content.<\/p>\n<h3>#1: Face a Window!<\/h3>\n<p>Far too often I see these awful video recordings that are glaringly bright and hard to focus on because the star of the video has their back to a window, like the image below. Yikes!<\/p>\n<p>Facing a window will give you a beautiful source of natural light, and make you appear clear in your video frame. Just check out the difference in the before and after photos below.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-live-how-to-avoid-glare.jpg\" alt=\"helpful tips for live video\" width=\"576\" height=\"1024\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Video with my back to a window<\/em><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-live-face-a-window-tip.jpg\" alt=\"tips for great looking video\" width=\"576\" height=\"1024\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Video facing a window<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>PRO TIP<\/strong>: Remove your glasses when filming! They pick up additional glare, which can be distracting.<\/p>\n<h3>#2: Film Horizontally on Your Mobile Device<\/h3>\n<p>Mobile filmers have the natural urge to film vertically since this is just how you\u2019re used to using your phone, but flipping your phone to a horizontal view yields a much nicer sized video. Horizontal videos look better all around, especially when displayed on the news feed.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-live-tips-film-horizontally.jpg\" alt=\"how to get live video right\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>PRO TIP<\/strong>: On mobile, you can also use that little edit button in the top left hand corner to add a beautiful filter and enhance the frame even more.<\/p>\n<h3>#3: Create a Few Practice Videos on Your Profile Page<\/h3>\n<p>Before ripping the bandaid off and going live, you should test things out by creating a practice video restricted to your eyes only. You can do this by going to your own Facebook profile, and selecting \u201cOnly Me\u201d before recording.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-live-practice-videos.jpg\" alt=\"practicing for facebook live\" width=\"354\" height=\"588\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This will allow you to \u201cget loose\u201d and comfortable on the camera. It will also help ensure the lighting and sound are up to your standards. For example, I can tell from the post below that I did not take my own advice from tip #1.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-live-test-fail.jpg\" alt=\"facebook live help\" width=\"505\" height=\"407\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>#4: Get Personal<\/h3>\n<p>The beauty of Facebook Live is that it allows you to share your experiences in real time, and make a more human connection with your audience. Take this a step further by sharing some bits of your life to connect with your audience on a more personal level.<\/p>\n<p>No, you don\u2019t need to give away your social security number or dive into the details of your messy breakup, but share something positive from your life, like the example from Plated below.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/theplated\/videos\/1587277897963360\/\">In this Facebook Live plated video<\/a> Michelle, Plated\u2019s Test Kitchen Manager, cooked a special recipe with her dad for Father\u2019s Day.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/plated-facebook-live-example.jpg\" alt=\"facebook live best practices\" width=\"800\" height=\"313\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This is such a nice way of sharing a part of Michelle\u2019s world that a lot of her viewers can likely relate to, and seeing the connection between her and her father definitely evokes positive emotions from viewers.<\/p>\n<h3>#5: Smile, and Be Properly Caffeinated!<\/h3>\n<p>At Wistia, we film a LOT of videos in house, and one tip always provided by our video producers is to bring energy and speak with a smile. This is something critical to remember when filming Facebook Live videos because you only have one take once you\u2019re live!<\/p>\n<p>Listening to a monotone, unfriendly voice selling a product will put everyone in the audience to sleep. On the other hand, watching a video of an individual with an energetic and friendly demeanor will evoke positive feelings in your viewers and keep them hooked. Speak with a smile, wake up with some caffeine, and most importantly, be yourself.<\/p>\n<h3>#6: Embrace Small Mistakes<\/h3>\n<p>So you stuttered on a word multiple times? Or maybe you had one piece of hair that was sticking up the entire time? Perhaps you burnt a piece of toast on your Facebook Live cooking show?<\/p>\n<p>With live video, these mishaps are bound to happen, and these things are actually what makes live video so much fun. Rather than getting embarrassed and ending the video mid-way through, embrace your mishaps. Make fun of your hair, and laugh at the fact that you\u2019re a professional chef that always burns toast! This will add personality to your video, and also help your audience see that you\u2019re a real human, with flaws, just like them!<\/p>\n<h3>#7: Ask Your Viewers to Interact<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019re likely aware that posts with more likes, comments, shares, and views are prioritized on the news feed. Facebook\u2019s algorithms recognize popular content, and actually make it even more popular without the advertiser needing to pay extra for more eyes.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/please_dont_talk_to_me_button.jpg\" alt=\"don't talk to me\" width=\"512\" height=\"512\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Don\u2019t be like this<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Interaction on your videos also gives them a vote of authority, and provides new viewers with confidence that they\u2019re not wasting their time on snooze-worthy content. To gain more interaction encourage it from your viewers! During the broadcast ask questions, and then ask your viewers to reply in the comments. Ask them to like and share the post. Perhaps even run a live contest asking them to like, share and comment on the post to be entered into a free giveaway raffle.<\/p>\n<h3>#8: Have Someone Monitor Comments and Feed You Questions<\/h3>\n<p>With Facebook Live it can be hard to host your video and reply to comments at the same time, which is why you should have a colleague answering your comments in text form, and prompting you to answer the most relevant questions during the actual broadcast.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the most amazing opportunities Facebook Live offers is the ability to engage with your followers,\u201d says <a href=\"https:\/\/www.impactbnd.com\/blog\/facebook-live-business-examples\">Christine Austin from IMPACT<\/a>. \u201cWith reactions, comments, and viewer numbers shown in real-time, you can prompt responses by asking and answering questions in your broadcast.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>#9: Call Out Your Commenters by Name<\/h3>\n<p>When answering questions over your broadcast make sure you call out the user by their first name. This helps build even more of a connection, and will make them feel special that you chose to answer their question live.<\/p>\n<h3>#10: Give an Actionable Sign-Off<\/h3>\n<p>The worst thing you can do is just casually push the finish button and then walk away. Rather, give a proper sign-off with an actual ending for next steps.<\/p>\n<p>After the broadcast, what do you want your viewers to do? Subscribe to your live video channel? Visit your Facebook page for a discount code? Share the recording on their page? Whatever it may be, be sure to end your Facebook Live post with something actionable for your viewers to do.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/refinery29\/videos\/10155124412612922\/\">great sign-off example from Refinery29<\/a> where they restate their names, thank viewers for tuning in, and encourage them to check out their \u201cvery cool shoes\u201d using the link at the bottom of the video.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-live-cta.jpg\" alt=\"call to action on facebook live\" width=\"800\" height=\"316\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>#11: Upload a Custom Thumbnail<\/h3>\n<p>Your thumbnail image is the first, most prominent thing people will see after your video is live, so you need it to be compelling!<\/p>\n<p>Once your video appears on your page after recording, click \u201cedit video,\u201d and you\u2019ll see an icon (like the one below), which will allow you to upload a custom thumbnail image.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/custom-thumbnail-for-facebook-live.jpg\" alt=\"custom video thumbnail\" width=\"755\" height=\"365\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Typically, choosing a high-quality image of a person with minimal distractions is what will yield the best results to get late viewers to click play and tune into your Facebook Live recording. You can also upload an image with text overlay to give Facebook browsers an instant hint into what the video content is about before they tune in.<\/p>\n<h3>#12: Pin Your Post to the Top of Your News Feed<\/h3>\n<p>Similar to how you pin a tweet on Twitter, you can pin your live video to the top of your newsfeed to get more traction. Take advantage of this to ensure it\u2019s the first thing people see when visiting your page.<\/p>\n<h3>#13: Add Captions to Your Video<\/h3>\n<p>I don\u2019t know about you, but I often scroll through my Facebook news feed when loved ones around me are sleeping. Whether you&#8217;re around resting family members, in a loud setting like a bus or train stop, or just attempting not to disturb the people around you, viewing videos without sound is quite common nowadays. That\u2019s where captions come in.<\/p>\n<p>Not only that, but captions make your video more accessible to a larger audience. Make sure to add captions to your Facebook video by either generating them through Facebook or uploading your own SRT file.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/why-add-captions-to-facebook-live.jpg\" alt=\"live video captions\" width=\"766\" height=\"489\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>#14: If Your Video was a Real Hit, Make it the Featured Video<\/h3>\n<p>Changing the settings of your live video to a \u201cFeatured Video\u201d will allow it to appear front and center on your page, as well as your video page, driving even more eyes to it.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/featured-video-facebook-live.jpg\" width=\"201\" height=\"242\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>#15: Promote Your Video After the Fact<\/h3>\n<p>Once your video is done livestreaming you can boost your post and run an ad campaign just like on your other Facebook videos and posts. Take advantage of the audience and geo-targeting features to get your recorded live video in front of a larger but still relevant audience.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/boost-your-facebook-live.jpg\" alt=\"promotion for facebook live\" width=\"149\" height=\"46\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>#16: Analyze Your Masterpiece<\/h3>\n<p>After your video has been up for a few days, go into your \u201cInsights\u201d tab to gauge how your Facebook Live video performed.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-live-insights-analytics1.jpg\" alt=\"facebook live analysis\" width=\"522\" height=\"375\" \/><\/div>\n<p>There you\u2019ll be able to see all of the same metrics you can from pre-recorded videos like minutes viewed, unique viewers, video views, 10-second views, average % completed, number of reactions, comments, and shares. Facebook Live videos also provide metrics around peak live viewers, total views, average view time people reached, and demographics of who watched.<\/p>\n<p>Using these metrics will allow you to continue to perfect your Facebook Live video strategy going forward.<\/p>\n<p>This guide should get you on the right path to Facebook Live streaming success!
