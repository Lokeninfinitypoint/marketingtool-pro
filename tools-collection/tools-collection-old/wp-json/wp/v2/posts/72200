Introduction to the Search Generative Experience<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Google Marketing Live 2023 kicked off with the news that an AI-powered search experience, known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/19\/google-search-generative-experience\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Search Generative Experience<\/a> (SGE) will be coming soon to a SERP near you. Google covered this more extensively at Google I\/O but did provide an overview and walkthrough of its new Search Generative Experience, as well as where ads will show in this search experience and some of the future capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>This in-testing approach to search results will use machine learning to give users more personalized results based on the user\u2019s search journey and contextual clues.<\/p>\n<p>In the example below, Google SGE is assuming that the user\u2019s question, \u201cis it easy for them to learn surfing,\u201d likely means the user is looking for surfing lessons for their children based on previously-asked questions and searches within SGE.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/google-marketing-live-sge.jpg\" alt=\"google marketing live - screenshot of sge\" width=\"720\" height=\"511\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-72216 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/google-marketing-live-sge.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/google-marketing-live-sge-480x341.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Google SGE also prompts users to ask follow-up questions. This makes the search experience more like a conversation rather than inputting queries into a machine that spits back results.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/google-marketing-live-sge-follow-up-questions.jpg\" alt=\"google marketing live 2023 - follow up question example\" width=\"720\" height=\"533\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-72217 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/google-marketing-live-sge-follow-up-questions.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/google-marketing-live-sge-follow-up-questions-480x355.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>SGE could be beneficial to businesses since the typical SGE user will likely make multiple searches via follow-up questions\u2014creating opportunities for a business\u2019s website or ad to show for highly specific (and lower-funnel) queries. But there could also be some drawbacks, which we covered <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/19\/google-search-generative-experience\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"video\"><\/div>\n<h4><strong>2.

Video view campaigns combine ad formats including in-stream skippable ads, in-feed ads, and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-make-youtube-shorts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube Shorts<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This new campaign type is poised to help advertisers further connect with their audience since it&#8217;ll be seamless to create one video ad that fits various placements across YouTube.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/google-marketing-live-video-view-campaigns.jpg\" alt=\"google marketing live - video view campaigns\" width=\"936\" height=\"614\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-72231 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/google-marketing-live-video-view-campaigns.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/google-marketing-live-video-view-campaigns-480x315.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Google shared that early testing of this campaign format resulted in 40% more views than single-format video ads.

Demand Gen campaigns<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/22\/demand-gen-campaigns\">Demand Gen campaigns<\/a> were announced as a new campaign type designed for social marketers to reach customers on their most visually-focused channels, like YouTube, Discover, and Gmail.

For example, Google recommends assigning values to conversions, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/04\/17\/how-to-set-up-google-ads-enhanced-conversions\">setting up enhanced conversions<\/a>, and upgrading to Google Analytics 4 (GA4) to make the most of Demand Gen and Video view campaigns.<\/p>\n<div id=\"broadmatch\"><\/div>\n<h4><strong>4. Broad match brand controls<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Since campaigns like Performance Max default to broad match keywords for search, many advertisers felt that they were showing for (and competing against) other brands due to this less restrictive matching behavior.<\/p>\n<p>With broad match brand controls, you can restrict your campaign to only show for branded searches when they align with brands you specify.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/google-marketing-live-2023-brand-controls.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot from google marketing live 2023 presentation - broad match brand controls\" width=\"936\" height=\"554\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72206\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/google-marketing-live-2023-brand-controls.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/google-marketing-live-2023-brand-controls-480x284.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This update enables you to get additional reach for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/29\/succeed-with-google-ads-broad-match\">broad match<\/a> while ensuring that it matches all the relevant brand traffic for your business. This feature is currently available in beta.<\/p>\n<div id=\"pmax\"><\/div>\n<h4><strong>5. Performance Max high-value new customer acquisition goal<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Google added a new &#8220;customer acquisition&#8221; goal your Performance Max campaigns can optimize for. This update is focused on getting new customers who have a high lifetime value or customers who haven\u2019t been engaging with your brand recently. Using AI, you can have Google bid more for customers who match these segments. That way, you&#8217;ll only pay more when you show to a customer who is predicted to be of higher value to your business.<\/p>\n<p>Since Performance Max has both top and bottom-of-funnel capabilities, this can make a big difference to advertisers who feel some customers sourced from this campaign type are of higher quality than others.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/google-marketing-live-performance-max-acquisition.jpg\" alt=\"google marketing live - performance max customer acquisition\" width=\"936\" height=\"546\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-72228 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/google-marketing-live-performance-max-acquisition.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/google-marketing-live-performance-max-acquisition-480x280.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The goal is available in beta, so advertisers will have to contact their Google team directly to opt into this new feature.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Creative<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Here are the Google Marketing Live announcements that will impact advertisers&#8217; creative processes.<\/p>\n<div id=\"conversation\"><\/div>\n<h4><strong>6. Conversational experience in Google Ads<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>This update, which is planned to roll out in July, will allow advertisers to essentially have Google guide them through the campaign setup process. You provide your landing page URL and answer prompts along the way, and Google will create assets based on what you provide, including headlines, descriptions, <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/keyword-research-for-ppc\/\">keywords,<\/a> and more. The more information you provide, the more refined your ads will be, said Google.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/google-marketing-live-updates-conversational-experience.jpg\" alt=\"google marketing live - conversational experience screenshot\" width=\"850\" height=\"534\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-72220 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/google-marketing-live-updates-conversational-experience.jpg 850w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/google-marketing-live-updates-conversational-experience-480x302.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 850px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For example, Google will give you conversational prompts to improve your ads as you go. Additionally, you\u2019ll still have full control over what suggestions from Google you decide to keep or edit yourself.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/google-marketing-live-2023-conversational-experience-screenshot-1.jpg\" alt=\"google marketing live - conversational experience screenshot\" width=\"850\" height=\"528\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-72221 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/google-marketing-live-2023-conversational-experience-screenshot-1.jpg 850w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/google-marketing-live-2023-conversational-experience-screenshot-1-480x298.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 850px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This could be greatly beneficial to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/19\/google-ads-for-small-businesses\">businesses starting out in Google Ads<\/a>\u00a0since building out in the platform can be a daunting task.

Product Studio<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>For ecommerce and retail businesses, we saw the introduction of Product Studio as a promising new tool from Google Marketing Live 2023.
