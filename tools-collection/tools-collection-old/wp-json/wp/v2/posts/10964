It reads:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em><span lang=\"EN\">&#8220;Starting September 2020, the search terms report only includes terms that a significant number of users searched for, even if a term received a click. You may now see fewer terms in your report.&#8221;<\/span><\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>What this means is, you will no longer be able to use this report to see all of the search terms triggering your ads.

Not only has it taken measures to broaden match types across the board, but it is also now limiting your visibility into how you\u2019re spending your money.<\/p>\n<p>Advertisers will have to start using more exact match variations in order to ensure that they&#8217;re showing up for the most relevant queries possible\u2014unless they are comfortable spending quite a bit of money to get an idea of where to optimize from broad and phrase match.<\/p>\n<p>It all seems like a way for Google to make more money while reducing the advertiser\u2019s ability to optimize, not to mention relentlessly encouraging automated bidding.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>How to respond to the search term report changes: expert takes and recommendations<\/h2>\n<p>We know we can\u2019t stop Google from making these changes. And we know we can\u2019t just stop PPC. So this begs the question, what can we do to uphold PPC returns for our businesses and our clients? We reached out to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/mark-irvine-42\">Mark Irvine<\/a>, top PPC expert and Director of Paid Media at <a href=\"https:\/\/searchlabdigital.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SearchLab<\/a>, <span lang=\"EN\">who provided his take on the matter and some recommendations on how to proceed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>This is a loss for advertisers<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cOf the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/07\/google-search-statistics\">3.5+ billion<\/a> searches performed on Google every day, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/search\/our-latest-quality-improvements-search\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">15%<\/a> of those searches have never occurred before. That&#8217;s <em>1 billion<\/em> searches occurring for the first time on Google every day. A billion searches is certainly not insignificant, but if Google only reports back the search terms with a \u2018significant\u2019 number of users, this is the bare minimum amount of data we&#8217;re at risk of losing. Losing access to potentially more than 15% of the data advertisers rely on for optimizing their campaigns <em>is<\/em> significant, regardless of how you spin it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>But you should continue optimizing<\/h3>\n<p>However, Irvine also makes a great point that this should not stop you from continuing optimizations:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAdvertisers shouldn&#8217;t let this loss of data interfere with their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/14\/forgotten-adwords-best-practices\">best practices<\/a>. Even missing many of their unique search terms, the data Google will continue to share is the data that&#8217;ll help them make the most meaningful optimizations in their account. Adding one new negative keyword that prevents wasting 100 clicks on bad traffic is just as effective as adding 100 keywords that would waste 1 click each\u2014with a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/16\/spend-less-time-in-google-ads\"> fraction of the work<\/a>. And too many advertisers aren&#8217;t taking those steps today on a regular basis\u2014so don&#8217;t let the loss of some of your data prevent you from still working with what you still have, particularly if what you have is the most valuable data.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p-small\"><strong>Don&#8217;t let the loss of some of your data prevent you from still working with what you still have, particularly if what you have is the most valuable data.<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h3>Review your Bing search query report<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Irvine then goes on to provide recommendations for older accounts and more seasoned PPC managers who will be hard hit by this change. For starters, try Microsoft Advertising tools:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">\u201cBoth Google and Bing share similar search trends and your search campaigns will map out to new search terms in Bing. By regularly reviewing your search queries in Microsoft Advertising, you can optimize your Bing search campaigns while also finding new traffic that the search query report on Google is no longer showing you. From <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/02\/14\/transfer-google-adwords-account-to-bing-ads\">Bing&#8217;s search query report<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">, you may easily be finding new keywords and negative keywords for Google as well.&#8221;<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google20ads20search20terms20report20bing20search20query20report.png\" alt=\"google ads search terms report bing search query report\" width=\"590\" height=\"465\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Launch Dynamic Search Ads to find new keywords<\/h3>\n<p>Irvine\u2019s next recommendation is to launch <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/01\/dynamic-search-ads\">Dynamic Search Ads<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDynamic search ads are great at targeting your ads based on the context of your landing pages and can ultimately help reach audiences for search terms that you didn&#8217;t cover with your keywords. Launching DSAs not only helps you cover your bases, but their search query reports can also help reveal where your traditional search campaigns have gaps in their keyword coverage.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google20ads20search20terms20report20dynamic20search20ads.png\" alt=\"google ads search terms report dynamic search ads\" width=\"800\" height=\"602\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">Dynamic Search Ads can help you identify keywords you may have missed.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Use Smart Bidding to optimize for &#8220;hidden&#8221; search terms<\/h3>\n<p>Even though we can\u2019t see the data now, Google will still be using it to inform its own <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/19\/google-ads-automated-bidding\">automated bidding<\/a> feature. Irvine points out that \u201cMuch like many other signals Google keeps out of the hands of advertisers (Browser, iOS, past search history, search partner engines, etc), if we want to optimize for that data, we&#8217;ll need to consider letting Google optimize for this traffic with smart bidding strategies, such as enhanced CPC or target CPA.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google20ads20search20terms20report20smart20bidding20target20CPA.png\" alt=\"google ads search terms report smart bidding target CPA\" width=\"600\" height=\"392\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Diversify your skillset<\/h3>\n<p>One final recommendation is that if you&#8217;ve been solely focused on search engine ads, this may be a good time to start learning other viable <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/17\/digital-marketing-skills\">digital marketing skills<\/a> for business growth.
