Every industry publication published the story, each adding their own spin on how it might impact online marketers. Then, individual SEMs jumped on the bandwagon and shared their predictions through social channels; some valid, others completely bonkers. By the end of the month, I felt like I was trapped in an enormous game of telephone. I\u2019d read tons of speculations, many of which were not rooted in actual data. Even worse, they were being repeated as gospel.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"b3da7549-141b-45ce-a43c-aa4be8ccd18e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/side-ads-change-telephone.jpg\" alt=\"game of telephone\" width=\"950\" height=\"534\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s no surprise that these rumors have sparked widespread panic within the marketing community. However, if there\u2019s one mantra that\u2019s been repeated by well-respected industry leaders (<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/siliconvallaeys?lang=en\">Fred Vallaeys<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/larrykim?lang=en\">Larry Kim<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/webmona?lang=en\">Mona Elesseily<\/a>, just to name a few) it\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t panic!\u201d Rather than continuing to speculate on the effects of the SERP switch-up, stay calm, continue to monitor, be reactive to your account performance, and keep an eye out for new data.<\/p>\n<p>Now that it\u2019s been a few weeks since the big shake-up, we\u2019re finally getting a clearer idea of how it\u2019s <em>really<\/em> impacting the search landscape. Here are <strong>five data-backed takeaways<\/strong> produced by industry experts:<\/p>\n<h2>#1. PLAs Continue to Kill It<\/h2>\n<p>Shortly after the SERP change, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/23\/google-kills-side-ads-more-data\">Mark Irvine reported<\/a> that Shopping Campaigns&#8217; click-through rates seemed to be benefitting tremendously from the switch-up. We assumed that this was because these were the only ads that were still eligible to appear on the right-hand side. However, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mp_ballard\">Mark Ballard<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/pronouncedahndy\">Andy Taylor<\/a> over at Merkle\/RKG recently published <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rimmkaufman.com\/blog\/googles-right-ads-removal-and-fourth-top-page-ad-deep-dive-data-two-weeks\/#.Vt7xuxiox9g.twitter\">new data<\/a> showing that PLAs are actually appearing at the top of the page more frequently than ever before!<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"e21887e9-c018-4a5b-bc42-982c7f0c6f0a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/side-ads-change-plas.png\" alt=\"pla share of desktop impressions by ad location graph\" width=\"623\" height=\"434\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>In addition, they found that PLA click share has increased, in comparison to text ads.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"87931906-8a36-4911-9293-2b3c6105502d\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/side-ads-change-plas-rkg.png\" alt=\"clicks by ad format\" width=\"626\" height=\"494\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Source: Merkle\/RKG<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:<\/strong> If you\u2019re an e-commerce advertiser, you should be taking advantage of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/04\/google-shopping-campaigns-tips-tricks\">Shopping Campaigns<\/a>. They were hot before, but they\u2019re only going to get hotter as performance elevates!<\/p>\n<h2>#2. Desktop Ad CPCs Remain Pretty Stable<\/h2>\n<p>Despite all of the hoopla claiming that this change would cause CPCs to skyrocket and completely obliterate everyone\u2019s PPC budgets, advertisers can rest assured that their budgets are safe and sound. Just days after the switch-up, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MarkIrvine89\">Mark Irvine<\/a> <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/23\/google-kills-side-ads-more-data\">reported<\/a> that \u201cCPCs hadn\u2019t changed\u2026yet\u201d and encouraged advertisers to keep an eye on changes occurring in their account over the next few weeks.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"75abd788-2dc2-404a-aa24-fa1e46c813c5\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/side-ads-change-cpcs.png\" alt=\"ad cpcs graph\" width=\"625\" height=\"492\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Source: Merkle\/RKG<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The guys over at Merkle\/RKG did just that and concluded that, thus far, desktop text ad CPCs have remained fairly consistent. In a recent <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rimmkaufman.com\/blog\/googles-right-ads-removal-and-fourth-top-page-ad-deep-dive-data-two-weeks\/#.Vt7xuxiox9g.twitter\">blogpost<\/a>, they explained that \u201csince the start of the year, we\u2019ve generally seen daily non-brand desktop text ad CPCs on Google.com run within about +\/-5% of their YTD average. Since early February, CPCs have been running a little higher than they were in late January, but nothing significant changed with the removal of RHS ads and the addition of the fourth top-of-page ad.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:<\/strong> Chill out\u2014you\u2019re not going to have to lay off staff or cancel the company Christmas party to pad your PPC budget. Rather than bumping up bids across the board, monitor key terms and adjust bids only if needed!<\/p>\n<h2>#3. Right Side Ads Weren\u2019t Anything Special Anyway<\/h2>\n<p>A few years ago, my boyfriend\u2019s dog attempted to eat one of my shoes. I was furious and whined for days that my \u201cbeloved shoe\u201d was completely destroyed. To be honest, I had completely forgotten about that pair of shoes\u2014they\u2019d been shoved under the bed for months\u2014and I never really liked them in the first place. It wasn\u2019t until I saw one dangling from the dog\u2019s mouth that I decided I missed them. In reality, I was only upset about the shoes because I felt as though they\u2019d been taken from me.<\/p>\n<p>The departure of the right hand ads had a similar effect on advertisers. We never loved them in the first place. In fact, we put a ton of emphasis on avoiding them and trying to land our ads in the top three positions. However, when side ads began disappearing, advertisers panicked and accused <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/09\/cord-cutters-youtube\">Google<\/a> of destroying their \u201cbeloved\u201d side ads.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c82eb43c-25b1-4f44-99ea-f32f04caa611\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/side-ads-change-seer.png\" alt=\"traffic from side ads graph\" width=\"472\" height=\"312\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Source: Seer Interactive<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Seer Interactive brought us back to reality when they <a href=\"http:\/\/www.seerinteractive.com\/blog\/google-removes-right-side-ads-vigilant-not-reactive\/\">posted a graph<\/a> of their clients\u2019 right-hand side ads\u2019 traffic in comparison to the traffic from their top ads. As you can see, barely any traffic (less than 7%) was coming from side ads anyway. We found similar results; less than 15% of our clients&#8217; ad clicks were coming from the side ads:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5f4f79fc-8390-47ba-80dd-e345be59192b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/top-vs-side-desktop-ad-clicks-1.png\" alt=\"top vs side ad clicks data\" width=\"822\" height=\"474\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:<\/strong> Stop mourning the death of the right rail! They weren\u2019t too special in the first place.<\/p>\n<h2>#4. You Won\u2019t See 4 Ad Blocks at the Top of Every SERP<\/h2>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dr_pete\">Dr. Pete<\/a> at Moz, the <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/four-ads-on-top-the-wait-is-over\">number of SERPs displaying four ads<\/a> at the top of the page is on the rise. In fact, it increased rather dramatically immediately after the initial release of the new layout.<\/p>\n<p>That said, as of 2\/22, there were still plenty of pages displaying one, two and three ads at the top of the page.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Pete pointed out that, although we\u2019re seeing these four-ad blocks appear more frequently than the two- and three-ad blocks, it\u2019s doubtful that Google will stick with one, universal format. It\u2019s known for constantly experimenting with different combos!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:<\/strong> Continue to keep an eye on trends with these ad packs. As Dr. Pete eloquently stated, \u201cthe situation is highly dynamic and will continue to change over time.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>#5. SEO Didn\u2019t Get Hit Nearly as Hard as We Anticipated<\/h2>\n<p>When this update was announced, many assumed it would result in a Mobilegeddon\/Panda-level disaster for the SEO community. Luckily, researchers have reported that it\u2019s been quite the opposite! In fact, just like it had a small impact on PPC, it also had a small impact on SEO.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7d36b9d9-6600-44bd-9012-a3e2852bf247\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/side-ads-change-organic.png\" alt=\"share of organic clicks\" width=\"627\" height=\"435\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Source: Merkle\/RKG<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The team over at Merkle\/RKG reported that their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rimmkaufman.com\/blog\/googles-right-ads-removal-and-fourth-top-page-ad-deep-dive-data-two-weeks\/#.Vt7xuxiox9g.twitter\">share of organic search visits have been completely stable<\/a> since the beginning of the year, despite the changes that Google made to the ad placement on the SERP.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"30cb5b8a-2604-4404-8812-b468f805dd29\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/side-ads-change-seo-perrose.jpg\" alt=\"organic ctrs graph\" width=\"1093\" height=\"746\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Don\u2019t speak French?

He also pointed out that these downward trends were probably impacted by additional factors, not solely the new ad layout, and encouraged SEOs to keep an eye on these trends, as they may change over time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:<\/strong> It\u2019s always best to couple your SEO efforts with paid search to mitigate impact from big updates, but this one is pretty minor so far.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"views-element-container contextual-region\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Wondering how the death of the right side ads will impact your account?
