important for businesses.<\/p>\n<h3>Helps with SEO<\/h3>\n<p>Citations play a crucial role in local <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/05\/seo-trends\">SEO<\/a> by communicating to search engines the legitimacy and prominence of your business in your area.<\/p>\n<p>For example, anyone could claim that they&#8217;ve been in business doing lawn care in a certain city for multiple years, but without proof, why should they be believed?<\/p>\n<p>By adding citations across the internet in the forms of listings and reviews, it convinces Google that you&#8217;re worthy of them ranking highly when someone in that area searches for their lawn care needs.<\/p>\n<p>Consistent and accurate information about your business across multiple sources establishes trust and credibility, improving your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/09\/google-ranking-factors\">search engine rankings<\/a> and visibility in the search that will drive traffic to your website.<\/p>\n<p>According to one study, citation signals account for <a href=\"https:\/\/whitespark.ca\/local-search-ranking-factors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">7%<\/a> of local search ranking factors.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/2023-local-search-ranking-factors.jpg\" alt=\"chart from whitespark

small businesses that want to show up in local search results and attract more customers must ensure they have accurate and consistent citations. It&#8217;s worth the effort.<\/p>\n<h3>Build trust with prospective customers<\/h3>\n<p>Accurate and consistent citations can also help build trust with potential customers, increase your credibility, and establish your business as an authority in your industry.<\/p>\n<p>People trust reviews as much as they trust personal recommendations.

Similarly, if you built local citations on community news sites, you can reach more customers who are using those sites as a resource for finding new businesses.<\/p>\n<p>By identifying the right local citations for your business, you can increase your chances of getting found in more places online by your potential customers.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\ud83d\udcda Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite10WaysFirstPageGoogle.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_10WaysFirstPageGoogle_Download\">10 Tangible &amp; Free Ways to Get on the First Page of Google<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<div id=\"types\"><\/div>\n<h2>Types of local SEO citations<\/h2>\n<p>Local citations can be classified into two main categories: <strong>structured<\/strong> and <strong>unstructured<\/strong> citations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Both types of citations can help improve your local search rankings, but they differ in terms of their format and where they appear online.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>Structured citations<\/h3>\n<p>Structured citations follow a specific format and are found on websites like local directories and review sites.

Use local directories and niche sites<\/h3>\n<p>As mentioned previously, adding your small business to local directories and niche sites is a smart strategy for boosting your online presence and gaining more visibility in local search results.<\/p>\n<p>Local citations are key to search engine algorithms that determine which businesses to display to users when they search for products or services online. By listing your business in these directories, you increase the likelihood of being ranked highly by Google, and thus, found by potential customers.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some prominent local directories and niche sites that you can utilize to build local citations:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.yelp.com\/businesses\/how-to-add-a-business-to-yelp\/\">Yelp<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.yellowpages.com\/en\/?from=advertise-with-us-YP\">Yellow Pages<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/pro.angi.com\/\">Angi<\/a> (formerly Angie\u2019s List)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tripadvisor.com\/CreateListing.html\">TripAdvisor<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The most important thing when creating your listings on these directories is to ensure that your business information is accurate, up-to-date, and consistent, including your business name, address, phone number, website URL, and operating hours.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/local-citations-yelp-listings.jpg\" alt=\"two yelp listings with filled in information\" width=\"743\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-71140\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/local-citations-yelp-listings.jpg 743w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/local-citations-yelp-listings-480x388.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 743px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you change your phone number later down the line, be sure to update it across all of your citations as well. Consistency is crucial to avoid any confusion for both your customers and search engines alike.<\/p>\n<p>If Google detects different ways to find you, they might decide to not display you at all to prevent a bad experience for their users.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the well-known directories mentioned, there may be industry-specific directories that cater to your business&#8217;s particular niche or geographic area.<\/p>\n<p>These sites may have a more targeted audience and can be particularly useful for small businesses with a niche market or service. For example, healthcare businesses will want to be listed on sites like HealthGrades, Vitals, RateMDs, and more.<\/p>\n<p>A few minutes of online search should reveal a few ideas for sites that you could use to build your local citations. You can use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/06\/listings-management-tools\">listings management tools<\/a> to help with this.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Utilize data aggregators<\/h3>\n<p>Data aggregators are websites that collect and distribute business information to various directories and search engines on your behalf.<\/p>\n<p>This centralizes business data and makes it easier for search engines to display accurate information about your business, which can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/12\/get-more-customers\">attract more customers<\/a> and improve your online visibility.<\/p>\n<p>According to HubSpot,<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/local-seo\"> the most popular data aggregators<\/a> for local businesses to submit their information to for local SEO in 2023 are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/local-listings.data-axle.com\/search\">Data Axle<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.neustarlocaleze.biz\/directory\/us\/\">Neustar Localeze<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/business.foursquare.com\/\">Foursquare<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.localvisibilitysystem.com\/2013\/09\/24\/how-to-add-your-business-to-factual\/\">Factual<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Note that there are plenty of other data aggregators out there. Some may require payment to list your business, while others offer free listings. It&#8217;s important to research each option and choose the ones that fit your budget and business goals.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Monitor and update your local citations<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s not enough to simply through your citations up and call it a day. It is essential to monitor and update your citations regularly once they exist.<\/p>\n<p>Inconsistent or inaccurate citations can not only create a bad user experience but harm your local search rankings as well.<\/p>\n<p>To help you keep your citations up-to-date, consider using a citation tracking tool.<\/p>\n<p>There are many tools available, such as<a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/local-seo-tools\"> Moz Local<\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/local-seo-tools\/auditing\/citation-tracker\/\"> BrightLocal<\/a>, and<a href=\"https:\/\/whitespark.ca\/\"> Whitespark<\/a> that can help you monitor your citations across different directories and sites and fix errors promptly.
