Why?<\/p>\n<p>People like email because they have more control with email than, say, social media. They can opt in and opt out easily (versus having to figure out settings on each social media platform; or deal with ads), they can choose whether to open an email or not (as opposed to social media where, if you don\u2019t care for a post, you still have to scroll past it), and they can delete emails they don\u2019t like.<\/p>\n<p>And marketers like email because\u2026well\u2026people check their email! When they wake up. When in line. On the bus. At work. For work. Email marketing gives you the ability to reach audience members who want to be reached, to be creative, to keep current customers up to date on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/13\/sales-promotion-examples\">deals and promotions<\/a>, products, and news, and to\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/04\/nurture-marketing\">nurture leads<\/a>\u00a0into paying customers.<\/p>\n<p>P.S.

For instance \u201cs\u201d may strike a ssslithering or sssecret feel. So keep this in mind in relation to your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/12\/23\/humanize-brand\">brand personality<\/a>.
