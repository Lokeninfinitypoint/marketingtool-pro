What may be less well known, however, is how to use it to your advantage by growing your following and creating high-quality content.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, I\u2019ll explore 10 tips for getting more likes on TikTok. I\u2019ll start with the basics \u2013 creating videos that are attention-grabbing and using hashtags to reach a wider audience \u2013 and move on to some more creative methods, such as staying up to date on the latest trends and leaving your viewers with a cliffhanger.<\/p>\n<h2>How to get more likes on TikTok<\/h2>\n<p>Use these 10 tips to improve your reach and relevance on TikTok to the people most likely to like your videos.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Hook your viewers in the first 2-3 seconds<\/h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to get more likes on TikTok, one of the best things you can do is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/11\/14\/facebook-video-ad\">create compelling videos with a hook<\/a>. In other words, make videos that are so eye-catching and engaging (especially for the first 2-3 seconds) that viewers can&#8217;t help but stop and watch.<\/p>\n<p>There are a number of ways to do this: Use colorful visuals, tell a compelling story, incorporate humor, and\u00a0ensure that your videos are well-edited and polished before you post them. Another idea? Add a \u201cjust wait for it\u201d text like the example below.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok-wait-for-it.jpg\" alt=\"how to get more likes on tiktok - screenshot of a &quot;wait for it&quot; video\" width=\"300\" height=\"551\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61935\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok-wait-for-it.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok-wait-for-it-163x300.jpg 163w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Or show the last clip of your video at the beginning so that you show the finished product first. This works well for food or DIY videos because you\u2019re able to intrigue people with the finished product and then they\u2019ll be much more likely to stick around and see how it\u2019s done.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok-food.jpg\" alt=\"how to get more likes on tiktok - screenshot of food video\" width=\"300\" height=\"527\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61939\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok-food.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok-food-171x300.jpg 171w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>With a little effort, you can create scroll-stopping content that will help you attract new followers and get more likes on TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udea8 <strong>Want more ideas?<\/strong> Get marketing, promotion, and social post ideas for every month of the year &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/marketing-calendar?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2025MarketingCalendar_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\">The Mega Must-Have Marketing Calendar<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>2. Use hashtags to reach a wider audience<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/codyarsenault.com\/best-tiktok-hashtags\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TikTok hashtags<\/a> are a powerful tool for reaching new audiences. By including relevant hashtags in your videos, you can make your content more discoverable to users who are searching for topics that interest them.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, using popular hashtags can help you to get more likes on your videos, as the more users who see your content, the more likely you are to get likes and engagement.<\/p>\n<p>But just like with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/29\/instagram-hashtags\">Instagram hashtags<\/a>, use them sparingly, as too many can make your content appear spammy. If your content is for a broad audience, use 1-2 popular hashtags mixed with 1-2 topic-specific hashtags. If it&#8217;s for a specific subset of people, go with 2-3 topic-specific hashtags. There\u2019s no magic number, experiment and eventually you\u2019ll see what works better for your audience.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Stay up-to-date on the latest trends<\/h3>\n<p>Anyone who&#8217;s using, marketing, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/11\/advertising-on-tiktok\">advertising on TikTok<\/a> for more than a few months has undoubtedly noticed how quickly trends come and go. What was popular last week may be completely forgotten by the time the weekend rolls around.<\/p>\n<p>For users who want to get more likes on their videos or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/07\/how-to-get-on-tiktok-fyp\">get on the FYP<\/a>, it&#8217;s important to stay up-to-date on the latest trends. By posting videos that are relevant to what&#8217;s currently popular, users are more likely to get views and engagement from other users.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s where <a href=\"https:\/\/ads.tiktok.com\/business\/creativecenter\/inspiration\/popular\/pc\/en?from=001119\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TikTok\u2019s Creative Center<\/a> comes in. This powerful analytics tool shows you what\u2019s up and coming in the way of:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hashtags<\/li>\n<li>Songs<\/li>\n<li>Creators<\/li>\n<li>Videos<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When it comes to finding hashtags to use in your content, or even ideas for creating content for that matter, the Creative Center is a great place to go.<\/p>\n<p>Under the Hashtags section, for example, you can see what was trending just yesterday, add your industry for more granular results, and even click on each hashtag individually to get more details about the audience insights, regional popularity, and more.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok-creative-center-hashtags.jpg\" alt=\"how to get more likes on tiktok - tiktok creator center hashtags tab\" width=\"720\" height=\"361\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-61941\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok-creative-center-hashtags.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok-creative-center-hashtags-480x241.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When you stay up to date on the latest trends by using TikTok\u2019d Creative Center you\u2019ll be able to create more compelling, likeable content, use relevant hashtags, and take advantage of trending sounds.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f <strong>Want to see what&#8217;s trending with your competitors?<\/strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/how-to-spy-on-competitors?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_SpyOnCompetitors_Download\">How to Spy on Your Competitors: 7 Ways to Become a Competitive Supersleuth<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>4. Use sounds to your advantage<\/h3>\n<p>Speaking of trending sounds, sound is a key part of the TikTok experience. In fact, many users create videos specifically for the purpose of pairing them with popular songs or sound effects.<\/p>\n<p>Just check out this Dua Lipa and Calvin Harris song \u201cOne Kiss\u201d which has had 1.9 million videos paired with that song alone.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok-trending-song.jpg\" alt=\"how to get more likes on tiktok - screenshot of a popular song\" width=\"300\" height=\"616\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61937\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok-trending-song.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok-trending-song-146x300.jpg 146w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When a particular song or audio clip is used over and over again, people become accustomed to it. They almost expect the video to be good because they\u2019ve seen so many other good videos in the past with the same audio.<\/p>\n<p>TikTok\u2019s Creative Center is a great way to find popular sounds to use to your advantage. If you want to try and ride a trend up, search through the breakout sounds. If you want to find a song that\u2019s already popular, browse through the Popular tab.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok-creative-center-songs.jpg\" alt=\"how to get more likes on tiktok - creator center songs tab\" width=\"720\" height=\"362\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-61940\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok-creative-center-songs.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok-creative-center-songs-480x241.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When you can use popular sounds combined with a scroll-stopping clip you\u2019ll have a much better chance of getting views and likes on your TikTok videos.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Use captions<\/h3>\n<p>Many people watch videos on social media with the sound off, so it&#8217;s important to make sure your videos are captioned. This way, you can appeal to a wider audience and get more likes on TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>Captions also help to provide context for the video and make it more engaging. To get the most out of your captions, make sure they are clear and easy to read. Use a font that is legible and large enough to be seen on a small screen.<\/p>\n<p>You can easily add captions in TikTok\u2019s video editor by selecting the Captions icon. TikTok will then analyze the words in your video and will automatically generate captions for it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok-captions.jpg\" alt=\"how to get more likes on tiktok - screenshot of video with captions\" width=\"300\" height=\"616\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61943\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok-captions.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok-captions-146x300.jpg 146w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can edit the placement and wording of the captions if TikTok doesn\u2019t get it quite right.<\/p>\n<p>Making sure you have captions added to your video is an easy way to get more likes and to have more people stick around until the end of your video.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Collaborate and duet<\/h3>\n<p>A great way to get more likes on TikTok is to connect and collaborate with other users. You can start by finding users who produce content that is similar to yours in terms of style or subject matter.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have found a few potential collaborators, reach out either via DM or their <a href=\"https:\/\/codyarsenault.com\/linktree-alternatives\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contact link in bio<\/a> and see if they would be interested in working together. Collaborating with others is a great way to get more exposure for your account, and it can also be a lot of fun. So don&#8217;t be afraid to reach out and connect with other TikTok users.<\/p>\n<p>Another great way to collaborate without directly reaching out to others is to duet or even stitch their videos (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/11\/how-to-stitch-on-tiktok\">how to stitch on TikTok here<\/a>). When you duet a video, your video appears alongside the original video, therefore viewers may recognize the original video and take that extra second to hear what you have to say about it.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Use TikTok\u2019s effects to enhance your videos<\/h3>\n<p>TikTok offers a wide range of effects that can help to enhance your videos and make them more engaging. By using the right effects, you can add visual interest, create a certain mood, or emphasize certain elements in your video.<\/p>\n<p>Take the Green Screen effect, for example. Essentially, you can record a video of yourself and it will crop out everything around you so that you can place a still image of something else behind you, like this:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok-special-effects.jpg\" alt=\"how to get more likes on tiktok - screenshot of video with green screen\" width=\"299\" height=\"617\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61938\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok-special-effects.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok-special-effects-145x300.jpg 145w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This helps create visual interest which can either be used in a humorous or informative way.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Edit your videos with CapCut<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for more advanced editing features than what TikTok\u2019s video editor can provide, then <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.lemon.lvoverseas&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CapCut<\/a> is a great choice. You can add audio, captions, overlays, stickers, and so much more.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok-use-sounds.jpg\" alt=\"how to get more likes on tiktok - screenshot of adding sound\" width=\"300\" height=\"650\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61936\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok-use-sounds.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok-use-sounds-139x300.jpg 139w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>CapCut is made by the same parent company as the creators of TikTok so their app is optimized for creating high-quality TikTok video content. Use it to create professional-looking videos with just a few taps.

Leave your viewers on a cliffhanger<\/h3>\n<p>One of the best ways to get people to engage with your content and like your videos is to leave them wanting more. That&#8217;s why many content creators choose to end their videos on a cliffhanger.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok-cliff-hanger.jpg\" alt=\"how to get more likes on tiktok - screenshot of cliffhanger scene\" width=\"300\" height=\"650\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61942\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok-cliff-hanger.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok-cliff-hanger-139x300.jpg 139w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>By creating a sense of anticipation, you can encourage people to tune in for the next installment of your video series. Just be sure not to overly drag out your videos using this method. If you make your videos or series too long, viewers will become impatient and eventually leave the video entirely.<\/p>\n<p>Create something that\u2019s snappy yet can be long enough for at least a two-part series.<\/p>\n<p>Using the cliffhanger strategy is a great way to get more likes on your video. If you can pique the viewer\u2019s interest and keep them engaged you\u2019ll not only get more likes on one single video but on every video in the series.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Post regularly and stay consistent<\/h3>\n<p>Any social media expert will tell you that consistency is key when it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/social-media-marketing\">social media marketing<\/a>. The same is true on TikTok, where regular posting and consistent content can help you attract more followers and get more likes.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, quality is also important\u2014no one wants to see a stream of poorly produced videos. But if you can find a balance between quality and quantity, you&#8217;ll be well on your way to TikTok success.<\/p>\n<p>So if you&#8217;re looking to get more likes on TikTok, use your analytics and overall benchmarks to find out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/09\/best-time-to-post-on-tiktok\">the best time to post on TikTok<\/a> for your audience, and then post regularly and stay consistent with your content.
