Here\u2019s what you can accomplish by promoting your IG:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exposure:<\/strong> Instagram is one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/11\/most-popular-social-media-platforms\">most popular social media apps in the world.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Reach:<\/strong> Instagram is the third-most-popular social media platform in the world, with 1 billion monthly active users and 500 million daily active users (Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/about.instagram.com\/about-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram<\/a>).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Connect with your audience:<\/strong> Instagram is the most gender-neutral of the social media platforms, at 50.9% female to 49.1% male, which means that your promotions are useful for connecting to both segments of your target audience (Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/274828\/gender-distribution-of-active-social-media-users-worldwide-by-platform\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Statista<\/a>).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/promote-instagram-account-free-gender-distribution.png\" alt=\"free ways to promote your instagram account user gender distribution chart\" width=\"800\" height=\"494\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Customers: <\/strong>With such a large user base, you can pretty confidently conclude that you are reaching a large percentage of your target market on Instagram.

This involves having a business profile, making it public, and completing your bio.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Make sure you have an Instagram business account<\/h3>\n<p>Before you start attracting more people to your Instagram account, make sure your Instagram account is that of a<strong>\u00a0business profile<\/strong>. If you\u2019re using a personal-use Instagram account for your business, switching to a business account is actually very easy. At the bottom right of your home screen select the person icon, then the wheel in the screen\u2019s top right corner. This will take you to the &#8220;Options&#8221; screen where you can select \u201cSwitch to Business Profile.\u201d<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/promote-instagram-account-free-switch-to-business-account.png\" alt=\"free ways to promote your instagram account switch to business\" width=\"500\" height=\"651\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>2. Complete your profile<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Being such a visual platform, incomplete Instagram profiles are extra unattractive; to the point where It would be better to have <em>less<\/em> people discovering a complete profile than to have <em>more<\/em> people arriving at an incomplete one. To <span lang=\"EN\">complete your business profile, i<span lang=\"EN\">nclude useful details about your business, use a high-quality profile picture, and make sure your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/09\/instagram-bios\">Instagram bio<\/a> is written in your brand voice. Also, include a link to your website or a designated landing page in your bio.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/promote-instagram-account-free-chewy-full-profile.png\" alt=\"free ways to promote your instagram account chewy full profile\" width=\"700\" height=\"591\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>3. Make yourself visible<\/h3>\n<p>You can\u2019t promote your Instagram account and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/19\/get-more-instagram-followers\">earn more followers<\/a> if they can\u2019t find you! So just run a double-check to make sure your profile is public. Otherwise, only those who are already following you can see your posts.<\/p>\n<p>Okay, now that we have those fundamentals taken care of, it\u2019s time to discuss how to promote your Instagram account effectively, without spending a dime.<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-cross-promote-your-instagram-account\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to cross-promote your Instagram account<\/h2>\n<p>Digital marketing does not refer to one channel in particular. An effective strategy <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/10\/15\/multi-channel-marketing\">employs multiple channels at once<\/a>, and through content consistency, creates a cohesive system\u00a0that synergizes to bring you the best results. Here\u2019s how to use your various other marketing channels to promote your Instagram account for free:<\/p>\n<h3>4. With email<\/h3>\n<p>It may be helpful to include the social media icons of your most-used platforms in the footer of your marketing emails\u2014or even in your signature for regular emails. This of course does not outwardly promote your Instagram account, but it gives your audience yet one more point of access to your profile. Plus, I\u2019d imagine that there are certain segments of your email list that are either <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/10\/customer-loyalty\">loyal customers <\/a>or highly qualified leads, so the chances\u00a0that they may arrive at your Instagram account through one of your emails are\u00a0higher.<\/p>\n<p>You can also send out marketing emails that do directly promote your Instagram account. If you\u2019re running a contest, giveaway, or event, you may want to direct readers to your Instagram profile so they can participate.<\/p>\n<h3>5. On your website<\/h3>\n<p>At this point, consumers expect social media icons to be on a business\u2019s website, typically at\u00a0the bottom in the footer, so be sure to add those icons and links to your handles. In addition, if your business is highly dependent on visuals (like before-and-after photos, beautiful landscapes, interior designs, etc.); if you&#8217;re a photographe or even planner with a gallery;\u00a0or if you have a product feed on Instagram, you may want to have a page where your Instagram feed is embedded.\u00a0Here are three free ways to connect your website page to your Instagram feed:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/developers.facebook.com\/docs\/instagram\/oembed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram\u2019s own free embed feature<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> if you are tech-savvy.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Free plugins for those who use WordPress, like <span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/en-gb.wordpress.org\/plugins\/instagram-feed\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Smash Balloon<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Free tools like <span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/embedsocial.com\/blog\/embed-instagram-feed-for-free\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EmbedSocial&#8217;s Forever-Free Instagram Widget for Websites<\/a><\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/promote-instagram-account-free-embed-feed-on-website.png\" alt=\"free ways to promote your instagram account embed feed on website\" width=\"800\" height=\"462\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>6. Via other social networks<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If you have large followings or high engagement rates on other social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn, use these platforms as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/28\/cross-channel-lead-generation\">cross-promotional<\/a> tools for your Instagram account. You could do this by using direct CTA\u2019s, promoting the link to your<span lang=\"EN\">\u00a0Instagram bio<span lang=\"EN\">, or sharing\u00a0your latest Instagram photos and videos on those platforms. Since many people are active on more than one social network, you can likely persuade some to follow you on Instagram as well.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 Ready to improve your Facebook ads?

Start with your family and friends<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This tip is particularly useful for small or <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/08\/facebook-local-advertising\">local businesses,<\/a> or those just starting out with their\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/09\/instagram-marketing-strategy\">Instagram marketing<\/a>. Connecting with family and friends will help you to garner some initial engagement, and they will (hopefully) be more than happy to promote your account on their own networks. Even if they don\u2019t directly promote your account, their engagements with your profile will show up in their feed and their followers can discover you that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>8. Prioritize engagement<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Perhaps the best way to promote your Instagram account is through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/30\/social-media-engagement\">genuine engagement<\/a>. Consumers like to feel heard, so the more you engage back with their comments, the more comments and exposure you will get. But don\u2019t just be reactive with your engagement; proactively like and comment on the posts of your supporters, and follow them back. Each of these engagements organically promotes your Instagram account while at the same time strengthening\u00a0your relationship with your audience and building trust.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>9. Request and share user-generated content<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/13\/ugc-instagram\">User-generated content can boost your Instagram engagement<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> while also promoting your business. There\u2019s no better form of promotional content than that of real customers. Plus, when you share their content, they will likely repost it for their followers to see, further amplifying your reach.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/promote-instagram-account-free-user-generated-content.png\" alt=\"free ways to promote your instagram account user generated content\" width=\"795\" height=\"504\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">A lot of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/28\/user-generated-content\">user-generated content <\/a>will occur organically, but you can also directly request it\u2014through a challenge, a contest, or any simple and fun engagement activity. For example, ask your customers to share photos of themselves using their favorite product of yours, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/22\/cause-based-marketing\">supporting a cause <\/a>that you care about. Especially with contests, this strategy could inspire (or even require) your followers to tag others who aren\u2019t yet following your Instagram account. Just make sure that your efforts result in gaining followers that are interested in your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Just make sure that your efforts result in gaining followers that are interested in your business.<\/span><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>10. Follow and engage with Instagram influencers<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Running an <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/26\/influencer-marketing\">influencer collaboration<\/a> can really boost your exposure on Instagram, but you can also simply engage with them in a way that supports their brand while also affording you added exposure. Don\u2019t just like their posts;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/02\/how-to-repost-on-instagram\"> repost them to your Instagram Feed or Story<\/a> and thoughtfully comment on them in a way that adds value to the post or the conversation. Be sure to take some time to completely familiarize yourself with an <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/21\/social-media-influencers\">influencer<\/a>&#8216;s\u00a0brand, audience, and content throughout the web so you can ensure you are fully aligned. <\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/promote-instagram-account-free-influencers.png\" alt=\"free ways to promote your instagram account influencers\" width=\"400\" height=\"753\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">A bonus perk of this strategy is that regularly interacting with influencers can help you stay up-to-date with industry information and popular trends within your niche. <\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"promote-instagram-account-with-content\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to use content to promote your Instagram account<\/h2>\n<p>At the heart of any good digital marketing strategy is content\u2014informative, authentic,\u00a0<span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/15\/quality-content-defined\">high-quality content<\/a>\u00a0that informs, engages, and satisfies your customers\u2019 needs.

Publish useful posts<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This is one of the\u00a0tried-and-true ways to promote your Instagram account for free\u2014or rather, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/02\/promote-your-business\">promote your business<\/a> as a whole via Instagram. Attractive, interesting, and useful content gives users a reason to follow you. Here are some ideas and tips for useful content:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\"><strong>The classic blog post post<\/strong> (not a typo): This is an <em>Instagram<\/em> post containing the title or a brief summary of a <em>blog<\/em> post and then the link\u00a0to it.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\"><strong>Long-form excerpt posts: <\/strong>Extract the key bullet points from your top-performing blog posts and include them in an Instagram post with a corresponding visual.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\"><strong>Content from other sources:<\/strong>\u00a0<span lang=\"EN\">Share industry stats via charts, graphs, and other attractive visuals, being sure to tag the original source.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/promote-instagram-account-free-useful-content.png\" alt=\"free ways to promote your instagram account with useful content\" width=\"800\" height=\"514\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Keep in mind that you don\u2019t always have to link back to your website in your Instagram posts. This is a great way to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/14\/increase-traffic-to-my-website\">drive\u00a0website traffic<\/a>, but when you think about the number of posts in your followers\u2019 feeds that contain links, a simple, a digestible tidbit post is like a breath of fresh air for them\u2014something they can take in and feel a sense of completion as they scroll through their endless feed.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">A digestible tidbit post is like a breath of fresh air for your followers\u2014something they can take in and feel a sense of completion as they scroll through their endless feed.<\/span><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">You may not see an immediate spike in engagement or followers with this method, but it is an absolute must. If you consistently provide education and high-quality content\u00a0over time and in your unique brand voice, your Instagram account is sure to gain a solid reputation and a relevant following. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>12. Post captivating, high-quality images<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">I know, this is no earth-shattering revelation. But contrary to popular belief, you don\u2019t need to be a professional photographer or have expensive equipment to produce attractive and captivating images for Instagram. There are plenty of free photo and video editing tools available through Instagram itself and other apps to help you create\u00a0eye-catching, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/01\/content-marketing-images\">quality images<\/a>, such as <span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canva.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Canva<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> or <span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/layout-from-instagram\/id967351793?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Layout.<\/a><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/promote-instagram-account-free-high-quality-images.png\" alt=\"free ways to promote your instagram account with high quality images\" width=\"800\" height=\"795\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span lang=\"EN\"><em>Kristin Damstetter<\/em><em><span lang=\"EN\">\u2019s vibrant Instagram feed proves that good-quality images are easier than you think.<\/span><\/em> <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Pro tip: For some businesses, it may be helpful to reserve your permanent feed for your quality images, gallery items, and more <span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/10\/16\/guide-to-evergreen-content-marketing\">evergreen<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> posts; and to save your raw, timely, and spontaneous content for your Instagram Story, which we will cover soon.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>13. Post at the right time<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">It\u2019s important to post regularly and consistently on Instagram, but you won\u2019t be doing much to promote your account if you\u2019re not <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/12\/01\/best-time-to-post-on-instagram\">posting at the right times<\/a>. The \u201cright time\u201d varies according to your<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/18\/beginners-guide-to-target-markets\"> target audience<\/a>, business type, and more, so you\u2019ll need to put some thought into this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">For example, if your target market is made up heavily of executives, the best time to post might be at the close of work, around 5pm, or during their morning commute. But if your audience is primarily mothers of young children, your most opportune time is likely going to be late morning, once they\u2019ve dropped off their little ones at school. Experiment and look at your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/01\/instagram-analytics\">analytics<\/a> to find out the time during which posting will be most effective in\u00a0promoting\u00a0your Instagram account.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>14. Ask questions in your posts<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Using captions or polls<span lang=\"EN\"> to ask a question relevant to your <span lang=\"EN\">niche<span lang=\"EN\"> is a great way to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/27\/how-to-increase-instagram-engagement\"> increase Instagram engagement<\/a>, gain more exposure and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/18\/instagram-growth\">boost your Instagram growth<\/a>. Think about questions that will be fun to answer or about topics that matter to your target audience; just steer clear of anything too personal or controversial, as the resulting engagement could take an ugly turn.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/free20ways20to20promote20your20instagram20account20ask20questions.jpg\" alt=\"free ways to promote your instagram account ask questions\" width=\"373\" height=\"663\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">You can also ask questions through\u00a0Instagram Story Highlights (we&#8217;ll get to those later).<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>15.

These kinds of posts give you ways to express your unique brand voice and help to promote the more human side of your business.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">You can use up to 30 hashtags in your posts, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should. Stay focused on the ones that will promote your account to the right audience. Plus, a post with a gazillion hashtags can be a bit overwhelming and even come off as desperate. You can always include just two or three in your post and then comment on your post with the rest of the hashtags you want to use\u2014this helps you get the same exposure while maintaining tasteful (and less aggressive) posts.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">You can use up to 30 hashtags in your posts, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should.

Here are a few free strategies to try:<\/p>\n<h3>17. Regularly post to your Instagram Story<\/h3>\n<p>Instagram Stories are like little albums for your business that can contain pictures, videos, stickers, polls, and more. The content refreshes every 24 hours so it\u2019s a great place to showcase the more raw and transparent content that helps to make your business relatable. Users love Instagram Stories, so using this feature regularly is a way for your account to self-promote. You can use Instagram Stories in a variety of ways.

Use Instagram Highlights<\/h3>\n<p>Instagram Story Highlights are curated collections of content you\u2019ve posted to your Instagram Story in the past. They are typically referred to as \u201calbums\u201d and can be grouped into different categories. What\u2019s so great about Instagram Story Highlights is that they don\u2019t disappear like Stories do; they live permanently on your profile, right underneath your bio section and above your regular feed.<\/p>\n<p>There are many ways to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/06\/instagram-story-highlights\">use Instagram Story Highlights<\/a> to promote your Instagram account, such as to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Showcase products<\/li>\n<li>Promote events<\/li>\n<li>Share your latest work or product updates<\/li>\n<li>Run interactive polls<\/li>\n<li>Answer follower questions<\/li>\n<li>Feature product tutorials<\/li>\n<li>Announce sales and discounts<\/li>\n<li>Start a series<\/li>\n<li>Highlight your best customer testimonials<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&#8230;all of which make\u00a0up quality and useful content, ensuring the implementation of strategy #9 above.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/free20ways20to20promote20your20instagram20account20instagram20story20highlights.jpg\" alt=\"free ways to promote your instagram account instagram story highlights\" width=\"336\" height=\"597\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Using IG Story Highlights to showcase testimonials.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>19. Use IGTV<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/22\/instagram-tv\">IGTV<\/a> (Instagram TV) operates similarly to YouTube and regular TV, in that users can swipe through channels of their favorite accounts or topics. With <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/03\/video-marketing-ideas\">video content<\/a> being such an effective means of reaching your audience, this is a great way to turn more of your video-inclined fans on to your Instagram account.<\/p>\n<p>There is also minimal work needed for this. Uploading your first IGTV video will automatically create your brand\u2019s unique channel. Plus, you can repurpose or even repost Facebook and YouTube videos you\u2019ve already created\u2014getting in front of potentially an entirely new segment of your Instagram following.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/promote-instagram-account-free-ig-tv.png\" alt=\"free ways to promote your instagram account ig tv\" width=\"800\" height=\"688\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">20. Make use of Instagram Live<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Running tutorials, workshops, and Q&amp;A sessions through an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/30\/instagram-live\">Instagram Live<\/a> session is another great way to promote your account. Be sure to let your followers know ahead of time that you\u2019ll be running a live session, so they can help spread the word and you can boost your number of viewers. Seeing you or someone in your company talk or demonstrate something is an effective way to build trust and put a face behind your brand.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/free20ways20to20promote20your20instagram20account20instagram20live.jpg\" alt=\"free ways to promote your instagram account instagram live\" width=\"414\" height=\"791\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<div id=\"free-ways-to-promote-instagram-account\"><\/div>\n<h2>More free ways to promote your Instagram account<\/h2>\n<p>These last (but not least) strategies involve keeping your audience up to date, joining popular conversations occurring on Instagram and elsewhere, and (if you&#8217;re into it) advertising. Let&#8217;s take a look.<\/p>\n<h3>21. Announce updates and sales promotions<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If you\u2019re running any sort of sale or deal, launching a <span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/29\/how-to-promote-a-product\">new product or service<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">, or want to announce that a popular item is back in stock, post these to your Instagram feed or Story.\u00a0When customers and fans come to know that you use this channel consistently for can\u2019t-miss information, they will more frequently check your feed and will likely share your account with others they know would want to be in the know.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Just be careful not to have too many promotional posts on your feed, is this can have an exhaustive effect on your audience.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Just be careful not to have too many promotional posts on your feed, is this can have an exhaustive effect on your audience.<\/span><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>22. Take advantage of a trend<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Speaking of trends, <span lang=\"EN\">these <span lang=\"EN\">can be powerful tools for promoting your Instagram account. A trend could be something as simple as using a new Instagram feature, as fun as doing the latest viral challenge, or as philanthropic as supporting societal changes.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Putting out tasteful and quality posts about trending topics will likely result in your followers\u00a0reposting on their networks, expanding your reach even further and helping to solidify your brand\u2019s core values.
