The <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/local-seo-importance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">state of local SEO<\/a> is such that you can still see major gains by executing these simple strategies.<\/p>\n<p>Executing these five relatively simple (if not always easy) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/seo-tactics\">SEO tactics<\/a> can generate great returns for small businesses from SEO.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Optimize your Google Business Profile<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/03\/google-my-business-optimization\">Optimize your Google Business Profile<\/a> (GBP) by selecting the right categories, getting key citations, keeping your name, address, and phone number consistent across data providers, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/16\/get-more-google-reviews\">soliciting as many reviews as possible<\/a>, and responding to reviews. It can be difficult to operationalize getting more reviews, but most of the other items on this list are pretty simple.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Audit links and on-page elements<\/h3>\n<p>Eliminate any major technical SEO issues, and when you\u2019re looking at linking text or <a href=\"https:\/\/gannett-my.sharepoint.com\/:w:\/r\/personal\/ahoward_gannett_com\/Documents\/Aug%206th.docx?d=w74a63ac6878b4a64842c5ced46f1c3dd&amp;csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=0E8t0z\">headlines<\/a> on pages on your website, look to avoid being overly aligned with the aggressive use of your target term.<\/p>\n<p>Again that means instead of using linking text or headlines on a page that look like this to target something like \u201cHVAC repair Dallas:\u201d<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>professional HVAC services in Dallas<\/li>\n<li>top HVAC repair experts in Dallas<\/li>\n<li>trusted Dallas HVAC repair service<\/li>\n<li>affordable HVAC repair in Dallas<\/li>\n<li>best HVAC technicians in Dallas<\/li>\n<li>Dallas HVAC repair professionals<\/li>\n<li>reliable HVAC repair service Dallas<\/li>\n<li>quality HVAC repair in Dallas<\/li>\n<li>expert HVAC repair Dallas<\/li>\n<li>HVAC repair services near Dallas<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You would use something more like this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>needing repairs for your HVAC in Dallas<\/li>\n<li>services to fix HVAC systems in Dallas<\/li>\n<li>looking for help with HVAC issues<\/li>\n<li>best solutions for HVAC problems in Dallas<\/li>\n<li>find reliable HVAC repair services<\/li>\n<li>professional help for HVAC breakdowns<\/li>\n<li>affordable fixes for HVAC units in Dallas<\/li>\n<li>quality service for HVAC maintenance<\/li>\n<li>expert technicians for HVAC repair<\/li>\n<li>trusted solutions for HVAC issues<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>While there is an element of local SEO being the land before time, this is one element that has actually advanced, and if you have a very old site or have used a very cheap SEO vendor you might need to refresh on-page elements, external linking, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/04\/internal-linking\">internal linking anchors<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\ude80 <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/first-page-of-google?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_10WaysFirstPageGoogle_Download\">10 Tangible &amp; Free Ways to Get on the First Page of Google<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>3. Build and update location pages<\/h3>\n<p>Targeting {town\/city} + {service\/business type} with location pages for areas that you service (even if you aren\u2019t located there) is very valuable. Again vary the text you use on-page and with links, and look at all of your competitors who are creating similar pages and create something better than what they have.<\/p>\n<p>Often this is a very low bar, but in a competitive market, you may need to put some real time and effort in. In our Dallas HVAC example, Berkeys.com has created a very comprehensive page:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/berkeys-location-page.webp\" alt=\"berkeys location page\" width=\"883\" height=\"531\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-84521\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/berkeys-location-page.webp 883w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/berkeys-location-page-480x289.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 883px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Below the fold, the page includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multiple videos<\/li>\n<li>Information about costs<\/li>\n<li>Information about service types<\/li>\n<li>Information about HVAC size and efficiency in specific areas of the home<\/li>\n<li>Information about license requirements in Dallas<\/li>\n<li>Points of differentiation for Berkeys<\/li>\n<li>Map embed<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The headlines are a little aggressive, but in general, if you go down the first page of results and look at your competitors and see that this is the most comprehensive page (even if it\u2019s not ranking first) you have a rough model and \u201cbar\u201d for your location pages.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> Don\u2019t just grab the first result here. It may be a site\u2019s home page, or if it is a location page it may be ranking for reasons other than how comprehensive the content is.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Create topically relevant informational content<\/h3>\n<p>Lots of targeted informational content can perform well on service sites, like product reviews and roundups, glossary-style overviews, and how-to content about topics related to your core service offerings. These assets can generate links and allow you to establish <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/topical-authority\">topical authority<\/a> and link internally to your location pages.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Build links!<\/h3>\n<p>A relatively small number of high-quality links can have an out-sized impact when it comes to local SEO because in so many markets, so many ranking sites have relatively few links. Many of the tried and true local <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/27\/backlink-audit\">link-building methods<\/a> can be a good start here, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Making sure you have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/04\/12\/local-citations\">local citations built<\/a> where you can, and you\u2019ve claimed any easy-to-claim profiles you can (e.g. Better Business Bureau profile, local chamber of commerce, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>Local press efforts<\/li>\n<li>Local partnerships with friendly companies, vendors, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Guest posts (again here look for relevant sites, real businesses, and sites that have traffic and rank well for relevant terms, which you can check using third-party tools)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Not only can these types of optimizations still have a major impact on SEO results for local SEO, they can still work <em>quickly <\/em>as you can see in the screenshot above.<\/p>\n<div id=\"local-seo-pitfalls\"><\/div>\n<h2>Local SEO pitfalls and risk elements for small businesses<\/h2>\n<p>If you own a small business and are looking to take advantage of local SEO, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re trusting a vendor to manage the process for you. As with anything: some vendors are great, and some are not. While the right vendor can add a ton of value to your business and your website specifically, the wrong one can get you into all sorts of trouble with Google.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">SEOs about to ruin it for ecom sites and local businesses.<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Nelly (@NellyDogman) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NellyDogman\/status\/1775884453543305255?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 4, 2024<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p>Beyond just \u201cfinding a vendor you trust\u201d what are specific areas where a vendor can get your website into trouble?<\/p>\n<h3>Link velocity and quality<\/h3>\n<p>An important thing to note for small business sites is that <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/GrindstoneSEO\/status\/1802915053647298856\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google has different rules for different sites<\/a>. If you are a large publisher (like Forbes) and your content gets scraped and low-quality links are pointed at your site with aggressive anchors, you can maintain rankings (and certainly have a much lower chance of having your entire site removed from search results).<\/p>\n<p>If you are a small business site with very few backlinks to begin with and your SEO vendor goes out and builds you a bunch of very low-quality links with exactly the same linking text pointing to your site, you could get in a lot of trouble (particularly if the rate at which you\u2019re acquiring those links is suspiciously high&#8211;e.g., you\u2019ve added 10-15 links a year for 10 years in business, and then all of a sudden your site gets hundreds or thousands of low-quality links).<\/p>\n<p>How can you help protect against this becoming an issue for your business?<\/p>\n<p>If they\u2019re not sending it already, ask your SEO company for a spreadsheet with the specific URL your link has been placed on, the URL on your site the link pointed to, and the linking text that site used to link to your site.<\/p>\n<p>What you are looking for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the site linking to yours a legitimate website (ideally something like a blog or resources section on a legitimate business or major publishing site) or does the content on the site look extremely low quality (and like the site only exists to link to other sites)?<\/li>\n<li>Is the site relevant? Is the theme of the site closely related to your business and what you talk about on your site?<\/li>\n<li>Does the site get traffic? Do they rank well in Google for the terms they write about and target on their homepage\/key pages?<\/li>\n<li>Is the anchor text or linking text varied from link to link?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The good news is that because your competitors are other small businesses with limited link profiles, you frequently won\u2019t need a high volume of quality links to grow traffic.<\/p>\n<h3>Content velocity and quality<\/h3>\n<p>As with link velocity and quality, there are different rules for your small business site than there are for large, authoritative sites. If your vendor is charging you $300 and offering to deliver 20 blog posts a month: it is, in fact, too good to be true.<\/p>\n<p>Beware here of large volumes of low-quality content (low quality can be AI, but it can also be human, and high-quality content can be AI-assisted) that\u2019s likely to have poor engagement signals (i.e., a poor experience for visitors to your site when they actually find you in search results or visit your site).<\/p>\n<h3>Anchor text (internal and external)<\/h3>\n<p>The linking text you use for your pages is an important element of link building, as mentioned above, but you want to vary your internal linking text within your own site as well.<\/p>\n<p>So if you\u2019re an HVAC company and you have a page that you want to have rank for HVAC repair in Dallas and you\u2019re linking to that page 10 times, instead of just using \u201cHVAC repair dallas\u201d all 10 times, you would want to use linking text like this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>needing repairs for your HVAC in Dallas<\/li>\n<li>services to fix HVAC systems in Dallas<\/li>\n<li>looking for help with HVAC issues<\/li>\n<li>best solutions for HVAC problems in Dallas<\/li>\n<li>find reliable HVAC repair services<\/li>\n<li>professional help for HVAC breakdowns<\/li>\n<li>affordable fixes for HVAC units in Dallas<\/li>\n<li>quality service for HVAC maintenance<\/li>\n<li>expert technicians for HVAC repair<\/li>\n<li>trusted solutions for HVAC issues<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to use more natural-sounding anchor text that\u2019s not just aggressive variations of the core term you\u2019re looking to target.<\/p>\n<h3>Aggressive Google Business Profile practices<\/h3>\n<p>Your Google Business Profile is of course a major SEO asset for your business, and while you obviously want to increase visibility for it you also don\u2019t want to put it at risk.<\/p>\n<p>Faking multiple locations and reviews can put you at risk of getting a profile banned or suspended. Generally speaking, there\u2019s probably a lower-risk approach to whatever you\u2019re trying to accomplish (e.g. legitimately expanding to a new office or just creating location pages to target a nearby area or town, asking your customers for reviews in a more organized way and incenting your staff to collect them, etc.)<\/p>\n<div id=\"local-seo-success-example\"><\/div>\n<h2>Simple fixes, quick results: A real-world example of local SEO success<\/h2>\n<p>Here are some real-world SEO results for a local roofing company website we recently worked on:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/local-seo-success-example.webp\" alt=\"example of website results when using local seo for growth\" width=\"855\" height=\"368\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-84522\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/local-seo-success-example.webp 855w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/local-seo-success-example-480x207.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 855px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/03\/organic-traffic\">Organic traffic<\/a> more than doubled in a few months, they jumped to #1 for their primary {town name} roofing keyword, and organic traffic (and qualified leads) are up over 3X year-over-year for the same year.<\/p>\n<p>Our efforts started after the Helpful Content Update (HCU) and the 9,7543* core updates Google has rolled out recently (*rough estimate)&#8211;what\u2019s the trick?<\/p>\n<p>The actual inputs here were extremely simple&#8211;what you might have imagined SEO deliverables to be several years ago:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated title tags and internal linking anchor text<\/li>\n<li>Built a small number of links per month to targeted pages<\/li>\n<li>Published a few SEO-focused content assets a month<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/08\/what-is-google-my-business\">Google Business Profile<\/a> was already pretty well-optimized or there would have been another lever for SEO growth.<\/p>\n<p>There are lots of other opportunities for growth for this site, but the point here is that some simple clean up and blocking and tackling had a huge business impact for this company and added immediate value to their website.<\/p>\n<p>We work with a lot of B2B SaaS companies.
