Consider this your go-to for coming up with creative, engaging social media posts for every day of the week. There is something in here for everyone, so just about any business can use it to build their social media presence and grow a relevant following.<\/p>\n<h2>Why use daily hashtags?<\/h2>\n<p>There are many <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/29\/instagram-hashtags\">ways to use hashtags<\/a> to grow your business. As we touched on above, there are various types of hashtags, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Location-based hashtags<\/strong> to enhance your local presence and attract more nearby customers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Industry hashtags<\/strong> to boost your credibility, expertise, and thought leadership.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Custom business hashtags <\/strong>to hone your brand voice and increase brand loyalty.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Promotion\/sale hashtags<\/strong> to increase engagement, especially when coupled with local hashtags.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Holiday hashtags<\/strong> to promote special deals and engage your community.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The great thing about daily hashtags is that they can offer a lot of the benefits from each of the other types of hashtags above. With them you can<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Easily come up with daily social media posts (no more racking your brain trying to come up with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/12\/marketing-ideas\">creative ideas<\/a>, which you don\u2019t have the time for anyway).<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/19\/get-more-instagram-followers\">Build your following<\/a> through regular, consistent posting.<\/li>\n<li>Engage your audience with creative and fun approach.<\/li>\n<li>Organically reinforce your core values and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/11\/content-marketing-mission-statement\">mission statement<\/a>, which consumers pay attention to now more than ever before.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/daily20hashtags20wednesday20hashtags20pick20a20class2023wednesdaywins.png\" alt=\"daily hashtags wednesday hashtags pick a class #wednesdaywins\" width=\"800\" height=\"518\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>Tips for using daily hashtags<\/h2>\n<p>While daily hashtags are a quick and easy way to build your social media presence, <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/social-media\/your-guide-using-right-hashtags\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">finding the right hashtags for your business<\/a> still takes careful thinking. So before you begin, take a gander at these tips so you can be equipped to choose the best daily hashtags that will drive your social media marketing goals.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>While daily <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/02\/twitter-hashtags\">hashtags can improve your reach on Twitter<\/a>, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Facebook, remember that your ultimate goal is to get found by not just anyone, but by potential customers. As such, I\u2019d encourage you to stick to hashtags closely related to your products, services, and overall <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/31\/brand-voice\">brand identity<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Daily hashtags are high-volume hashtags (sort of like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2010\/10\/04\/high-volume-keywords-vs-low-volume-keywords\">high-volume keywords<\/a>), so it\u2019s best that you pair them with local or branded hashtags to help target the right audience.<\/li>\n<li>Many of these hashtags have equally effective variations (such as #MotivationalMonday, #MotivationMonday, #MondayMotivation), so don\u2019t limit yourself!<\/li>\n<li>Hashtags aren\u2019t case-sensitive, but sometimes you may want to use capitalization to make the hashtag\u00a0more quickly decipherable (as I did with this post).<\/li>\n<li>There are several standard \u201ctemplate\u201d hashtags\u00a0listed in the Monday hashtag section\u00a0that can be used for any day of the week, such as\u00a0#TuesdayQuotes, #WednesdayVibes, #ThursdayFeels, etc.<\/li>\n<li>This is a long-but-not-exhaustive list.
