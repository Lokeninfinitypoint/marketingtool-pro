Even for sites that have lost traffic from Google.<\/li>\n<li>It seems likely that that gap will close quickly in the coming months, but it\u2019s difficult to tell how quickly and how much share will be directly \u201cstolen\u201d by AI tools or LLMs.<\/li>\n<li>Many tactics that are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/seo\">SEO best practices<\/a> are also best practices for gaining visibility in LLMs.<\/li>\n<li>Some tactics will be much more valuable for placement in LLMs or won\u2019t matter at all in SEO results, and some more aggressive GEO tactics could even get sites penalized in traditional <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/seo-ranking-factors-2025\">search rankings<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>SEO results are increasingly becoming a hybrid of traditional search results and AI-generated search results, with the increasing presence of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-overviews-impact-on-seo\">AI Overviews in Google search results<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Agentic search, or users using specific AI agents to perform specific tasks or answer specific questions, is in its infancy, and optimizing for placement in AI agents will likely require different tactics than either SEO or GEO.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>My prediction for the rest of 2025 is that for most businesses, the responsibility of \u201cSEO\u201d will encapsulate both optimizing for search placement on Google and placement in LLMs. Marketing teams or agencies will be expected to work on tasks that aid with both of these things. And, as the numbers for referrals from LLMs get more and more interesting, businesses will want to understand the optimization process and be willing to focus more resources on getting placement and visibility there. I also believe that in many cases, where <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/03\/organic-traffic\">SEO traffic<\/a> is less accessible for some sites, they\u2019ll look to shift focus and investment from traditional SEO to GEO.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd0e <strong>Need help understanding the modern rules for SEO?<\/strong> Download our free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/how-to-do-seo-right?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_SEOstrategies_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\/\">How to Do SEO Right\u2014Right Now!<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"schema-markup\"><\/div>\n<h3>2.
