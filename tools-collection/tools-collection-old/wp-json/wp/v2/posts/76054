PEST competitive analysis<\/h3>\n<p>You can think of a PEST competitive analysis as sort of a deeper dive into the threats of your SWOT analysis. As we mentioned, threats are typically driven by factors that are outside of your control. This includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Political:<\/strong> Laws and regulations, taxes, and even political forces that impact the ease of doing business in your market.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Economic:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-during-inflation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Inflation<\/a>, stock exchange rates, interest rates, labor costs, supply chain, sales cycle patterns\u2014anything influencing your ability to make and spend money.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Social:<\/strong> Demographic and population patterns, consumer behaviors, and cultural shifts that impact interest in your business or products\/services.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Technological: <\/strong>Tools, platforms, and technology that may compete with your offerings or give your competitors an advantage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>PEST competitive analysis example<\/h4>\n<p>Here\u2019s a basic run-through of some of the PESTs impacting a communication platform primarily for home service and home improvement businesses.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Political:<\/strong> New opt-in and consent rules and regulations around texting are ramping up. But this presents an opportunity to create templates, educational content, and product offerings that make these compliance hassles easier.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Economic: <\/strong>Supply chain shortages and seasonality can dramatically impact any given vertical\u2019s interest in the product.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Social<\/strong>: With the pandemic over, people are less into DIY home improvement and are turning back to the pros. Also, with millennials and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/09\/gen-z-stats\">Generation Z<\/a> getting older and being less interested in DIY home improvement (and more interested in saving the world from itself), the home service industry is expected to grow.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Technological:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteAIinMarketingGuide.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_AIMarketing_Download\">AI<\/a>, combined with personalized automation, presents a huge opportunity for call centers to become leaner and more powerful.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>PEST competitive analysis template<\/h4>\n<p>Use this PEST competitive analysis template to compare the challenges you\u2019re facing to those of your competitors.

Porter\u2019s Five Forces competitive analysis<\/h3>\n<p>This framework got its name from Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter, who created it in 1979. The model examines five market forces that affect companies in any industry, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Threat of new entrants:<\/strong> The more players in an industry, the higher the competition, but some industries are easier to enter into than others. The ease with which a new business can enter into an existing industry depends on up-front costs, training, and certifications, as well as the power of existing brands in the space.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bargaining power of suppliers: <\/strong>How much power do suppliers have to raise prices which would in turn decrease profitability? This depends on how many suppliers are already in the space and the availability of alternatives and substitutes.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bargaining power of buyers: <\/strong>This represents how easy it is for customers to switch from one brand to another, such as for better pricing. When there are few customers and many alternatives, bargaining power is high, not to mention that price comparisons are more accessible now thanks to the internet. (This is why <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/10\/customer-loyalty\">building brand loyalty<\/a> and truly distinguishing your products and services is so important!)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Threat of substitute products: <\/strong>Think not just about identical products and services but also different ones that meet the same need.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Rivalry among existing competitors: <\/strong>When rivalry is high, industry players have to invest more in advertising and sometimes partake in pricing wars, which impacts profitability.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/competitive-analysis-template-competitive-rivalry.webp\" alt=\"competitive analysis - chart that shows competitive rivalry factors\" width=\"936\" height=\"552\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76083\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/competitive-analysis-template-competitive-rivalry.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/competitive-analysis-template-competitive-rivalry-480x283.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.business-to-you.com\/porters-five-forces\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h4>Five Forces competitive analysis examples<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Threat of new entrants:<\/strong> For example, the hotel industry is a lot harder to enter into than say, the home services industry, but home services is still harder to enter into than food and beverage.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bargaining power of suppliers: <\/strong>An example here would be in the restaurant industry. Supplies are more abundant for fast food than for farm-to-table, so supplier power would be higher for the latter.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bargaining power of buyers:<\/strong> In industries like real estate, hotels, and travel, buyers have access to a wealth of price comparison tools, making buyer power very high.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Threat of substitute products:<\/strong> Let\u2019s take the beer industry. While spiked seltzer is not the same type of product, it serves the same purpose in many ways, and can therefore be a threat.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Rivalry among existing competitors: <\/strong>Because of its difficulty to enter, the airline industry has fewer players and therefore higher competition. Add in the high bargaining power of buyers and suppliers and the competition is even more fierce.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Five Forces competitive analysis template<\/h4>\n<p>Use this template to examine your business and your competitors with respect to Porter\u2019s Five Forces.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/competitive-analysis-templates-porters-five-forces.webp\" alt=\"porter's five forces competitive analysis template screenshot from wordstream\" width=\"936\" height=\"534\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76084\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/competitive-analysis-templates-porters-five-forces.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/competitive-analysis-templates-porters-five-forces-480x274.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1UpUfbpskQFa8R6lAawRe8wluW3OlP0qVQWQTp5IvSH0\/copy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Go to the Five Forces competitive analysis template<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Use these competitive analysis templates and examples to grow your business<\/h2>\n<p>A good business measures its performance, but a great business takes a step back and looks at its performance relative to the competition.
