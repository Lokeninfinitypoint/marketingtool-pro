You\u2019re under tremendous pressure to create ads that are both engaging and informative, include a clear call to action, and stand out against competitors\u2019 ads. Unfortunately, one sloppy grammatical misstep can counteract all your hard work and destroy your credibility. And if you violate Google Ads (formerly known as Google AdWords)\u00a0policies, your ad will never even get approved.<\/p>\n<p>To avoid giving searchers a negative first impression, be sure to double-check your ads to be sure you\u2019re not committing these all-too-common advertising <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/17\/google-ads-issues\">mistakes<\/a>:<\/p>\n<h2>Advertising Mistake #1: Jumping Between Title and Sentence Case<\/h2>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/advertising-20mistakes-capitalization.jpg\" alt=\"top advertising mistakes\" width=\"354\" height=\"314\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Lately, I\u2019ve noticed that tons of people have a habit of capitalizing random words, seemingly with no rhyme nor reason. When writing ads, you should be using either title case or sentence case\u2014no exception. What\u2019s the difference? Sentence case is the standard format for most communications. With this method, only the first letter of the sentence is capitalized (along with any proper nouns).<\/p>\n<p>Here at WordStream, <strong>we tend to favor title case for ads, as it typically yields higher click-through rates<\/strong>. With title case, you capitalize the first letter of the sentence, the first letter of any \u201cmajor\u201d words and all words with four letters or more.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/advertising-mistake-title-case.png\" alt=\"nars ad in title case\" width=\"524\" height=\"226\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Looks like NARS has got title case down pat.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Beware that excessive capitalization, such as FREE SHIPPING, and inter-capitalization, such as FrEe ShIpPiNg, are <strong>strictly prohibited<\/strong> in Google Ads\u00a0and can spark an <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/25\/adwords-ad-disapproved\">ad disapproval<\/a>. Stick with sentence case or title case and you should be just fine!<\/p>\n<h2>Advertising Mistake #2: Neglecting to Use Commas<\/h2>\n<p>While they\u2019re definitely useful, commas are the bane of my existence. Sprinkle in too many and your work becomes unreadable\u2014too few and you risk dangerously altering the intent of the sentence.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/advertising-mistake-commas.jpg\" alt=\"come on people book\" width=\"451\" height=\"648\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Either this was some weird foreshadowing or the editor needs a crash course in comma use.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the most common misuse of commas is neglecting to include them after introductory clauses or phrases, especially when addressing an audience. This can dramatically change the way the reader interprets the sentence. I think we can all agree that \u201ccome on people\u201d and \u201ccome on, people.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/advertising-mistake-dahmer.png\" alt=\"i like cooking my family and pets\" width=\"450\" height=\"250\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Uhh, ok Jeffrey Dahmer.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Commas also must be used to separate words in a simple series of three or more items. Again, failing to do this can result in a complete misinterpretation of the writer\u2019s intent. If someone said \u201cI like cooking, my family, and my pets\u201d in the bio section of dating site, I\u2019d probably be down to meet them. However, if their profile claimed, \u201cI like cooking my family and my pets,\u201d it would likely warrant a 9-1-1 call.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re struggling to determine when to include a comma in your ad, a good (and completely unscientific) rule of thumb is to read the sentence out loud. If you hesitate or pause at any point while reading it, you probably need to insert a comma at that juncture. Here\u2019s a more detailed primer on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarbook.com\/punctuation\/commas.asp\">proper comma usage<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Advertising Mistake #3: Including Emoji<\/h2>\n<p>Believe me, I understand the temptation to use <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/03\/google-know-nearby-emoji-infographic\">emoji characters<\/a> in ad text. I\u2019m guilty of sprinkling those cute little guys throughout my texts, tweets, posts\u2014even emails! It may not be the most professional mode of communication, but you sure can convey quite a bit with these images.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/advertising-mistakes-emojis.png\" alt=\"emojis in tweet\" width=\"585\" height=\"124\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>WordStream\u2019s Twitter account certainly has no shortage of emojis.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, adding emoticons in your ad copy is a major paid search faux paus. The Google Ads\u00a0policy team has explicitly warned advertisers that this practice violates their policy guidelines. While some account managers have managed to evade disapprovals, it\u2019s definitely not worth the risk. (<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/27\/emojis-in-ad-text\">Don\u2019t listen to Larry<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<h2>Advertising Mistake #4: Non-Standard Use of Numbers\/Characters<\/h2>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/advertising-mistakes-characters.png\" alt=\"ad with *s\" width=\"206\" height=\"90\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Don\u2019t bother trying to get creative with symbols and characters in your ad copy. Google considers this strategy to be \u201cgimmicky\u201d and, if you employ it, your ads will probably never see the light of day. Rather than using visual shortcuts to attract searchers\u2019 attention, you should be striving to compose <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/02\/ppc-ad-headlines\">eye-catching headlines<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>That said, there are a few exceptions to this rule. For example, if your brand or product names contain symbols (think: Arm &amp; Hammer) or if you are legally required to include asterisks to indicate that conditions apply to your claims, you can use them in your copy (pending Google Ads\u2019 approval).<\/p>\n<h2>Advertising Mistake #5: Using Improper Punctuation<\/h2>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/advertising-mistakes-punctuation.jpg\" alt=\"comment with no commas\" width=\"451\" height=\"149\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Failing to punctuate your sentence properly leads to a host of problems. Firstly, your copy will appear hastily composed and unprofessional. Even worse, it can lead to misinterpretation. For example, in the post above, does the writer mean to say \u201cWe have 2 hours to kill. Someone come see us\u201d or \u201cWe have 2 hours to kill someone. Come see us\u201d? These two versions carry drastically different sentiment.<\/p>\n<p>Not only should you strive to use proper punctuation in your copy, you should try your best create sentences that fit within each description line of your ad. <strong>If you\u2019re able to end the first description line with punctuation, your ad will be eligible for a mega-headline<\/strong>, whereby your headline and your description line are combined to create an extra-long header. Typically, ads with mega-headlines garner <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/08\/12\/ad-ctr\">higher ad click-through rates<\/a>, so you definitely want to create ads that are eligible for this!<\/p>\n<h2>Advertising Mistake #6: Substituting Slang Terms for Real Words<\/h2>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/advertising-mistakes-slang.png\" alt=\"text slang terms defined\" width=\"640\" height=\"641\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Back in the \u201890s and early 2000s, AOL\u2019s instant messenger program took internet users by storm. As a middle schooler, I spent hours upon hours gossiping with friends and flirting with crushes via AIM. And anyone who was anyone conducted these conversations entirely in short hand. Back in those days, <em>you<\/em> was exclusively spelled <em>u<\/em>, <em>too\/to\/two<\/em> was always<em> 2<\/em>, <em>thanks<\/em> was <em>thx<\/em>\u2026you get the picture. We then got even lazier and moved to initialisms like <em>LOL<\/em>, <em>TGIF<\/em> and <em>BRB<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Nowadays, this slang has made its way into our day-to-day communications. However, it\u2019s certainly not acceptable to incorporate into PPC ads. This is a major <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/16\/google-display-network-mistakes\">advertising mistake<\/a>. Not only are these slang terms unprofessional, they\u2019re also not universally understood. Some are regional, others are generational and all seem to be constantly evolving. Moreover, if Google detects such language in your ads, they will be automatically disapproved. Stick with real words\u2014they\u2019re worth the extra characters!<\/p>\n<h2>Advertising Mistake #7: Going Bananas With Exclamation Points<\/h2>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/advertising-mistakes-exclamation.png\" alt=\"omg!!!\" width=\"608\" height=\"247\" \/><\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s important to convey urgency in your ad copy, but dousing it with exclamation points is not the best way to do this. Excessive use of exclamation points, be it multiple in a row (!!!) or throughout the copy (Bright pink lipstick! Luscious color! Buy yours today!), are deemed \u201cscammy\u201d by Google and will result in ad disapprovals. Instead, leverage more sophisticated tactics like <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/08\/18\/ad-customizers\">ad customizers<\/a> and enticing ad copy to woo searchers into taking action.<\/p>\n<h2>Advertising Mistake #8: Skipping Out On Spell Check<\/h2>\n<p>Just use it. Enough said.<\/p>\n<h2>Advertising Mistake #9: Misplacing Apostrophes<\/h2>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/advertising-mistakes-apostrophes.jpg\" alt=\"comic with misused apostrophes\" width=\"500\" height=\"343\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Nothing gets under my skin more than a misplaced apostrophe. Remember, aside from conjugations, the main role of an apostrophe is to indicate possession. However, many people mistakenly use them to demonstrate plurality\u2014a major faux pas.<\/p>\n<p>The use case for apostrophes is simple. To show possession, plug in an apostrophe after your noun and tack on an <em>s<\/em>. However, things get a little trickier when the subject term already ends in an <em>s<\/em> (either because it is a plural or a singular word that ends in <em>s<\/em>). In this case, you can go one of two directions. If you adhere to the AP Style Guide, the apostrophe should appear after the <em>s <\/em>and there is no need to add a second <em>s<\/em>. For example, <em>the kids\u2019 parents were very mean. <\/em>On the flipside, according to the Chicago style, singular nouns that end in <em>s <\/em>get an <em>\u2018s. <\/em>For example, <em>the Lexus\u2019s bumper was dented. <\/em>With words for which the plural term does not end in an <em>s<\/em>, like <em>children<\/em>, the apostrophe is applied after the word and an <em>s<\/em> is added.<\/p>\n<p>There are two major exceptions to this rule that are downright confusing. The biggest culprit is definitely <em>its<\/em> versus <em>it\u2019s<\/em>. Let\u2019s set things straight. In this case, <em>it\u2019s<\/em> serves as a contraction for <em>it is.<\/em> <em>Its<\/em>, without the apostrophe, is the possessive pronoun of it. Another confusing set is <em>whose<\/em> vs. <em>who\u2019s<\/em>. In this case, <em>who\u2019s<\/em> is a contraction of <em>who is <\/em>and <em>whose<\/em> is the possessive of who.<\/p>\n<h2>Advertising Mistake #10: Misusing of Homophones<\/h2>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/advertising-mistakes-homophones.jpg\" alt=\"friends ross complaining about homophones\" width=\"498\" height=\"262\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Homophones are two or more words that have the same pronunciation, but different spellings or meanings.
