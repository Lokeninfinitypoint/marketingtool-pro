Ahrefs, Moz Pro, SEMrush will have a site audit or site crawl tool that allows you to crawl your website and determine not just general search health, but common inefficiencies that are dragging down your site\u2019s organic performance. They\u2019re also replete with other tools\u2014keyword research tools, backlink profiling tools, etc. I would recommend procuring at least the free trial version of one of these tools before attempting a complete SEO audit of your site.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Google Search Console:<\/strong> There are many ways to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/16\/how-to-use-google-search-console\">use Google Search Console<\/a> (formerly Webmaster Tools) for SEO auditing with respect to keywords, organic CTR, technical fixes, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/02\/improve-core-web-vitals\">Core Web Vitals<\/a>, and submitting any pages for reindexing that you have reoptimized as a result of your audit.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Google Analytics:<\/strong> The whole point of an SEO audit is to improve traffic to your site, and as such, you&#8217;ll need Google Analytics to measure the impact of your actions.

A straightforward and time-honored way to build internal links: when you create a new piece of content, do a site search for older, related content which, ideally, has built up some equity; then find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/anchor-text\">anchor text<\/a> within the old content to link to the new content. So, if you\u2019ve created a new resource on Facebook ads:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/SEO-audit-internal-links.png\" alt=\"how to do an seo audit - domain authority from mozbar on SERP\" width=\"1183\" height=\"705\" class=\"alignnone\" \/><\/div>\n<p>These are the pages you\u2019ll want to link from (the top pages on your site related to that keyword, according to Google).<\/p>\n<p>A chrome extension like <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/products\/pro\/seo-toolbar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MozBar<\/a> will give you this view. You\u2019ll want to link from the page with the greatest page authority (PA). Page Authority and Domain Authority (DA) are not \u201cofficial\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/27\/seo-metrics\">SEO metrics<\/a>. Google doesn\u2019t use them to index pages. They were created by SEO software companies to provide estimates of a page\u2019s or a domain\u2019s authority. That said, they\u2019re still pretty accurate; and they\u2019re useful when determining which sites or pages to link from.<\/p>\n<p>You also want to keep in mind user experience and information architecture (IA) when creating internal links. Linking from credible pages isn\u2019t everything. Where would be a genuinely useful place to send a site visitor from a given page? What would bring them closer to purchasing your product or service? We\u2019ll discuss this more in Step 2, but these are good questions to ask yourself when building internal links.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>How to build external links<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Earning links from a diverse set of authoritative domains is the essence of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/12\/domain-authority\">increasing Domain Authority<\/a>. One straightforward way to build external links is to search for resource lists that could realistically feature your content and link to you. So, if you\u2019re running an <a href=\"\/google-seo-guide\">SEO<\/a> audit for a private school in Massachusetts, and you want to make recommendations for external link building:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/seo-audit-external-links.png\" alt=\"how to do an seo audit - domain authority results to identify external links\" width=\"938\" height=\"530\" class=\"alignnone\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cBest prep schools in ma\u201d will yield some nice resource lists that may or may not already feature your client, and that represent good opportunities to reach out for external links.<\/p>\n<p>An easier way to build external links\u2014and a way that yields higher return\u2014is to search for unlinked mentions. Any good SEO tool will have a content explorer tool that allows you to search for places on the web where your brand has been mentioned:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/seo-audit-content-explorer.png\" alt=\"how to do an seo audit - content explorer tool to identify links\" width=\"1149\" height=\"692\" class=\"alignnone\" \/><\/div>\n<p>After sorting by Domain Authority and assuring your target has not already linked to you, you can reach out to content managers via Twitter, email, condor, what have you; ask for links back to your homepage; and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/25\/twitter-link-building\">offer to share their article on your social accounts in return<\/a>.<br \/>\n<a id=\"site_structure\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Step 2: Identify site structure improvements<\/h3>\n<p>Information architecture, or IA, is a pretty sweeping term that basically just means, \u201cThe way information is ordered\/structured.\u201d<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/seo-audit-website-architecture-example.png\" alt=\"seo audit - website architecture\" width=\"650\" height=\"433\" class=\"size-full wp-image-55650 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/seo-audit-website-architecture-example.png 650w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/seo-audit-website-architecture-example-480x320.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/website-architecture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h4><strong>How to improve site architecture<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>For the purposes of an SEO audit, that means redistributing internal linking structures on your website to pass equity to the pages that need it. If your site structure is a mess, here are some tips.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Work closely with developers and designers to develop user-friendly solutions that will improve page authority without compromising UX (User Experience).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Increase number of blog posts per page<\/strong>. If your blog index only lists ten pages at a time, this pushes older posts some 20-30 clicks from your homepage (where the most equity lies). Increase that number of posts per page to bring those older posts closer to the homepage.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Check for overlapping links.<\/strong> Such as the \u201crelated posts\u201d and \u201cpopular posts\u201d sections of your blog or in the header and footer. Replace those duplicate links with links to other pages to which you want to pass equity so you can fully maximize that coveted link space.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Unless you\u2019re auditing your own site, IA-based recommendations should hinge on the goals of project stakeholders. To which pages\/parts of the site are they trying to push users? Is the goal to make the site intuitive or immersive? Your target audience and business goals will inform the way you define and organize content.<br \/>\n<a id=\"thin_content\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Step 3: Find (and fix) thin content<\/h3>\n<p>Speaking of content\u2026your pages aren\u2019t going to get any respect in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/serp\">SERP<\/a> (Search Engine Results Page) if they\u2019re thin. Panda, a 2011 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/12\/07\/google-algorithm-update\">Google algorithm update<\/a> that cracked down on sites with thin content, made sure of that.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThin\u201d content is content that fails to meet user needs. A 300-word blog post explaining a complex concept would be considered thin. That said, it\u2019s not realistic to put 1000-2000 words on every page of your site. Pages closer to your homepage are going to be dominated by design work\u2014hero images, icons, call-to-action buttons\u2014and product-centric copy.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/seo-audit-content-length-by-rank.png\" alt=\"seo audit - content length by rank\" width=\"720\" height=\"524\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-55651\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/seo-audit-content-length-by-rank.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/seo-audit-content-length-by-rank-480x349.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>So, what content should you be looking at?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Select pages<\/strong>. Maybe you&#8217;ve identified pages that have dropped in performance or rank. Or, if you are an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/15\/small-business-seo-services\">SEO service<\/a>, your client has given you a deck of all the pages they\u2019d like audited.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Top pages<\/strong>. Export your top 25, 50, 100 pages by traffic\u2014depending on site size\u2014and make sure each is sufficiently beefed up.<\/li>\n<li><strong>All of it. <\/strong>Most site audit tools within the above SEO software I mentioned will, after crawling your site, offer a broad report on content length and quality.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can then export pages with little to no content and identify page-level action items on how to fix each one.<\/p>\n<p>The two big benefits of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/05\/longform-content\">long-form content<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>More opportunities to link internally.<\/li>\n<li>More opportunities to squeeze in target, ancillary, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/27\/lsi-keywords\">LSI keywords<\/a> that will help that page get found (see Step 5).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><a id=\"duplicate_content\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Step 4: Identify (and nix) duplicate content<\/h3>\n<p>Good news: when scanning for duplicate content, you\u2019re going to be looking at the same subsets of your site that you looked at when you were scanning for thin content. Some SEOs get riled up about duplicate content and the potential site penalties sites could incur as a result. Here\u2019s my take on it:<\/p>\n<p>Google is smart enough to know whether or not you\u2019re intentionally and maliciously duplicating content on your site to clog the SERP with your site\u2019s URLs. In all likelihood, you\u2019re not. A more likely scenario, if you have duplicate content, is that it\u2019s happening unintentionally.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps your CMS (Content Management System) is dynamically generating new pages that are similar in appearance and that haven\u2019t been manually canonicalized in Search Console. WordPress does this with archive pages.<\/p>\n<p>Even still, anything that causes Google&#8217;s crawlers to have to do more thinking or more work can hinder your SEO.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/seo-audit-duplicate-content.png\" alt=\"how to do an seo audit - duplicate content\" width=\"342\" height=\"276\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55652\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/goldsteinbrossard.com\/blog\/duplicate-content\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re concerned about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/30\/google-penalty\">incurring Google penalties<\/a> for unintentional duplicate content, <a href=\"https:\/\/webmasters.googleblog.com\/2008\/09\/demystifying-duplicate-content-penalty.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this post from Google<\/a> should set you at ease.<br \/>\n<a id=\"keyword_optimization\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Step 5: Scan for keyword optimization<\/h3>\n<p>As with beefing up thin content, there are certain pages on your site where it\u2019s not going to be feasible to <em>fully <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/11\/14\/how-to-rank-for-a-keyword\">optimize for target and ancillary keywords<\/a>.

It wouldn\u2019t necessarily make sense, for instance, to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/www.seroundtable.com\/google-url-change-old-new-content-25675.html&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXtaai3d3bAhWQuFMKHaeTB3QQFggRMAQ&amp;client=internal-uds-cse&amp;cx=000441450357890335581:cd9ewuhjkd8&amp;usg=AOvVaw0_Sw4rz-mf05zUBmJufbuz\">change a URL<\/a> simply to optimize for a new keyword.<br \/>\n<a id=\"meta_tags\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Step 6: Make sure meta tags are optimized<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/meta-tags\">Meta tags<\/a> consist of a meta title and a meta description. They help Google determine the content of the page it\u2019s crawling, and are two of the bigger factors Google takes into account when determining the order in which to rank pages. They also help users looking through search results determine the content of your page, and as such, act as promotions for your content.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/seo-audit-meta-tags.png\" alt=\"how to do an seo audit - meta title, meta description, URL example\" width=\"788\" height=\"123\" class=\"alignnone\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Using your vertical-specific keyword research, write or rewrite your meta tags, making sure to optimize them for the keywords that will help them show up in search.<\/p>\n<p>With meta tags especially\u2014though this is also important for general <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/12\/03\/seo-copywriting\">SEO copywriting<\/a>\u2014you want to avoid squeezing in keywords for the sake of squeezing in keywords, also known as keyword stuffing. \u201c10 Great Instagram Captions, Good Instagram Captions, and Funny Instagram Captions That Will Make You ROFL\u201d is not a good title.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>How to optimize meta titles<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Google displays the first 50-60 characters of your title. After that, it truncates the title with an ellipsis. Not only can this cause vital keywords to be omitted from being crawled, but it just flat out looks bad in the SERP.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep your titles under 60 characters, and 90% of them will avoid truncation. This <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/learn\/seo\/title-tag\">useful, free tool from Moz<\/a> helps with title creation.<\/li>\n<li>Your target keyword should exist in totality in your title.<\/li>\n<li>Include your brand name in the title to piggyback off its authority.<br \/>\nFor example: Target Keyword | Brand Name.

As such, regular updates will help <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/29\/fresh-content-google-ranking-factor\">keep your pages fresh and relevant<\/a> in the eyes of the search engine.<\/p>\n<p>There are two types of content that should be updated regularly:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Top pages<\/strong>, which I discussed in Step 3. These are the pages that drive the most traffic for your business. Updating them assures they\u2019ll continue to drive traffic for your business.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Opportunity pages.<\/strong> An opportunity page is a page which, if it were to move up slightly in the SERP, would gain a meaningful<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/14\/increase-traffic-to-my-website\"> increase in traffic<\/a>. Popular SEO products are equipped with rank trackers that allow you to see where pages rank for certain keywords, if those rankings have changed, and how much traffic is being generated from each keyword.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/seo-audit-page-2.png\" alt=\"how to do an SEO audit - list of pages on page 2 of SERP\" width=\"1726\" height=\"676\" class=\"alignnone\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Pages just outside the top 10. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>Pages that rank just outside the top 10 should be updated religiously to give them a chance to move up to page one. A similar approach should be taken with pages that rank just outside the top 3. Traffic falls off precipitously after the first 3 spots, and nearly altogether after the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/19\/get-on-first-page-google\">first page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>How to make page updates<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>You can check out our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/03\/get-more-traffic-from-evergreen-content\">post on how to update evergreen content<\/a> but here are some key pointers.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Add new information and research.<\/strong> For example, if you have a blog post about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/12\/07\/google-algorithm-update\">Google algorithm updates<\/a>, and a new algorithm update just came out, that post is ripe for an update. Keeping your content up to date will ensure that your organic visitors\u2019 needs are being met, so they don\u2019t bounce back to the SERP and click another result (which can ultimately harm your rankings).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Add keywords.<\/strong> Identify related, ancillary keywords that have shown to be traffic drivers and add those keywords to your page.<\/li>\n<li><strong>General housekeeping.<\/strong> Compress images and fix or eliminate broken links. Cumbersome <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/08\/image-seo\">images<\/a> result in slow load times (more in Step 8). Broken links result in a poor user experience (more in Step 9). Remedying these on-page elements can give your page the boost it needs to achieve the desired ranking.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pruning content.<\/strong> A fourth type of content update is actually removing content from your site. It may seem counterintuitive, but if there are pages on your site that get little to no organic traffic, they may be hurting your overall organic rankings by lowering the average value of your site in Google\u2019s eyes. Look for pages with 0 or close to 0 organic visits in the past year, and if you can\u2019t overhaul the pages right away to add more value, deindex them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a id=\"pagespeed\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Step 8: Run page speed analytics<\/h3>\n<p>Page speed is vital\u2014especially after Google dropped its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/01\/22\/google-speed-update\">Speed Update<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/19\/core-web-vitals-google-page-experience-update\">Page Experience Update<\/a>. This is partly due to increases in mobile searching. Anyone using a phone to look for stuff on the internet isn&#8217;t going to wait around for a slow-loading site. That means the faster your site is, the more likely Google is to reward you with strong organic rankings.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/speed\/pagespeed\/insights\/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nhlottery.com%2FHomepage&amp;tab=desktop\">PageSpeed Insights<\/a> is going to be your go-to tool here.

Run each image listed in the report through a simple image compressor like <a href=\"https:\/\/compressor.io\/compress\">this one<\/a>, then re-upload them to your CMS. Depending on the before-and-after sizes of your images, you stand to gain a substantial increase in performance.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Implement <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/08\/lazy-loading-seo\">lazy loading.<\/a><\/strong> This will make sure the &#8220;first paint&#8221; of your website occurs as quickly as possible.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Check for common mistakes.<\/strong> Here are some <a href=\"https:\/\/searchenginewatch.com\/2017\/09\/13\/what-may-be-slowing-your-site-down-and-how-to-fix-it\/\">common things that could be slowing down your site<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a id=\"site_errors\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Step 9: Scan for site errors<\/h3>\n<p>A 404 is a \u201cpage not found\u201d error, generally caused by broken links and images within your site. For example, if a page on your site links to a piece of content that has since been deleted, anyone who clicks that link will get a 404 error.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/404-graphic.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"267\" height=\"388\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52660\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/404-graphic.png 1000w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/404-graphic-207x300.png 207w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/404-graphic-706x1024.png 706w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/404-graphic-768x1114.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Contrary to popular opinion, broken links don\u2019t result in site penalties. As content cycles in and out, and your site\u2019s structure changes over time, 404s occur naturally. That said, broken links in inopportune places can fracture your internal linking structure. They can also be a pain in the ass for users trying to navigate from one page to another.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>How to find and fix broken links<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Site audit tools have the ability to identify all the 404s within your site. Once you identify them, fixing them is a matter of determining how important each link is to your linking structure and user experience. Have a page which no longer exists, or which now exists at a new URL? It\u2019s a good idea to make sure all high-traffic pages which formerly linked to that page now 301 redirect to the new page; or, that they at least redirect back your home page.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/broken-link-checker\/nibppfobembgfmejpjaaeocbogeonhch?hl=en\">This chrome extension<\/a> is useful for identifying broken links on a page-by-page basis.<br \/>\n<a id=\"https\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Step 10: Switch from HTTP to HTTPS<\/h3>\n<p>In today\u2019s digital marketing landscape, running on HTTP is a decided no-no. HTTPS is faster, more secure, and is one of Google\u2019s ranking signals.<\/p>\n<p>Checking to make sure your site is running on HTTPS is as simple as manually entering the various non-HTTPS iterations of your site domain\u2014www.site.com; site.com; http:\/\/www.site.com\u2014and making sure they\u2019ve all been 301 redirected to the HTTPS iteration.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll then want to scour the search index for places where non-HTTPS URLs appear. You can use the <a href=\"https:\/\/search.google.com\/search-console\/not-verified?original_url=\/search-console\/index&amp;original_resource_id\">Index Status<\/a> report in Search Console to see which version of your site\u2019s URLs are canonicalized. If you have to, manually canonicalize the HTTPS versions.<\/p>\n<p>For a <em>super <\/em>in-depth guide on making the switch from HTTP to HTTPS, read <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/2017\/06\/guide-switching-http-https\/\">this<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Use this SEO audit checklist to get more traffic and rank higher<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s a reason there\u2019s no one prescribed recipe for a successful SEO audit.
