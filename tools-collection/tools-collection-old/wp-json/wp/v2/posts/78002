If you clicked the link we added to the introduction of this guide, the website you landed on would count your visit as referral traffic.<\/p>\n<p>By comparison, the other common website traffic sources are search and direct traffic. Search traffic comes from visitors clicking on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/serp\">search engine results<\/a>. Direct traffic is from visitors that go directly to your website, like if they type your URL into their browser.<\/p>\n<p>Examples of referral traffic sources can include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Social media apps like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-competitors\">Instagram<\/a> or X (formerly known as Twitter)<\/li>\n<li>Online directories like Yelp or Angi<\/li>\n<li>Just about any non-search engine website like a blog post<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\ud83d\udc4b Need to get more website visitors?

Here are three reasons why.<\/p>\n<h3>Generate more potential leads<\/h3>\n<p>At the most basic level, increasing referral traffic means increasing the number of potential customers who visit your website.<\/p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s not just more people coming in through your virtual door. It\u2019s people that found you by actively clicking a link that interested them. So if the backlink they clicked is relevant to your website, those visitors have a high intent to learn about, and maybe purchase, what you sell.<\/p>\n<h3>Get more traffic from search engines<\/h3>\n<p>Backlinks from high-quality websites are a signal to search engines that your website is trustworthy.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Referral-traffic-wordstream-chart-SEO.webp\" alt=\"Referral traffic - Graphic showing main SEO ranking factors\" width=\"858\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-78005 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Referral-traffic-wordstream-chart-SEO.webp 858w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Referral-traffic-wordstream-chart-SEO-480x336.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 858px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Backlinks are still an influential search engine ranking factor, as shown in this graph from <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/firstpagesage.com\/seo-blog\/the-google-algorithm-ranking-factors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>FirstPageSage<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>As your backlink profile and referral traffic grow, you\u2019ll land on more search engine results pages and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">generate more traffic<\/a> from them.<\/p>\n<h3>Reduce your reliance on Google<\/h3>\n<p>Google is a fantastic source of traffic.

But how do we go about getting more of it? Let\u2019s dive in.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Get listed in online directories<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/03\/01\/business-directory-listings\">Online directories<\/a> are like the phonebooks of the digital age. People look to websites like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/07\/22\/yelp-reviews\">Yelp<\/a>, the Better Business Bureau, and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/angi-business-listing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Angi<\/a> (formerly Angi\u2019s List) to find the services and business they need.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Referral-traffic-wordstream-example-Yelp.webp\" alt=\"Referral traffic - screenshot from Yelp\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-78007 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Referral-traffic-wordstream-example-Yelp.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Referral-traffic-wordstream-example-Yelp-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Yelp is one of the most popular <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/06\/listings-management-tools\"><em>business directories<\/em><\/a><em>, but there are dozens of others that will help increase your online footprint.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Ideally, you want exposure on as many directories as possible. But you also want to make sure that your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/04\/12\/local-citations\">information is current<\/a>, so no one gets frustrated trying to reach you. You can even <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/optimize-google-my-business-listing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">optimize your listings<\/a> with things like images, service descriptions, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">reviews<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udea8 Not sure if your directory listings are up to par?

Submit guest posts<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/06\/21\/guest-posting-dos-donts\">Guest posts<\/a> are a great way to build up referral traffic. The idea is to reach out to websites that want content, and offer to write a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/09\/how-to-write-a-blog-post\">blog post<\/a> in exchange for the backlinks they provide.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s best to focus your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/guest-posting-guidelines\">guest posting<\/a> efforts on sites that are related to your business, which means your content will be in front of a relevant audience providing top-notch referral traffic. If you can set up a regular guest posting schedule, all the better, because that allows you to keep your referral traffic from those sources steady over time and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/14\/increase-traffic-to-my-website\">increase traffic to your website<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Write press releases<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/04\/how-to-write-a-press-release\">Press releases<\/a> are a quick and easy way to get a wave of fresh traffic from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/referring-url\">referring URLs<\/a>. It\u2019s a great idea to do a press release for an event you\u2019ll be hosting or to announce milestones like executive changes, earnings releases, acquisitions, and product launches.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Referral-traffic-wordstream-example-flounders.webp\" alt=\"Referral traffic - Press release from a brewery\" width=\"441\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-78008 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Referral-traffic-wordstream-example-flounders.webp 441w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Referral-traffic-wordstream-example-flounders-221x300.webp 221w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A press release is great for promoting new products or events while generating valuable referral traffic from the publications that pick it up.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>But to be honest, if you are paying for a press release, you can write about pretty much anything and pretend it\u2019s newsworthy. Some businesses even send out press releases whenever they get a new client.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Get active on social media<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/social-media-marketing\">Social media sites<\/a> are also natural contenders for bringing in referral traffic. Plus, there are several options to fit your brand and audience.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/10\/facebook-post-ideas\">Facebook<\/a>, for example, is fantastic for an older audience and organizing events. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/23\/tiktok-marketing\">TikTok<\/a> caters to a younger crowd and lets you show off your video flair. And of course, there\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/08\/linkedin-pulse\">LinkedIn<\/a>, if your target customer is of a professional mindset.<\/p>\n<p>No matter which social media platforms you choose, make sure your posts have a clear <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/09\/call-to-action#:~:text=A%20good%20example%20of%20a,that%20action%20(save%20money).\">call to action<\/a> that leads people to your website. That\u2019s how you drive referral traffic from social media apps.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Referral-traffic-wordstream-example-Yelp-2.webp\" alt=\"Referral traffic - Instagram post from Accessible Community \" width=\"433\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-78009 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Referral-traffic-wordstream-example-Yelp-2.webp 433w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Referral-traffic-wordstream-example-Yelp-2-217x300.webp 217w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 433px) 100vw, 433px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Depending on the platform, you can add CTA links, buttons, or text in the caption.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>5. Create link-worthy content<\/h3>\n<p>If you want to catch <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/10\/link-building-secrets\">backlinks<\/a> and increase the traffic you get from other websites, you need the right bait. In this case, we\u2019re talking about content that other websites want to link to.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few types of content that writers and marketers love to link to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Original data:<\/strong> Statistics from a survey or data your app captures<\/li>\n<li><strong>Infographics:<\/strong> A roundup of statistics or a visual presentation of a process<\/li>\n<li><strong>Opinionated blog posts:<\/strong> A fresh take on a common question in your industry<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve created your backlink magnet, share it with publications and thought leaders in your industry so they can link back to your site.<\/p>\n<h3>Referral traffic the easy way<\/h3>\n<p>Referral traffic is an important source of new potential customers.
