We\u2019ll admit it: unlike Facebook, LinkedIn is not for every business. But that doesn\u2019t mean that it isn\u2019t useful.<\/p>\n<p>There are tons of B2B marketers out there leveraging LinkedIn advertising to spread brand awareness and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/07\/linkedin-lead-generation\">drive lead generation<\/a>. This is the largest stage for business-minded social interactions. If you are targeting c-suite professionals, providing educational material to marketers, or just spreading brand awareness, LinkedIn advertising is the solution for you.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/social-media-advertising-linkedin-logo-2.png\" alt=\"Social media advertising LinkedIn logo\" width=\"779\" height=\"220\" \/><\/div>\n<p>First things first, if you are going to <a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/marketing-solutions\/ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">advertise on LinkedIn<\/a>, your company needs to have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/02\/25\/how-to-creatively-use-linkedin-company-pages\">LinkedIn company page<\/a> to publish content. Once you have that all set up, you can dive into the specifics of LinkedIn Ads. Don\u2019t worry \u2013 I\u2019m here to help with those.<\/p>\n<p>In this comprehensive LinkedIn advertising guide, I\u2019ll review everything you need to know to get started, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>LinkedIn ad types and formats<\/li>\n<li>Remarketing with LinkedIn advertising<\/li>\n<li>LinkedIn advertising targeting options<\/li>\n<li>Linkedin advertising best practices<\/li>\n<li>Linkedin advertising examples<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>LinkedIn ad types<\/h2>\n<p>Like other social advertising platforms, LinkedIn advertising offers you a variety of ad types and formats to play with.\u00a0And, like other platforms, you should be selecting your ad format based on the overall action you want to drive. Across all their offerings, LinkedIn advertising\u00a0supports brand awareness, website visits, engagement, video views, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/17\/generate-leads-linkedin\">lead generation<\/a>, site conversions, and job applications.<\/p>\n<h3>LinkedIn sponsored content<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/marketing-solutions\/native-advertising\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sponsored content ads<\/a> look and feel native to the LinkedIn platform. These are the ads that appear to be \u201cboosted\u201d posts from a company\u2019s own feed. Your ads manager can create a typical post with a headline, image and link to sponsor. Or you can create carousel ads, video ads, and lead generation ads that appear in the same \u201cboosted\u201d format.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/linkedin-advertising-sponsored-content.jpg\" alt=\"LinkedIn advertising sponsored content\" width=\"602\" height=\"514\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>LinkedIn text ads<\/h3>\n<p>LinkedIn text ads are the closest to Google or Bing search ads that you can get on the platform. <a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/marketing-solutions\/ppc-advertising\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn text ads<\/a> operate on a familiar pay-per-click or impression basis, and they\u2019re featured in the sidebar. These are admittedly kind of boring for a social platform \u2013 a basic text block with a headline, next to a company logo.<\/p>\n<h3>LinkedIn Sponsored InMail<\/h3>\n<p>Know that feeling when you log into LinkedIn and have 10 new messages? It\u2019s likely that some of those are marketers <a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/marketing-solutions\/sponsored-inmail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">popping into your inbox through Sponsored InMail<\/a> for a pretty penny. Marketers or sales teams can curate a list of contacts to send personalized messages to. The content of the messages is largely up to you \u2013 you want to invite prospects to events or even attempt to generate an inbound call.<\/p>\n<h3>LinkedIn programmatic display ads<\/h3>\n<p>LinkedIn joined the fray of programmatic offerings, which is great news for B2B advertisers who rarely have good options for targeting. <a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/marketing-solutions\/dynamic-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">With these display ads<\/a>, you can target the largest professional audience based on intent or personas \u2013 but more on LinkedIn advertising targeting options later. In terms of ad creative, it\u2019s your run-of-the-mill display ads. Marketers can choose their preferred demand-side platform or trading desk and buy inventory through open or private auctions.<\/p>\n<h3>LinkedIn dynamic ads<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/marketing-solutions\/dynamic-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dynamic ads<\/a> are basically as personalized as you can get with your LinkedIn advertising. Advertisers can choose to promote job postings, content downloads, their own <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/19\/linkedin-company-page-features-examples\">company page<\/a>, or drive traffic to a website via spotlight ads, which also appear on the newsfeed. This ad type also has set templates and auto-translation options to make personalizing the ad creative easy for you.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/linkedin-advertising-elevate-1.jpg\" alt=\"LinkedIn Elevate\" width=\"880\" height=\"530\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Bonus: Elevate<\/h3>\n<p>Plot twist: <a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/elevate?trk=elevate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Elevate is not an ad<\/a>, per se, but it works as a\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0advertising solution. Elevate is a platform that a company can pay for their employees to become brand advocates. Basically, it makes it easier for your marketing or sales team to control or suggest content that your employees share on LinkedIn. Should employees be sharing your suggested content anyway? Probably. But this spoon-feeds posts and moves the needle \u2013 my company saw three hires learn about us from Elevate posts and had $20k+ in earned media!<\/p>\n<h2>LinkedIn advertising costs<\/h2>\n<p>As on other platforms, LinkedIn advertising costs are determined by your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/help\/linkedin\/answer\/7431\/linkedin-s-advertising-cost-bid-types?lang=en\">bids and budgets<\/a>. This means that your overall ad spend will vary depending on your business and your goals, because this determines the types of ads that you choose for your campaigns and the budgets that you set.<\/p>\n<p>However, LinkedIn advertising\u00a0does come\u00a0a few minimums that all advertisers must spend:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>$10 daily budget per campaign<\/li>\n<li>$10 total budget per campaign (an optional feature for Sponsored Content)<\/li>\n<li>$2 bid for CPC or CPM on Text Ad campaigns<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>LinkedIn advertising <em>also<\/em> has a minimum bid for Sponsored Content campaigns, but the exact for this ad will depend on the audience that you\u2019re targeting. Which brings us to\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>LinkedIn advertising targeting options<\/h2>\n<p>This is where LinkedIn advertising\u00a0gets exciting. The targeting on this social platform is better than most. It\u2019s regularly updated and thorough, because professionals like to brag about all of their promotions and achievements. Members contribute their own job titles, company names, seniority, professional interests, and more. With over <a href=\"https:\/\/foundationinc.co\/lab\/b2b-marketing-linkedin-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">500 million members consisting of 73 million senior-level influencers and 45 million decision makers<\/a>, it\u2019s extremely likely your LinkedIn ads\u00a0are\u00a0going to land in front of the right eyeballs.<\/p>\n<h3>Matched audiences<\/h3>\n<p>To get started, you should place a tag on your website to be able to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/12\/linkedin-retargeting\">retarget your visitors on LinkedIn<\/a>, just as you would set up for Facebook or Google. LinkedIn calls their tag an \u201cInsight Tag,\u201d and it can also be used to create lookalike audiences. In addition to targeting your website visitors, you can also upload or integrate email lists and run account-based targeting through LinkedIn.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t have enough website visitors or sales prospects to build out a viable campaign audience? No problem! LinkedIn advertising\u00a0features an audience option that expands your reach through their network of publishers. This is generally brand-safe, but beware \u2013 it can make your audience large.<\/p>\n<p>Aside from the basic Insight Tag, you can also place conversion tracking on your LinkedIn advertising campaigns. These triggers are great to track unique purchases or other actions on your site, especially if you do not use a marketing automation system to create unique landing pages and forms.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/linkedin-advertising-forecasted-results-matched20audience.jpg\" alt=\"forecasted results\" width=\"461\" height=\"648\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Audience options<\/h3>\n<p>LinkedIn ads\u00a0come\u00a0with exhaustive options for targeting, which means that you\u2019re able to make sure your ads are getting served to the right people. If you are interested in testing the effectiveness of an ad against different audiences, you can save your audience as a template to layer on later.<\/p>\n<p>To set up your LinkedIn advertising\u00a0targeting, start with the basics first: language and location. You can choose a permanent geolocation as specified in user profiles, i.e., \u201cThe Greater New York Area,\u201d or shorter-term location based on IP address.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve determined the language and location, you can narrow down your audience based on these targeting options available.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/linkedin-advertising-audience-targeting-options-1.jpg\" alt=\"LinkedIn advertising audience targeting options\" width=\"947\" height=\"344\" \/><\/div>\n<h4><em>Company<\/em><\/h4>\n<p>Targeting by company is especially useful if your sales team has defined verticals. An added bonus, LinkedIn advertising offers\u00a0the best targeting by company option compared to other platforms (ahem, Facebook or Twitter), because members are far more likely to keep their employment info up-to-date.<\/p>\n<p>If targeting a specific company isn\u2019t right for your strategy, you can still use this targeting option to narrow down your audience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Company<\/strong>\u00a0<strong>c<\/strong><strong>onnections<\/strong>: LinkedIn allows you to target first-degree connections of selected companies \u2013 if they have over 500 employees.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Company<\/strong> <strong>f<\/strong><strong>ollowers<\/strong>: This selection will let you reach your company page followers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Industries<\/strong>: Based on the primary industry listed on company pages, you can reach LinkedIn members employed in those industries.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Names<\/strong>: Reach employees based on the company name listed on their profiles.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Size<\/strong>: Based on the number of employees listed on a company profile, you can reach employees who work at companies of a certain size.<\/p>\n<h4><em>Demographic<\/em><\/h4>\n<p>This is much simpler: Add members to your audience that are of a certain age or gender, which is inferred from their profile.<\/p>\n<h4><em>Education<\/em><\/h4>\n<p>LinkedIn Ads lets you reach members based on their degrees, fields of study (e.g., \u201cMarketing,\u201d or \u201cJournalism\u201d), and the institution they attended.<\/p>\n<h4><em>Job experience<\/em><\/h4>\n<p>Like targeting by company, building an audience based on jobs is done best on LinkedIn.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Functions or skills<\/strong>: You can build an audience composed of tasks in their job positions or skills listed in their profiles. The skills can also be gleaned from endorsements from connections.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Seniorities, titles, or experience<\/strong>: Reach LinkedIn members with a certain level of seniority, a job title, or years of experience listed on their page. Heads up: If there are gaps or overlaps on someone\u2019s jobs, those are not counted!<\/p>\n<h4><em>Interests<\/em><\/h4>\n<p>LinkedIn introduced <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/25\/linkedin-interest-targeting\">interest-based targeting<\/a> just recently. Now, you can include users who have joined groups around certain interests \u2013 like brand marketing or digital advertising \u2013 and people with interests that align with your business.<\/p>\n<p>If you target certain job titles, companies of a specific size, and followers of your company page, remember that LinkedIn creates the audience based on an \u201cAND\u201d statement, which can easily shrink your audience to an unrealistic size. Don\u2019t worry! You can also elect to exclude certain criteria as well.<\/p>\n<p>I recommend choosing one grouping to focus on: Create an audience that targets by job function and a different one targeting by groups. Then you can easily measure how your ads resonate and adjust bidding accordingly. LinkedIn Ads do not have you compete against yourself, so if there is overlap \u2013 a member who exists in more than one of your audiences \u2013 you won\u2019t pay double to reach them.<\/p>\n<p>Depending how big your audience is and the type of ads you run, LinkedIn generally recommends a certain level of saturation in your advertising strategy. The higher the impression rate, the more likely a prospect is to click on your ad. Is that expensive? Definitely. Effective? Find out for yourself!<\/p>\n<p>Quick update: You can now segment your LinkedIn Ad traffic according to job function, company, company size, and more.

That, dear readers, is why I want to wrap up with some time-tested <strong>LinkedIn advertising best practices<\/strong>. Here\u2019s three to take with you as you get started!<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">1. Think carefully about the customer journey<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let\u2019s return to those ad types we talked about earlier. When you\u2019re just getting started with LinkedIn advertising, it may be tempting to try all the different products the platform has to offer. Here\u2019s why that\u2019s a mistake: <strong>Different LinkedIn ad types are appropriate for different stages of the customer journey.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Take Sponsored InMail, for example\u2014the ad type that allows you to contact your LinkedIn prospects directly through their personal inboxes. I feel strongly about this, so I\u2019ll be frank: Using Sponsored InMail as the first touchpoint between you and your LinkedIn prospects is a <strong>bad idea<\/strong>. Why? Because people, generally speaking, don\u2019t enjoy getting message notifications from strangers who work at companies they\u2019ve never heard of. As a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/12\/marketing-ideas\">marketing tactic<\/a>, that\u2019s about as invasive, pushy, and counterproductive as it gets.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/linkedin-advertising-marketing-funnel.png\" alt=\"linkedin-advertising-marketing-funnel-stages-illustration\" width=\"688\" height=\"830\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I\u2019m not saying you should drop Sponsored InMail from your LinkedIn advertising strategy overall. What I <em>am<\/em> saying is that you should use Sponsored InMail <strong>sparingly<\/strong> as a way to re-engage prospects who\u2019ve already interacted with your business in meaningful ways. A mid-funnel prospect will be far more open to sales messages than a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/07\/marketing-funnel\">high-funnel prospect<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">2. Layer your targeting options (but not too much)<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As we saw earlier, there\u2019s no shortage of LinkedIn advertising targeting options. As a digital marketer, you should be thrilled about this\u2014more targeting options means more valuable opportunities! Allow me to explain.<\/p>\n<p>No matter which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/06\/18\/marketing-channels\">digital advertising platform<\/a> you\u2019re looking at, the whole point of targeting options is to enable advertisers to reach the people most likely to become their customers. LinkedIn, of course, is no exception. The closer you can get to reaching <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/23\/buyer-personas\">your ideal customer<\/a>, the less money you\u2019ll waste on impressions and clicks from users who present no value to your business. <strong>Layering multiple LinkedIn targeting options is the only way to do this<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you\u2019re using LinkedIn advertising to promote a software solution that helps small restaurants optimize their online presence. If targeting users who work in the food service industry is the only parameter you set, you\u2019re going to waste a ton of money. Alternatively, if you layer a variety of parameters in order to target owners of small restaurants, you\u2019d drive substantially better results!<\/p>\n<p>A word of warning: Don\u2019t layer your LinkedIn advertising targeting options <strong>too much<\/strong>. If you go too far, you\u2019ll target an extremely narrow audience and miss some valuable opportunities.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">3. Glean insights from other advertising platforms<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My apologies to anyone advertising <em>exclusively<\/em> on LinkedIn\u2014this final best practice is for those of you who are also leveraging platforms like Google Ads, Bing Ads, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/01\/31\/low-budget-facebook-ad-campaigns\">Facebook Ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Although every digital advertising platform is unique\u2014people use Google actively and Facebook passively, for example\u2014it\u2019s generally a good idea to give your prospects a fairly cohesive experience across all the places they\u2019re interacting with your business. From a tactical standpoint, that means <strong>repurposing the ad copy and targeting parameters that work really well on other platforms<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Take a look at the handful of Google ads that drive your best click-through rates and conversion rates. From a copy perspective, are there any themes that carry across these ads? Any particular words, phrases, or tones that seem to resonate really well with your prospects? If so, try implementing those copy elements into your LinkedIn ads.<\/p>\n<p>Now, take a look at the handful of <em>Facebook<\/em> ads that drive your best click-through rates and conversion rates. Feel free to derive inspiration from this copy as well, but what I\u2019m really interested in are the targeting parameters. Are there any <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/12\/11\/facebook-custom-audience-strategy\">custom audiences<\/a> that respond especially well to your marketing messages? Does it seem like past website visitors are particularly open to remarketing? Once again, you may find that these insights are applicable to your LinkedIn advertising campaigns as well.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">5 LinkedIn advertising examples to\u00a0inspire you<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As helpful as it is to go into your first LinkedIn advertising campaign with a handful of best practices, it\u2019s equally important that you get a strong sense of what LinkedIn ads actually look like in action. So, we\u2019ve assembled a quick list of five LinkedIn advertising examples that you can use for inspiration.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">1. SurveyMonkey<\/h3>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/linkedin-advertising-survey-monkey-example.png\" alt=\"linkedin-advertising-example-survey-monkey\" width=\"546\" height=\"503\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This one from SurveyMonkey is terrific simply because of how well it\u2019s targeted towards me. As a content marketer, I\u2019m often tasked with writing case studies\u2014a type of content that happens to be one of the most difficult to execute effectively.<\/p>\n<p>On top of meeting a pain point shared by many marketers, this ad also does a great job of enticing users to click. The featured image\u2014in addition to being exceptionally designed\u2014is awesome because it draws users in with the implication that the guide being promoted is accessible to everyone: <em>\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014the road to writing better case studies takes just three simple steps. You\u2019ve got this.\u201d\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">2. Instapage<\/h3>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/linkedin-advertising-instapage-example.png\" alt=\"linkedin-advertising-example-instapage\" width=\"541\" height=\"440\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The simplicity and directness of Instapage\u2019s value proposition is what I love about this LinkedIn ad. With a single sentence, Instapage successfully addresses two major pain points: (1) the difficulty of creating personalized advertising experiences and (2) the amount of time it takes to build an effective landing page. That\u2019s great copywriting!<\/p>\n<p>I also appreciate the thoughtful use of contrast in this LinkedIn ad; the blue of the \u201cRequest A Demo\u201d CTA button stands out nicely against the silvery background. If you don\u2019t clearly direct your prospects\u2019 attention to a CTA, you may as well not invest in LinkedIn advertising.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">3. Airtable<\/h3>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/linkedin-advertising-airtable-example.png\" alt=\"linkedin-advertising-example-airtable\" width=\"540\" height=\"440\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Like Instapage, Airtable nails it with their value proposition\u2014it\u2019s succinct, memorable, and thoughtful. Even if a particular user doesn\u2019t click on this LinkedIn ad, you better believe they\u2019ll remember the value Airtable offers to their customers.<\/p>\n<p>Another really strong component of this ad is the alignment between the <strong>offer it\u2019s making<\/strong> and <strong>the depth of the relationship between Airtable and its target audience<\/strong>. This is undoubtedly a top-of-funnel Linked ad\u2014used to drive awareness, not sales. Recognizing that the users who are seeing this ad are relatively unfamiliar with their company, the marketers over at Airtable decided to put forth a low-stakes offer\u2014a free content calendar template\u2014that still manages to demonstrate the value of the company.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">4. Verifyed<\/h3>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/linkedin-advertising-verifyed-example.jpg\" alt=\"linkedin-advertising-example-verifyed\" width=\"542\" height=\"460\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once again we have an example of a LinkedIn ad that could not be better targeted towards me. Because a big part of my job is writing about trends in digital marketing, this piece of content from Verifyed regarding influencer marketing is virtually irresistible.<\/p>\n<p>But that\u2019s not what puts it over the edge and makes it a great LinkedIn ad; what makes it a great LinkedIn ad is the fact that it <strong>doesn\u2019t feel like an ad<\/strong>. When I first came across this offer in my LinkedIn feed, I could have sworn it was an organic post. Because people tend to be more trusting of organic posts than advertisements, emulating this example from Verifyed would be a smart move on your part.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">5. Music and Arts<\/h3>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/linkedin-advertising-music-and-arts-example.jpg\" alt=\"linkedin-advertising-example-music-and-arts\" width=\"541\" height=\"499\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Somehow, the marketing team over at Music and Arts found out that I\u2019m a music fanatic. I don\u2019t know how they did it, but what I <em>do<\/em> know is that they most certainly got my attention. Talk about a thumb-stopping LinkedIn ad!<\/p>\n<p>What I love most about this example is the fact that it takes advantage of the carousel format\u2014a type of LinkedIn ad that enables you to share a series of clickable cards. As you can see, this ad gave me the option of scrolling through several different links and selecting the one that resonated most deeply. No matter which vertical you operate in, we recommend breaking away from the typical single-image mold and giving the carousel format a try!<\/p>\n<h2>Go for a test drive with LinkedIn advertising<\/h2>\n<p>When LinkedIn first began dabbling in advertising, managed accounts meant that you would work with customer service reps and commit to a fixed amount of money. Luckily, LinkedIn advertising has moved changed significantly over the past few years and now offers a self-service platform that recently got a UX upgrade.<\/p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/hi6x2nwLXHc?autoplay=0&amp;start=22&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>If you\u2019re worried about spending too much money, the platform makes it easy to set budgets, bid types, and end dates.
