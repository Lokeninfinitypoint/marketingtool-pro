But if the goal is to be a universal scheduling app for any business, this feedback would be really helpful.<\/p>\n<p>ChatGPT also gave links to a review of the platform and a Reddit discussion about it. The brand could use them to update its website, guide <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/26\/influencer-marketing\">influencer marketing<\/a> initiatives, and jump into Reddit discussions to change how people think about its product.<\/p>\n<h4>How to use this tip<\/h4>\n<p>This was such a useful and straightforward idea.

For example, you could ask, \u201cWhat are the best mountain bikes for kids?\u201d or \u201cWhat\u2019s the best budget-friendly social media software.\u201d If your product doesn\u2019t show, use AI to figure out why.<\/p>\n<p>Take it a step further and ask AI how you can reposition your product for a particular market segment. Rippling could follow up and ask how to position its app for a broader audience or specifically for small businesses.<\/p>\n<div id=\"mine-subreddits-for-customer-intel\"><\/div>\n<h3>2.

It surfaces so much useful feedback that I had to keep myself from continuing down too many Reddit rabbit holes.<\/p>\n<p>I chose Semrush as a test subject because I knew it was a popular topic on Reddit. I used Gemini for this test since it can access links (some tools, like the free version of Claude, can\u2019t).<\/p>\n<p>To start, I gave Gemini the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SEO\/comments\/1eyl1ck\/semrush_is_it_essential_or_are_there_better\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">link to a Reddit conversation<\/a> titled \u201cSemrush &#8211; is it essential or are there better alternatives?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Gemini spit out a brief summary of the thread. Then I asked it a series of questions, like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are the most common adjectives used to describe Semrush?<\/li>\n<li>What are the most common negatives mentioned about Semrush?<\/li>\n<li>What challenges do people say they have that Semrush solves?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Every question netted a lot of helpful information. Here\u2019s what Gemini listed as common adjectives:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/AI-in-marketing-wordstream-semrush-common-adjectives-1024x467.webp\" alt=\"AI in marketing - list of adjectives for Semrush.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"467\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88507 size-large\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/AI-in-marketing-wordstream-semrush-common-adjectives-980x447.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/AI-in-marketing-wordstream-semrush-common-adjectives-480x219.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And here\u2019s part of its answer to the \u201ccommon challenges\u201d question:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/AI-in-marketing-wordstream-subreddit-semrush-1024x515.webp\" alt=\"AI in marketing - Semrush common challenges.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"515\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88508 size-large\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/AI-in-marketing-wordstream-subreddit-semrush-980x493.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/AI-in-marketing-wordstream-subreddit-semrush-480x242.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Rebekah said she used this tactic to help build customer personas.

You can use Gemini (or any other AI tool that can access links) to mine those conversations for insights in many ways from dozens of subreddits in minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Besides the questions I posed in the test, try questions like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why do people say they bought [competitor\u2019s] product?<\/li>\n<li>What are the most common <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/chatgpt-alternatives\">alternatives<\/a> to my product that people mention?<\/li>\n<li>Are there any specific product features mentioned most?<\/li>\n<li>What criteria do people use to decide if my product is worth the cost?<\/li>\n<li>Are there any use cases where my product is mentioned as particularly useful or unuseful?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Of course, you can also just ask Gemini to make a list of questions you should ask (that\u2019s what I did).<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u270d\ufe0f Free resource!<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLValuePropositionGuide.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_ValuePropositionGuide_Download\">How to Create a Value Proposition From the Ground Up<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"find-statistics-with-context\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Quickly find contextual stats and data<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019ve ever searched for relevant data to include in your work, you know what a pain it is to find it on Google. Inevitably, you\u2019ll land on the same out-of-date statistic every other marketer used. Then, you\u2019ll spend 30 minutes chasing down the source, only to end up in a never-ending spiral of posts that link to each other.<\/p>\n<p>Sound familiar? Several commenters said they broke the citation circle by using AI as a research assistant.<\/p>\n<h4>The test<\/h4>\n<p>There weren\u2019t many specifics in the thread explaining how people use AI for research. This is a use case I\u2019m familiar with, though.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the time, I need to see if there\u2019s data to back up a point I want to make.

There are a couple of important caveats to consider.<\/p>\n<p>First, not all AI tools have access to up-to-date web results. Double-check where your gen AI of choice gets its info.<\/p>\n<p>Second, verify the source of any stat you get.

Not a bad start, though.<\/p>\n<p>But we want something weird and unexpected. The kind of analogy that knocks readers out of skimming mode and into understanding mode.<\/p>\n<p>To get there, I asked Claude to \u201cstart over and write three weird, unexpected analogies for generative AI.\u201d It came up with a blob of pizza-eating pizza dough, a book troll, and a kaleidoscopic chameleon.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/AI-in-marketing-wordstream-semrush-common-adjectives-1-1024x660.webp\" alt=\"AI in marketing - list of weird analogies.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"660\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88514 size-large\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/AI-in-marketing-wordstream-semrush-common-adjectives-1-980x632.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/AI-in-marketing-wordstream-semrush-common-adjectives-1-480x309.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Fun? Yes! Useful? Maybe. At least as a creativity springboard.<\/p>\n<h4>How to use this tip<\/h4>\n<p>The analogies we got from Claude needed some editing, but it understood the concept and delivered decent options to get us started.<\/p>\n<p>Since the goal is to make a concept more understandable and relevant, you might ask your AI tool to position your analogies for a certain audience. For example, here\u2019s how Claude would explain generative AI to a sports-minded reader:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/AI-in-marketing-wordstream-analogies-sports-1024x656.webp\" alt=\"AI in marketing - sports analogies.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"656\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88515 size-large\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/AI-in-marketing-wordstream-analogies-sports-980x628.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/AI-in-marketing-wordstream-analogies-sports-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The beauty of gen AI is that it remembers your previous requests so you can iterate on them until you\u2019re happy. Try refining your analogies by audience segment, tone (funny vs. serious), or industry.<\/p>\n<div id=\"reframe-content-for-copywriting-formulas\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Reframe content for formulas<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/16\/copywriting-formulas\">Copywriting formulas<\/a> are really useful for creating influential copy and content. AIDA (attention, interest, desire, action), for example, helps writers frame headlines, sales copy, and blog posts to walk readers through their decision-making process.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/roypovarchik\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Roy Povarchik<\/a>, organic media lead at Riverside.fm, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/update\/urn:li:activity:7271912734986792961?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7271912734986792961%2C7272137661153259520%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287272137661153259520%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7271912734986792961%29\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">uses AI tools<\/a> to reformat copy around copywriting frameworks like AIDA. He said it helps him \u201cget out of his head and not be fixated.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>The test<\/h4>\n<p>I grabbed several random pieces of copy and fed them to Claude to test out Roy\u2019s use case. First, I tried a blurb from Buffer\u2019s sales page. Here\u2019s the original:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cGrow your audience on social and beyond<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Buffer helps you build an audience organically. We\u2019re a values-driven company that provides affordable, intuitive marketing tools for ambitious people and teams.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I prompted Claude to \u201crewrite this text, framing it with the AIDA (attention, interest, desire, action) formula.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/AI-in-marketing-wordstream-aida-two-1024x710.webp\" alt=\"AI in marketing - rewrite with the AIDA formula \" width=\"1024\" height=\"710\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88516 size-large\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/AI-in-marketing-wordstream-aida-two-980x680.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/AI-in-marketing-wordstream-aida-two-480x333.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The output was a bit jargony. But it\u2019s a great way to see new options, especially when your brain is stuck on one version.<\/p>\n<p>Next up, I thought I\u2019d see what Claude could do with a press release for a product launch. I found a <a href=\"https:\/\/ir.hubspot.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/hubspot-launches-new-ai-breeze-plus-hundreds-product-updates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recent one from HubSpot<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s part of Claude\u2019s rewrite:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/AI-in-marketing-wordstream-AIDA.webp\" alt=\"AI in marketing - AIDA rewrite of a press release.\" width=\"995\" height=\"975\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88517 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/AI-in-marketing-wordstream-AIDA.webp 995w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/AI-in-marketing-wordstream-AIDA-980x960.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/AI-in-marketing-wordstream-AIDA-480x470.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 995px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I wouldn\u2019t publish it as is, but I really like how it highlights pain points in the \u201cInterest\u201d section and immediately soothed them in the \u201cDesire\u201d copy.<\/p>\n<p>I also really liked how it separated and labeled each portion of the framework so it&#8217;s easy to review.<\/p>\n<h4>How to use this tip<\/h4>\n<p>You can plug just about any copy into a gen AI chatbot and ask it for a rework. I tried some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/seo-headline\">headlines<\/a> and a few social media posts, and Claude had no problem with them.<\/p>\n<p>I wouldn\u2019t expect ready-to-publish content, though. There was a lot of marketing-y phrasing I\u2019d remove. It did do a good job of combining challenges with solutions, though.
