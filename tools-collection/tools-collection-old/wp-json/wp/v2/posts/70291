Use it as a checklist whenever you need to write copy or review a draft!<\/p>\n<h2>21 copywriting mistakes to avoid for better marketing results<\/h2>\n<p>Below you&#8217;ll find a list of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/seo-copywriting\">copywriting<\/a> mistakes that are often all too easy or tempting to make.\u00a0 Some are minor while others can really impact your marketing results.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Not understanding the copy&#8217;s target<\/h3>\n<p>The most obvious yet often ignored mistake some writers still make:<\/p>\n<p>They craft content in a way that makes sense to <em>them<\/em>, not the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">audience they need to engage<\/a>. While it&#8217;s critical to know your product or service, there&#8217;s a difference between what you want to tell and what the reader wants to hear about it.<\/p>\n<p>Ensure you know the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/23\/buyer-personas\">buyer&#8217;s persona<\/a> inside and out. A competent copywriter understands their needs, pains, motivations, frustrations, and possible objections because it helps craft compelling content that works.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/identify-target-audience-questions.png\" alt=\"questions to identify your target audience\" width=\"720\" height=\"611\" class=\"size-full wp-image-61989 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/identify-target-audience-questions.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/identify-target-audience-questions-480x407.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>2. No problem to solve<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/06\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells\">Copywriting<\/a> is about getting the audience to act. But to act, they need to understand the problem this action will help them solve. It\u2019s wrong to assume that the reader knows it.<\/p>\n<p>Outline the problem in your content. Remember the <em>&#8220;What&#8217;s in there for me?&#8221;<\/em> issue: When reading, a person looks for a clear answer to this question.<\/p>\n<p>Example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grab our marketing guide!<br \/>\n<em>No problem to solve here; a reader doesn&#8217;t understand why they need to take this guide.<\/em><\/li>\n<li>Grab our content guide to help you write persuasive marketing copy!<br \/>\n<em>The reader understands what&#8217;s in there for them in your content.)<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here&#8217;s another <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/24\/google-ads-examples\">Google Ad example<\/a> that has the problem stated within the copy:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-relationships.png\" alt=\"ppc ad copy tips - example of google ads using emotional ad copy\" width=\"720\" height=\"376\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65069 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-relationships.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-relationships-480x251.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>\u270d\ufe0f <strong>Want even more ad copywriting tips? <\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>Download our free guide<\/strong>\u00a0 \u2935\ufe0f\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span> <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLWebBlogInContentTextLinkTrickstoClicks.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_TrickstoClicks_Download\" class=\"waffle-rich-text-link\"><strong>10 Tricks to Get the Click: How to Write Exceptional PPC Ad Copy<\/strong><\/a><span> <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><\/div><\/div><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>3. Wrong tone<\/h3>\n<p>The golden rule of copywriting: Follow the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/31\/brand-voice\">brand&#8217;s tone of voice<\/a> when crafting all of your copy. If unable to capture that tone and stay consistent, you won&#8217;t hit the target market.<\/p>\n<p>The tone of voice is about a brand&#8217;s values, philosophy, and attitude toward its audience. It determines the lexical items and sentence structure you&#8217;ll use in copies to communicate the message. It allows you to speak the same language as the audience and make them want to listen to you.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/brand-tone-of-voice.jpeg\" alt=\"brand tone of voice\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-70294\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/brand-tone-of-voice.jpeg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/brand-tone-of-voice-480x360.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.indeed.com\/career-advice\/career-development\/tone-of-voice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>If your client doesn&#8217;t have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/10\/content-style-guide\">brand book or style guide<\/a> describing their tone of voice, the minimum you can do is to read their previously published content to mirror their communication style in your writings.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Opening with boring generalizations<\/h3>\n<p>All too often, writers start out a blog post or marketing email with a generic absolute or boring generalization. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>It&#8217;s not a secret that sugar harms our health.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>Everyone knows that smoking is dangerous.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Such claims convey no meaning or value. Why write it if it tells nothing new?<\/p>\n<p>Anyone can create such generic content online. If you want to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/22\/marketing-copy\">write compelling marketing copy<\/a>, use interesting information backed up by statistics and research, quotes from influencers in the topic, or testimonials from customers.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of the above, how about:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>When I learned that the <a href=\"https:\/\/the1thing.com\/the-5-unexpected-benefits-of-sugar\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sugar in chocolate can improve thinking skills<\/a>, I was thrilled&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>Did you know that smoking causes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/tobacco\/data_statistics\/fact_sheets\/health_effects\/effects_cig_smoking\/index.htm#:~:text=Smoking%20causes%20about%2090%25%20(or,of%20all%20lung%20cancer%20deaths.&amp;text=More%20women%20die%20from%20lung%20cancer%20each%20year%20than%20from%20breast%20cancer.&amp;text=Smoking%20causes%20about%2080%25%20(or,obstructive%20pulmonary%20disease%20(COPD).&amp;text=Cigarette%20smoking%20increases%20risk%20for,causes%20in%20men%20and%20women.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nine<\/a> out of 10 of all lung cancer deaths?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/how-to-write-great-introduction.jpeg\" alt=\"how to write a great introduction\" width=\"720\" height=\"432\" class=\"size-full wp-image-70295 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/how-to-write-great-introduction.jpeg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/how-to-write-great-introduction-480x288.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.writtenlyhub.com\/write-great-blog-post-introduction\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>You can get more<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/08\/how-to-write-an-introduction\"> tips on how to write an introduction here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Ignoring the audience&#8217;s motivation level<\/h3>\n<p>This mistake is about forgetting the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/01\/content-marketing-funnel\">sales funnel stage<\/a> of your target reader. Before you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/03\/ad-copy-examples\">write effective ad copy<\/a>, you need to know where they are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have they already heard of your brand or product?<\/li>\n<li>Are they ready to purchase?<\/li>\n<li>Do they have any questions, doubts, or fears left that could hold them back from purchasing?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a great <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/21\/emotional-ad-copy-examples\">example of emotional ad copy<\/a> that plays on the target audience&#8217;s doubt:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/emotional-ad-copy-examples-mailchimp-doubt.png\" alt=\"emotional ad copy examples - doubt\" width=\"426\" height=\"755\" class=\"wp-image-62002 aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Bottom line: You need to understand how aware, skeptical, and motivated your reader is. It helps you choose the right <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/20\/copywriting-techniques\">copywriting technique<\/a> and decide on proper calls to action for a copy.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Weak headlines and subheads<\/h3>\n<p>Not only is reading online <a href=\"http:\/\/www.entheosweb.com\/content_writing\/tips.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">25%<\/a> slower than from print, but users also don&#8217;t read but scan web copy. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/17\/how-to-write-great-headlines\">Headlines<\/a> and subheads guide them through content and help them understand if it&#8217;s worth their time.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why a good copywriter makes these two copy elements count.<\/p>\n<p>Stellar headlines and subheads are short, specific, and relevant to the content. The element of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/03\/emotional-marketing-copy\">emotional writing<\/a> is also worth trying to grab attention, evoke curiosity or FOMO, and motivate users to keep reading.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/compelling-headline-example.png\" alt=\"compelling headline example\" width=\"720\" height=\"310\" class=\"size-full wp-image-70296 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/compelling-headline-example.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/compelling-headline-example-480x207.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/01\/headline-examples\">headline example<\/a> for a piece of content about headlines&#8230;<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Weak headline:<\/strong><em> Headlines to Try in Blog Posts, Ads, Emails, and More<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Strong headline:<\/strong> <em>88 Headline Examples you Can&#8217;t Help But Click<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>7. Lengthy sentences<\/h3>\n<p>Quick question: Can you find a period in this sentence?<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/copywriting-mistakes-novel.jpg\" alt=\"novel screenshot\" width=\"410\" height=\"591\" class=\" wp-image-70298 aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Unless you&#8217;re Oksana Zabuzhko, a Ukrainian novelist and essayist practicing super long sentences in her works (the above text is hers, from <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Museum_of_Abandoned_Secrets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>The Museum of Abandoned Secrets<\/em><\/a>; you can find its audio version in English), avoid this practice.<\/p>\n<p>Long sentences hurt your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/04\/seo-content-readability\">content&#8217;s usability and readability<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that online users read only <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nngroup.com\/articles\/how-little-do-users-read\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">20-28%<\/a> of your text; focus on brevity.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Too formal<\/h3>\n<p>Copywriters know that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/05\/conversational-tone\">web writing is conversational<\/a>, and we speak to the audience in their language if we want to engage them.<\/p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s challenging to strike a balance between conversational and casual. Afraid of losing this balance, some authors may sound too formal. They use complex sentences, academic language as if they write college essays, etc.<\/p>\n<p>This is a mistake. It scares the reader away. The minimum you can practice to prevent this is to insert some conversational phrases like &#8220;you see&#8221; or &#8220;can&#8217;t&#8221; instead of &#8220;cannot&#8221; into your copies.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/copywriting-formal-vs-conversational-tone.png\" alt=\"formal vs conversational tone\" width=\"720\" height=\"531\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-60880\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/copywriting-formal-vs-conversational-tone.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/copywriting-formal-vs-conversational-tone-480x354.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The ideal variant is to know and follow your brand&#8217;s tone of voice.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Too much jargon and buzzwords<\/h3>\n<p>Even though <a href=\"https:\/\/nces.ed.gov\/pubs2019\/2019179.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">21%<\/a> of U.S. adults are illiterate, even those with high literacy skills won&#8217;t spend time reading your unnecessarily complex texts.<\/p>\n<p>Niche jargon and buzzwords are a no-no when it comes to copywriting.<\/p>\n<p>If a person has to take a dictionary to understand what you write, they&#8217;ll hardly enjoy and get engaged with your message. Readability testing tools can help you see whether you&#8217;re stuffing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/04\/marketing-collateral\">your marketing collateral<\/a> with too many overcomplicated words.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells-HBS-easy-reading-level-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"287\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7588\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells-HBS-easy-reading-level-1.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells-HBS-easy-reading-level-1-480x191.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>This copy is written for Harvard graduate school candidates. But does it use fancy words? Nope.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>10. Ignoring mobile copywriting<\/h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s face it: Most think of web-based copywriting when seeking a content specialist for their brands. But what about <a href=\"https:\/\/explodingtopics.com\/blog\/mobile-internet-traffic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">4.32 billion<\/a> internet users consuming your message from mobile?<\/p>\n<p>When writing and formatting content, it&#8217;s critical to remember such a broad audience.<\/p>\n<p>Design it for thumb-stopping visuals, short sentences, and easy-to-read font sizes for headlines. Eliminate unnecessary words, write up-to-point subheads, and consider short paragraph lengths.<\/p>\n<h3>11. Ignoring or overdoing SEO<\/h3>\n<p>When writing marketing copy, it&#8217;s also worth remembering how people will find it online. <a href=\"https:\/\/writingbreeze.com\/seo-writing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO writing<\/a> elements will help search engines understand the context and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/06\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google\">rank your pages<\/a> accordingly, but it&#8217;s essential to strike a balance here.<\/p>\n<p>Focusing too much on optimizing your copy for keywords will do more harm than good. For Google, it will look like spam; for users, it will sound awkward and unnatural to read.<\/p>\n<h3>12. Too many modifiers<\/h3>\n<p>Adverbs and adjectives (especially beneficial ones) are powerful copywriting instruments. The trick is to know the limit.<\/p>\n<p>Every modifier you use in content should serve for driving it. When overused, they make your copy wordy: Users can lose the core message you communicate.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Too many:<\/strong><em> Add this beautiful and comfortable leather couch to your bedroom to give yourself a cozy corner to sit with a neutral yet stylish look that matches your room design <\/em>(six modifiers).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Just right: <\/strong><em>\u201cThis comfortable leather couch has a neutral color to match your room&#8217;s design. <\/em>(three modifiers).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>13. Too many intensifiers<\/h3>\n<p>Intensifiers are words we use to emphasize adverbs. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with them unless they become redundant, turning your copy into balderdash.<\/p>\n<p>When used too often, intensifiers become nothing but fillers. They seem to be what Stephen King had in mind when saying, &#8220;The road to hell is paved with adverbs.&#8221; Most are<em> -ly<\/em> adverbs:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/copywriting-mistakes-intensifiers.png\" alt=\"copywriting mistakes - intensifier words to avoid\" width=\"720\" height=\"494\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-70299\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/copywriting-mistakes-intensifiers.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/copywriting-mistakes-intensifiers-480x329.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/contentmarketinginstitute.com\/articles\/delete-words-phrases\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>When possible, avoid such words in your content. You can always find an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/22\/power-words\">alternative power word<\/a> that sounds stronger. Thus, &#8220;critical&#8221; or &#8220;essential&#8221; looks more confident than &#8220;very important.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>14. Boring words<\/h3>\n<p>Most writers have words or phrases they use too often. (Mine are &#8220;here,&#8221; &#8220;professional,&#8221; and &#8220;when it comes to&#8221;). When overused, they make your copy monotonous and dull to read.<\/p>\n<p>Do your best to stop overusing certain words in writing. Analyze your copy, consider repeated phrases, and grab a thesaurus to change them and make your texts more engaging.<\/p>\n<h3>15. Weak formatting<\/h3>\n<p>As a rule, copywriters don&#8217;t think about their texts&#8217; makeup. They follow the basic rules of web writing but ignore the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.advancedwebranking.com\/blog\/content-usability-blunders\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content usability blunders<\/a> that can make them lose readers.<\/p>\n<p>These blunders are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Right align<\/li>\n<li>Hard-to-see subheads<\/li>\n<li>Wrong font size<\/li>\n<li>Complex text structure<\/li>\n<li>Large text fields<\/li>\n<li>Poor color-contrast ratio<\/li>\n<li>No paragraphs<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When writing, please think of how your text will look online.<\/p>\n<p>The ideal variant would be to know beforehand where the copy will go live. A page layout will help you see the website&#8217;s typography and format your text accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/psychology-copywriting-cognitive-fluency-taxes.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"409\" height=\"295\" class=\"size-full wp-image-50647 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/psychology-copywriting-cognitive-fluency-taxes.png 409w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/psychology-copywriting-cognitive-fluency-taxes-300x216.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>The readability of your font impacts the effectiveness of your copy!

Why lose readers simply because they can&#8217;t visually perceive your information?<\/p>\n<h3>16. Wrong use of emotional triggers<\/h3>\n<p>Copywriting is about triggering an emotional response from users, encouraging them to stay with a brand, and motivating them to act.<\/p>\n<p>Knowing this, some authors use emotional triggers for evil, manipulating a person&#8217;s fear, uncertainty, and doubt (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.webopedia.com\/definitions\/fud\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FUD<\/a>) in their copies. While such manipulation can be a powerful sales tool, its overdose doesn&#8217;t work for building an ongoing customer relationship.<\/p>\n<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><strong>Want to know how to use emotion the right way?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>Free guide<\/strong> &gt;&gt; <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite120WordsforMarketingWithEmotion.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_120WordsPhrases_Download\" class=\"waffle-rich-text-link\">The 120 Best Words &amp; Phrases for Marketing with Emotion<\/a><span> \ud83d\ude0c <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><\/div><\/div><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>17. Wrong CTA, multiple CTAs, or no CTA at all<\/h3>\n<p>While copywriters know that a call to action (CTA) is a must, some aren&#8217;t sure how to make it effective.<\/p>\n<p>A good CTA:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creates a sense of urgency;<\/li>\n<li>Tells the user what to do right after reading the copy;<\/li>\n<li>Gives the user a compelling reason to take that action.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/call-to-action-examples-coschedule-lock-in.png\" alt=\"call to action examples - lock in my free account\" width=\"720\" height=\"417\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59011\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/call-to-action-examples-coschedule-lock-in.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/call-to-action-examples-coschedule-lock-in-480x278.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A big mistake is to include several CTAs on one page, especially if they lead to different pages or ask to take a few various actions.

Too many colloquialisms or idioms<\/h3>\n<p>Colloquialisms (regional phrases) and idioms can add color and personality to your writing, but too many can be distracting with business copywriting.<\/p>\n<p>Be careful with your &#8220;cold cucumbers&#8221; or &#8220;raining cats and dogs&#8221; as not all readers will understand them and you may not be able to convey the message you intend.<\/p>\n<h3>19. Too many features but no benefits<\/h3>\n<p>This is a common mistake of newbie copywriters and those lacking information about the buyer persona&#8217;s needs and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/28\/pain-points\">pain points<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>They describe the product features but don&#8217;t tell the audience how those features can benefit them, which is critical to do in marketing messaging: You should give readers <em>a reason<\/em> to buy.<\/p>\n<p>Make friends with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/21\/features-vs-benefits\">feature-benefit<\/a> writing:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Lead with benefits. Answer the<em> &#8220;So what?&#8221;<\/em> question. Explain how your product or service can improve a reader&#8217;s life if they choose it.<\/li>\n<li>Back up the benefits with the features that make them possible.

Relying on copywriting formulas too much<\/h3>\n<p>Tons of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-write-an-ebook\">copywriting<\/a> best practices are online for us to learn and use in texts. Based on other writers&#8217; experience, these tips are great to use as a guideline or starting point.<\/p>\n<p>But often, these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/16\/copywriting-formulas\">copywriting formulas<\/a> are just prevalent practices that worked for someone. Who said they would work for your readers?<\/p>\n<p>Examples:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They say: Odd numbers capture more attention. <a href=\"https:\/\/contentmarketinginstitute.com\/articles\/neuro-writing-tactics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">True<\/a>, but it doesn&#8217;t mean even numbers will kill your copy&#8217;s engagement.<\/li>\n<li>They say: The word &#8220;free&#8221; is a surefire way to grab a reader. Maybe, but some people will see it as a signal of spam.<\/li>\n<li>They say: These headline formulas work. Let it be, but those formulas won&#8217;t rock if they don&#8217;t suit your audience or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/13\/content-marketing-strategy\">content strategy<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The point I&#8217;m trying to drive home is, it&#8217;s a mistake to believe and follow all copywriting formulas in your texts. Test them with your audience rather than assuming they will work for you because they worked for another copywriter.<\/p>\n<h3>21. Being too salesy<\/h3>\n<p>Online users are not naive or stupid. They understand your copy is about selling something, so they don&#8217;t need you to focus their attention on that. Too aggressive, direct selling messages in texts cause a backfire.<\/p>\n<p>Rejection.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, tell a story about your product, use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/03\/testimonial-advertising\">testimonials from satisfied customers<\/a>, and focus on appealing language to make the audience want what you have for them. A compelling call to action at the end of your content will be enough for readers to act.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/elevator-pitch-examples-storytelling-template.png\" alt=\"elevator pitch examples - storytelling elevator pitch template\" width=\"720\" height=\"576\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63710 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/elevator-pitch-examples-storytelling-template.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/elevator-pitch-examples-storytelling-template-480x384.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Use our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/16\/elevator-pitch-examples-templates\">elevator pitch templates<\/a> to write convincing but not salesy content!<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Keep your copywriting on the right track<\/h3>\n<p>So now you have it: the long list of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/website-copywriting\">copywriting<\/a> mistakes (here&#8217;s a list of what you should do when <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/copywriting-101\">writing copy<\/a>).
