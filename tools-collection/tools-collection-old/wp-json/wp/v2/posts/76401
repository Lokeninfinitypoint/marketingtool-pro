Typically, a 30\/60\/90-day plan outlines goals and expectations during the first 30, 60, and 90 days.<\/p>\n<p>The idea behind a 30\/60\/90-day plan is to add structure to onboarding, with goals around learning the basics, meeting people critical to success, developing an actionable strategy, and eventually executing said strategy. You can also use a 30\/60\/90-day plan for new projects.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/306090-day-plan-example.webp\" alt=\"30 60 90 day plan example for social media management\" width=\"840\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76414\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/306090-day-plan-example.webp 840w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/306090-day-plan-example-480x343.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 840px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/fanbooster.com\/blog\/30-60-90-day-plan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>A 30\/60\/90-day plan should also include metrics for success.

Some may bring up a 30\/60\/90-day plan ahead of an interview and ask you to prepare one, while others might have you lightly touch on a plan right then and there.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s unlikely you need a fleshed-out plan for an interview unless explicitly asked for ahead of time, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to have some of the higher-level points covered. Before putting the plan together:<\/p>\n<h3>Carefully review the job description and the company itself<\/h3>\n<p>Look at the company\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/02\/how-to-write-a-business-mission-statement\">mission statement<\/a>, what they call out on their homepage, what they emphasize on the job description, etc. Think about what bigger role the position you\u2019re applying for plays in the company and them reaching their goals.<\/p>\n<p>For example, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.warbyparker.com\/history\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Warby Parker About page<\/a> serves as a great distillation of their mission: to inspire and impact the world with vision, purpose, and style.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/306090-day-plan-mission-statement.webp\" alt=\"warby parker mission statement example from website\" width=\"773\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76415\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/306090-day-plan-mission-statement.webp 773w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/306090-day-plan-mission-statement-480x373.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 773px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Think about what goals matter to this position<\/h3>\n<p>What might their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/07\/agency-profitability-metrics\">KPIs<\/a> be? Metrics of success? Given the company\u2019s size and audience, what types of <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-metrics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">metrics<\/a> and goals make sense?<\/p>\n<p>For example: You wouldn\u2019t want to say you can drive 500 leads in 90 days via your marketing role if their audience is smaller and a good quarter is more like 5 qualified leads.<\/p>\n<p>Bonus: Before the later stages of an interview, ask about the metrics of success for the position. Not only is this a great way to see if the role sounds realistic and aligns with your expectations, but it\u2019s also great for informing your 30\/60\/90-day plan.<\/p>\n<h3>Be realistic and don\u2019t oversell yourself<\/h3>\n<p>What can you feasibly do in 30\/60\/90 days? Keep in mind you\u2019re new this entire time, so you\u2019re also busy learning about the company, audience, and product or services.<\/p>\n<p>When mapping out realistic goals, don\u2019t neglect time spent on meeting people as well. You\u2019re going to do a lot of meet and greets in your early weeks, and possibly some interviewing or shadowing.<\/p>\n<h3>Emphasize the role of learning and training<\/h3>\n<p>Pay attention to learning, training, and shadowing in your proposed plan. If you\u2019re mapping out specific goals, write down the titles of potential stakeholders you\u2019d want to partner with for these goals.<\/p>\n<p>Learning is an essential part of any job and it shows you\u2019re excited to grow. It\u2019s also a great way to meet your team and those outside your own department as well.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if your role involves Google Ads and you\u2019re not very experienced, call out some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/21\/google-skillshop\">Google Ads courses<\/a> you\u2019d take right out of the gate.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/306090-day-plan-learning-goals.webp\" alt=\"ppc 101 homepage from wordstream\" width=\"578\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76416\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/306090-day-plan-learning-goals.webp 578w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/306090-day-plan-learning-goals-480x498.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 578px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Even if a 30\/60\/90-day plan isn\u2019t asked for during your interview, having a rough idea of one ready to go on a moment\u2019s notice can\u2019t hurt. If you\u2019re really excited about one you put together, you could even mention sending it to the interviewer after your call\u2019s concluded.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 Need more learning resources?

And even if you\u2019re not asked to create one, it\u2019s a good idea to make one yourself to stay on track.<\/p>\n<h3>Days 1-30: Learning, learning, learning<\/h3>\n<p>Typically, the first 30 days of a 30\/60\/90-day plan are all about learning. You\u2019re new to the company and the role. You need to establish a foundational knowledge of the company, products, audience(s), and of course, your responsibilities.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Base your goals around learning and growing in your role<\/li>\n<li>Who will you interview?<\/li>\n<li>What training will you need?<\/li>\n<li>Any courses you\u2019d like access to?<\/li>\n<li>Certifications?<\/li>\n<li>Additional resources you\u2019d like?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As you embark on your first 30 days, take note of questions you have the moment they arise and follow up on them. This is your chance to learn all you can, and filling in any knowledge gaps as early as possible can save you a ton of confusion down the road.<\/p>\n<p>Also, as you map out goals for your first 30 days and beyond, make sure they\u2019re concrete, measurable ones. Both you and your prospective manager should be able to ask and answer the question, \u201cIs this goal complete?\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/smart-goals-e1685648679235.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"936\" height=\"561\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76423\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/smart-goals-e1685648679235.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/smart-goals-e1685648679235-480x288.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Make sure the goals you outline in your 30\/60\/90-day plan are SMART goals.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>For example, you could state that by day 60 you want to complete X courses on Y topic, or have published four blogs and interviewed two in-house experts.<\/p>\n<h3>Days 31-60: Strategy and further learning<\/h3>\n<p>During your first 30 days, you\u2019ve hopefully learned what you need to know to start thinking about strategy and upcoming tasks.
