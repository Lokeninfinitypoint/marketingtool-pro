That\u2019s how the story goes for many businesses that commit to developing authentic, attractive, and memorable brands. As a result of intentional brand-building, they enjoy gains that range from boosted engagement to increased influence and the ability to reel in other brands that gladly pay to share their spotlight. For them, it\u2019s the key to real prosperity in business. It can be the same for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/brand-affinity-adwords-scaling-1.jpg\" alt=\"brand affinity can improve adwords and facebook ad performance\" width=\"800\" height=\"407\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">However, successfully harnessing the full power of branding to strengthen your business requires much thought, planning, and consistent effort. So you need to understand what brand personality and brand messaging are, the importance of both, and how to shape them to create a lasting brand that\u2019ll bring you lasting success. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re covering in this post.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">What is brand personality and why should you care?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">We all understand what \u201cpersonality\u201d is in an everyday context. It refers to the combinations of distinct characteristics and qualities that make people recognizable and, hopefully, attractive to others. That definition remains the same when it comes to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/14\/use-branding-to-improve-advertising\">branding<\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/brand-personality_0-1.png\" alt=\"chart comparing popular companies and their brand personalities\" width=\"792\" height=\"389\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/ebaqdesign\/brand-personality-traits-of-top-brands-19c58890770f\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Just as every person has a personality, so does every brand. And just as an individual\u2019s personality affects how others view and interact with them, your brand\u2019s personality impacts how people view and interact with your business. It can make the difference between struggling to get by and:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Retaining more <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/10\/customer-loyalty\">loyal customers<\/a> and turning them into brand advocates.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Bringing in a steady stream of new customers.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Building credibility and authority within your industry, which fuels more of the above.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">So, of course, you don\u2019t want to leave the development of your brand personality to chance. If you want the benefits of having a brand, you have to go after them strategically. How?\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">4 ways to develop your brand personality<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Consider four crucial steps in the process of defining your brand personality. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">1. Decide who you are FIRST<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Many brands decide who they are AFTER launch and tailor their messaging as things shake out. That\u2019s a waste of time, money, and resources. Instead of playing catch up, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/12\/google-tag-manager\">streamline<\/a> things from the start.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Choose your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/09\/company-core-values\">core values<\/a> and the drivers behind your work BEFORE ever coming to market. Highlight your priorities, specialties, and your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/13\/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing\">emotional<\/a> appeal. If these are the foundation for your brand identity, the rest will fall into place much easier. Why? Because, in selling your unique brand, you\u2019ll stand out from others who are simply selling non-distinct <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/29\/how-to-promote-a-product\">products and services<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Related:<\/strong> <\/em>Defining your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/brand-purpose\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">brand purpose<\/a> can help you with this crucial step!<\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">2. Enlist the help of family &amp; friends<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Outside perspectives can be extremely helpful when trying to gain clarity on what your brand personality should be. And who better to shed light on who you are and what you\u2019re all about than the people who know you best?<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/brand-personality-family-friends-1.png\" alt=\"how to develop a memorable brand personality\u2014two happy friends\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pexels.com\/photo\/man-and-woman-sitting-on-chair-in-front-of-desk-1346197\/\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Ask your family and friends to describe you as an individual and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/27\/facebook-ads-for-entrepreneurs\">entrepreneur<\/a> (not your brand). You should end up with a decent list of characteristics and traits, especially after doing your own brainstorming too. You can then analyze the list to see how your characteristics<em> do <\/em>carry over into your business and how they <em>could<\/em> carry over into your branding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">For example, let\u2019s say that you sell makeup to women in their 20s. When asked, your family and friends described you as a bright ray of sunshine in their lives. Given that feedback, it would make sense to adopt a positive, uplifting brand personality and voice. This is just one example of how <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/24\/customer-feedback\">feedback from others can be applied <\/a>to help you develop cohesive branding.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">3. Get to know your audience<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As much as your brand personality has to do with who <em>you<\/em> are, it also relates to who your audience is. Your branding could be a perfect reflection of what your business is all about. But if it doesn\u2019t resonate with your audience, what does it matter?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">So don\u2019t develop your branding blindly or based on assumptions about your<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/18\/beginners-guide-to-target-markets\"> target market<\/a>. Speak to current and potential customers often, observe them, and do your research to find out how they perceive your brand in comparison to competitors. Then, weave what you learn into your brand personality.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">4. Nail down your brand voice<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">An important part of brand personality, voice can make or break your efforts. <em>How<\/em> you choose to communicate determines whether or not you can successfully breathe life into the traits and characteristics you define as part of your brand personality. You\u2019ve got to get it right.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/brand-voice_0-1.png\" alt=\"how to develop a memorable brand personality\u2014venn diagram intersecting your unique personality and how you want to appear\" width=\"800\" height=\"523\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Should your voice and tone be funny or serious? Sophisticated or causal? Old-school or always on-trend? It could be one or several depending on your style, audience, industry, and other factors. Whatever you choose, though, the main thing is that you keep your voice consistent. After all, your voice exists everywhere your brand does; you want it to be recognizable and memorable no matter where people hear it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Once you\u2019ve done the work of defining who you are, gathering feedback from those close to you, getting to know your audience, and settling on your brand voice, what next? You can move on to crafting your brand message. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">What brand messaging is and\u00a0why you need it<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As mentioned, <em>how<\/em> you communicate with your audience matters. Equally important, though, is <em>what<\/em> you communicate to them (AKA your brand messaging).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Over the years, FedEx\u2019s slogans have provided excellent examples of strong, enduring brand messaging. Take a look at a handful of those slogans and notice what they all have in common.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">We Live To Deliver<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Our Most Important Package is Yours<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">When It Absolutely, Positively Has to Be There Overnight<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Did you catch it? All three highlight the company\u2019s singular focus: Getting your packages delivered. All of FedEx\u2019s messaging across its website and other <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/25\/benefits-of-content-marketing\">content<\/a> highlights this same commitment. Even its visual branding including the brand colors and the arrow in its logo never deviate from the main message. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Take this as a lesson. A dialed-in message that appeals to the core values, needs, and wants of your audience will always perform better than an unfocused and inconsistent one. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Walmart is another noteworthy example of this. Since its core message centers on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/18\/ppc-money-saving-checklist\">saving money<\/a>, it\u2019s no surprise that words like \u201cdiscount\u201d, \u201crollback\u201d, and \u201cclearance\u201d are a common staple across the company\u2019s content. And that\u2019s not to mention calls to action such as \u201cbe the first to save!\u201d and \u201cstart with everyday low prices.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/brand-personality-walmart_0-1.png\" alt=\"how to develop a memorable brand personality\u2014walmart logo and tagline\" width=\"794\" height=\"237\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The takeaway? When you have an <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/04\/25\/event-marketing\">established brand<\/a> message and allow it to inform your decisions, your overall marketing becomes both simpler and more effective. Whether you\u2019re writing blog posts, landing pages, ads, Instagram captions, emails, or even your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/16\/elevator-pitch-examples-templates\">elevator pitch<\/a>, your brand message will point true north. Even better, it\u2019ll capture and hold the attention of your audience.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">4 keys to crafting strong brand messaging<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Now that we know what strong brand messaging looks like and why it\u2019s important, let\u2019s dive into how to create it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">1. Let your core values lead the way<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">What\u2019s important to you? What motivates you to do what you do every day? What rules do you and your team live by? All of these questions tie back to a main ingredient of every solid brand\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/09\/company-core-values\">core values<\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Determine what yours are, figure out which ones you have in common with your audience, and use those as the foundation for your brand messaging. Tie everything back to them and you <em>will<\/em> attract more of the right people to your business (who\u2019ll then tell other like-minded people about you).<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">2. Consider your offerings and\u00a0audience<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As with developing your brand personality, you\u2019ll want to consider your potential customers when crafting your message. But it\u2019s also essential to make sure it\u2019s a match for what you\u2019re offering, whether you sell products or services or both. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/brand-personality-nike-1.png\" alt=\"how to develop a memorable brand personality\u2014nike logo and tagline\" width=\"800\" height=\"360\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.brandchannel.com\/2013\/07\/03\/nike-celebrates-25-years-of-just-do-it\/\">Image source<\/a><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Take, for example, Nike\u2019s \u201cJust Do It\u201d slogan. It matches Nike\u2019s workout products because it centers on taking action. It also matches the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">audience<\/a> (fitness enthusiasts) because it encourages being bold and forging ahead, which they value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Be sure that <em>your<\/em> message is aligned with what you offer and to who.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">3. Get inspiration from successful companies<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Besides the major brands we\u2019ve discussed, there may be others\u2014in or outside of your industry, large or small\u2014whose messaging resonates with you. Think about why. Learn from what those brands are doing and use the inspiration as <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/12\/20\/creative-advertising-ideas\">creative and strategic fuel <\/a>for your efforts. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">4. Don\u2019t overthink it and\u00a0don\u2019t overdo it<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">It\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed thinking about how to appeal to absolutely every potential customer you might come in contact with. But fretting over that is a surefire way to alienate and confuse your audience, which would only push you away from your business goals. Be resolved to keep your brand messaging as simple as possible. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Ulta Beauty does this with great success. Even though the company has two messages\u2014\u201cAll Things Beauty. All In One Place\u201d and \u201cWelcome To The Fun Side Of Beauty\u201d\u2014they both revolve around one thing. Ulta doesn\u2019t try to appeal to anyone who doesn\u2019t love beauty and having fun with beauty products. They don\u2019t try to incorporate home goods or any other topics into their messaging; it\u2019s all beauty all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/brand-personality-ulta-1.png\" alt=\"how to develop a memorable brand personality\u2014ulta beauty logo and tagline\" width=\"800\" height=\"518\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/onebellevueplace.com\/ulta-beauty-opens-new-location-in-nashville-on-february-23\/\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">So ask yourself: What message(s) will get my main point across to the majority of my audience in the most straightforward way? Once you have an answer, leave it at that. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">To enjoy the benefits of strategic branding\u2026<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As you can see, a fair bit of work goes into <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/01\/brand-strategy\">developing a brand <\/a>personality and message worth taking notice of and remembering. For that investment of time, energy, and resources to pay off, consistency is vital. Once you decide on personality traits, take on a certain voice and tone, and choose a message, don\u2019t stray from it (unless, of course, A\/B tests or the direction of your company dictate change).\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">To help you build trust with your audience and increase brand awareness by staying \u201con brand\u201d at all times, why not create a brand guide? By having your guidelines in writing, you and your team can stay on the same page and enjoy the many benefits that consistent, thoughtful branding can bring!<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This post will help you to understand what brand personality and brand messaging are, the
