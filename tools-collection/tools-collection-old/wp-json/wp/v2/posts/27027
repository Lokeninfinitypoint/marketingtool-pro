Some news websites have even gone as far to say that ad blockers will herald the end of the Internet as we know it.<\/p>\n<p>What exactly is going on with ad blockers, and as an online advertiser, should you be worried?<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-blockers.png\" alt=\"ad blockers\" width=\"846\" height=\"709\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>What Are Ad Blockers?<\/h2>\n<p>Ad blockers \u2013 sometimes known as content blockers \u2013 are simple software programs that prevent ads from being shown on websites. Ad blockers are typically browser add-ons, and are available for the Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Internet Explorer web browsers.<\/p>\n<p>AdBlock Plus is the most popular ad blocker on the web. This browser plugin has been downloaded and installed millions of times, and is available for a range of different browsers. Although AdBlock Plus is the most popular ad blocker, dozens of alternatives are available.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Are Ad Blockers in the News?<\/h2>\n<p>Apple made headlines recently when it announced that iOS 9, the latest iteration of the mobile operating system that powers iPhones and iPads, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/09\/19\/technology\/apple-ios-9s-enabling-of-ad-blocking-prompts-backlash.html\">would now support ad blocking technology<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-blockers-content-blockers.png\" alt=\"what are ad blockers\" width=\"636\" height=\"358\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Dean Murphy, a British software developer, created an ad blocking app for iOS called Crystal. The app, which was available on the Apple App Store for 99 cents, functioned similarly to AdBlock Plus and the other ad blockers on the market. Murphy told the media he did not create Crystal with the intent of making a fortune, but rather to develop his iOS programming skills.<\/p>\n<p>In the week after Crystal was launched on September 16, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/propelled-by-apple-ad-blocking-cottage-industry-emerges-1443115929\">Murphy earned $75,000 from sales of his app<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Marco Arment, creator of Instapaper and cofounder of Tumblr, also created an ad blocker for iOS, an app called Peace. The wildly successful app, which was downloaded tens of thousands of times, was pulled by Arment just 36 hours after it was launched when Arment experienced a \u201ccrisis of conscience\u201d about Peace\u2019s potential impact on sites that rely on advertising revenue to survive.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Is Ad Blocking So Controversial?<\/h2>\n<p>A vast majority of websites on the Internet exist thanks to online advertising. Millions of websites, from tiny blogs to huge corporate-owned magazines, depend on online advertising revenues in order to operate. As I mentioned, ad blockers have been available for years, but for Apple \u2013 one of the largest, wealthiest technology companies in the world \u2013 to openly support them is big news.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-blockers-allowed-by-apple.jpg\" alt=\"all about ad blockers\" width=\"959\" height=\"639\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via WSJ.com<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Much of the angst surrounding Apple\u2019s decision stems from the fact that by giving people the option to block online ads, many more people will actually do it. Although <a href=\"http:\/\/www.idc.com\/prodserv\/smartphone-os-market-share.jsp\">Android remains the biggest player in the mobile device market<\/a>, significantly more people could adopt ad blockers now that they\u2019re available on iOS for the first time, which could subsequently have a considerable impact on Internet advertising revenues.<\/p>\n<p>According to data from Adobe and PageFair, adoption of desktop ad blockers has risen steadily in recent years, from approximately 21 million users in 2010 to more than 181 million users in January of this year:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-blockers-adoption-growth-chart-1.png\" alt=\"ad blocker growth\" width=\"749\" height=\"450\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via Adobe\/PageFair<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Some experts believe that adoption of mobile ad blockers, such as those now permitted on Apple\u2019s iOS 9 platform, could exceed this figure considerably as the software programs become increasingly popular.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of ad blockers\u2019 potential impact on advertisers, opinions are mixed. The same report by Adobe and PageFair estimates that the rise of ad blocking technology could cost advertisers a total of more than $40 billion by next year:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-blockers-financial-impact.jpg\" alt=\"impact of ad blockers\" width=\"660\" height=\"603\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via Adobe\/PageFair<\/em><\/p>\n<p>However, other estimates are far more conservative, placing the potential economic damage at around $1 billion. Unfortunately, it\u2019s impossible to say how bad the damage could be.<\/p>\n<p>Although the most obvious reason that people use ad blockers is to eliminate ads from their web browsing experience, there are actually several other benefits of using them. By removing ads from the web pages users are served, page load times are often decreased considerably, and can also reduce data usage \u2013 good news for people with limited data plans.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-blockers-page-load-times.jpg\" alt=\"ad blockers page load time\" width=\"640\" height=\"578\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Another reason some people use ad blockers is that some advertisements make use of scripts \u2013 tiny, self-contained snippets of code that perform specific functions on a web page \u2013 that can be easily exploited to gain access to users\u2019 sensitive information.<\/p>\n<p>As many advertising platforms utilize tracking and behavioral monitoring technology that profiles user behavior based on the sites they visit, content blockers can be very attractive to people who do not want their online browsing preferences sold to advertisers and content delivery networks. This is what makes add-ons like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ghostery.com\/en\/\">Ghostery<\/a>, which functions in a similar way to many ad blockers, so popular among privacy-minded users.<\/p>\n<h2>The Bad News About Ad Blockers<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s get the bad news out of the way first. <strong>The rise of ad blockers <em>will<\/em> affect advertisers<\/strong> \u2013 the real question is how, and how many. Some advertisers may notice a significant impact on the performance of their mobile PPC campaigns, whereas others might not notice any difference at all. In a way, you can think of this development in much the same way as <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/21\/google-mobile-update\">Google\u2019s \u201cMobilegeddon\u201d algorithm update<\/a> earlier this year \u2013 some sites were hit hard, and others didn\u2019t even notice.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-blockers-before-after-tweet.png\" alt=\"ad blockers impact\" width=\"540\" height=\"481\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>A mobile SERP before and after installation of an iOS 9 ad blocker, via <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/soundboy\/status\/644491129463918592\"><em>@soundboy<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Ad blockers affect the display of PPC and display ads, across Google AdWords, Bing Ads, and other advertising networks, meaning that advertisers with any type of active campaign could potentially be affected by increased adoption of these software programs.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re running a PPC or display campaign targeting mobile users on Apple devices, and they have an ad blocker installed on their device, they won\u2019t see your ads. It doesn\u2019t matter what extensions you\u2019re using, how many ad formats you\u2019re taking advantage of, how good your ads are \u2013 if a user with an ad blocker searches for a keyword you\u2019re bidding on, they won\u2019t see your ads. At all.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-blockers-before-after.jpg\" alt=\"before and after ad blockers\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Example mobile site with ad blocking disabled (left) and enabled (right)<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>The Good News About Ad Blockers<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s not all doom-and-gloom \u2013 there is <em>some<\/em> good news.<\/p>\n<h3>Mobile Ad Blockers Don\u2019t Affect Desktop Search Campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>Although increasing use of ad blockers will affect some advertisers, it\u2019s important to note that this whole situation was triggered by Apple\u2019s decision to allow ad blockers to be downloaded and installed <em>on mobile devices<\/em> \u2013 this does not affect desktop campaigns whatsoever. If users aren\u2019t using ad blockers on their desktops, your ads could still be shown as they always have.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also worth remembering that most people don\u2019t use any ad blockers <em>at all<\/em>, and just because Apple has allowed them on the App Store doesn\u2019t mean all users are going to radically change their behavior.<\/p>\n<p>You may also want to think about the targeting options of your campaigns. You should be doing this anyway, but by refining your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/16\/ad-targeting\">targeting options<\/a>, you can rest easy in the knowledge that your ad budget is being spent as wisely as it possibly can be by targeting your \u201cperfect\u201d audience.<\/p>\n<h3>Mobile Ad Blockers Don\u2019t Affect Apps<\/h3>\n<p>Another plus is that ad blockers don\u2019t affect app functionality, which is where most mobile device users spend their time \u2013 they only affect browser-based searches, and only then if the user has an ad blocker installed.<\/p>\n<h3>The Importance of Remarketing<\/h3>\n<p>The potential rise in ad blocker adoption means that remarketing, not just regular display campaigns, is now more important than ever, because remarketing is about focusing on bottom-line metrics such as conversions.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-blockers-ad-visibility.png\" alt=\"how do ad blockers affect ad visibility\" width=\"829\" height=\"441\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via Google<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Impression data for display campaigns has always been difficult to quantify, but by focusing on remarketing, you\u2019re ensuring that your campaigns are not just potentially reaching the right people, but the right people who are more likely to convert further down the funnel. Focus on clicks and conversions, not impressions \u2013 remember, <a href=\"http:\/\/think.storage.googleapis.com\/docs\/the-importance-of-being-seen_study.pdf\">more than half of display ad impressions aren\u2019t even seen<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Ad Blockers Present New Opportunities for Native Advertising<\/h3>\n<p>One outcome of the renewed interest in ad blockers could be an increase in the popularity and prevalence of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/07\/native-advertising-examples\">native advertising<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Native ads look, read, and appear just like \u201ctrue\u201d content, putting them beyond the reach of ad blocking technology. Native advertising has become increasingly popular in recent years, but could soon become even more popular if ad blocker adoption continues to rise. Not every advertiser will be able to implement a native advertising campaign (or should, even if they have the means), but it\u2019s another direction that online advertising could take in the future.<\/p>\n<h3>Small Businesses Are the Least Likely to Be Affected<\/h3>\n<p>Since most small businesses <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/12\/google-adwords-mobile-data\">aren\u2019t seeing great conversion rates from mobile ads<\/a> anyway, they are the least likely to be affected by increased adoption of ad blockers on mobile.<\/p>\n<h2>TL;DR: What Ad Blockers Mean for You<\/h2>\n<p>So, in summary:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ad blockers are simple software programs that prevent online ads from being shown<\/li>\n<li>Apple sparked a controversy by allowing ad blocking technology in iOS 9, the latest version of its mobile operating system<\/li>\n<li>Increased adoption of ad blockers could affect real impressions for PPC and display advertisers (you think they&#8217;re seeing your ad, but they&#8217;re not)<\/li>\n<li>Social media advertising will remain unaffected by ad blockers, for now<\/li>\n<li>The best way to fight ad blockers is to diversify your advertising channels \u2013 across both search and social \u2013 and make sure you\u2019re using all the ad targeting options available to you, to focus your spend on where it will deliver the most ROI<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>UPDATE: Google to Offer &#8216;No Impression, No Charge&#8217; on Display Network<\/h2>\n<p>Google announced on Wednesday September 30 that it plans to introduce changes to the Display Network that will help advertisers&#8217; budgets go further. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/adwords.blogspot.ca\/2015\/09\/Enhancing-the-google-display-network.html\">an official blog post<\/a>, Google will soon no longer charge display network advertisers for impressions that are not viewable to users. If an ad isn&#8217;t seen &#8211; whether due to an ad being below the fold, in a background browser tab, or scrolled out of view &#8211; the advertiser won&#8217;t be charged. Although it doesn&#8217;t explicitly say so, this move seems a likely reaction to the increased concern about the adoption of ad blocking technology, though the problems outlined in the post have certainly been an issue for Display Network advertisers for some time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Edit:<\/strong> This post was updated on 10\/6 to reflect the fact that some ad blockers can eliminate the visibility of ads on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter on desktop clients.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ad blockers have been around for years, but online advertisers all over the world have been freaking out about these software programs lately.
