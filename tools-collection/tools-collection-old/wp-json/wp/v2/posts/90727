Since these users are highly engaged, they are likely to have fairly high intent to take the next step in the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-the-buyers-journey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">buyer&#8217;s journey<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Those keywords can tie back directly to the product or service you\u2019re offering to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/online-lead-generation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">help you generate leads<\/a>. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Roofing company near me<\/li>\n<li>Business accounting software<\/li>\n<li>When is the best time to buy a new car<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Search allows you to get in front of a user in their time of need and try to make an impression.

In some instances, the ad formats you need to appear in each placement can help you determine what platforms to use in case you don\u2019t have the resources to create those ads.<\/p>\n<p>Search ads use<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/responsive-search-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Responsive Search Ads<\/a> and are very attainable for just about every advertiser. They require only written text and a landing page.

While all networks other than search lack much of the intent that comes with Search, there are still lots of different ways to make an impact on your audience. Likely, for these formats, you\u2019re better off focusing on top to mid funnel calls to action rather than bottom of funnel like you can with search.<\/p>\n<h4>Ad formats in LinkedIn ads<\/h4>\n<p>While there is some variance in ad format depending on the campaign objective you use, there are quite a few different ad formats you can use on the LinkedIn platform to engage with your target audience.<\/p>\n<p>This article would be far too long if we went into each format in-depth, but here\u2019s a quick overview of the most common formats I use for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-lead-generation\">lead generation campaigns<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Single image ads<\/strong> are the most common and are likely the ones you\u2019re most familiar with. They include a single creative that can have almost any combination of text, imagery, and graphics to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-pros-write-calls-to-action\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> promote your campaign call to action<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Carousels and videos<\/strong> are very similar to single images in that you still get the surrounding supporting text. But rather than using a single image, you can leverage a series of images for carousels or a video for the video creative format.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Document ads<\/strong> are one of the newer formats and let you upload a document (oftentimes a PDF or PowerPoint) with a few slides as a teaser and have the rest of the asset gated behind a lead gen form.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Message ads<\/strong> operate almost like an email and can be found in the user\u2019s LinkedIn inbox. Typically, these are reserved for highly-appealing calls to action (read: not your whitepaper that you use everywhere else) and are best used sparingly to make a big impact.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>No matter what you\u2019re promoting, there\u2019s guaranteed to be an ad format that will work well for your purposes.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-vs-linkedin-ads-ad-format-png.avif\" alt=\"linkedin ads vs google ads - linkedin ad formats\" width=\"873\" height=\"437\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90746 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-vs-linkedin-ads-ad-format-png.avif 873w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-vs-linkedin-ads-ad-format-300x150.avif 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-vs-linkedin-ads-ad-format-768x384.avif 768w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-vs-linkedin-ads-ad-format-480x240.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 873px) 100vw, 873px\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-vs-linkedin-ads-pros-cons\">\n<h2>Google Ads vs. LinkedIn ads: Pros and cons<\/h2>\n<p>Need help deciding when to use each ad platform? Let&#8217;s dive into some pros and cons of Google Ads vs. LinkedIn ads.<\/p>\n<h3>Google Ads pros<\/h3>\n<p>Whether it\u2019s bottom-of-funnel campaigns through search or top and mid-funnel with Google\u2019s expanded networks, there\u2019s something for almost everyone with this platform.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Active searching<\/strong>: When using Search campaigns, you\u2019re able to reach your target audience at the exact moment they\u2019re researching the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/customer-pain-points\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">solution to a problem<\/a>. If you can craft great ads and stand out from the competition, you can influence them at a pivotal moment in their buyer journey.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Multi-channel coverage<\/strong>: Google isn\u2019t just search. Within the same ad platform, you can leverage search, display, YouTube, and many other Google-owned placements for much broader coverage than just a single placement.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Buyer influence:<\/strong> With those expanded networks, you can have a bigger influence on potential buyers by being present more often in their web browsing. You&#8217;re able to use these additional placements and impressions to further your potential customers&#8217; knowledge and interest in your brand and offerings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Google Ads cons<\/h3>\n<p>Here are some of the cons of Google Ads that you might alleviate with LinkedIn Ads.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lower control for personas<\/strong>: While search campaigns let you target users in their time of need, it\u2019s a little harder to control who you generate leads from. Google\u2019s targeting options just aren\u2019t great for B2B options, so you may end up with more unqualified leads due to a lack of specificity with targeting.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Low search volume for unknown brands\/solutions:<\/strong> if you\u2019re a new brand or your product is brand new, there might not be lots of people searching for you since they aren\u2019t aware of you yet. Search can only answer demand, it doesn\u2019t really create it. Without other top and mid-funnel strategies, search campaigns can be hard to get off the ground.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-vs-linkedin-ads-search-volume.avif\" alt=\"google ads vs linkedin ads - keywords\" width=\"810\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90830 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-vs-linkedin-ads-search-volume.avif 810w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-vs-linkedin-ads-search-volume-300x222.avif 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-vs-linkedin-ads-search-volume-768x569.avif 768w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-vs-linkedin-ads-search-volume-480x356.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>These branded Google Ads keyword examples have a monthly average search volume of 100 searches, according to our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a>.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>LinkedIn ads pros<\/h3>\n<p>LinkedIn is the B2B advertising capital of the internet. No matter how you reach your audience or which format you use, your users are almost certainly on LinkedIn. As long as you\u2019re on board with moving up the call-to-action funnel and focusing on top or mid-funnel calls to action, you\u2019ll be in a good spot on LinkedIn.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>B2B advertising capabilities<\/strong>: If you\u2019re trying to generate leads from other businesses rather than finding individual users, LinkedIn is a great option.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Persona fit<\/strong>: If you articulate your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/25\/buyer-persona-examples\">target personas<\/a> based on their job experience and the companies they\u2019re associated with.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Demand Generation:<\/strong> Unlike search, users on LinkedIn aren\u2019t actively searching for solutions to their problems. But because of that, it means you can introduce your brand, company, and offerings to your target audience even before they may need you, helping to create demand and build out a longer pipeline.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Unique Ad Formats:<\/strong> While all platforms have something akin to a single-image ad, LinkedIn\u2019s special offers are the document and message ads. They let you interact with your target audience in different ways than other platforms and can help you stand out from the crowd.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 id=\"linkedin-ads-vs-google-ads-cons\">LinkedIn ads cons<\/h3>\n<div>\n<p>Here are some reasons why you might use Google Ads over LinkedIn Ads.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Calls to action strategy<\/strong>: Although we all want bottom-of-funnel conversions, LinkedIn is not the best choice for those. There are some small exceptions, but you shouldn\u2019t expect that you\u2019ll be in that category. Typically, this channel does best with top and mid-funnel calls to action.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Higher cost<\/strong>: With great targeting comes great cost.

Why not both?<\/p>\n<p>As we covered, each channel has its best use cases and drawbacks, but in my experience, they work really well together to create much more coverage across all stages of the buyer funnel.<\/p>\n<p>LinkedIn is great for creating awareness and influencing the exact target audience you need. Google is great at answering a user\u2019s queries and getting them to take the final conversion action through automated bidding strategies.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s stop pitting platforms against one another. If I had my way, there wouldn\u2019t be a choice of which one to use. It would be a discussion around how to most effectively use both to create a strong lead funnel for your company to capitalize on now and in the future.<\/p>\n<h2>Why both Google Ads and LinkedIn Ads work well together<\/h2>\n<p>Both LinkedIn and Google Ads can be great platforms to generate leads for your business. While some businesses might find one channel more impactful than another, they typically work well together to create a comprehensive buyer funnel to make sure you\u2019re generating top-of-funnel interest, nurturing users to create demand, and then capturing that demand with bottom-of-funnel tactics.<\/p>\n<p>For more help balancing these two platforms, see how<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/marketing-services?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Demo_Blog_Demo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> our solutions<\/a> can seamlessly support your campaigns on both LinkedIn Ads and Google Ads for maximized success.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Use this complete comparison to understand the pros and cons of using Google Ads or LinkedIn Ads, and learn when to use both to generate leads for your business. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":114,"featured_media":90755,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[101],"tags":[],"dipi_cpt_category":[],"class_list":["post-90727","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-google-ads"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v25.8 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Google Ads vs. LinkedIn Ads: Which Platform Is Best For Lead Generation?
