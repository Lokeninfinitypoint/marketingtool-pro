Pinterest has become a haven for recipe swappers, DIY enthusiasts, designers, and more. Some of the most popular Pinterest users get their content shared thousands of times a day, and a high number of followers serves as a green light for other users debating who to follow.<\/p>\n<p>A user\u2019s number of Pinterest followers is another internet glamour metric, similar to Twitter followers. Just as with Twitter, having <strong>an army of inactive followers won\u2019t do you much good<\/strong>, since on Pinterest the <strong>real value comes from repins, comments, and liking<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Still, in a world where the number of your followers and fans matters more than it should (says the person with less than 100 Pinterest followers), most savvy social media moguls long for as many follower notches on the Pinterest-bedpost as they can manage.<\/p>\n<p>Lucky for you, we\u2019ve got plenty of smart alternatives to buying Pinterest followers. <strong>These techniques will get you <em>real <\/em>followers who will stay active<\/strong>, engage with your content, bring <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/05\/09\/five-tips-to-increase-referral-traffic\">referral traffic<\/a> to your site, and do your laundry! Alright, that last one\u2019s not <em>entirely <\/em>true, but the others are guaranteed.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Top 12 Alternatives to Buying Pinterest Followers<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h2>1. Promote Your Pinterest Account on Other Social Networks<\/h2>\n<p>Connect your Pinterest account with your Twitter and Facebook profiles. You can set up your permissions to have newly pinned items show up on your other networks. While this should be used with discretion, since heavy pinners may overwhelm your pals on Twitter and Facebook (Farmville-style), this is a great way to drum up followers from your other social networks.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Plaster the \u201cPin It\u201d Button All Over Your Content<\/h2>\n<p>Make it easy for visitors to share your stuff and follow you by <a href=\"http:\/\/business.pinterest.com\/widget-builder\/#do_pin_it_button\">adding the Pin It button<\/a> to your content and the Follow Button. Also try integrating Pinterest\u2019s nifty widgets if you\u2019re feeling adventurous.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Make Competitors into Contributors<\/h2>\n<p>You don\u2019t hear much about contributor boards, but they are an awesome feature on Pinterest that helps you gain exposure and pin collectively. Contributor boards let you and others you\u2019ve invited to each add pins to a single board, creating a happy commune of collaborative pinning.<\/p>\n<p>Invite followers to become contributors on certain boards, and when they accept the invite, the board will automatically be displayed on their Pinterest pages, meaning more exposure for you! Better yet, if users choose to follow all the boards on one of your contributor\u2019s account, your contributor board is followed too!<\/p>\n<p>Contributors can be added in the \u201cedit\u201d options connected to any existing Pinterest board you\u2019ve created.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"9ba09191-84cb-45de-9cb3-6d7a4aa98bcb\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adding-pinterest-contributors-1.png\" alt=\"Adding Contributors to Pinterest\" width=\"1466\" height=\"1189\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Invite customers, colleagues, and even competitors to become contributors to a few of your boards. You want to add contributors that share a similar audience to you. Adding competitors lets you gain exposure across their network \u2013 ingeniously sneaky!<\/p>\n<h2>4. Make Unique Boards That Stand Out<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s likely to be thousands, if not millions of \u201cFood\u201d boards on Pinterest, but how many \u201cManna From Heaven\u201d boards or \u201cDrool-Worthy Dumplings\u201d boards? Probably not so many. Get Pinterest followers by creating eye-catching board titles that demand a second glance. Don\u2019t get too freaky though; make sure that a user will still get the gist of what your board is all about.<\/p>\n<p>Also consider your audience \u2013 you should create more segmented boards within your industry. For example, it\u2019d be smart for a bakery to have a separate board for scones, lattes, cupcakes, and muffins, but those would look a bit silly for a tech company. This doesn\u2019t mean you should completely steer away from topics outside of your expertise \u2013 especially with Pinterest-popular topics like food.<\/p>\n<p>Mashable does a fantastic job with their \u201cNerdy Desserts\u201d board, creating a dessert board that still manages to relate to their knowledge base and appeal to their geeky audience.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7c15260b-0b5f-419a-a58e-45a5a46bd7a8\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/buying-pinterest-followers-alternatives-1.png\" alt=\"Alternatives to Buying Pinterest Followers\" width=\"236\" height=\"285\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Don\u2019t be afraid to go over-board, as it were \u2013 the most successful Pinterest accounts have over 200 different boards!<\/p>\n<h2>5. Pin Often and With Purpose<\/h2>\n<p>Staying active is a golden rule of all social media sites. It\u2019s important to pin often on Pinterest, but not all at once \u2013 no one appreciates having their home feed plastered with a single user\u2019s overzealous actions.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, spread your pins out over the course of a day. It\u2019s good to shoot for somewhere between 3 \u2013 15 pins a day. Make it easy for yourself by scheduling pins with a tool like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pingraphy.com\/\">Pingraphy.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>More activity means you are showing up on more Pinterest users\u2019 feeds, which naturally will increase your number of Pinterest followers.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Pin Original &amp; High-Quality Content<\/h2>\n<p>If users see you pinning the same old stuff everyone else pins, they won\u2019t be itching to follow you. New and high-quality pins will capture the most attention.<\/p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t to say you shouldn\u2019t repin other content \u2013 of course you should, but be sure to complement your repins with your own original content. If you\u2019re pinning photos, make sure they are high-quality and look good \u2013 low-quality, blurry images aren\u2019t nearly as appealing.<\/p>\n<p>Also aim for rich, colorful content. <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.curalate.com\/the-perfect-pinterest-pin-how-to-optimize-your-images-for-maximum-engagement-on-pinterest\/\">Curlate has done a study<\/a> showing that colorful pictures and images with minimal white space perform the best, with colors like red, orange, and brown getting twice as many repins as blue-dominated images.<\/p>\n<p>Take Pinterest\u2019s layout into consideration as well when pining content. Tall, long images look the best, which makes Pinterest an excellent space to share and promote <a href=\"\/articles\">infographics<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Quality content gets noticed \u2013 your pins should fulfill needs, answer questions, and inspire.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Comment, Like, and Engage<\/h2>\n<p>Though the commenting feature has been around on Pinterest for quite some time now, it\u2019s undervalued and rarely used, which means commenting is the perfect method to get some extra attention! Users who see you commenting and interacting with their boards will be much more likely to follow you.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1da3e4f3-0a4d-40c8-a72e-33a8a988fec6\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/getting-more-pinterest-followers-1.png\" alt=\"Should I buy Pinterest followers?\" width=\"662\" height=\"506\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>While \u201cliking\u201d content doesn\u2019t spark the same kind of notice and conversation that commenting does, it\u2019s still a solid practice.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"74b9f6e3-ecc5-4adc-b2c3-2cb03cd11de8\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pinterest-likes-1.png\" alt=\"Getting more Pinterest fans\" width=\"488\" height=\"912\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><em>How could you not like those slobbery beasts?<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>8. Write Solid Captions and Implement #Hashtags<\/h2>\n<p>I can\u2019t begin to tell you how many Pinterest \u201clove it\u201d or \u201chave to try this\u201d captions I\u2019ve seen. This is a poor practice if you\u2019re trying to increase your Pinterest followers. Opt instead for curt but descriptive captions that will make your pins easily searchable. Also consider adding some #hashtags where appropriate. Don\u2019t get too carried away \u2013 tons of hashtags and links in the description can come off as #spammy.<\/p>\n<h2>9. Get Creative &amp; Try Something Different<\/h2>\n<p>Get Pinterest followers by experimenting with design and layout on Pinterest. Peugeot Panama made social media headlines when they hosted a contest in which users had to find and pin the missing car tiles.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1fd5e574-4113-44bc-9365-b59f0d552a56\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/should-I-buy-pinterest-followers-1.png\" alt=\"is it smart to buy pinterest followers?\" width=\"459\" height=\"260\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Peugeot Panama took advantage of Pinterest\u2019s unique layout to create something new \u2013 try implementing your own cutting-edge designs.<\/p>\n<p>Middle Sister Wines also have fantastically creative Pinterest layouts, with each brand of wine represented by a character.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a045bd8b-e228-48de-9d32-f65b45c9143d\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-pinterest-followers-1.png\" alt=\"Increasing Pinterest Followers\" width=\"641\" height=\"413\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><em>You can&#8217;t image what they&#8217;re like at Happy Hour.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>While this is a creative design, it\u2019s not terribly hard to implement \u2013 could your business do something similar?<\/p>\n<h2>10. Follow Others<\/h2>\n<p>Give a little, get a little \u2013 following others is a great way to get your own followers, as many users practice reciprocal following.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t know who to follow? Click your name in Pinterest and you\u2019ll see a drop-down option to \u201cFind Friends.\u201d Pinterest will then show your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/04\/15\/facebook-marketing\">Facebook<\/a> and Twitter friends that are on Pinterest!<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2135d218-28c8-478f-9fbf-3ef8746143e9\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/gaining-pinterest-followers-1.png\" alt=\"Finding Friends on Pinterest\" width=\"252\" height=\"294\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>When you pin something, you\u2019ll also see the person and board you are repinning from. If it seems like a cool board, go ahead and follow that user\u2019s board, or all of their boards if you really dig their style.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also a smart idea to follow the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/01\/28\/who-to-follow-on-pinterest\">most popular Pinterest accounts<\/a> so you can see what the pros are pinning and think about how to emulate their Pinterest power.<\/p>\n<h2>11. Create \u201cCover Images\u201d For Your Content<\/h2>\n<p>This is a serous gem, and is key in getting Pinterest users to click through to the referral links attached to your pins. Despite being an image-oriented site, it\u2019s becoming increasingly more common to see quotes, text, and cover images appearing on Pinterest.<\/p>\n<p>What do I mean by a cover image? A Pinterest cover image is a striking graphic that hooks in viewers to a piece of content offered on your site. Here are a few examples:<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"91380328-5480-4aea-b6fa-166cd4da9f90\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-ways-to-get-more-pinterest-followers-1.png\" alt=\"Best Ways to Get More Followers on Pinterest\" width=\"235\" height=\"387\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<\/td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"343775e2-ed5d-4413-a151-ec6276d92a72\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-get-more-pinterest-followers-1.png\" alt=\"Buying followers Pinterest\" width=\"237\" height=\"445\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<\/td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5427a8e3-9d07-4c49-ac73-e03edeb24048\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/buy-pinterest-followers-alternatives-1.png\" alt=\"Buy Followers Pinterest\" width=\"235\" height=\"308\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>Cover images work great for sharing content like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tutorials<\/li>\n<li>White Papers<\/li>\n<li>E-Books<\/li>\n<li>Lists<\/li>\n<li>(Best) Blog Posts<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Using cover images promotes your persona as a trusted relayer of top-notch content, boosting your Pinterest following as a result.<\/p>\n<h2>12. Become a Featured Board<\/h2>\n<p>Having one of your boards featured on Pinterest\u2019s \u201csuggested boards to follow\u201d section or on popular pin-aggregators like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.repinly.com\/\">Repinly<\/a> is a following gold mine. This kind of exposure can\u2019t be bought, so your best bet is to set up your boards so that they have the best chance of becoming featured Pinterest boards. To increase your chances, make sure that your boards have a very focused subject, are well populated with plenty of pins, and get plenty of visits.<\/p>\n<p>For more Pinterest tips, tricks, and strategies, check out our complete <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/05\/01\/pinterest-marketing-guide\">Pinterest Marketing Guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Should My Business Be on Pinterest?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As a image-driven site, Pinterest works better for some companies than others.

Some do a pretty good impersonation, with bio pics and comments. There\u2019s a chance that these fake Pinterest followers are real enough to slip by Pinterest\u2019s spam filter, but don\u2019t trick yourself into thinking you\u2019re buying users who will truly interact and engage with your content.<\/p>\n<p>Pinterest\u2019s greatest value for marketers exists in generating referral traffic \u2013 Pinterest alone drives <a href=\"http:\/\/mashable.com\/2012\/02\/01\/pinterest-traffic-study\/\">more referral traffic than Google +, LinkedIn, and YouTube combined<\/a>.
