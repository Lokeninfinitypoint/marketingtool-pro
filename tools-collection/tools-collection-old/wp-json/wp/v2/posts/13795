Whether you\u2019re a small business owner, an in-house digital marketer, or an account manager at an agency, we want to provide the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/products\">products<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/solutions\">services<\/a> you need to achieve healthy, long-term growth.<\/p>\n<p>We can\u2019t do that if we don\u2019t understand the challenges you\u2019re facing.

What obstacles do they face? Are we doing an adequate job of helping them overcome those obstacles? If not, what do we need to do differently?<\/p>\n<p>I think you get the point. With that, let\u2019s take a look at some of the experiences our customers enjoyed while visiting WordStream HQ last week.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Speed networking exercise<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After some breakfast, a glimpse into what\u2019s coming to WordStream Advisor, and an update on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog?category=165&amp;author=All\">major developments<\/a> in the world of digital marketing, it was time for our 10 attendees to get to know each other a little better. So they did some speed networking\u2014think speed dating, but replace the premature declarations of love with insightful discussions of mutual challenges and unique experiences.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5290fc90-c3f0-4c4f-bcab-9df71f8d48fd\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-insight-round-table-speed-networking.jpg\" alt=\"customer-insight-round-table-speed-networking-exercise\" width=\"691\" height=\"461\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Every four minutes, each customer rotated to a new partner and responded to a new question. The\u00a0questions ranged\u00a0from \u201cWhat did you want to be when you grew up?\u201d to \u201cWhat are some tools other than WordStream that are integral to your success?\u201d And\u00a0the room was buzzin\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>After a couple rounds, it was time for WordStream employees (myself included!) to get in the mix. For the next half hour, we did essentially the same exercise\u2014rotating to a new partner every four minutes and embarking on a new topic of conversation. The key <em>difference<\/em> was that we were free to come up with our own questions for one another. So, whereas I talked to Mark from Dental Health Management Solutions about the challenges of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/04\/26\/linkedin-b2b-lead-generation\">B2B lead generation<\/a>, I talked to Ellen from LeaderStat about what it means to be the sole marketer at a company with several distinct internal organizations. We covered a ton of ground in only 30 minutes!<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Marketing journey brainstorm<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Following a trip to the Skywalk Observatory, a lunch-and-learn with Jenn Mason of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.curdsandco.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Curds &amp; Co.<\/a>, and a tour of the WordStream office, it was time to get back to business. Eric Gravlin, a senior manager on our UX design team, led a 90-minute brainstorming session that invited our customers to reflect on their experiences with digital marketing and business management.<\/p>\n<p>The goal? To learn more about the challenges our customers have faced, the successes they\u2019ve enjoyed, and the improvements we can make to better serve them going forward.<\/p>\n<p>The brainstorm was broken into three sections: past, present, and future. During the first section\u2014which took up the majority of the brainstorm\u2014we asked our participants to share responses to three questions:<\/p>\n<ol dir=\"ltr\">\n<li>How did you acquire your first customer?<\/li>\n<li>What\u2019s been your biggest roadblock to date?<\/li>\n<li>What was a moment of success?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>After jotting their answers down on sticky notes, everyone posted them on a timeline and expanded upon what they had written. For example, while one customer discussed the difficulty of negotiating for more marketing budget, another talked about the joy of winning a top ad placement on the SERP.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1195d826-8729-4a29-ae32-c3b4108e545f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-insight-round-table-marketing-journey-past-exercise.jpg\" alt=\"customer-insight-round-table-marketing-journey\" width=\"691\" height=\"461\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once everyone had posted their answers on the timeline, they marked each one with either a blue sticker (to signify an aha! moment) or a red or yellow sticker (to signify a moment when they knew they needed help).<\/p>\n<p>Next, it was time to focus on the present\u2014on the things our customers are currently doing on a monthly basis to keep their businesses running. We asked each of them to jot down answers to questions like these:<\/p>\n<ol dir=\"ltr\">\n<li>What activities do you typically do every month? When?<\/li>\n<li>What <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/08\/social-media-marketing-tools\">tools<\/a> do you use to accomplish these tasks?<\/li>\n<li>What are the five things that take the most time?<\/li>\n<li>What are the five things you do on a daily basis?<\/li>\n<li>What are you doing to grow your business?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Eric wrapped up the brainstorming session by leading a quick activity focused on the future. Once again, we asked our attendees to think about a few questions:<\/p>\n<ol dir=\"ltr\">\n<li>What do you see yourself doing differently in three months?<\/li>\n<li>What keeps you up at night as a business owner or marketer?<\/li>\n<li>What\u2019s the one thing you want WordStream to build?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"be1ccb76-3707-4399-bd78-21ff91e8be45\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-insight-round-table-marketing-journey-future-exercise.jpg\" alt=\"customer-insight-round-table-marketing-journey-brainstorm-conclusion\" width=\"691\" height=\"461\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>After a quick stretch break, it was time for the final\u2014and most anticipated\u2014part of the day.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Customer insight panel<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Making sure to save the best for last, we wrapped up the day with everyone\u2019s favorite session: the customer insight panel. Led\u2014with a terrific sense of humor, I might add\u2014by Senior Customer Success Specialist <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/19\/employee-spotlight-lauren-gentile\">Lauren Gentile<\/a>, the panel was our opportunity to get the customers\u2019 honest perspectives on a wide range of topics.<\/p>\n<p>The majority of the session involved Lauren asking direct questions to individual customers. For example, when asked if he has any advice for fellow business owners venturing into digital marketing for the first time, Mark (who owns his own law firm) recommended learning the basics of PPC on your own\u00a0and then\u00a0partnering with a company like WordStream. Later on, when Lauren asked John from Jennco Solutions for his opinion on the sales and onboarding processes, he recommended that we make more of a point to demonstrate the full value of what we\u2019re offering to our prospects.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"615d8a93-e0b4-44da-9fc2-3b5d1a9b1a5a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-insight-round-table-panel-john_0.jpg\" alt=\"customer-insight-round-table-panel-johns-answer\" width=\"691\" height=\"461\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>After Lauren had asked each customer a specific question, she opened up the floor for WordStream employees to ask the group anything they wanted. Among my favorites was a question from Topher (an engineer) about ideas for WordStream Advisor features and a question from Navah (recently recognized <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/06\/07\/ppc-experts\">PPC expert<\/a>!) about the challenges of establishing a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/10\/15\/multi-channel-marketing\">cross-platform digital marketing strategy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>By the time the panel had come to a close, our generous attendees had been hard at work for over nine hours\u2014all to help WordStream become a better company. As a token of our gratitude, the day ended with a cocktail hour punctuated with plenty of drinks and a taco bar.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Final thoughts<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Regardless of department, job title, or seniority level, every WordStream employee is in agreement on one thing: <strong>It\u2019s a privilege to engage with our customers in this way<\/strong>. The better we understand our customers and their goals, the better we become at our jobs. Simply put, we can\u2019t overstate how valuable these insights are to the success of our company.<\/p>\n<p>We hope all the customers who participated got something out of it, too. Ideally, by giving you all an inside look at your favorite online advertising management company, we\u2019ve fostered a stronger sense of pride in the products and services we do our best to build around your needs.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re looking forward to what\u2019s coming next!<\/p>\n<p><em>A huge thank you to Kim Castings for organizing a wonderful event and to Mikayla Wyman for snapping so many awesome photos.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On June 11, 2019, we hosted 10 generous customers for our fourth customer insight roundtable.
