Be Honest in Your Sales Copy<\/h2>\n<p>This might seem painfully obvious, but it\u2019s amazing to me how many sites write checks their products can\u2019t cash. Not only is honesty in your copy crucial to your business\u2019 reputation, it also fosters and encourages trust in your brand. Don\u2019t make claims you can\u2019t substantiate, and don\u2019t use hyperbole lightly \u2013 <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/02\/marketing-to-millennials\">today\u2019s consumers are hypersensitive to marketing BS<\/a>, so be honest, straightforward, and approachable in all your sales copy, from your homepage to your email campaigns.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-sales-online-be-honest-with-your-copy.jpg\" alt=\"Increase sales online be honest in your copy\" width=\"620\" height=\"350\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>This PETA ad was pulled from billboards in the U.K. by the Advertising Standards Authority in 2013 for making unsubstantiated claims.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This principle also applies to how you position yourself as a business. Ever come across a site that\u2019s obviously run by one or two people, but features copy that would be better suited to a multinational enterprise company? This approach not only makes you look foolish, it also damages your brand\u2019s credibility. If you\u2019re a small company, take pride in that and be upfront about it \u2013 many consumers are turning to smaller businesses precisely because of the more individualized, personal service they can offer. Don\u2019t try to be something you\u2019re not.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Get More Ad Clicks with Ad Extensions<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re selling stuff online, ad extensions are a no-brainer \u2013 this feature (available in both AdWords and Bing) allows you to make your ad bigger with more places to click. And it doesn\u2019t cost any extra! AND it increases your ad\u2019s click-through rate! Amazing, right?<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-sales-online-ad-extensions.png\" alt=\"Increase sales online use ad extensions\" width=\"532\" height=\"190\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In the above example, the links to \u201cMen\u2019s Sunglasses\u201d and \u201cWomen\u2019s Sunglasses\u201d give people who are looking to buy a new pair of Ray-Ban\u2019s two additional places to click. This saves the potential customer a step and makes it easier and faster to find exactly what they want (so they go to your site instead of a competitor\u2019s).<\/p>\n<h2>3. Show Off Customer Testimonials and Trust Signals<\/h2>\n<p>In today\u2019s social media environment, customer feedback has never been more important. Fortunately, this means that your satisfied customers can provide you with one of the most valuable weapons in your arsenal \u2013 testimonials.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-sales-online-customer-testimonials.png\" alt=\"Increase sales online include customer testimonials\" width=\"983\" height=\"360\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Legions of satisfied customers are considerably more influential than even the best-written sales copy, so make sure you include gushing testimonials and reviews from your hardcore brand evangelists gushing about how wonderful you are. These might appear on your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/07\/ecommerce-sales-product-pages\">product pages<\/a>, landing pages, pricing page, even your home page. For more info, check out my post on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/05\/customer-testimonials\">the power of customer testimonials<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, the inclusion of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/27\/trust-signals\">trust signals<\/a> can be an excellent way to increase online sales and\/or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/22\/increase-average-order-value\">average order value<\/a>, as it creates a more favorable perception of your brand in the mind of the prospect and can potentially overcome hesitations preemptively. If your business has any professional accreditations (even something as routine as a Better Business Bureau certification or membership to your local chamber of commerce), put these trust signals front and center on your site. If you have an impressive list of satisfied clients, make sure your prospects know about it.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Create a Sense of Urgency<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s important to be honest and transparent about who you are and what you do, but there\u2019s no rule against creating a sense of urgency to persuade prospects to buy from you right now.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-sales-online-create-sense-urgency.png\" alt=\"Increase sales online by creating a sense of urgency\" width=\"735\" height=\"488\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Many consumers respond positively to incentives that create a sense of urgency, from time-sensitive special offers to limited-edition products. Although the ways you can accomplish this are as diverse as the products you can buy online, some strategies may be more effective than others. For example, if you don\u2019t (or can\u2019t) make a limited-edition product to entice prospects, maybe you can offer a financial incentive to customers who commit to a purchase right away, such as free shipping or a discount.<\/p>\n<p>In AdWords, you can use <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/08\/18\/ad-customizers\">ad customizers<\/a> to display a countdown on a seasonal offer or limited-time sale:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-sales-online-ad-customizers.png\" alt=\"Increase sales online use ad customizers\" width=\"620\" height=\"92\" \/><\/div>\n<p>However you choose to do it, creating a sense of urgency is a great way to increase online sales.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Offer a Bulletproof Money-Back Guarantee<\/h2>\n<p>Oftentimes, one of the most powerful factors in a consumer\u2019s decision not to buy something is risk aversion \u2013 the desire to avoid a potential loss. Most times, this perceived risk is a financial one. Why should someone buy your products? What if they don\u2019t work, or the customer doesn\u2019t like them? Even small purchases can carry the risk of \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse,\u201d so overcome this objection from the outset by offering a bulletproof money-back guarantee.<\/p>\n<p>The more risk you remove from the prospect\u2019s decision, the more likely they are to buy from you, so take away anything that could dissuade prospects from buying from you.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-sales-online-money-back-guarantee.jpeg\" alt=\"how to increase sales online lifelock money back guarantee\" width=\"984\" height=\"802\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>6. Offer Fewer Choices<\/h2>\n<p>To many businesses, this concept is simply unthinkable. Surely offering more products is a great way to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/30\/cross-selling-upselling\">increase sales<\/a>! Well, not necessarily. In fact, in many instances, a greater variety of choice can lead to indecision on the part of the prospect, which in turn results in lost sales.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a wide range of products, consider structuring your site or product pages in a way that offers visitors as few choices as possible. This reduces the possibility that the visitor will be overwhelmed by dozens of different products. This can be accomplished by arranging your products into increasingly narrow categories (an added bonus of which is offering visitors greater ease to find exactly what they\u2019re looking for), or you could place greater emphasis on fewer individual products. Either way, remember that the more choices you provide, the more likely a customer is to bounce and go elsewhere.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Target Lookalike Audiences on Facebook<\/h2>\n<p>One of the best ways to increase online sales is to use the data you have about your existing customers to find people just like them. Facebook allows you to do this through the targeting of lookalike audiences.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-sales-online-facebook-lookalike-audiences.png\" alt=\"Increase sales online target lookalike audiences in Facebook\" width=\"600\" height=\"365\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Lookalike audiences in Facebook are essentially users on Facebook who share characteristics and behaviors to customers in your database. You upload your data to Facebook, which then cross-references its own data (and information from third-party data brokers) to create matches based on the criteria you specify. You can also use tracking pixels and data from app installations to help you create lookalike audiences. This is an excellent way to make the data on your existing customers work for you, as it effectively allows you to greatly expand your reach with minimal effort and use highly targeted ads to entice Facebook users who are very similar to your existing customers.<\/p>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/28\/facebook-ad-targeting\">this blog post about Facebook ad targeting<\/a> to learn more about lookalike audiences.<\/p>\n<h2>8. Reduce Friction in the Checkout Process<\/h2>\n<p>According to Business Insider, approximately <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/heres-how-retailers-can-reduce-shopping-cart-abandonment-and-recoup-billions-of-dollars-in-lost-sales-2014-4\">$4 TRILLION worth of online merchandise was abandoned in incomplete shopping carts last year<\/a> alone, of which 63% was potentially recoverable. This is a truly jaw-dropping statistic, and one that reveals how crucial it is to nail your checkout process.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-sales-online-combat-shopping-cart-abandonment.jpeg\" alt=\"how to increase sales online abandoned shopping cart\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Similar to the point above about user experience, reducing friction in your checkout process can have an incredible impact on your conversion rates. Just as you should make it as easy as possible for visitors to use and navigate your site, you should make it even easier for them to actually buy what you\u2019re selling.<\/p>\n<p>Eliminate any unnecessary steps in your checkout process that could dissuade a prospect from converting. Skip unnecessary fields in forms. Don\u2019t time them out and make them start over from the beginning. Here are some more tips on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/17\/shopping-cart-abandonment\">battling shopping cart abandonment<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>9. Provide as Many Payment Options as Possible<\/h2>\n<p>Okay, so your business takes credit cards. What about Google Wallet payments? Or ApplePay? What about Stripe? WePay?<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-sales-online-accept-numerous-payment-types.jpeg\" alt=\"how to increase sales online easy iphone payment\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Consumers have more choice than ever before in terms of how they actually pay for goods and services, and not everyone prefers to use American Express. By offering more payment options, including newer services that are becoming <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/31\/2020-ecommerce-marketing-trends\">increasingly popular<\/a> on mobile, you\u2019re making it easier for prospects to give you their money. Sure, it can be a hassle to optimize your site (and checkout process, as we discussed above) to include all these options, but doing so is a great way to increase online sales, particularly if your site has strong mobile traffic.<\/p>\n<p>On a related note, site security is paramount, especially for ecommerce sites where visitors are providing payment information. The best way to secure your site is with an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/09\/what-is-an-ssl-certificate\">SSL certificate<\/a>. The process, pricing, and type of certificate you need varies depending on the size of your site and your industry and the provider you choose. Some offer them for free but require regular renewal, some offer them as a paid but one-time option, while others offer them free as part of a larger offering. For example, HubSpot includes free <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/products\/cms\/ssl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SSL encryption<\/a> with its CMS.<\/p>\n<h2>10. Invest in Quality Product Images<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s compelling evidence that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/wordofmouth\/2015\/jul\/21\/food-presentation-dinner-food-enjoyable\">well-presented food actually tastes better than sloppily plated dishes<\/a>. Given how important appearance is in relation to how we perceive things (including other people), it stands to reason that investing in quality product photography will have a similar effect on visitors to your site.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-sales-online-product-photography.jpeg\" alt=\"how to increase sales online product photography studio\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Regardless of what you sell, include high-quality images of your products \u2013 no tiny thumbnails or poorly lit shots taken in your stock room. Also be sure to include a wide range of images. It might seem overkill to include shots of your products from every conceivable angle, but try it out. People love to kick a product\u2019s proverbial tires before buying, especially online.<\/p>\n<h2>11. Get Rid of Your Landing Pages<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve mentioned this strategy before, and it usually raises more than a few eyebrows to say the least. However, we\u2019re not advocating for eliminating landing pages unnecessarily, but rather optimizing your online ads to align with how many consumers actually browse the Web and shop online.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-sales-online-facebook-click-to-call-ads.png\" alt=\"Increase sales online use Facebook click-to-call ads\" width=\"425\" height=\"244\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Call-Only campaigns in Facebook and AdWords are an excellent example of a situation in which removing the traditional landing page entirely makes a lot of sense. Most people don\u2019t want to spend several minutes browsing pages on their mobile device \u2013 they simply want to get in touch with your business.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-sales-online-call-only-campaigns.png\" alt=\"how to increase sales online call only google ads on mobile\" width=\"748\" height=\"692\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>By utilizing <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/07\/call-only-ads\">Call-Only ads<\/a>, you\u2019re making it easier for prospects to reach out to your business, eliminating one of the leakiest stages of the classic online sales funnel completely, and potentially increasing the volume of calls to your business \u2013 one of the most valuable lead sources to many businesses. People who call you are practically begging you to sell them something.<\/p>\n<h2>12. Give Gmail Ads a Try<\/h2>\n<p>Or don&#8217;t&#8230;<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/16\/gmail-ads-going-away\">Gmail Ads are going away<\/a>. \ud83d\ude41<\/p>\n<p>After years in and out of beta, Gmail Ads are FINALLY available to everyone. This is an exciting way to reach prospects and increase sales.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-sales-online-gmail-ads.png\" alt=\"Increase sales online use Gmail ads\" width=\"1197\" height=\"494\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If you\u2019re already reaching customers when they search and when they browse on social, why not go the extra mile and hit them while they\u2019re in their inboxes, too? One of the most effective ways to use <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/01\/gmail-ads\">Gmail Ads<\/a> is by targeting competitor keywords. People who are in the market for your competitors\u2019 products are getting emails from your competitors that mention their brand terms right now. By targeting those same terms you can show up in their inboxes and hopefully change their minds.<\/p>\n<h2>13. Keep Messaging Consistent Across Campaigns and Your Site<\/h2>\n<p>Ever clicked a PPC ad that grabbed your attention, only to be taken to an irrelevant landing page (bad) or the site\u2019s homepage (worse)? Did you end up buying whatever you were looking for from that site? Probably not.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-sales-online-message-match-ad.png\" alt=\"how to increase sales online display ad for air canada\" width=\"456\" height=\"377\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A display ad for Air Canada, and its accompanying landing page.<\/em><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-sales-online-message-match-landing-page.png\" alt=\"how to increase sales online landing page matches ad\" width=\"1094\" height=\"560\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If a user clicks an ad for a specific product or service, the page they\u2019re taken to should be about that specific product or service \u2013 not a related category, not a special offer for another product, but <em>that specific product<\/em>. Make sure your messaging is relevant across your PPC and paid social campaigns and the pages associated with them, so that ad clicks actually turn into sales.<\/p>\n<h2>14. Answer Every Question and Address Every Objection in Your Copy<\/h2>\n<p>One of the most dangerous pitfalls you can fall into when trying to sell online is making assumptions about your prospective customers\u2019 knowledge of your product, service, or even market. Many companies mistakenly believe their customers know more about what they\u2019re selling than they actually do, which results in unanswered questions or objections that are failed to be addressed \u2013 both of which can harm sales.<\/p>\n<p>Consider every question you can possibly think of about your product, and answer it in your copy on your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/06\/01\/product-pages\">product pages<\/a>. Similarly, think about every potential objection a prospect might have about your offering, and preemptively overcome it in your copy. This might seem impractical, but remember, you\u2019re not bombarding prospects with unnecessary information \u2013 you\u2019re giving them exactly what they need to make an informed decision. This approach is also an excellent exercise in writing tight, clear, concise copy. If you\u2019re worried there\u2019s too much copy, you can always trim it down. Just keep the focus on the customer and how it benefits them, not why your company is so awesome.<\/p>\n<h2>15. Give Away As Much As You Possibly\u00a0Can for Free<\/h2>\n<p>People <em>love<\/em> free stuff, and the more you give away for free, the more favorably prospective customers are likely to perceive you and your brand, which can result in more online sales.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-sales-online-give-away-free-stuff.jpeg\" alt=\"how to increase sales online free stuff\" width=\"800\" height=\"472\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Awesome!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Look at your current offerings. Can you give anything away for free? If you\u2019re in the software business as we are, it\u2019s easy to offer free, no-obligation trials of your software. Or even free tools like ROI calculators and other interactive content (<a href=\"https:\/\/outgrow.co\/increase-sales\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Outgrow is a great tool for this!<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Even if you\u2019re not, you can just as easily give away samplers, trial memberships, two-for-one offers, and other reward-based incentives. Giving stuff away for free isn\u2019t just a great way to improve people\u2019s perception of your business, it\u2019s also a great way to introduce them to your must-have products and tempt them to buy more.<\/p>\n<h2>16. Create and Target Detailed Buyer Personas<\/h2>\n<p>I\u2019m going to go ahead and assume that you\u2019re already creating buyer personas (because if you aren\u2019t, you\u2019re in real trouble), but I <em>am<\/em> going to challenge you to create even more detailed buyer personas than you have in the past.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-sales-online-create-detailed-buyer-personas.jpg\" alt=\"Increase sales online create detailed buyer personas\" width=\"1170\" height=\"465\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If you\u2019ve ever looked at the targeting options available to Facebook advertisers, you may have seen the amazing granularity with which you can target users on Facebook \u2013 advertisers can target users based on the square footage of their home, the university from which they earned their degree, and even where they plan on going for their next vacation (as Margot revealed in her fascinating post about <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/10\/20\/facebook-audience\">amazingly granular Facebook audiences<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, this degree of specificity may be a little overkill for your buyer personas, but the better you \u201cknow\u201d your ideal customers, the more likely they are to respond to carefully crafted messaging tailored specifically to their lives. Push yourself to create more detailed buyer personas than you ever have before. To learn more about this process, check out my detailed guide to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/23\/buyer-personas\">creating buyer personas<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>17. Implement Tiered Pricing<\/h2>\n<p>When you go to a restaurant, the chances are pretty good that you\u2019ll invariably choose one of the mid-priced dishes. This is because many restaurants manipulate psychology to push people toward the mid-range meals. We\u2019ll often avoid the cheapest dishes \u2013 and the most expensive \u2013 making the middle-tier options the most appealing. This is a technique known as \u201cdecoy pricing.\u201d The same principle can be leveraged to increase sales online with tiered pricing structures.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-sales-online-decoy-pricing.jpeg\" alt=\"how to increase sales online decoy pricing\" width=\"1630\" height=\"500\" \/><\/div>\n<p>By including a third \u201cdecoy\u201d option in your pricing structure, you can push people toward the middle option \u2013 the one you <em>really<\/em> want them to buy. Sure, some people will go for the most expensive option anyway (which is a bonus, revenue-wise), but most will subconsciously avoid the decoy and choose the middle-tier option, which is precisely what you want them to do.<\/p>\n<p>Many companies leverage this psychological principle (also known as the \u201casymmetric dominance effect\u201d) to make us buy what <em>they<\/em> want. To learn more about decoy pricing, check out <a href=\"http:\/\/marketingland.com\/5-psychological-hacks-will-make-pricing-page-irresistible-121535\">this post by Neil Patel at MarketingLand<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>18. Add an Opt-In Pop-Up Offer to Push Them Over the Edge<\/h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to increase sales in retail, don&#8217;t ignore the potential of opt-in offers \u2013 prompts that encourage people to sign up for your newsletter, mailing list, or loyalty programs. Using opt-in offers can not only significantly increase the number of contacts in your database (a major asset for future <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/12\/is-email-marketing-effective\">email marketing<\/a> campaigns), but also increase online sales in the short term.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-sales-online-launch-opt-in-offer.jpeg\" alt=\"Increase sales online launch an opt-in offer\" width=\"640\" height=\"322\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Prospective customers who are on the fence about buying from you may well be swayed by a well-placed opt-in offer for, say, free shipping, or 10% of their first order. Even if they decide against the purchase at that time, but <em>do<\/em> sign up for your opt-in offer, you\u2019ve still added them to your database and they may choose to return later to complete the sale.<\/p>\n<p>When launching an opt-in offer, be sure to test every element for maximum optimization. Test the phrasing of the copy, the position at which it appears on your site, and the flow that visitors are directed through the process. A\/B test different offers and see which ones yield a greater volume of sign-ups. Consider having the pop-up be triggered by a site exit so visitors see it just before they&#8217;re about the leave the page. The more people that sign up for your newsletter or loyalty program, the more potential sales you can make in the future.<\/p>\n<h2>19. Grow Online Sales with Mobile Optimization<\/h2>\n<p>The number of online businesses with poorly designed, badly optimized \u201cmobile\u201d sites is amazing.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-sales-online-optimize-mobile-site.png\" alt=\"how to increase sales online mobile optimization\" width=\"3581\" height=\"1393\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Mobile search has already eclipsed desktop search in volume. If you don\u2019t want to leave sales on the table, it\u2019s vital that your site is optimized for mobile \u2013 and not purely from a technical perspective.<\/p>\n<p>Make it as easy as possible for mobile visitors to buy whatever you\u2019re selling. This may involve an extensive overhaul of your checkout process (see tip #18), or the design and launch of an entirely separate mobile site. Amazon\u2019s mobile site is an excellent example of how <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/02\/ecommerce-seo\">mobile ecommerce<\/a> can (and arguably should) be done, but you don\u2019t need Amazon\u2019s resources to create a compelling, user-friendly experience for visitors on mobile.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-sales-online-ecommerce-example.jpg\" alt=\"Increase sales online responsive design ecommerce example\" width=\"600\" height=\"328\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Navigation and user experience are among the most crucial elements of a well-designed, highly optimized mobile experience. The harder it is for visitors to find \u2013 and buy \u2013 what they want, the more likely they are to abandon your site altogether and take their business elsewhere. Pages should load near-instantaneously, and navigation should be logical. Don\u2019t ask for too much information, only the bare minimum you need to either make the sale or market to prospects later. Allow visitors to come back to their carts later, even on another device. Don\u2019t expect mobile visitors to convert in a single session, because they probably (almost definitely) won\u2019t \u2013 but they might convert later, if you make it easy for them to do so.<\/p>\n<p>Think of your mobile visitors and do everything you possibly can to make it effortless for them to buy from you while they\u2019re on the go.<\/p>\n<h2>20. Impress New Customers with an Amazing Follow-Up Email<\/h2>\n<p>Sadly, the customer experience typically ends for many businesses when they\u2019ve finally got their hands on a customer\u2019s money. This is a terrible mistake for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/04\/client-retention-tips\">customer retention<\/a>. To increase sales volume online, make sure you have a thoughtful, considerate, genuinely useful follow-up procedure in place for new customers.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-sales-online-follow-up-email.png\" alt=\"how to increase sales online follow up email example\" width=\"497\" height=\"602\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As a hardcore computer geek, I\u2019m <em>always<\/em> ordering stuff from Newegg.com \u2013 replacement parts, new components, and other deliciously geeky stuff. The reason I\u2019ve been a loyal Newegg customer for many years isn\u2019t just the price of the goods (which <em>is<\/em> highly competitive), but rather the focus on customer service and the follow-up process Newegg has in place.<\/p>\n<p>Whenever I place an order, I receive detailed summaries of my purchase (including vital tracking information so I can hit \u201cRefresh\u201d on the order page to see where my stuff is), as well as customer service information, links to relevant products I might be interested in, and all sorts of other resources. I\u2019m prompted to leave reviews and feedback about my experience, encouraged to contact a real person if I have questions about my order, and can even discuss or answer questions about my purchase for other users who are considering buying whatever I just splurged on. Generally speaking, it\u2019s just a great shopping experience \u2013 which is why I\u2019ve been buying my hardware from Newegg for years.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t forget about your customers as soon as they\u2019ve given you their credit card details. The more attention you pay to them after they\u2019ve bought something, the more likely they are to become fiercely loyal brand evangelists who will not only turn into satisfied repeat customers, but will also go and tell and their friends (and blog readers) about how great you are. When a customer buys something, offer them something for free (see tip #11). Talk to them on social media (more on this shortly). Send them a thoughtful, useful follow-up email with incentives to buy from you again. However you do it, make your customers feel like the precious little snowflakes they are \u2013 think <em>relationships<\/em>, not transactions.<\/p>\n<h2>21. Nail Your Value Proposition \u2013 And Make It Immediately Obvious<\/h2>\n<p>Far too many companies lose sales and waste time by focusing on themselves. Remember how we discussed that people don\u2019t want to buy things, only solve their problems? Well, another painful truth is that unless your customers are the brand evangelists we\u2019ve been talking about, the vast majority of them don\u2019t care about you or your company \u2013 only how your products or services will make their lives better. This is why <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\">your value proposition<\/a> should take center stage in all your marketing communications and site content.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-sales-online-value-proposition.jpg\" alt=\"Increase sales online value proposition\" width=\"750\" height=\"470\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Essentially, your value proposition is the primary reason customers should buy from you, not your competitors, and the promise of the value prospects will receive by investing in whatever you\u2019re selling. Value propositions can be broken down into three main areas:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Relevance:<\/strong> How your product\/service will solve customers\u2019 problems<\/li>\n<li><strong>Quantifiable value:<\/strong> The specific benefits your product\/service offers<\/li>\n<li><strong>Differentiator:<\/strong> Why customers should buy from you and not a competing company<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When you break down a value proposition into these three components, it becomes easy to see why these elements should inform virtually everything about your marketing messaging and site content, from the copy on your homepage to the content of your email marketing campaigns. Why <em>wouldn\u2019t<\/em> you focus exclusively on these aspects of your products?<\/p>\n<p>Take a look at your landing page copy, sales collateral, and other marketing materials. Is the value proposition immediately obvious? If not, it\u2019s time to go back to the drawing board. Everything your prospects see should tie back to your value proposition in one way or another. The greater the perceived value you can create surrounding your products or services, the more sales you\u2019ll make.<\/p>\n<h2>22. Use the Voice of the Customer for More Resonant Ad Campaigns<\/h2>\n<p>Hopefully you\u2019re already using PPC and paid social to expand your reach and find new audiences. However, the language you use in your campaigns can have a tremendous impact on your conversion rates (and, therefore, your sales), so my fourth tip is to use \u201cthe voice of the customer\u201d in your campaigns \u2013 but what does this mean?<\/p>\n<p>The voice of the customer is a market research technique that aligns copy with the needs, wants, pain points, expectations, and aversions of the consumer being targeted by that particular messaging. This process often includes language and phrasing used by customers themselves during market research and focus group testing.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-sales-online-use-voice-of-customer.jpg\" alt=\"Increase sales online use the voice of the customer in your copy\" width=\"850\" height=\"427\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The example above, from accounting software company FreshBooks, uses the voice of the customer to great effect. During its market research, FreshBooks discovered that its target market (small-business owners) found bookkeeping to be painful and challenging, and so it incorporated language used by its target market in its messaging.<\/p>\n<p>This technique can be extraordinarily powerful, as you\u2019re using the exact phrasing used <em>by<\/em> your ideal customers <em>to reach<\/em> your ideal customers. To learn more about how to incorporate this into your own campaigns, check out <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/11\/voice-of-the-customer\">this post on the voice of the customer<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>23. Pinpoint Your Best Attribution and Conversion Paths<\/h2>\n<p>Sometimes, it feels as though you\u2019re doing everything right, only to see <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/17\/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate\">your conversion rates hovering somewhere between \u201cmiserable\u201d and \u201cpathetic.\u201d<\/a> Oftentimes, this isn\u2019t anything to do with the messaging or positioning of your ads (though it pays to look at this closely), but rather a misunderstanding of when and where conversions are happening.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-sales-online-conversion-paths.jpg\" alt=\"Increase sales online conversion paths\" width=\"768\" height=\"322\" \/><\/div>\n<p>One of the first things you should do if your conversion rates look low is to examine your attribution models and conversion pathways in Analytics. You may be surprised to find that parts of your marketing strategy that seem like conversion duds actually have a big influence on your online sales. For example, maybe organic search isn\u2019t a great channel for converting into sales, but people who find you <em>first<\/em> through organic search, and <em>then<\/em> see a Facebook ad are highly like to become a paying customer. If that\u2019s the case, you should double-down on content marketing and pour some money into Facebook remarketing too (see Tip #1, below).<\/p>\n<h2>24. Actually Talk to Your Prospects on Social Media<\/h2>\n<p>Active engagement with prospects via social media is overlooked as a potential sales tool by far too many businesses because it is perceived as having a negligible impact on actual sales \u2013 when in fact this is one of the best ways you can increase brand awareness, customer satisfaction, <em>and<\/em> sales.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-sales-online-social-media-engagement.png\" alt=\"how to increase sales online facebook post\" width=\"884\" height=\"328\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Think of a time when you tweeted at a company, or commented on a brand\u2019s Facebook page \u2013 and the company actually responded to you personally. What effect did this have on your perception of that brand? I\u2019ll wager it became significantly more favorable. <strong>Providing fast, honest answers to questions that potential customers have about your offerings is an excellent way to increase sales<\/strong>, as the more attention you are perceived as paying to potential customers, the more likely people are to want to buy from you. This also results in unsolicited social feedback among users themselves \u2013 the kind of brand exposure and \u201cadvertising\u201d you just can\u2019t buy (well, not in a way that sounds legitimate, anyway).<\/p>\n<h2>25. Use Remarketing to Close Way More Deals<\/h2>\n<p>No matter whether you\u2019re running a PPC campaign or a Facebook advertising campaign, any digital marketing initiative takes time, money, and effort to accomplish. If you\u2019re not using remarketing, you\u2019re essentially banking on prospective customers converting immediately, which almost never happens (and is exactly as crazy as it sounds).<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/increase-sales-online-remarketing.png\" alt=\"how to increase sales online remarketing\" width=\"3508\" height=\"2480\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re remarketing your content or a specific time-sensitive sale offer, <strong>remarketing is arguably the single most effective way to increase sales online<\/strong>. Not only does remarketing keep your brand at the forefront of prospects\u2019 minds, it also provides would-be customers with numerous additional opportunities to convert. Given the often-fractured customer journey, which now usually takes place across at least a day or two and several devices, remarketing also closely aligns with how today\u2019s consumers prefer to shop \u2013 which is wherever and whenever <em>they<\/em> choose.<\/p>\n<p>Remarketing is a complex, nuanced topic with unique considerations depending on whether you\u2019re remarketing with paid search or paid social, so check out <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/12\/04\/adwords-remarketing-best-practices-guide\">The Complete Guide to AdWords Remarketing Best Practices<\/a> and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/11\/16\/facebook-remarketing\">The Ridiculously Awesome Guide to Facebook Remarketing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>How to Increase Online Sales [Summary]<\/h3>\n<p>Try these 25 tactics to start closing more sales online:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use Remarketing to Close Way More Deals<\/li>\n<li>Actually Talk to Your Prospects on Social Media<\/li>\n<li>Pinpoint Your Best Attribution and Conversion Paths<\/li>\n<li>Use the Voice of the Customer for More Resonant Ad Campaigns<\/li>\n<li>Nail Your Value Proposition \u2013 And Make It Immediately Obvious<\/li>\n<li>Impress New Customers with an Amazing Follow-Up Email<\/li>\n<li>Grow Online Sales with Mobile Optimization<\/li>\n<li>Add an Opt-In Pop-Up Offer to Push Them Over the Edge<\/li>\n<li>Implement Tiered Pricing<\/li>\n<li>Create and Target Detailed Buyer Personas<\/li>\n<li>Give Away As Much As You Possibly Can for Free<\/li>\n<li>Answer Every Question and Address Every Objection in Your Copy<\/li>\n<li>Keep Messaging Consistent Across Campaigns and Your Site<\/li>\n<li>Give Gmail Ads a Try<\/li>\n<li>Get Rid of Your Landing Pages<\/li>\n<li>Invest in Quality Product Images<\/li>\n<li>Provide as Many Payment Options as Possible<\/li>\n<li>Reduce Friction in the Checkout Process<\/li>\n<li>Target Lookalike Audiences on Facebook<\/li>\n<li>Offer Fewer Choices<\/li>\n<li>Offer a Bulletproof Money-Back Guarantee<\/li>\n<li>Create a Sense of Urgency<\/li>\n<li>Show Off Customer Testimonials and Trust Signals<\/li>\n<li>Get More Ad Clicks with Ad Extensions<\/li>\n<li>Be Honest in Your Sales Copy<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Want more online sales?
