Read on and get inspired!<\/p>\n<h3>1. Apple&#8217;s Mac vs PC campaign<\/h3>\n<p>You can\u2019t have a product marketing conversation without mentioning Apple. Namely, its Effie Award-winning <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/0eEG5LVXdKo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mac vs PC marketing campaign<\/a> where PC (the suit-and-tie-wearing office guy) is always struggling to keep up with Mac (the cool, hipster guy).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-market-a-product-mac-vs-pc.jpeg\" alt=\"how to market a product - apple's mac vs pc campaign\" width=\"455\" height=\"344\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-57593\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-market-a-product-mac-vs-pc.jpeg 455w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-market-a-product-mac-vs-pc-300x227.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Bloated with malware.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>There are 66 different (and very funny) iterations of the ad, but the same features are mentioned in every video: iMovie, iTunes, iPhoto, and ease of use. It&#8217;s clear that Apple was speaking to people looking for a computer that could support personal and creative needs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The takeaway: <\/strong>Don&#8217;t just sell your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\">value proposition<\/a>, communicate what your audience cares about. Even a brand as massive as Apple pinpoints its messaging in each campaign to speak to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/23\/buyer-personas\">personas<\/a> it&#8217;s targeting.<\/p>\n<h3>2. SoFi: Don&#8217;t sell your product; sell emotions<\/h3>\n<p>Many product marketers fall into the trap of \u201cselling the product, not the experience.\u201d No one wants your product. No one wants any product. They want a solution to their problem. They want to feel relieved. Excited. Confident. Secure. Safe.<\/p>\n<p>You see, talking only about the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/21\/features-vs-benefits\">benefits, features<\/a>, and facts and you only engage two areas of the brain\u2014the two that simply decode words into meaning. Incorporate<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/03\/emotional-marketing-copy\"> emotional words<\/a> and images in there and the game changes.<\/p>\n<p>Take SoFi. Is it selling personal loans in the ad below? Nope. It&#8217;s selling the feelings of empowerment (&#8220;kick unnecessary fees out&#8221;) and dance-worthy joy over saving money.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-market-a-product-zero-fees.png\" alt=\"how to market a product - positive emotion in ad\" width=\"500\" height=\"697\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-57637\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-market-a-product-zero-fees.png 500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-market-a-product-zero-fees-480x669.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>The takeaway:<\/strong> Emotional marketing doesn&#8217;t have to mean sob-worthy Subaru stories. Just use interesting words and expressive imagery to represent how your customer will feel as a result of your product.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Schlitz: Tell them how it&#8217;s made<\/h3>\n<p>In the early 1900s, Milwaukee brewer Schlitz was struggling. It ranked eighth among American brewers and had little hope for growth. Every brewer at the time screamed about their beer\u2019s \u201cpurity,\u201d but with no clarification of what \u201cpure\u201d meant, no brewer could top the other.<\/p>\n<p>They eventually hired Claude Hopkins (now one of the fathers of modern advertising), who requested a tour of the brewery. After seeing plate-glass rooms that dripped beer over pipes, twice-daily cleaned pumps, four-time sterilized bottles, and 4,000-foot deep artesian wells, he had only one question: \u201dWhy in the heck don\u2019t you tell your market you do this?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It was because every brewer followed this protocol, but Hopkins strongly advised Schlitz to advertise stories about this because no other brewer did, and these would clarify \u201cpure\u201d for consumers.<\/p>\n<p>So Hopkins created ads like these:<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/product-marketing-examples-schlitz-beer-ad.png\" alt=\"product marketing examples - schlitz beer ad\" width=\"720\" height=\"453\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-57664\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/product-marketing-examples-schlitz-beer-ad.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/product-marketing-examples-schlitz-beer-ad-480x302.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"http:\/\/swiped.co\/file\/schlitz-beer-ads-by-claude-hopkins\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>They went from eighth to number one in American beer in just a few months.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The takeaway:<\/strong> Don&#8217;t just<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/06\/26\/product-descriptions\"> write product descriptions<\/a>\u2014tell true stories that involve your potential customers, take them behind the scenes, and elicit emotions.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Nike: Do what your competitors won\u2019t do<\/h3>\n<p>In the 1970s and 80s, when Nike tried to break into the casual shoe market, it fell behind Reebok.<\/p>\n<p>It then used a then-unknown, and sometimes scoffed at, marketing tactic: celebrity endorsements. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/history-of-nike-facts-about-its-50th-anniversary-2014-11\">Nike\u2019s first celebrity athlete endorsements<\/a> started in the 1970s with tennis player Ilie Nastase and track star Steve Prefontaine, catapulting its revenue to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/1676904\/31-year-look-mark-parkers-nike-career\">$270 million<\/a>. By 1990, after getting Michael Jordan on board, its revenue hit $2.2 billion. Today Reebok is about 1\/45 the size of Nike.<\/p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/product-marketing-example-nike-prefontaine.jpeg\" alt=\"product marketing examples - nike and steve prefontaine ad\" width=\"472\" height=\"650\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-57667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/product-marketing-example-nike-prefontaine.jpeg 472w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/product-marketing-example-nike-prefontaine-218x300.jpeg 218w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 472px) 100vw, 472px\" \/><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mrgrantlee7.com\/2020\/11\/21\/the-soul-of-nike-steve-pre-prefontaine\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div><strong>The takeaway:<\/strong> Try something new.

National Dairy Board: Market to your existing customers<\/span><\/div>\n<p>In the early 1990s, Pepsi and Coke dominated the beverage market, spending more than $100 million to advertise just one of their varieties. At the same time, boring old milk consumption was on the decline in California\u2014not good for dairy farmers.<\/p>\n<p>The National Dairy Board and California Advisory Board had to try something with their minuscule $23 million advertising budget.\u00a0 The hired ad agency Goodby, Silverstein and Partners (GS&amp;P) hypothesized that advertising to milk drinkers, rather than non-milk drinkers, might be the ticket. Through focus groups, they found consumers only drink milk with something else. Also, they never think about it until they run out of it.<\/p>\n<p>So that led to the creation of the first &#8220;Got Milk?&#8221; commercial:<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/product-marketing-examples-got-milk-williams.jpeg\" alt=\"product marketing examples - got milk campaign\" width=\"500\" height=\"655\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-57668\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/product-marketing-examples-got-milk-williams.jpeg 500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/product-marketing-examples-got-milk-williams-480x629.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw\" \/><em><\/em><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-2567205\/Got-milk-Not-anymore-Dairy-industry-shelves-iconic-celebrity-ad-campaign-favor-new-50M-effort-pushing-milk-protein.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/div>\n<p>National milk sales went from being in decline to increasing <a href=\"http:\/\/marketing-case-studies.blogspot.com\/2008\/04\/got-milk-campaign.html\">7% in California by 1994<\/a>.

The 4-Hour Workweek: Make a promise you can actually deliver on<\/h3>\n<p>Remember the Ab Rocket? The Rock-N-Go Exerciser? Or any of the other ab rockers out there? These products, which sold for $100-200, were called out by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/consumer-reports-big-promises-of-some-infomercial-exercise-machines-fall-flat-plus-set-up-a-home-gym-for-under-100-60756267.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> <em>Consumer Reports<\/em><\/a> in 2009 as being the same or less effective than zero-equipment ab workouts.<\/p>\n<p>Making a promise you can&#8217;t deliver on means you\u2019ll only survive until your market figures that out, and with <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/online-review-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online reviews as powerful as ever<\/a>, this is not long at all.

No one business owns a particular technology and it&#8217;s natural to work across business lines in support of the broader 3M goal.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He said the company also:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Listens to any new product idea, regardless of the employee or their position or the seeming absurdity of their idea.<\/li>\n<li>Gives each employee 15% free time to explore new ideas.<\/li>\n<li>Keeps a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/28\/diversity-in-marketing\"> diverse workforce<\/a> regarding thinking, culture, gender, ethnicity, and experience.<\/li>\n<li>Embraces failure.

McDonalds: Know your audience<\/h3>\n<p>Finally, McDonald\u2019s took a big swing and a miss with the Arch Deluxe. At the time, McDonald\u2019s was known mostly as a restaurant for kids, so they tried the Arch Deluxe to target adults.<\/p>\n<p>Have you ever thought about fine dining downtown\u2026and had McDonald\u2019s pop into your mind?

Lifesavers: Create new brands for new products<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s always good to think outside the box and test new ideas and markets, but this can be hit or miss\u2014sometimes a catastrophic miss. For example, Life Savers once <a href=\"http:\/\/content.time.com\/time\/specials\/packages\/article\/0,28804,1913612_1913610_1913599,00.html\">marketed soda in the 1980s<\/a>.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/product-marketing-examples-lifesavers-soda.jpeg\" alt=\"product marketing examples - lifesavers soda fail\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-57669\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/product-marketing-examples-lifesavers-soda.jpeg 500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/product-marketing-examples-lifesavers-soda-480x360.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.com\/pin\/151503974937754733\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>It actually did well in taste tests, but once sold nationally, it tanked.
