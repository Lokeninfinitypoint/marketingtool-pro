Know your target audience<\/h3>\n<p>For any ad to be successful in generating leads, it needs to be targeted to the right audience.<\/p>\n<p>Before creating ads, the music school conducted research using Google Search Console to collect data on demographics, interests, and behaviors, creating a detailed buyer persona of potential students.<\/p>\n<p>By analyzing search queries, audience demographics, and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/website-grader\/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">website performance<\/a>, they gained valuable insights into their audience&#8217;s preferences and behaviors.<\/p>\n<p>Armed with this information, the school was able to create more targeted ads and content that resonated with their audience and resulted in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/03\/improve-conversion-rates\">improved conversion rates<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To learn about your target audience from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/16\/how-to-use-google-search-console\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Search Console<\/a>, you can follow these steps:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <a href=\"https:\/\/search.google.com\/search-console\/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Search Console<\/a> and select the website you want to analyze.<\/li>\n<li>Click on the &#8220;Performance&#8221; tab to see the search performance of your website.<\/li>\n<li>Look at the data under the &#8220;Queries&#8221; tab. This section will show you the queries (keywords) that people are using to find your website.<\/li>\n<li>Analyze the impressions and clicks data for each query. Impressions refer to the number of times a search result from your website appeared in the search engine results page (SERP) for that query, while clicks refer to the number of times a user clicked on that search result.<\/li>\n<li>Look for patterns in the queries that are <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bringing traffic to your website<\/a>. Are there any particular queries that are driving a significant amount of traffic? What types of queries are they (e.g. informational, navigational, transactional)?<\/li>\n<li>Look at the demographic data of the users who are performing these queries. Are they mostly from a certain geographic location or age range?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/google-ads-for-lead-generation-search-console.webp\" alt=\"google search console top queries\" width=\"936\" height=\"432\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-73915\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/google-ads-for-lead-generation-search-console.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/google-ads-for-lead-generation-search-console-480x222.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Use this information to tailor your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/03\/ad-copy-examples\">ad copy<\/a> to better target your audience.

Utilize the right keywords<\/h3>\n<p>Keywords are the foundation of your Google Ads campaigns. The music school conducted thorough <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteBigEasyKeyword.html?cid=Web_Any_Homepage_PPC_BigEasyKeyword_Download\">keyword research<\/a> using tools like Google Keyword Planner to identify high-intent keywords that their target audience was likely to use.

Depending on how you\u2019re collecting leads, you\u2019ll need to align keyword intent with the keywords you\u2019re choosing.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/keyword-intent-wordstream.jpg\" alt=\"keyword intent chart\" width=\"859\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-73944\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/keyword-intent-wordstream.jpg 859w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/keyword-intent-wordstream-480x335.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 859px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For example, if you collect leads through gated white papers or resources, you could target informational keywords.

Craft compelling ad copy<\/h3>\n<p>The music school&#8217;s ad copy was the first point of contact between their business and potential leads. They wrote clear, concise, and persuasive ad copy that highlighted the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/07\/unique-selling-proposition\">unique selling points<\/a> of their virtual music lessons. They included a compelling call-to-action (CTA) to encourage users to take the desired action, such as contacting them, signing up, or making a purchase.<\/p>\n<p>These are all important aspects of Google Ads that drive leads.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\ud83d\udca1 Want more ad copy tips?
