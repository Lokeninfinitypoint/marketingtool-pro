Create an Immersive Experience with Facebook Canvas Ads<\/h3>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-advertising-tips-canvas-1.gif\" alt=\"Facebook Advertising Tips Canvas\" width=\"700\" height=\"400\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If you\u2019ve seen demos of Facebook Canvas Ads in action, it\u2019s possible you were interested in the functionality, but turned off by the seemingly time-consuming creation process. Canvas ads are a jumble of videos, still images, text, call-to-actions, and other interactive collateral. Is the time worth the final product?<\/p>\n<p>Statistics say yes.<\/p>\n<p>When done well, Canvas ads can be seriously engaging: <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/02\/25\/facebook-canvas-ads\/\">53% of users<\/a> that open a Canvas ad view at least half of it, and the average view time per ad is an impressive 31 seconds. The reason? The ability to mash together several different ad types (carousel ads, video ads, single image ads, etc.) allows for unmatched storytelling ability\u2014you can <em>really <\/em>immerse the user in your brand experience.<\/p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"  style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/5NXSuLm8BLE?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>The creation process itself is also extremely templated, and is merely a matter of dragging collateral into the Facebook UI and dropping it in the right spots. Templates include the following: Get New Customers (best for customer acquisition), Sell Products (Best for eCommerce), and Showcase Your Business (best for driving brand awareness).<\/p>\n<p>The other big value proposition of the Canvas ads format is speed: your products and lead forms open directly within the Canvas, and they do so nearly instantaneously. No need to redirect to those pesky, slow-to-load landing pages. Customers seamlessly bypass a critical stage in the buying process.<\/p>\n<p>I covered <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/04\/30\/facebook-canvas-ads\">Facebook Canvas ads<\/a> in completion in a post this past month. Note: The Canvas ads format is available exclusively on mobile.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Free guide<\/strong><span>\u00a0&gt;&gt;\u00a0<\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLFBFundamentals.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FacebookFundamentals_Download\">7 Fundamental Facebook Advertising Tips<\/a><\/strong><span>\u00a0every advertiser should know.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>2. Show Off Your Products with Facebook Carousel Ads<\/h3>\n<p>Carousel ads are tailor-made for displaying multiple e-commerce products (or multiple parts of the same product) in a <a href=\"https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/simple_image\/public\/images\/media\/images\/facebook-advertising-tips-carousel.gif?zKUt9bzvAQ0XGikZN_eArkw9NhgfVlx6&amp;itok=MHEb-ZM8\">single, swipe-able ad<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Carousel ads give advertisers the ability to display up to 10 images or videos\u2014with 10 different CTAs\u2014in one ad, and link to different landing pages from each panel of the Carousel. They\u2019re effective on both desktop and mobile, and are available for most <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/social-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook ad<\/a> objectives\u2014so if you\u2019re not shooting for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/21\/facebook-offer-ads\">online sales<\/a>, don\u2019t feel like your hands are tied.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Expand Your Reach with Page Post Engagement Ads<\/h3>\n<p>Already enjoy a fair amount of page likes on your business\u2019s Facebook page, but struggling to reach the majority of your followers? It\u2019s a common problem for a lot of businesses.<\/p>\n<p>No matter how <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/10\/facebook-post-ideas\">engaging your Facebook posts are<\/a>, Facebook\u2019s algorithm only allows your organic posts so much exposure\u2014so if you have 100 page likes, and you post something organically to your account, it\u2019s possible that only 20 or so of your followers will see that post. Page post <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/18\/facebook-advertising-features\">engagement ads<\/a> offer a solid fix.<\/p>\n<p>To set up engagement ads, merely opt for the \u201cEngagement\u201d marketing objective. \u201cEngagement\u201d in this case includes comments, shares, likes, event responses, and offer claims. By running engagement ads, you get your content an audience with the people who already like, comment, and otherwise interact with it. You can also choose from Facebook\u2019s proverbial array of targeting options to get your content in front of new segments of the population that might be equally inclined to like, share, what have you.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Facebook Video Ads: Everyone\u2019s Doing It, and So Should You<\/h3>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-advertising-tips-video-1.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook Ad Tips Video\" width=\"770\" height=\"384\" \/><\/div>\n<p>What\u2019s so great about Facebook video ads? Well, for one, shoppers that view videos are <a href=\"https:\/\/thinkcreativeagency.com.au\/video-marketing-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1.81x<\/a> more likely to purchase than non-video viewers. For another, the set-up process is as simple as setting up an image ad. It\u2019s the video creation itself that might dissuade advertisers from getting in the video ads game\u2014yet even those advertisers might soon find themselves at a disadvantage. Views of branded video content on Facebook <a href=\"http:\/\/tubularinsights.com\/sponsored-content-q2-2017-report\/\">increased 258%<\/a> as of June 2017, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/tjmccue\/2017\/09\/22\/top-10-video-marketing-trends-and-statistics-roundup-2017\/#73edbd77103d\">over 500 million<\/a> people watch video on Facebook every day.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook video ads can be up to 240 minutes long, so there\u2019s really no limit to the amount of storytelling you can fit in one ad spot. That said, you might be better off keeping it short and sweet, and adding captions\u2014according to Facebook, captioned video ads increase video view time by an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/news\/updated-features-for-video-ads\">average of 12%<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Our resident video expert Margot Da Cunha has the full lowdown in her <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/25\/facebook-video-ads\">Complete Guide to Facebook Video Ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Keep It Simple with Facebook GIF Ads<\/h3>\n<p>Common sense says that the shorter a video is, the easier it is to get prospects to stick around for the entire thing. As it turns out, statistics say the same thing:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-advertising-tips-video-length-1.png\" alt=\"Facebook Ad Tips Gif\" width=\"580\" height=\"400\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via Wistia<\/em><\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s <em>right <\/em>in the wheelhouse of the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF).\u00a0 Why make a 5-minute video to tell your brand story when you can evoke the reaction you\u2019re looking for in less 10 seconds? GIFs exist in the space between images and videos\u2014they\u2019re essentially very short videos which play on a loop, but which don\u2019t require nearly the amount of time and resources to make. Here\u2019s a great example of a GIF ad we created for our AdWords Performance Grader:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"align-center\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/wordstream-facebook-gif-ad-example1-compressor-1.gif\" alt=\"Gif Ads\" \/><\/div>\n<p>GIFs look great on mobile and are a synch to make.

Rake in Leads with Facebook Lead Ads<\/h3>\n<p>Like Canvas ads, Facebook lead ads are a mobile-only solution, and they were created so advertisers could forgo sending prospects to cumbersome mobile landing pages. Lead forms are great for accruing names and job titles, phone numbers, addresses, demographics\u2014pretty much any information that can be used to market or remarket your products. And because your lead form opens right within the Facebook app, your prospects need not head to your website to <em>provide <\/em>that information.<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/facebook-ad-tips.png\" alt=\"Facebook Lead Ads\" width=\"369\" height=\"710\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-59209\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/facebook-ad-tips.png 369w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/facebook-ad-tips-156x300.png 156w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px\" \/><br \/>\nLead ads are cheap, effective, and best of all, the contact information you collect can be used to create custom and lookalike remarketing audiences.<\/p>\n<p>Allen Finn\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/24\/facebook-lead-ads\">How to Create Facebook Lead Ads That Convert<\/a> has the full skinny on lead ads.<\/p>\n<h2>Your Facebook Ads Account<\/h2>\n<h3>7.

Not so fast. AdWords and Facebook account structures have some key differences, and it\u2019s important to get a handle on them to make the most out of each platform. For one: Facebook budgets are controlled at the ad set level as opposed to the campaign level\u2014a fact which allows for much greater control over how much you spend on specific audiences. Our prescribed recipe for account structure success looks a little like this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Choose a campaign <\/strong>based on your specific marketing objective<strong>. <\/strong>If you want to drive traffic to your homepage <em>in addition <\/em>to driving app installs, create two different campaigns.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Break out ad sets<\/strong> based on refined targeting and budgeting.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cycle those ad sets<\/strong> through your existing campaigns to determine where your lowest cost-per-acquisition (CPA) lies.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For more on each of these steps, and to learn how to integrate your ad account structure with your sales funnel, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/30\/facebook-ads-account-structure\">The Last Guide to Facebook Ad Account Structure You\u2019ll Ever Need<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>10.

Master Facebook Remarketing<\/h3>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Facebook-Remarketing-1.png\" alt=\"Facebook Ad Tips Remarketing\" width=\"780\" height=\"460\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via Sprout Social<\/em><\/p>\n<p>You know that booze cruise offer that follows you around the web? How about that pair of stylish shoes you added to your cart but forgot to purchase? That\u2019s remarketing. Remarketing is so effective because it allows you to target users based on an action they\u2019ve already taken on your website or social accounts. Thus, you have the advantage of knowing how they\u2019ve already interacted with your brand, and in what part of the funnel they reside.<\/p>\n<p>The most common form of Facebook remarketing is called Custom Audiences (see below). For a holistic look at Facebook remarketing strategy, check out Margot Da Cunha\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/11\/16\/facebook-remarketing\">Ridiculously Awesome Guide to Facebook Remarketing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>12. Get Familiar with Custom Audiences<\/h3>\n<p>For a more granular understanding of Facebook remarketing, you should gain facility with Custom Audiences. Custom Audiences allow you to target five different user segments:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Customer File<\/strong>. Match email addresses, phone numbers, and Facebook user IDs to existing Facebook accounts and target those accounts.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Website Traffic<\/strong>. Target people who have visited your website, or visited specific pages of your website.<\/li>\n<li><strong>App Activity. <\/strong>Target people who have launched or interacted with your app or game.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Offline Activity.<\/strong> Target people who have interacted with your business in-store, by phone, or through other offline channels.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Engagement.<\/strong> Create a list of people who engage with your content on Facebook or Instagram.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>With each of these segments you have the (highly recommended) option of adding layered behavioral, demographic, and interest targeting to refine your audience. Don\u2019t just settle for getting your ads in front of prospects and customers who have previously interacted with your brand\u2014layering traditional <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/29\/facebook-ad-targeting-strategies\">Facebook targeting<\/a> atop those lists can help you reach the most qualified prospects.<\/p>\n<p>Knowing how to create and execute campaigns using Custom Audiences is the crux of Facebook remarketing. For tips on getting the most out of your Custom Audiences, and for information on how Custom Audiences are changing in the coming months\u2014due to the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), Facebook is implementing a Custom Audiences permission tool that will require you to provide proof of consent before utilizing Custom Audiences (more on this later)\u2014check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/04\/23\/facebook-custom-audience-changes\">Big Changes to Facebook Custom Audiences: What You Need to Know<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>13. Experiment with Lookalike Audiences<\/h3>\n<p>Facebook lookalike audiences exist in the space between layered (behavior, interest, and demographic) targeting and remarketing (utilizing Custom Audiences). Creating lookalikes is the practice of leveraging the information you\u2019d use to create Custom Audiences to instead create audiences that have similar characteristics, but represent a new segment of potential customers. These prospects haven\u2019t yet interacted with your brand. But they\u2019re similar to those who have.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-advertising-tips-lookalike-audiences-1.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook Ad Tips Lookalikes\" width=\"530\" height=\"394\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>15. Implement the Facebook Pixel<\/h3>\n<p>This is a Facebook ad tip you don&#8217;t want to miss. What exactly is the Facebook Pixel? Well, way back in the day (2015) advertisers had to install multiple pixel codes on their website to track different conversion metrics. Each new landing page for each new <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/13\/sales-promotion-examples\">promotion<\/a> required a new pixel\u2014a sustainable practice in small doses, but pretty cumbersome the bigger and more complex your ad strategy got. Enter Facebook Pixel.<\/p>\n<p>Like Custom Audiences, lookalike audiences are best utilized in conjunction with layered targeting. Adding layered targeting to lookalike audiences is specifically an effective way to control audience size\u2014say, if your worried your lookalike is unqualified, or too large for your budget. Facebook also gives you the option to manually increase audience size on a sliding scale from 1 to 10&#8230;<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lookalike-audience-sizes-1.png\" alt=\"Facebook Ad Tips Lookalikes Audiences\" width=\"725\" height=\"478\" \/><\/div>\n<p>And thus create new audiences based on your initial\u2014or \u201cseed\u201d\u2014audience. This option gives you the opportunity to reach new prospects\u2014prospects that are increasingly different from those in your original lookalike audience, but still similar enough to warrant exploration.<\/p>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/facebook-lookalike-audiences\">How to Use Facebook Lookalike Audiences<\/a> for the full rundown on\u2026well\u2026you guessed it.<\/p>\n<h3>15. Leverage Audience Insights for Audience Creation<\/h3>\n<p>The power of Audience Insights comes down to discernment\u2014or, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/12\/11\/facebook-custom-audience-strategy\">as Larry Kim would put it<\/a>, separating the donkey (average-to-below-average) audiences from the unicorn (high-performing) audiences.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-advertising-tips-audience-insights-data1-1.png\" alt=\"Facebook Ad Tips Insights\" width=\"800\" height=\"336\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Audience Insights is a tool which allows you to pull from self-reported Facebook data (information given by Facebook users when they fill in their profiles) and third-party data (information like household income, purchasing behavior, etc. pulled from external partners) to create new audiences. Where specifically does this data come from? Facebook gives you three options: glean insights from <strong>everyone on Facebook, <\/strong>from <strong>people connected to your Page, <\/strong>or from an <strong>existing Custom Audience. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>From there\u2014much like the Custom Audience creation process\u2014you\u2019re going to want to layer interests (like competitor pages!) and behaviors atop your audience to refine your insights as much as possible<\/p>\n<h3>16. Facebook Behavior, Interest, &amp; Demographic Targeting<\/h3>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via E2M Solutions<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a newer business with marginal website traffic, you probably have little in the way of remarketing options. If that\u2019s the case, your best bet is going to be what\u2019s called manual, or layered targeting. Manual targeting is the process of creating audiences based on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Behaviors<\/strong>\u2014reach users based on purchase behaviors, intent, device usage, and more.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Interests<\/strong>\u2014reach users by looking at their interests, activities, the pages they liked, and closely-related topics.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Demographics<\/strong>\u2014reach users by location, age, gender, language, relationship status, and more.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The modus operandi when creating audiences with layered targeting is to start broad then move gradually toward more qualified, refined subsets. Because you\u2019re starting from scratch, you\u2019re CPA is likely going to be a little higher than if you were remarketing to a custom audience, but still\u2014when done correctly, layered targeting can be an effective way to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/13\/facebook-interest-targeting\">hack your sales funnel<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Creating Effective\u00a0Facebook Ads<\/h2>\n<h3>17.
