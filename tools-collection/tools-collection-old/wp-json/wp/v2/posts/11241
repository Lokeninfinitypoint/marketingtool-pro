Offer loyal customers an exclusive preview<\/h3>\n<p>Your loyal customers are a key part of how to promote your product, because they are most likely to not only buy it, but also promote it to their networks. This can take the form of a private, in-person or virtual pre-launch party, an online tour, preview, or demo. Or, it could even be a special invitation to test it out and give feedback. These exclusive offerings are not only a great <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/07\/customer-engagement-strategy\">customer engagement strategy<\/a>, but they also reinforce how much you value them\u2014and engagement and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/10\/customer-loyalty\">loyalty<\/a> are essential for any <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/12\/growth-marketing\">successful growth marketing strategy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-promote-a-product-using-introductory-offers\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Use a special introductory offer<\/h3>\n<p>Rather than just announcing your new product or service, you can make it available as a part of a special introductory deal. This deal can take many forms, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Discounted pricing.<\/li>\n<li>Reduced-rate bundle or package.<\/li>\n<li>Joint promotion with a complementary business.<\/li>\n<li>Voucher or coupon with purchase.<\/li>\n<li>Buy one get one free deal.<\/li>\n<li>Double the points if you have a loyalty program.<\/li>\n<li>Free gift for every referral.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Whatever your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/13\/sales-promotion-examples\">promotion<\/a>, be sure to emphasize that it won\u2019t last forever.

Make use of a Google Business Profile<\/h3>\n<p>There are several ways you can promote your new product or service using your Google Business Profile, provided you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/10\/create-google-my-business-account\">have a Google\u00a0 Business account<\/a>.

Just remember that Google My Business posts expire every seven days, so you\u2019ll need to repost. On the other hand, if you\u2019re running a special introductory deal, an \u201cOffer\u201d post would be best, as you can set a timeframe.

Write a blog post<\/h3>\n<p>When promoting your new product or service, you may not have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/12\/great-landing-pages\">landing page<\/a> for customers or subscribers to go to. After all, your new offering could just be an upgrade on an existing platform or account. In this case, your goal may not be to get more customers, but to get your existing customers engaging, or to re-engage dormant customers.<\/p>\n<p>Having a blog post written on the newly launched item is a great way to go into depth on all of the details, features, and benefits you would otherwise include on a landing page, and you can share the link to the blog post via your emails or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/19\/social-media-for-small-business\">social media channels<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-promote-new-product-service-blog-post.png\" alt=\"how to promote a product or service\u2014blog post announcement\" width=\"800\" height=\"1478\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>An example of a new product launch via blog post, by <a href=\"https:\/\/content.myemma.com\/product-news\/introducing-our-all-new-segment-builder\">emma<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Even if you do have a landing page, a blog post is still a great channel for getting the word out about your new offering, and provides ample opportunities for you to link to the landing page.

Host an event<\/h3>\n<p>Events not only get customers excited about your new product or service, but can also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/26\/prospecting-strategies-ppc-agencies\">get new prospects<\/a> personally engaging with you or other employees of your business\u2014a great way to win them over as customers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-promote-new-product-service-host-event.png\" alt=\"how to promote a product or service\u2014event invite on instgram\" width=\"800\" height=\"587\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Events don\u2019t have to be fancy and super organized; something as simple as an open house or an info session will work for locations like salons, fitness centers, yoga studios, spas, and retail stores.If your business is in a location with other local businesses, you can work together to have a sidewalk sale or outdoor open house to draw even larger crowds.<\/p>\n<p>During the pandemic, virtual events still serve as an effective promotion tool. You might:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Host a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/31\/facebook-live-guide\">Facebook Live session<\/a> demoing the product and highlighting its features.<\/li>\n<li>Run a live or recorded Q&amp;A on the product itself.<\/li>\n<li>Center the event around an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/21\/social-media-influencers\">influencer<\/a> who has expertise around your new product or service, with the promise to unveil the new offering at the end.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-promote-new-product-service-virtual-event.png\" alt=\"how to promote a product or service\u2014virtual event invite\" width=\"800\" height=\"749\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Virtual, customer-exclusive training session for a new version of Salesforce<\/em><\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-promote-a-product-using-upgrades\"><\/div>\n<h3>8. Offer a complimentary upgrade<\/h3>\n<p>If your business is more service-based than product-based, like a salon, spa, fitness center, or consulting business, you can offer an upgrade for customers to try out your new service. Promoting a new facial or massage type at your spa? Provide a complimentary (but perhaps temporary) upgrade for existing customers to try it out. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/27\/how-to-build-a-ppc-offering\">Expanding your agency\u2019s PPC offerings<\/a>? Add the new service to existing clients\u2019 packages at their legacy pricing. Another option would be to offer free shipping of your new product, for a limited time.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-promote-new-product-service-free-shipping.png\" alt=\"how to promote a product or service\u2014free shipping offer\" width=\"800\" height=\"570\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-promote-a-product-using-trade-ins\"><\/div>\n<h3>9. Allow trade-ins<\/h3>\n<p>If your new product is, in fact, an upgrade of an older one, consider a trade-in program. Trade-in promotions are effective because consumers are more likely to buy a new product using a token or credit they already have (in this case, the product they own). You can also resell the old trade-in products (provided they are in good enough condition) or use them for future giveaways.<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-promote-a-product-using-customer-reviews\"><\/div>\n<h3>10. Share customer reviews<\/h3>\n<p>One of the best ways to promote a new product or service\u2014and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-market-your-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">to market your business<\/a> in general\u2014is to let your customers promote it for you. If you take advantage of some of the ideas previously mentioned (like offering an upgrade or free trial), you can then <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">ask them to write an online review<\/a> of the new service or provide material for a testimonial.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-promote-new-product-service-ask-for-review.png\" alt=\"how to promote a product or service\u2014ask for reviews\" width=\"800\" height=\"956\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/reallygoodemails.com\/emails\/lunacy-comes-out-of-beta-meet-version-50\/\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Reviews and testimonials will be invaluable when rolling the product out to your more general audience. After all, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thanx.com\/academy\/restaurant-marketing\/reputation-management\/using-google-reviews-drive-traffic-new-location\/\">84%<\/a> of consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-promote-new-product-service-share-reviews.png\" alt=\"how to promote a product or service\u2014share reviews\" width=\"642\" height=\"1282\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-promote-a-product-using-social-media-posts\"><\/div>\n<h3>11. Post on social media<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re using any of the tactics mentioned above to promote your new product or service, make sure to spread word of your deals and offerings via your social media accounts (as many of the companies did in the examples above). This is an easy way to reach your audience, and your followers can easily share your post to their own profiles. Another benefit is that customers\/prospects can ask questions about the product in the comments section. Their questions and your answers can serve as an organic FAQ. The post can link to a landing page or blog post with more information.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-promote-new-product-service-post-social-media.png\" alt=\"how to promote a product or service\u2014social media post\" width=\"800\" height=\"386\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you have a niche audience or loyal following, you may also want to use a custom hashtag in your promotion post. This will not only expand the reach of your campaigns, but may also inspire customers to share posts and pictures to their accounts, using the custom hashtag. And you know what that means: User-generated content that can then be used to get even more people try out your new service or product!<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-promote-a-product-using-facebook-ads\"><\/div>\n<h3>12. Run Facebook ads<\/h3>\n<p>With <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/19\/social-media-for-small-business\">1 billion daily active users,<\/a> Facebook advertising is a window to a large base of people who will be interested in your new product or service.
