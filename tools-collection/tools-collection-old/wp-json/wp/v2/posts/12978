But here\u2019s the thing: most of these are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/21\/promotional-email-examples\">promotional emails <\/a>that go right into my \u201cPromotions\u201d tab. Yes, I do open some of them, but only if they are super appealing to me.<\/p>\n<p>This might seem discouraging for all you email marketing ecommerce folks out there, but it is likely a challenge you are already aware of. Being a marketer in the ecommerce industry is not an easy thing. The space is like New Years Eve in Times Square\u2014it is jam-packed! Yet, email can\u2019t be ignored. In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/29\/email-marketing-statistics#targetText=59%25%20of%20B2B%20marketers%20say,to%2010%20email%20marketing%20studies).\"><strong>80% of retail marketers<\/strong><\/a><strong> indicate that email marketing is their greatest driver of customer retention<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>So how can you stand out against the flood of other <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing\/what-is-email-marketing\">emails loading up your target customer\u2019s inbox<\/a>? Here are 11 ways to improve your email marketing for ecommerce\u2014and make those message un-missable!<\/p>\n<h2>1. Make your subject line POP<\/h2>\n<p>The first few tips are ALL about email subject lines. Why? Your email subject line is like the cover of your book. It needs to be super gripping and compelling to convince that person with 27,000+ unopened emails in their inbox (aka me) to open yours. In fact, <strong>35% of email recipients open email based on the subject line alone<\/strong>, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.convinceandconvert.com\/digital-marketing\/email-marketing-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Convince&amp;Convert<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So how can you make your email lines open-worthy? Here are a few things to consider:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Think outside of the box, and get creative with your copy!<\/li>\n<li>Use simple, understandable language (no big words, please).<\/li>\n<li>Use ALL CAPS when appropriate.<\/li>\n<li>Use exclamation marks to show enthusiasm.<\/li>\n<li>Put the BEST highlights of your email in the subject line\u2026<\/li>\n<li>\u2026 But leave a little piece unknown to get them wanting more<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond crushed it with their email subject line below. Their nice and exciting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/25\/email-copywriting-tips\">email copy<\/a> instantly caught my eyes, with the all caps \u201cYESSSSS!,\u201d the writing style, excitement about Fall (who doesn\u2019t LOVE Fall?!), and, of course, putting a 20%\u00a0 coupon on the table. They also left me wanting more with the \u201cGet your first look\u201d text, which is exactly what you need to do to make me open that email.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"afd870a9-3a93-4666-9828-649dc63197ea\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-ecommerce-subject-line-bbb.jpg\" alt=\"ecommerce email subject line from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond\" width=\"965\" height=\"32\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>2. Use emojis in your subject line<\/h2>\n<p>Another great way to hook people into your emails is by making your subject lines visual through the use of emojis. <strong>Brands using emojis in their email received a 56% higher open rate <\/strong>than those that did not, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.experian.com\/marketing-services\/marketing-services.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Experian<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This is even MORE critical for those in the ecommerce marketing industry because there are SO many emails being received from other ecommerce companies. But scanning through my own inbox, I noticed only a few use emojis. This tactic is definitely something to consider.<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re using emojis, it is critical to make them relevant. Take a look at the examples below.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"0ed5e5d8-a2f3-4ebb-ace6-8e6606775d15\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-ecommerce-subject-line-etsy.jpg\" alt=\"ecommerce email subject line Etsy\" width=\"685\" height=\"31\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"07649615-eeba-4990-a58a-e5c497117028\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-ecommerce-subject-line-joss-main.jpg\" alt=\"ecommerce email subject line Joss &amp; Main\" width=\"701\" height=\"30\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>They both work, but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/03\/how-to-sell-on-etsy\">Etsy<\/a> did a really great job of making the emoji relevant to the copy.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Personalize your subject lines<\/h2>\n<p>Last email subject line tip, I promise (they are just that important!!). One way for ecommerce marketers to really make their emails stand out is my making them completely about your customer. What better way to do that then using your customer\u2019s first name in the email subject line? <strong>Emails that include the first name of the recipient in their subject line receive a higher click-through-rate then those that don\u2019t<\/strong>, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/sales\/subject-line-stats-open-rates-slideshare\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HubSpot<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I know I instantly noticed this Lord + Taylor email below. I immediately wanted to know what I\u2019ve been missing! If using an email marketing tool, this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/03\/email-marketing-best-practices\">best practice<\/a> is even easier to do using automation. So make your subject lines about your customer, and you\u2019ll see your click-through-rates go up right up after hitting \u201csend.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a3a5aacc-69b5-42cf-997f-bcb5a5aeed87\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-ecommerce-personalized-subject-line.jpg\" alt=\"ecommerce email marketing personalized subject line\" width=\"721\" height=\"32\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>4. Send a welcome email!<\/h2>\n<p>Moving on from subject lines, let\u2019s dive into the content of the email itself. These <strong>\u201cwelcome emails\u201d bring in a whopping <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invespcro.com\/blog\/welcome-emails\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">320% more revenue<\/a> than other promotional emails in the B2C industry<\/strong>. And what could be easier than saying welcome!<\/p>\n<p>To do this well, make sure to use big, bold text, include a call to action, and have a stunning image and overall design. Check out the email below from Rent the Runway.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ab3ad675-74b9-41dc-9f90-57ad6743bde0\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-ecommerce-welcome-email.jpg\" alt=\"ecommerce welcome email example\" width=\"539\" height=\"606\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>What better way to be welcomed than by a beautiful smiling human? Then, as I scrolled down, I saw the CTA.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5e44f4a0-5906-48ce-9a31-458a80ab7121\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-ecommerce-welcome-email-cta.jpg\" alt=\"welcome email CTA\" width=\"653\" height=\"453\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>I love how pleasant and not overly pushy this ecommerce CTA is because it is important to remember this is a \u201cWelcome\u201d email to a new customer so making a great first impression is critical!<\/p>\n<h2>5. Use videos thumbnails<\/h2>\n<p>I could sit here and provide a long list of statistics about how important video marketing is, but even more important is embracing all of the places you can use video in your ecommerce marketing efforts. What better way to make your products come to life than with video?<\/p>\n<p>The best way to do this is by simply including a linkable image with a play button (which resembles a video) in your email that then links to your website where the video lives. Why? Many email providers do not allow for in-email video playback. And why not? Configuring it this way gets your shoppers one click closer to purchase.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"0bb01397-ee5b-4301-811b-5790115d80d3\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-ecommerce-thumbnail-video.jpg\" alt=\"ecommerce email marketing thumbnail video example\" width=\"596\" height=\"507\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>6. Make each subscriber feel special<\/h2>\n<p>As we have been discussing, it is so critical for ecommerce marketers to stand out. Another great way to do this is by making your email subscribers feel truly valued and special. There are many ways to do so, but one great way is through special offers and deals. For instance, check out the example below from Fabletics.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"63c35bdf-347f-4531-8997-eecf97069cbe\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-ecommerce-vip-offer.jpg\" alt=\"VIP offer from Fabletics\" width=\"604\" height=\"390\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Due to my \u201cVIP\u201d status, they offered a pair of leggings for only $10\u2014what a steal! Finding fun ways to do things like this for your business will not only help you convert customers through email, but it can also help you create returning and even loyal customers.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Instill FOMO in subscribers with a limited-time offer<\/h2>\n<p>Who gets FOMO when they are invited to an event they cannot attend because you end up sick at home or have another obligations? I know I do.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s possible to create FOMO for your brand offerings, especially for all you ecommerce marketers out there who have products that people want on SALE. Clearly putting your items on sale makes them more attractive and more \u201csellable,\u201d but it is also so critical to partner your sales offering with an expiration date to get your shoppers buying before they get distracted.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f39e09ac-e257-4ac0-a10e-ef0c4daf7e8d\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-ecommerce-limited-offer-subject-line.jpg\" alt=\"ecommerce email subject line with limited offer\" width=\"621\" height=\"40\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>So how can you do this effectively? Here are a few quick tips:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure your subject lines include FOMO verbiage. like \u201cHurry up!\u201d or \u201cAct fast!\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Include the discount in your subject line.<\/li>\n<li>Give a hard deadline of when the sale or special offer ends.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"30eac482-4f65-4c4a-bc51-8baeef4c22a6\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-ecommerce-limited-offer-email.jpg\" alt=\"ecommerce email with limited offer\" width=\"636\" height=\"704\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>8. Celebrate the seasons!<\/h2>\n<p>Who doesn\u2019t love a change in season? It feels like a fresh start or a new beginning. It\u2019s a time to go crazy over pumpkins, aggressively bake holiday cookies and cozy up with hot cocoa, or bust out your dusty cleaning supplies to prepare for spring. Whatever the occasion may be, tie it to your ecommerce email campaigns to relate to your audience in a way that we all can. This is such a great thing for ecommerce marketers to do because typically businesses in B2C have products related to different seasons and celebrations.<\/p>\n<p>Take the example below from an email I received from Crate &amp; Barrel.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f9f234ba-5372-4264-be23-790c74cad50e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-ecommerce-seasonal-offer-email.jpg\" alt=\"Crate &amp; Barrel Halloween email\" width=\"563\" height=\"547\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3ec23f61-e97d-4502-8d09-3a16513ed3c5\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-ecommerce-seasonal-offer-email-two.jpg\" alt=\"Crate &amp; Barrel Halloween email with copy\" width=\"625\" height=\"645\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>I love everything about this, from the fun and spooky Halloween decor to the enticing copy. It surely got me in the mood to shop to create a similar vibe in my own home.<\/p>\n<h2>9. Turn new customers into returning customers<\/h2>\n<p>The thing with ecommerce that many of you are all too aware of is that many customers are one-time customers. It\u2019s the best customers who are the ones that come back again and again. So why not create an ecommerce marketing campaign that turns your one-time customers into lifelong customers?<\/p>\n<p>How can you do this? Take a page from DSW\u2019s book by building a special VIP club that is FREE to join.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"9e0f4442-fd12-4a99-b882-dd4502a0486b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-ecommerce-returning-customers.jpg\" alt=\"DSW VIP email\" width=\"567\" height=\"644\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Build a neat, concise, and thoughtful list of the exciting perks joining the club will offer them, similar to the one below. Think along the lines of providing free shipping or providing certain discounts or rewards every time they shop. Anything that will get your audience willing to shop more works well!<\/p>\n<h2>10. Educate your subscribers<\/h2>\n<p>There is something to be said about not always being salesy and just showing off your products in every email. If you can provide your audience with substantial and useful information to guide their future purchases, it is going to leave them with a much stronger sense of brand recognition and admiration for your ecommerce company.<\/p>\n<p>Take the example from Zola, a wedding planning website that makes revenue through their ecommerce wedding registry store. Rather than just encouraging folks to set up their registries, Zola sent along a very compelling and well-designed guide on flatware for a bride or groom new to the flatware buying game. As someone who just recently had a wedding, I must say this is a super helpful resource!<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5fe54010-3cca-42d2-84a5-47a691f29ded\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-ecommerce-educate-subscribers.jpg\" alt=\"Zola email\" width=\"610\" height=\"535\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>11. Pay to get to the top<\/h2>\n<p>I know, I know\u2014your marketing budget it tight! But, as we have discussed, your audience has an inbox over-populated with other ecommerce marketing emails so to get your most important messages noticed, it may be worth throwing in a few bucks to get to the top of inboxes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGmail Ads are one of the more intriguing opportunities Google has given advertisers to reach people where they spend a lot of their time online\u2014in their inboxes,\u201d says WordStream founder, Larry Kim. \u201cYou can reduce costs by optimizing several aspects of your campaign, reach your own (and a new) audience, and measure post-open success.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Take a couple examples below from ones that hit my inbox recently. I especially love one from HelloFresh where the subject line is short and sweet with a special deal for first time customers.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"bc8cd6d3-a398-44f6-870d-d14e2c85f31e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-marketing-ecommerce-paid-promotion.jpg\" alt=\"examples of paid promotion email subject line views\" width=\"982\" height=\"82\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Make your email marketing an ecommerce success!<\/h2>\n<p>While being an email ecommerce marketer comes with many crowded challenges, these tips should be sure to set you emails apart from the pack.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How can you stand out against the flood of other emails loading up your target customer&#8217;s inbox?
