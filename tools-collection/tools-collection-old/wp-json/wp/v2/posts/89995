Make it easy for AI crawlers to find content on your site<\/h3>\n<p>AI crawlers (or spiders) sift through an endless supply of pages on the web, trying to match users with the most relevant content. If your site is slow or hard to navigate, you\u2019re basically presenting crawlers (and users, for that matter) with a mess.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how to make it easy:<\/p>\n<h4>Improve page speed and mobile friendliness<\/h4>\n<p>Page speed is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/09\/google-ranking-factors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google ranking factor<\/a>, so your site needs to load fast for Google. But it should also be fast for AI. Crawlers are built to scan and summarize content quickly, and there\u2019s a chance they might time out and not fully crawl everything if your site is slow.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/pagespeed.web.dev\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Page Speed Insights<\/a> tool makes it easy to see how fast your pages load and what elements can be addressed. Simply plug in the URL of the page you want speed insights for and get results in just seconds.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/pagespeed-insights-tool-example-results-png.webp\" alt=\"example report for google pagespeed insights tool\" width=\"1200\" height=\"853\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-90003\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/pagespeed-insights-tool-example-results-png.webp 1200w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/pagespeed-insights-tool-example-results-980x697.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/pagespeed-insights-tool-example-results-480x341.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Some quick fixes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compress images with tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/tinyjpg.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TinyPNG<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/squoosh.app\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Squoosh<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Try using lazy loading<\/li>\n<li>Use a content delivery network (CDN) to speed up load times globally<\/li>\n<li>Eliminate unnecessary plugins and scripts. If your site is running five different tracking codes, it might be time to clean things up.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Your site also needs to be mobile-friendly, and the most common way to achieve this is through responsive web design. A responsive site automatically adjusts your page sizes, layout, button types, and more to work better on mobile devices.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, AI search is built to answer questions on the go, whether someone\u2019s using voice search in a car or scrolling through results on their phone. If and when you show up in AI search results, you don\u2019t want visitors to arrive at a clunky design.<\/p>\n<h4>Use internal links for optimal crawlability and discoverability<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/04\/internal-linking\" rel=\"noopener\">Internal links<\/a> connect different pages of your website, making it easier for AI crawlers to navigate between them. These links also help the crawlers find all the content on your site. If a page exists without any links pointing to it (i.e., it\u2019s an orphan page), a crawler might not see it.<\/p>\n<p>You can add internal links in your navigation, footers, within each piece of content, and in other places.<\/p>\n<p>As the crawlers move through your site, they collect more information about your content that influences whether or not you\u2019ll be mentioned and listed in AI results. Internal links have great benefits for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/27\/seo-metrics\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO performance<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/how-web-crawlers-work-png.webp\" alt=\"graphic showing how web crawlers work\" width=\"676\" height=\"510\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-90004\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/how-web-crawlers-work-png.webp 676w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/how-web-crawlers-work-480x362.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 676px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A well-linked site helps AI understand the relationships between your content, making it easier for the platforms to cite your pages when users search topics related to your site.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tip: <\/strong>Make sure you can reach any page of your site in three clicks or fewer from any other page. One way to do this is through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/topic-clusters-for-local-seo\">topic clusters<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"target-conversational-queries\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Target conversational queries<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/google-keyword-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">91%<\/a> of all search queries are considered long tail, or conversational. Sure, people still search broad terms like \u201cgarden hoses.\u201d But with AI, people talk to it like they would a friend, asking questions like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What\u2019s the best garden hose that won\u2019t kink?<\/li>\n<li>Which hose is best for a big backyard?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Copilot can generate ideas and variations of how users ask about a topic. Even though these don\u2019t have actual search data (like volume or intent), the ideas can still be worth considering since they come from AI itself\u2013the very place you want to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/offset-lower-website-traffic\">get traffic<\/a> from.<\/p>\n<p>For example, instead of targeting just \u201cgarden hoses\u201d in your content, ask an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency\">AI tool<\/a> to provide questions and conversational phrases about the topic. You might get responses like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What\u2019s the best garden hose for water pressure?<\/li>\n<li>Which garden hose lasts the longest?<\/li>\n<li>What size hose do I need for my yard?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>AI search engines will return clear, direct answers in response to conversational queries. So, your page content should do the same.<\/p>\n<p>Also consider the \u201cPeople also ask\u201d (PAA) section in Google results for more ideas. Google practically hands you a roadmap to conversational search. The PAA section lists related questions you can use and answer in your content.<\/p>\n<p>As an example, when I search \u201cgarden hoses,\u201d this is what the PAA section shows. And when I click on a question, even more questions will appear at the bottom of the list.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/people-also-ask-results-garden-hoses-png.webp\" alt=\"example of people also ask results for garden hoses query\" width=\"903\" height=\"286\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-90005\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/people-also-ask-results-garden-hoses-png.webp 903w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/people-also-ask-results-garden-hoses-480x152.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 903px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd0e <strong>Need help finding the right keywords?<\/strong> Try our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"improve-e-e-a-t-signals\"><\/div>\n<h3>3.

Reach out to those sites to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Engage with industry blogs and media.

Optimize for featured snippets and AI Overviews<\/h3>\n<p>If your content is a wall of text, it\u2019s like handing over a puzzle with missing pieces. But if you break things up with clear headings, short paragraphs, and easy-to-read lists, you\u2019re basically spoon-feeding the AI exactly what it wants to show users.<\/p>\n<p>Look at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-overviews-breaking-search\">AI Overview<\/a> for the query \u201cWhat size hose do I need for my yard?\u201d It\u2019s all bite-sized information with headings and lists.
