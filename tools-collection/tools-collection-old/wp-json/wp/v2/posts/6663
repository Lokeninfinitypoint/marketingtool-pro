To buy or not to buy? Let\u2019s <strong>review the<\/strong> <strong>reasons for and against buying Twitter followers.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In this post, we&#8217;ll be looking at:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why You Should Buy Twitter Followers<\/li>\n<li>Why You Shouldn&#8217;t Buy Twitter Followers<\/li>\n<li>How to Buy Twitter Followers<\/li>\n<li>Where to Buy Twitter Followers<\/li>\n<li>How to Increase Your Twitter Followers Naturally<\/li>\n<li>Why Earning Twitter Followers Naturally is Best<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"why you should buy twitter followers\"><\/a>Reasons Why You Should Buy Twitter Followers<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Look Like a Boss: A Big Twitter Following Makes You Appear Important<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5d0aa419-8f65-4386-a255-5231ea53dc62\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/buying-twitter-followers-like-a-boss-01-1.png\" alt=\"Twitter followers free\" width=\"714\" height=\"735\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Let\u2019s face it, a lot of social media activity is already just thinly veiled narcissism. Those who give themselves a pat on the back when their newest instagram post gets 13 likes must certainly be temped by the idea of buying more Twitter followers.<\/p>\n<p>Businesses have the advantage of labeling their self-promotion as branding, but ultimately it\u2019s two sides of the same coin. There\u2019s no judging here though \u2013 we\u2019ve all felt the rewarding confirmation that comes with a retweet.<\/p>\n<p>While boiling down the value of your online presence to a mere number on Twitter sounds ridiculous, there\u2019s really no denying that one\u2019s Twitter following, despite being a vanity metric, is often thought to correlate with a user\u2019s importance. For clubs booking comedians or venues hosting bands, a high Twitter following can easily put you ahead of the competition. A large Twitter following shows promise and possibility\u00a0 &#8211; not just of a good show, but of bringing in more followers and fans in to see the show, and therefore bringing in more money.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Even if the followers are fake, the clout that comes with a high Twitter following is very much real<\/strong>. A boost in Twitter followers can transform a stand-up amateur into a professional comedian, a garage band into a rising star, a movie extra into fresh new talent, and a small business into an authoritative source. Individuals have even been hired for job positions as a result of their high Twitter following, since the number serves as a representation of how powerful your online word can be.<\/p>\n<p>With fake followers it\u2019s all a masquerade, so it really comes down to how long you can push the act or live the lie.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bandwagon Syndrome<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Related to the previous section, once real users see your Twitter numbers rising, they\u2019ll be more likely to follow you as well. If someone claims to be an expert food critic but only has 23 followers, most will think that the only food they\u2019re judging is their mom\u2019s mac and cheese. If that number is more like 800 or 2,000, they become a considerably more reputable source \u2013 one that users will be much more likely to follow. This means your Twitter robot followers are actually generating real followers as a result of your imagined prestige.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Easier &amp; Cheaper<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a heck of a lot easier to buy followers on Twitter than earn them. Gaining a real Twitter following takes time and effort \u2013 you need to consistently be sharing great content, posting hilariously witty remarks, or broadcasting the latest news.<\/p>\n<p>You could put in all that effort\u2026 or you can grab your wallet and buy a militia-sized army of Twitter followers for less than a Starbucks Frappuccino. On Fiverr, where users provide various products or services (often web related) for only $5, marketers are <strong>promised as many 8,000 Twitter followers within 24 hours in exchange for an Abraham<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"0af991ed-8854-4a0e-be55-a375d551234d\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/buy-twitter-followers-fiverr-1.png\" alt=\"buy twitter followers cheap\" width=\"634\" height=\"283\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>All The Cool Kids are Doing It<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Start-ups, celebrities, and politicians alike have been known to buy more Twitter followers \u2013 it\u2019s a fairly common practice for those who have something to gain from amassing a large number of Twitter followers in a short period of time.<\/p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http:\/\/fakers.statuspeople.com\/\">Fake Follower Check<\/a> tool from StatusPeople, which claims the ability to determine how many of a user\u2019s Twitter followers are fakes, 71% of Lady Gaga\u2019s over 35 million followers are fake or inactive, along with 70% of President Obama\u2019s nearly 30 million followers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It\u2019s Not All <em>That<\/em> Bad<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If the President of the United States has fake Twitter followers, it can\u2019t be all that bad, right?<\/p>\n<p>While purchasing bot Twitter followers is against Twitter\u2019s terms and white-hatters might scoff at the idea, <strong>it\u2019s completely legal.<\/strong> One also has to question how corrupt buying Twitter followers really is compared with regular Twitter marketing practices like paying for a promoted hashtag \u2013 is it just a matter of splitting hairs?<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"why you shouldn't buy twitter followers\"><\/a>Why You Shouldn\u2019t Buy Twitter Followers<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Can You Even Call Them Followers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You\u2019re not really buying Twitter followers so much as mindless spam bots.

Many of the sites that offer to sell you more Twitter followers are a scam \u2013 you may put up your hard earned cash and come away with absolutely nothing. Often these nefarious groups are simply looking to take advantage of businesses that don\u2019t know any better, or are hoping to cash in on desperate marketers looking for a quick fix. Providing them with your credit card might not be the brightest idea.<\/p>\n<p>Your fake followers could also end up doing <strong>damage against your real Twitter followers by hacking, phishing, and infecting real followers<\/strong> with link spam.

These legitimate, earned followers are more valuable because you\u2019ve built a relationship with them. These relationships will prove much more prosperous than those silly faceless egg accounts.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Target Others in Your Industry<\/strong>: Getting the attention of big-name tweeters in your industry can do a lot for your reputation, so be sure to follow and interact with them. Just one retweet or mention from a well-respected industry leader can greatly increase your Twitter followers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Tweet During Peak Times<\/strong>: Tweet when your tweets are most likely to be seen \u2013 generally between 10 am and 4 pm.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Link to and Promote Your Twitter Handle: <\/strong>Link to your Twitter handle on your blog, website, and other social media accounts. Put it on your business card, use it in your guest blogger bio, and announce it when you speak at conferences. The more you link to your Twitter handle and promote it, the more followers you\u2019ll bring in.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Share Something of Value<\/strong>: Make yourself a person of value by tweeting resources related to your industry, or just fun and interesting content. Also make sure to retweet the great content shared by others \u2013 this shows that you\u2019re not just self-promoting and are actually interested in spreading quality information from a variety of sources.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Hashtags<\/strong>:\u00a0 While you don\u2019t want your tweets to be a messy glob of ###s, implementing some hashtags now and then makes your tweets easier to find and can help spread your scope while gaining Twitter followers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><a id=\"why you should increase your twitter followers naturally\"><\/a>A Final Word: Why the Long, Hard, and Earnest Road is Best<\/h2>\n<p>Increasing your followers on Twitter naturally isn\u2019t easy, but it\u2019s worth it in the end. Just a handful of engaged, active followers is infinitely more valuable than hundreds of fake accounts that do nothing more than add to an ego-stroking number.<\/p>\n<p>Buying Twitter followers harkens back to the old days of SEO, evocative of outdated black-hat logic that grows less fruitful and more damaging as an increasing emphasis is put on quality over quantity. Buying Twitter followers may provide some temporary sense of instant gratification, but the <strong>potential backlash of being found out as a liar or fraud<\/strong> can quickly undo any advantages and permanently destroy your reputation.<\/p>\n<p>For small businesses, such <strong>growing pains are essential for character development<\/strong> \u2013Twitter is a valuable space for businesses to test and hone their personality, be it humorous, technical, or offbeat. Brand persona and Twitter following grow together as a result. Discovering and becoming a power player in your niche is what really increases your Twitter following, and bypassing such steps results in a hollow brand trying to survive off a vanity metric.<\/p>\n<p>So fight the good fight, earn your followers the old-fashioned way! Or don\u2019t.
