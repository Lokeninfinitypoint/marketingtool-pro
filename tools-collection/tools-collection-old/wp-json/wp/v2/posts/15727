We\u2019ll dig into each of these in depth, but here\u2019s a quick look at how they shake out:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c268e0d7-b429-4f9d-b55b-7cb041e45612\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/types-of-google-ads-compared.png\" alt=\"how to advertise on google - benefits of google ad types\" width=\"720\" height=\"520\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-62350\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/types-of-google-ads-compared.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/types-of-google-ads-compared-480x347.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Google Search Network: Find Prospects That Are Ready to Convert<\/h2>\n<p>Whether this is your first foray into search advertising or you\u2019re a relative pro with a vested interest in the bottom line, the search network is going to be a great place to start. Search and Display make up two halves of Google\u2019s traditional advertising offerings; when comparing the two, Search has some distinct advantages.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest advantage? <strong>Higher conversion rates. <\/strong>Our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/29\/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks\">Google Ads industry benchmarks<\/a>, which we pulled from our vast store of client data, offer an interesting look at Search vs. Display metrics across industries. Average conversion rate tells a story that indubitably favors Search:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a02e733d-0250-46d9-98ab-8bd12c2f6fbc\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/choosing-channel-right-for-you-conversion-rates.png\" alt=\"Google Ads Networks Conversion Rates\" width=\"3334\" height=\"4515\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The average conversion rate in Google Ads across all industries is 3.75% on the search network, compared to just 0.77% on the display network. The biggest reason for the discrepancy? Users on the search network are <em>active. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>Whether or not they\u2019re looking for a paid or an organic result, users go to Google\u2019s search bar because they\u2019re looking for an immediate, relevant answer to their query. That in mind, it helps if your business sells a product or service that represents an on-the-spot solution to a problem. Something that fills an immediate need. A pipe bursts in your prospect\u2019s bathroom, so they search for a plumber. The SAT is coming up, so a mother searches for a tutor for her son.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"34303f6a-312f-4916-931b-0486c6fb8577\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/choosing-the-right-google-ads-network.jpg\" alt=\"Google Ads Networks SERP\" width=\"897\" height=\"502\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>But even if you\u2019re not in Dating &amp; Personals or Legal\u2014niches with sky-high conversion rates on the search network\u2014you can still position your product or service as something your prospects <em>need <\/em>sooner rather than later.<\/p>\n<p>This is the greatest intrinsic advantage of the search network: <strong>the ability to bid on high-intent keywords that put your text ads in front of users who are ready to convert. <\/strong>If, when conducting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/11\/21\/ppc-keyword-research-guide\">keyword research<\/a>, you find yourself coming across keywords related to your niche that have high <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/30\/commercial-intent-keywords\">commercial intent<\/a>, and your product or service realistically matches those queries, then you can safely assume that the search network is a good place to start spending your budget.<\/p>\n<h2>Google Display Network: Capturing the Passive Searcher<\/h2>\n<p>The display network reaches nearly 90% of all consumers online, in more than 100 countries and 30 languages. This giant pool of potential prospects and the nature of search behavior on the display network\u2014users are <em>passive <\/em>rather than active\u2014means that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/06\/12\/biggest-benefit-google-display-ads\">the number one benefit of using the display network<\/a> is the ability to build top-of-funnel brand awareness.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve already seen, and accepted, that Search converts better than Display. What\u2019s more, Search has a much higher click-through rate (3.17% compared to just 0.46%):<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f8b77b62-1897-4184-97bf-0c5a3c13d656\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Google-Data-Infographic-final_201720copy-01.png\" alt=\"Google Ads Networks CTR\" width=\"3335\" height=\"3800\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The reason\u2014and this is the same thing we discussed when we looked at conversion rates\u2014is the nature of search behavior on each network. Despite the ability to use eye-popping image and video creative, it is flat out more difficult to get users to click-through and convert on the display network, because they are not <strong>actively searching for a solution to a pain point<\/strong>. Again, though, this is no reason to write off Display when you\u2019re trying to decide the network that\u2019s right for you. It just means that, in order to get the most out it, you have to adjust your expectations and play to its strengths.<\/p>\n<p>Because searchers on the display network are not actively looking for your product or service, Display gives you the opportunity to generate leads at the awareness stage of your sales funnel.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2e3657c2-9273-4f3f-9576-a59f29d074fb\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/choose-the-right-google-ads-network-sales-funnel-1.png\" alt=\"Google Ads Networks Sales Funnel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"712\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>If you\u2019re set on generating conversions in a <strong>particular campaign<\/strong>, by all means, eschew Display. BUT, be aware that while clicks are more difficult to come by on the display network, they come at a much lower cost compared to Search ($0.63 compared to $2.69).<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4406d59e-bad7-4f16-bbfd-fc1f35ad5df1\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Google-Data-Infographic-final_201720copy-04.png\" alt=\"Google Ads Networks CPC\" width=\"3335\" height=\"3805\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Therefore, leveraging the display network allows you to significantly open up your prospect pool by increasing brand awareness on a much wider scale for comparatively less money. Building this kind of brand affinity en masse can also help you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/08\/brand-affinity-marketing\">increase click-through rates and conversion rates in campaigns that exist on other networks<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Tactically, one of the most effective ways to do this is through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-remarketing\">remarketing<\/a>. Remarketing allows you to serve ads to users who have visited your site on pages across the web, and thus stay top-of-mind with those users as they, ideally, near closer to the deliberation stage of your funnel. We\u2019ve found that remarketing display ads fatigue users at a slower rate compared to standard display ads, and that their conversion rates also increase over time\u2014so when you utilize remarketing in display, you have less of a chance of \u201coffending\u201d prospects by stalking them around the web.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking to bolster your prospect pool and build brand affinity on a large scale, the display network is a great place to allocate some budget. And for advertisers with limited creative resources, the advent of <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/2404190?hl=en\">responsive display ads<\/a> this summer has made display ad creation and optimization easier than ever.<\/p>\n<h2>Google Shopping: Attract More Qualified Clicks<\/h2>\n<p>Shopping is huge right now, and it\u2019s only getting bigger. Google released a suite of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/19\/google-shopping-new-features\">new Shopping functionality<\/a> this summer, dropped <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/10\/google-marketing-live\">Smart Shopping<\/a>, and just recently introduced <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/9140490\">shoppable image ads<\/a>. U.S. retailers leveraging Google Ads are currently spending 76.4% of their budgets in Shopping and receiving <em>more than 85%<\/em> of their clicks from Shopping:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"10479c1e-a869-4562-a3cd-5e555eb9c4c7\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/choosing-the-right-google-ads-channel-shopping.png\" alt=\"Google Ads Networks Qualified Clicks\" width=\"550\" height=\"292\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>On mobile, those numbers are even more remarkable: <a href=\"https:\/\/searchenginewatch.com\/2018\/03\/26\/why-google-shopping-is-dominating-retail-search-marketing\/\">79% and 87.9 %<\/a><u>,<\/u> respectively. Now, 79% of your friends jumping off a cliff is not a good reason to also jump off said cliff. But it certainly makes you wonder what\u2019s at the bottom.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Google Shopping, the proof is in the pudding. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/17\/google-mobile-benchmarks-by-ad-type\">average cost-per-action of a mobile shopping ad<\/a> is $45.26\u2014this compared to $97.71 for a standard text ad, $81.04 for an expanded text ad, and $98.29 for a standard display ad.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4453c598-4eb2-4b93-8af2-4ee2ea3c56c9\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad_type_benchmarks_shopping_ads_0.png\" alt=\"Google Ads Networks Shopping\" width=\"1000\" height=\"868\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Like any bull market, there reaches a point of saturation and declining returns. Until then, if you\u2019re selling a tangible product, it\u2019s time to see what the fuss is all about. The following attributes make Shopping a landscape well worth venturing into:<\/p>\n<p>1. <strong>Reach<\/strong>. Shopping ads appear in Google Search, Google Shopping, and across Google Search Partner sites like YouTube and image search. And they don\u2019t just <em>appear <\/em>in Google Search\u2014they\u2019re served at the top of the SERP (Search Engine Results Page), above organic results and text ads. Your shopping ad can also appear in <em>concert <\/em>with your text ad or with another shopping ad, giving you multiple opportunities per single query to earn a click.<\/p>\n<p>2. <strong>Format. <\/strong>Not only are shopping ads bigger than text ads\u2026<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c218bc03-d4e5-4b8d-ba7d-e9e8f86efbe2\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-networks-vr-glasses.png\" alt=\"Google Ads Networks VR Glasses\" width=\"689\" height=\"390\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>But they also allow you to leverage enticing image creative to draw in prospects. Which leads us to the next benefit of the Shopping network\u2026<\/p>\n<p>3. <strong>More qualified clicks. <\/strong>Because searchers have the ability to discern unique product information from your shopping ad just by looking at it\u2014specifically, what it looks like and how much it costs\u2014the searchers who click are inherently further down the sales funnel.<\/p>\n<p>4. <strong>No keyword management. <\/strong>Shopping has a lot in common with SEO. Google Ads connects directly to your product listings in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/18\/google-merchant-center\">Google Merchant Center<\/a>. Then, rather than leaning on keyword bids, your ad placement is determined by your ability to optimize your product listings for Search (as if you were writing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/meta-tags\">meta titles and descriptions<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>5. <strong>Better reporting. <\/strong>Shopping allows you to get as granular as you want in your reporting efforts. The <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/6239130?hl=en\">Bid Simulator<\/a> is also a great tool if you\u2019re unsure of whether or not to raise or lower your bid.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a lot to like about the shopping network. If you have a product that could feasibly exist in a shopping ad, you should strongly consider getting in the game.<\/p>\n<h2>YouTube: Maximizing Meaningful Impressions with TrueView<\/h2>\n<p>Over the last two years, the number of small and medium-sized businesses advertising on YouTube <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/intl\/en-GB\/yt\/advertise\/\">has doubled<\/a>. Part of the reason behind that trend is that businesses are starting to understand just how much video people are consuming on a daily basis and how much internet traffic is predicted to come from video in the very near future (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/08\/video-marketing-statistics\">80%<\/a> by 2019). The other factor involved is that video and other visual assets are getting easier to create for advertisers with minimal resources, training, and time. With <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/products\">WordStream Advisor<\/a>, for instance, you can now create compelling, ready-to-publish Facebook video ads in a matter of minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Anytime you put effort into creating something, the fear is that it\u2019s not going to be seen. TrueView, YouTube\u2019s default ad format, puts that fear to bed. With TrueView, you <strong>only pay when viewers actually watch (for 30 seconds) or interact with your video. <\/strong>That means no wasted spend on impressions that fail to garner real, meaningful interactions.<\/p>\n<p>TrueView comes in two flavors:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>TrueView in-stream. <\/strong>These play before or during your run-of-the-mill YouTube videos. Users are given the choice to skip the ad after five seconds of air time; you still only pay if they click an element in your ad or watch for 30 seconds (or until the end, whichever comes first).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"628f3cb1-f347-4e36-ba7d-b093ce3c1c2d\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/choose-the-right-google-ads-channeltrueview-in-stream.png\" alt=\"Google Ads Networks TrueView In Stream\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>TrueView video discovery. <\/strong>These appear alongside other YouTube videos, in YouTube search pages, or on the various websites on the display network.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"aefb6c2c-27df-47f7-8634-4cb061bb6cd9\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-networkstrueview-discovery-ads.png\" alt=\"Google Ads Networks TrueView Discovery\" width=\"4267\" height=\"2133\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>You can <em>also <\/em>leverage product listings in your existing Merchant Center data to create a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/24\/trueview-for-shopping\">TrueView for shopping<\/a> campaign, with which you can actually showcase a shopping listing for your product <em>next <\/em>to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/07\/youtube-call-to-action-extensions\">TrueView video ad content<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>One other YouTube ad format of note is bumper ads. Bumper ads are six seconds or shorter, and they play before, during, or after YouTube videos. The unique appeal here is that, first, users can\u2019t skip bumper ads and, second, they operate on CPM (cost-per-thousand impressions) bidding, meaning you pay each time your ad is shown 1,000. Bumper ads are tailor made for reach campaigns, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blog.google\/products\/ads\/say-it-in-six-why-marketers-and\/\">70% of brands<\/a> that use them report an increase in brand awareness.<\/p>\n<p>51% of marketers are currently in the YouTube video ad game, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.emarketer.com\/Article\/More-Spending-on-Social-Video-Ads-Planned\/1016049\">more plan on getting involved<\/a> in the near future. If you have the capability to produce video and are in the business of maximizing meaningful ad impressions, YouTube represents a very advantageous channel for your ad spend.<\/p>\n<h2>Finding the Google Ads Channel That\u2019s Right for You<\/h2>\n<p>Each of these channels, as we\u2019ve seen, has unique strengths. And most businesses can get value out of using all of them in concert. The question is: what\u2019s your objective? If your brand is completely awesome, but you\u2019re having trouble getting the word out, you might benefit from the leveraging the display network or the reach-boosting power of YouTube bumper ads. If you\u2019re looking for quality over quantity of clicks, you might experiment with Shopping. If you\u2019re in Dating &amp; Personals, or another niche that allows you to leverage provocative creative, you might note that conversion rates are actually higher than industry average on Display and use that channel to move the needle.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no right answer, and the fact is, each of these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/29\/ad-channels\">ad channels<\/a> is worth at least <em>trying <\/em>if you want to find the budget allocation that\u2019s right for you.
