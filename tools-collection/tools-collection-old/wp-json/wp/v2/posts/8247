Usually, this is because they manually track conversions on their own or because they sometimes are unsure of what tracking could look like for them. After all, not every business is a <a>cookie-cutter purchase or call-based model.\u00a0<\/a>However, I <strong>always <\/strong>advise against this because <strong>there\u2019s a fit for tracking in every account. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Some of the more typical conversion actions include\u00a0calls, form fills, and purchases, but there are many more that could be a better fit for your business, such as live\u00a0<a>chat messages, content downloads, and bookings (more on that later).<\/a><\/p>\n<p>At the least, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/customize-google-ads-conversion-tracking\">conversion tracking<\/a> is a way to quantify the value of your advertising. At the most, it\u2019s an imperative grounding metric to make sense of all other data points within your account. Since all PPC decisions are usually made based on historical data <u>(<\/u>because no one likes just guessing<u>)<\/u>, then you really need conversion tracking set up right if you want to continuously optimize your account and get the best bang for your buck.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-conversion-tracking-conversion-rate-benchmarks-1.png\" alt=\"google ads conversion tracking conversion rate benchmarks\" width=\"616\" height=\"720\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>How to set up Google Ads conversion tracking (correctly)<\/h2>\n<p>While there are\u00a0many types\u00a0of conversion actions to choose from, the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/6095821\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">setup process<\/a> is essentially the same throughout.<\/p>\n<p>In short, Google generates a\u00a0bit of HTML code\u00a0that you paste into the webpage on your site that customers visit immediately after completing the conversion (such as an order confirmation\u00a0or <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/03\/thank-you-pages\">thank you page.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>To get started, click on the <strong>Tools section in Google Ads<\/strong>, and select <strong>Conversions <\/strong>from under Measurement in the drop-down menu, which brings up the<strong> Conversion actions section,<\/strong> then click the <strong>+Conversion<\/strong> button to create your first conversion.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-conversion-tracking-conversion-actions-tab-1.png\" alt=\"google ads conversion tracking conversion actions tab\" width=\"922\" height=\"304\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You&#8217;ll be prompted to fill out a form that will help Google Ads generate the appropriate HTML code for you to just paste right into your webpage.<\/p>\n<p>Give the conversion a name, such as &#8220;Contact Form Submissions&#8221; if you want to track how many times visitors fill out your site&#8217;s Contact Us form.<\/p>\n<p>Then, you\u2019ll select the source of the conversion and Google will prompt you through the implementation process from there.

Let\u2019s quickly review the conversion metric columns Google provides us so that we can better understand our conversion activity:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Conv. (1-per-click): <\/strong>Counts each time you receive one or more conversions from a single ad-click. You can use this number to approximate the number of<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/10\/google-display-network-targeting\"> new customers<\/a> you&#8217;re getting.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cost \/ conv. (1-per-click): <\/strong>Displays your cost (how much you spent on clicks) divided by your total conversions. This helps you measure your return on investment (ROI). Ideally, you should be spending less on clicks than you&#8217;re earning on conversions. This metric is also commonly known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/cost-per-action\">Cost Per Acquisition or Cost Per Action (CPA)<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Conv. rate (1-per-click): <\/strong>Shows the percentage of clicks that resulted in conversions. The higher the percentage, the more effectively the ads or <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">keywords are performing<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>View-through conv.: <\/strong>Measures the number of times a customer viewed, but did not click on, your ad and later went through with a conversion.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-conversion-tracking-metrics-1.jpg\" alt=\"metrics you can measure with google ads conversion tracking\" width=\"396\" height=\"298\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>8 reasons your Google Ads conversion tracking isn\u2019t working<\/h2>\n<p>Alright so now that we&#8217;ve covered the basics for conversion tracking, let&#8217;s go over the eight most common hang-ups I see businesses run into with their Google Ads accounts.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Not knowing what to track<\/h3>\n<h4><strong>What\u2019s wrong<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>One common misconception with conversion tracking is that your actions have to be run-of-the-mill, old-fashioned transactions, like purchases. But we know that for most businesses, it\u2019s not always that easy.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>How to fix it<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>If you\u2019re unsure of what actions you should track as meaningful conversions, you\u2019ll first want to take a step back and walk through your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-customer-journey\/\">customer journey<\/a>. If you have a longer <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/26\/sales-cycle\">sales cycle<\/a> or generally a more complex product or service, then your ideal customer probably won\u2019t convert right away after <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/14\/increase-traffic-to-my-website\">visiting your site<\/a> just one time from an ad.<\/p>\n<p>Or, maybe that conversion happens offline via a sales rep call. But that doesn\u2019t mean your visitors can\u2019t complete meaningful actions once they land on your web page.<\/p>\n<p>You may have to get creative and provide things for your potential clients to do. Now, this might not always directly equate to something that makes you money right away. But,\u00a0these actions help to push your leads further down your funnel so they can eventually convert into customers.<\/p>\n<p>Actions like these include downloading a whitepaper, providing an email in a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/26\/pop-up-strategy\">pop-up<\/a>, viewing a video, engaging in <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/reasons-to-use-live-chat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">live chat<\/a>, viewing a page,\u00a0and so much more. So get creative with what you want to track because the more ways you have to quantify your customer\u2019s actions each step of the way, the better!<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-conversion-tracking-events-to-track_0-1.jpg\" alt=\"events to track with google ads conversion tracking\" width=\"959\" height=\"345\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>2. No conversion data or low conversion rates<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s wrong<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So, you thought you had conversion tracking good to go, but after some time you\u2019re digging through your account for little to no conversions to be found. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/21\/google-ads-not-converting\">Why aren&#8217;t your Google Ads converting?<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Remain calm and follow these three steps:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rule out performance first!<\/strong><br \/>\nWe cannot stress this one enough. It\u2019s easy to scapegoat your tracking when you see that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/17\/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate\">conversions are low<\/a>, but we\u2019ll have to look retrospectively at the account to ensure there\u2019s really nothing going on performance-wise.<\/p>\n<p>One indicator is if conversion data just seems slightly low (and not just zeros across the board) then we know right off the bat there\u2019s some sort of action still being tracked, so it might not totally be the tracking\u2019s fault.<\/p>\n<p>You may want to view your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/15\/google-ads-account-audit-post-covid\">change history<\/a> to double-check any tweaks you made to the account that could have caused a performance dip. Ask yourself these types of questions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Were budgets or <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/15\/smart-bidding\">bids<\/a> lowered?<\/li>\n<li>Do my keywords have a lower search volume, meaning maybe they\u2019re just less popular?<\/li>\n<li>Have I historically had lower activity during this time of year?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Read\u00a0through the \u201cConversions\u201d section of Google Ads<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We touched on how to create conversions via the Conversions section of Google Ads, but being able to <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/3438531?hl=en#:~:text=Your%20repeat%20rate%20is%20the,the%20%E2%80%9Cone%20conversion%E2%80%9D%20setting.\">read through the data<\/a> it puts out is just as important. Navigate to that\u00a0 same section to cross-check what actions are currently being counted as conversions.<\/p>\n<p>Then find in the next column over what type of conversion each action is.<\/p>\n<p>Then check\u00a0to see if there has been any recent activity on that action\u2019s tag under\u00a0tracking status. If not, then you know conversions may just be slow.<\/p>\n<p>On the right-hand side, you can see how many conversions have come in as well. As for repeat rate, that\u2019s just the average number of conversions you receive based on interactions that lead to at least one conversion.<\/p>\n<p>These are all important columns to be familiar with to see if conversions are just slow, not working, or being recorded incorrectly. If you\u2019re unsure of a column, simply hover over the title at the top of the column and Google will remind you of the definition as well.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Try out the Google Tag Assistant browser plugin<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Google has also come out with a handy tool to check up on the tags on our landing page. <a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/tag-assistant-legacy-by-g\/kejbdjndbnbjgmefkgdddjlbokphdefk?hl=en\">Google Tag Assistant<\/a> is a plugin you can download and install on your browser that will run tests on whatever page your browser is on.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you\u2019re still unsure after the two steps above whether your tags are firing correctly or potentially duplicated, you can run the tag assistant which will report back live which tags it picks up. It color-codes the tags to tell you if there are\u00a0any issues with them, and provides the tag code so you can cross-check this with the code once you click into the selected conversion action of the conversion section.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-conversion-tracking-google-tag-assistant-1.png\" alt=\"use google tag assistant for google ads conversion tracking\" width=\"1014\" height=\"548\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>3. Conversion data seems off<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s wrong<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ve always brought in a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-increase-sales-for-your-business-on-a-budget\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ton of sales<\/a>, but your conversion metrics have been crazy slow, or vice versa.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On top of remembering to rule out performance first and leveraging the GTM plugin to check for double tags or tags on the wrong page, you\u2019ll also want to check two specific portions of that \u201cConversions\u201d section again.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Check the &#8220;Recent Activity&#8221; and &#8220;Include in Conversions&#8221; columns<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For example, recent activity can show whether you haven\u2019t brought in a conversion in a while (\u201ctag inactive\u201d or \u201cno recent conversions\u201d). Or, your \u201cInclude in Conversions\u201d column will show whether that action\u2019s conversion data will be reported in your conversion columns on your campaigns. If that column says No when it\u2019s supposed to say Yes, then you\u2019ll want to click into it to edit it and say yes\u2014as long as it\u2019s not Google Hosted (Google Hosted conversions will never show in the conversions columns).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cross-check with your backup tracking<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Finally, but most importantly, you\u2019ll want to always have a backup way of tracking your conversions on your end to cross-check. This could be via Google Analytics, a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/09\/crm-for-small-business\">CRM<\/a>, a marketing\u00a0partner interface, or manually tracking what comes in on your end.<\/p>\n<p>If you have your own backup method of conversion tracking that you\u2019re in charge of then not only will your data not be lost if tracking issues pop up, but you\u2019ll be able to cross-check to see if your Google Ads data really is off or not.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-conversion-tracking-conversion-actions-window-1.png\" alt=\"google ads conversion tracking conversion actions window\" width=\"1839\" height=\"730\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>4. Need to remove\/add a conversion<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s wrong<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You realize you forgot to add in a conversion action you wanted to track. Or, on the opposite end, your conversion data is skewed higher because it\u2019s accounting for an action\u00a0you no longer want to track.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>To add: <\/strong>Easy peasy! Refer back to our setup section and follow the prompts to add that action in,\u00a0so it can\u00a0be included in data moving forward.<\/p>\n<p><strong>To remove: <\/strong>Navigate to the <strong>Conversions<\/strong> section of Google Ads under <strong>Tools<\/strong>, then <strong>Measurement<\/strong>, and click on the name of the conversion action you\u2019d like to remove. Once you\u2019re in that conversion\u2019s separate informational section, you can hit <strong>Edit<\/strong> on that information box and uncheck the \u201c<strong>Include in Conversions<\/strong>\u201d option. You can also remove the tracking code from your site\u2019s backend as well.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Conversion action unclear<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s wrong<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You\u2019re seeing conversion data come through in your Google Ads columns, but you\u2019re not sure what that conversion actually is or what that might mean for your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/11\/21\/customer-journey-mapping\">customer journey<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is a bit of a tricky one, and I hate to be the bearer of bad news here, but there will be some things in Google Ads that the platform just does not have the capability to report on.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you\u2019re trying to attribute one specific <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">keyword<\/a> or ad to one specific conversion, then that is virtually impossible. And\u00a0while you can sort of get an idea by digging\u00a0through your converting keywords or ads and finessing the date range to match when that specific conversion came in, you\u2019ll never know for sure which action that is if you have multiple set up.<\/p>\n<p>However, what you can do is cross-check your actions back in that Conversions section. So, if you navigate back to your conversions section it will list out how many of those specified actions were completed within your selected time frame.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to dial that in even further if, say, you had a different thank you page based on locations, click on those actions and go to the Webpages section within them to see a breakdown of the total conversions split out by page.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-conversion-tracking-webpages-1.png\" alt=\"google ads conversion tracking webpage tab\" width=\"2402\" height=\"718\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>6. \u201cNo recent conversions\u201d or \u201ctag inactive\u201d in the Conversions section<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s wrong<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You\u2019re in your Conversions section of Google Ads and you see big red, scary text that says one of these two phrases \u201ctag inactive\u201d or \u201cno recent conversions.\u201d But maybe you\u2019ve converted fairly recently, so how could this be?<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This one is a breeze since it\u2019s really a no-action-needed issue! While those texts under your Recent Activity seem like a glaring red flag, once we hover over them Google reminds us that these are fairly innocuous.<\/p>\n<p>They both mean you haven\u2019t had <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/11\/get-more-conversions\">conversions<\/a> within the last 7-day (no recent conversions) or 30-day (tag inactive) period. It does not mean that you are not tracking properly, but that conversions have just been slow for that particular action. So,\u00a0the only plan of action is potentially evaluating your account performance to see if there are\u00a0any optimizations you can do to boost conversion frequency.<\/p>\n<p class=\"color-pc-blue\"><em>Evaluate your Google Ads account performance with our<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong> Free Google Ads Performance Grader<\/strong><\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>7. New landing page, old tracking set up<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s wrong<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You\u2019re excited to have finally put live that new landing page you\u2019ve been working at, but how do you handle tracking since it\u2019s been previously set up on your old page?<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Okay, to be honest, we added this one to also partially serve as a reminder that your new\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/10\/high-converting-landing-pages\">landing page<\/a> usually requires a few housekeeping updates to ensure the continuity of your conversion tracking goes smooth as silk.<\/p>\n<p>If it\u2019s a totally new page then it most likely will not have your old tags on it (unless it redirects to an old thank you page or specific situations similar to that). So, you\u2019ll treat this the same as the set-up steps listed above to just implement the tracking fresh again as if it were new.<\/p>\n<p>The last step is to always keep in mind that you\u2019ll need to swap out all final landing page URLs on your ads (including paused ones so Google doesn\u2019t flag you for a \u201cdestination mismatch\u201d between new and old landing pages within the same ad group).<\/p>\n<h3>8. Conversions just (poof!) fell off<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s wrong<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You had conversions flowing in at a steady pace and then they dropped drastically to almost nothing or even zero.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Okay, so if there\u2019s suddenly zeros across the board for your conversion data<u>,<\/u> then your tracking has a 99% chance of being the problem.<\/p>\n<p>Remain calm!<\/p>\n<p>The first place\u00a0you need to go is back to that change history as mentioned in hang-up number two so that performance can be ruled out completely. Then, follow the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/15\/google-ads-account-audit-post-covid\">audit<\/a> steps we discussed leveraging\u00a0the Conversions section of Google Ads as well as the Google Tag Manager to identify any weaknesses in your tracking. It may take reinstalling a tracking tag or changing what\u2019s being tracked to get you back on track, and that\u2019s okay!<\/p>\n<h2>Now you can reap the benefits of Google Ads conversion tracking<\/h2>\n<p>Overall, it can be easy to automatically freak out about anything related to conversion tracking because it can feel complex with lots of moving parts and coding elements to it. But you don\u2019t need to be a web wiz to at least troubleshoot what tracking means for you in terms of your PPC account performance. So, if you go into any issues head-on then methodically untangle them, you\u2019ll find that you can usually fix the problem or come up with a solution for a stress-free continuation of your ad campaign.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google Ads conversion tracking gets complicated fast.
