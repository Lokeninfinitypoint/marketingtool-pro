But that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t be genuine in your communication. Don&#8217;t use generic, empty messaging. Actually reflect on the specific item you want to mention to jog their memory. And if it permits, keep a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/05\/conversational-tone\">conversational tone<\/a> if you can. This is easier to read and write, and the person won&#8217;t feel obliged to use formal tone in their response.<\/p>\n<h3>Include the original message<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re following up on a previous email, do not make the recipient search for the original email and do not rewrite the email. Reply all to your email and then remove yourself from the recipient list so the person can have all of the context they need.<\/p>\n<p>Also, if the original email had an attachment, re-attach it.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udceb<strong> More free email templates!<\/strong>\u00a0 <strong>&gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteEmailExampleTemplate.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Email_EmailTemplates_Download\">The Complete Email Marketing Toolkit<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>Have one clear ask<\/h3>\n<p>With the above being said, don\u2019t make them re-read the original email.
