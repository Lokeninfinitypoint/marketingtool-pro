Suddenly, everyone has access to tools that can spin up dozens of publishable blog posts with a few well-crafted AI prompts.

Try bingo cards, calendars, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/interactive-content\">interactive quizzes<\/a>, timelines, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have your new and original content, Eric suggests using it in more traditional assets. \u201cWe\u2019ve differentiated by having mixed media in a blog post, so it\u2019s not just words, it\u2019s templates, there\u2019s videos, there\u2019s product demos.\u201d<\/p>\n<div id=\"use-your-voice-as-a-differentiator\"><\/div>\n<h3>3.

Rease says that this is where an ideal example really shines. \u201cI work with very technical topics, so when I write or edit, I look for ways to take a step back and connect with the reader through an example that will resonate,\u201d she explained. \u201cOften, this means finding an example that works with a much broader (and potentially less technical) audience.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I think this tactic works similarly to Louis\u2019 tip on using first-person experience. You\u2019re packaging a concept in a relatable story to make it more memorable and understandable. And in both cases, it\u2019s something you can do better than AI.<\/p>\n<p>Eric Doty has an interesting application of this strategy. He built <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dock.us\/revenue-archives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this gallery<\/a> of sales assets to help inspire his customers to create their own.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/differentiate-content-wordstream-sales-examples-1.webp\" alt=\"How to differentiate content - Dock examples page.\" width=\"600\" height=\"515\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91824 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/differentiate-content-wordstream-sales-examples-1.webp 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/differentiate-content-wordstream-sales-examples-1-480x412.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dock.us\/revenue-archives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to write best practices; it\u2019s another to curate examples. It\u2019s effortful work that\u2019s still not extremely easy for LLMs to replicate,\u201d Eric said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSolid, relatable examples are a great differentiator,\u201d Rease added. \u201cExamples are your chance to get into the mindset of the readers and consider \u2018what would make this click for them?\u2019&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Real-world examples are best. But when they aren\u2019t readily available, try some hypotheticals that bring your point home. Just remember what Katrina said about relatability.

Create with empathy<\/h3>\n<p>Empathy is often either treated as a hollow buzzword or confused with being nice. In reality, empathy is a learned skill that\u2019s essential for any effective communicator, and as<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/stephanie-yoder\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Stephanie Yoder<\/a>, director of content at<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rebrandly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Rebrandly<\/a>, explained, it\u2019s a valuable tool for connecting with your audience in the age of AI.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to be empathetic to your readers, which is something AI cannot do,\u201d Stephanie said. \u201cAn increasing number of companies are churning out endless pages of AI-generated content in an arms race to the bottom. That means content made with actual human beings in mind (as opposed to bots) will stand out even more. There is a golden opportunity for brands willing to double down on genuinely helpful content.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the context of content creation, empathy means understanding the real problem your customer is trying to solve. The old adage is to \u201csell the hole, not the drill.\u201d Meaning, promote the solution, not the product. I\u2019d say take that a step further and empathize with the pride of hanging a shelf yourself\u2014then write content that speaks to that.<\/p>\n<p>For a big brand, The Home Depot does a great job of empathizing with its customers. Their taglines \u201cYou can do it. We can help\u201d and \u201cHow doers get more done\u201d speak directly to our sense of accomplishment instead of \u201cselling the drill.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/differentiate-content-wordstream-home-depot-1.webp\" alt=\"How to differentiate content - Home Depot ad.\" width=\"936\" height=\"526\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91823 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/differentiate-content-wordstream-home-depot-1.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/differentiate-content-wordstream-home-depot-1-480x270.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.adweek.com\/commerce\/home-depot-builds-new-slogan-targeted-to-doers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>There are lots of opportunities to show empathy for your readers in long-form content, too. Name your target audience in the introduction, include pain points in your H2s, and add an inside joke or two.<\/p>\n<p>The point, according to Stephanie, is to make sure and include a people-first perspective in all of your content, no matter how it\u2019s created. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t use AI to speed up your content creation process,\u201d she said. \u201cBut a human must absolutely be in the loop at every stage of the process, preserving the humanity and actual utility of your content.\u201d<\/p>\n<div id=\"highlight-authors-over-brand\"><\/div>\n<h3>9. Highlight authors over brand<\/h3>\n<p>Colin Campbell, the head of content and community at Pixis who gave us the tip earlier on managing expert quotes, has thought a lot about how the challenge of standing out in an increasingly crowded space.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen everybody&#8217;s using the same LLMs, which all have access to the same information to produce content on the same topics, no amount of editing the outputs will help create a differentiated final product,\u201d he noted. \u201cThe only reliable way to create differentiated content now is to curate inimitable inputs.<\/p>\n<p>Collin mentioned four \u201cbuckets\u201d of such inputs:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Opinions<\/li>\n<li>Experiences<\/li>\n<li>Proprietary data<\/li>\n<li>Identity<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Other content marketers I spoke to had already explored the first three. So, I was interested in diving into the fourth. \u201cI do believe users will care more and more about who wrote the content they consume,\u201d Collin told me. \u201cJust look at the rise of Substack and individual influencers as \u2018thought leaders.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>We already see this play out all over LinkedIn. Scroll long enough, and you\u2019ll see individuals\u2019 accounts getting much more engagement than the brands they work for. The trick is parlaying that personal following into views and visits on your content.<\/p>\n<p>Rand Fishkin is a great example of how an author can build credibility that outshines brands to out-compete generic content.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/differentiate-content-wordstream-fishkin-1.webp\" alt=\"How to differentiate content - Rand Fishkin LI post.\" width=\"600\" height=\"500\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91822 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/differentiate-content-wordstream-fishkin-1.webp 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/differentiate-content-wordstream-fishkin-1-480x400.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/posts\/randfishkin_did-you-see-ross-hudgens-study-about-homepage-activity-7331045164288733184-O4WY?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAfpBUkBZn1g_3AT-AQ7-zTMTBRIIDRYtto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t need to be as prolific on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/01\/09\/social-media-marketing-strategies\">social media<\/a> as Rand to use Colin\u2019s advice.
