Run a sale or promotion<\/h3>\n<p>This is a classic holiday marketing tactic for a reason: it works. Shoppers not only save up for the events each year, but they browse various retailers for the best deals. In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tidio.com\/blog\/black-friday-trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">87%<\/a> of people plan on shopping between Black Friday and Cyber Monday\u2014and Small Business Saturday is a part of this timeframe.<\/p>\n<p>While consumers may assess their willingness to buy from large businesses purely on economics, they often give <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/2025-marketing-planning\">small businesses<\/a> a little leeway. Even if you can\u2019t offer the steepest discount, consumers may factor in the sense of satisfaction they get in supporting a local shop.<\/p>\n<p>Your sale or promotion can take several forms. Some popular Small Business Saturday ideas include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Doorbuster or early bird deals:<\/strong> Offer a special discount to those enthusiastic souls who are waiting outside your door when you open on Saturday morning.<\/li>\n<li><strong>BOGO:<\/strong> The \u201cbuy one, get one\u201d structure is a classic for brands, especially those in retail.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Deals by category:<\/strong> Cut prices on specific categories of merchandise or service offerings.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bundle deals: <\/strong>Offer discounts when customers buy complementary products or services together (wine and cheese, shoes and socks, sheets and duvet cover\u2014you get the idea).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/small-business-saturday-marketing-stat.jpg\" alt=\"small business saturday - consumers planning on shopping on small business saturday\" width=\"936\" height=\"343\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86207 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/small-business-saturday-marketing-stat.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/small-business-saturday-marketing-stat-480x176.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tidio.com\/blog\/black-friday-trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udca1For more small business-friendly marketing ideas<\/strong> check out our free guide to <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite30BestWaysToPromote.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Marketing_The30BestWaysToPromoteYourBusiness_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the 30 best ways to promote your business (with or without money)<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"local-events\"><\/div>\n<h3>2.

Create your own Small Business Saturday event<\/h3>\n<p>If your town isn\u2019t doing something, why not take the initiative and host a Small Business Saturday event yourself?<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps plan an in-store event designed to draw people to your brick-and-mortar location. Be sure to take your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">target customer<\/a> into account when you create your event.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a local bakery that caters to young families might offer a holiday cookie decorating class for kids. Meanwhile, the sophisticated florist down the street might invite adults to stop by for a holiday centerpiece design demonstration.<\/p>\n<p>Allow your imagination to run wild as you flesh out this Small Business Saturday marketing idea. Whatever event you dream up, promote it in advance with fliers, on social media, and via your email list.<\/p>\n<div id=\"small-business-saturday-partnership\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Partner with other small business owners<\/h3>\n<p>Don\u2019t feel up to hosting an event on your own? Consider partnering with other local business owners to co-create a Small Business Saturday celebration.<\/p>\n<p>You might all spearhead a larger event, creating a directory of participating small businesses. Go in on advertising together in advance, and offer incentives to customers who stop by multiple stores in your collective.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/small-business-saturday-marketing-partnership.webp\" alt=\"small business saturday marketing ideas - ways to partner with other businesses example for small business saturday\" width=\"657\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86198 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/small-business-saturday-marketing-partnership.webp 657w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/small-business-saturday-marketing-partnership-480x438.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 657px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/hawaiidoggiebakery.org\/2019\/11\/small-business-saturday-in-manoa\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can pair up with just one or two other small businesses to host a smaller event. Look for natural crossover in your audience to create an event that will appeal to the customers you have in common.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a local cafe might team up with the bookshop down the street and host a \u201ccoffee and a book\u201d event. The coffee shop sets up an espresso machine at the bookstore, and visitors can grab a latte and curl up with a great read on the store\u2019s shelves.<\/p>\n<div id=\"small-business-saturday-map\"><\/div>\n<h3>5.

Tap a local influencer for support<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/digital-marketing\/influencer-marketing-tips\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Influencer marketing<\/a> is a wildly effective tactic that\u2019s sometimes overlooked by small businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Some hear the phrase and assume it\u2019s only for big brands with mega budgets, but an ever-expanding pool of micro-influencers\u2014those with thousands, rather than millions, of followers\u2014are making influencer marketing a viable tactic for small brands.<\/p>\n<p>To find the right micro-influencer to promote your Small Business Saturday efforts, look for someone who\u2019s a trusted source for your ideal audience. A gym might partner with a popular wellness influencer, while a clothing boutique might tap a fashion influencer.<\/p>\n<p>And when you work with a micro-influencer, you\u2019re likely to see stronger results than you would with a big name. Influencers with fewer than 15,000 followers typically see a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.upfluence.com\/influencer-marketing\/influencer-engagement-everything-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">3.86%<\/a> engagement rate on Instagram, while mega influencers with 1 million or more followers see much lower engagement; the average rate is 1.21%.<\/p>\n<div id=\"online-communities\"><\/div>\n<h3>10.

The average open rate across industries hovers around <a href=\"https:\/\/www.campaignmonitor.com\/resources\/guides\/email-marketing-benchmarks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">21%<\/a>, which means it might take <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/01\/automated-email-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more than one email<\/a> to get your readers to open and click.<\/p>\n<p>Your email marketing campaign should serve two main purposes:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Repeat your Small Business Saturday message so everyone gets it, even if they\u2019re not diligently reading every one of your emails.<\/li>\n<li>Create a growing sense of excitement as the day draws nearer.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Start with a teaser message, sharing that something big is coming this Small Business Saturday.
