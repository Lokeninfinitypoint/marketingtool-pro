In a momentary distraction from the clock on the digital display on my driver\u2019s dashboard, I wonder if my Uber driver would have cursed the daredevil cyclist if he weren\u2019t worried about his rating.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m trying to get to 745 Atlantic Avenue, home of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wework.com\/locations\/boston\/south-station\">WeWork Boston\u2019s second location<\/a> in the city. A leader in the coworking (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/videos\/office-sharing-company-wework-expands-to-welive\/\">and now co-living<\/a>) space, WeWork Boston is graciously hosting the inaugural Boston Content Hackathon, an event organized by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.boscontent.com\/\">Boston Content<\/a>, a networking and advocacy group for content marketing professionals in the Boston area.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been to technical hackathons before, but never a content marketing hackathon.

I\u2019m not sure what to expect <em>at all<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s 6:20 p.m. By now, I\u2019m convinced that everyone has already begun to forge bonds with other attendees over drinks. I feel a bead of sweat roll down my back. <em>God<\/em>, I think, <em>I\u2019m going to be that guy. The late arrival<\/em> <em>doomed to awkwardly mill around staring at my phone while everyone else talks excitedly in their newly formed cliques.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>A few minutes later, with a screech of tires on asphalt, my driver gets me to 745 Atlantic. I hurriedly exit the Explorer, thank my driver, and head inside.<\/p>\n<p>The hackathon was on.<\/p>\n<h2>From Zero to Content Marketing Strategy in 3 Hours<\/h2>\n<p>Boston Content\u2019s Content Marketing Hackathon was born of a competition among WeWork Boston\u2019s resident businesses to win a night of free content consulting from content professionals across the Boston area.<\/p>\n<p>The winning business was <a href=\"http:\/\/knead.com\/\">Knead<\/a>, an early stage service-based startup that offers on-demand in-office massage therapy to companies in and around Boston. Knead had a solid offering, and had already made in-roads at some of the Boston area\u2019s biggest and best-known brands, such as <em>The Boston Globe<\/em>, Babson College, and NECN.<\/p>\n<p>What Knead didn\u2019t have, however, was a content marketing strategy.

He told us of his own lengthy tour of duty in Corporate America, and how years of high-stress work in Boston\u2019s professional sector had wreaked havoc on his posture and his health, a decline that prompted Pierce to quit the rat race and bootstrap Knead with his own savings and investments.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"df09f5a3-9e23-499c-bd2b-28c9d2261b0b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/inside-a-content-marketing-hackathon-group.jpg\" alt=\"Inside a content marketing hackathon\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>The crowd listens raptly to Nicholas Pierce, Knead Founder, explain his content needs.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We asked questions about Knead\u2019s pricing model, the competitive landscape for on-demand wellness services in Boston, and other crucial background information we\u2019d need to help propel Knead\u2019s content marketing efforts. The group was divided into three teams, and then we set to work.<\/p>\n<h2>Hacking Content, Workshop-Style<\/h2>\n<p>My team was led by Julie Carey, Product Marketing Director at Virgin Pulse. We took our places around the table in one of WeWork Boston\u2019s conference rooms, and almost immediately people began excitedly coming up with ideas for content Knead could produce to expand its range and reach new customers.<\/p>\n<p>Some suggested ways in which Knead could establish itself as a thought leader in the corporate wellness space, such as cosponsoring studies with the many medical organizations in Boston. Others recommended leveraging the power of listicles via social to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/10\/brand-awareness\">build brand awareness<\/a> and grow their social presence. A couple of our team members started typing away on their laptops, while others scribbled notes on Post-Its in black marker.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"cbc46e20-793a-4209-adbf-d61b1bfca6f4\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/inside-a-content-marketing-hackathon-matt-naffah.jpg\" alt=\"Inside a content marketing hackathon Matt Naffah\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Boston Interactive\u2019s Matt Naffah, left, and two team members strategizing Post-It style <\/em><\/p>\n<p>As the others talked, I took a moment to check out Knead\u2019s website on my phone. The site loaded quickly \u2013 a good sign \u2013 and after scrolling past the sunny image of the Boston skyline from the harbor, I got to the meat of the Knead homepage. The site told me that Knead delivers \u201cshort-duration chair massage to the office, building, or event\/party,\u201d and that the company handles \u201call scheduling and payment on our mobile-friendly website.\u201d The site also promised \u201cConvenient locations on a recurring basis\u201d and told me that \u201cIt\u2019s time for a relaxation revolution.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At that moment, I realized that the entirety of the content on the Knead homepage and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/27\/guide-to-about-us-pages\">About Us page<\/a> was feature-driven \u2013 <strong>there was no mention of the benefits of Knead as a service<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>I brought this to the attention of the group.

We discussed ways in which Knead\u2019s service could be repositioned to focus on the benefits of Knead, rather than the features. We talked about how Knead could appeal to HR staff and wellness program managers \u2013 Knead\u2019s primary audience \u2013 as a retention or onboarding tool. Somebody had the brilliant idea of positioning Knead as a way for HR professionals, typically the unsung heroes of the corporate world, to \u201cbe the hero\u201d for a change by offering Knead massages as a reward incentive.<\/p>\n<p>After another lightning-quick half-hour of brainstorming, Julie warned us we had just a few more minutes to present our case and outline our recommendations. Somehow, I was elected to co-present our ideas to the founders. We watched the first presentation, led by Boston Interactive\u2019s Director of Digital Strategy Matt Naffah, nodding along as Matt and his team offered their insights.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"b92f1e7f-9559-4be5-8bbe-07b2c64014ce\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/inside-a-content-marketing-hackathon-quiet-time.jpg\" alt=\"Inside a content marketing hackathon\" width=\"600\" height=\"447\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><em>A moment of quiet contemplation for Matt Naffah\u2019s group.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Then it was our turn.<\/p>\n<h2>Tough Love<\/h2>\n<p>We stood in front of the whole group and the founders, and laid out our recommendations. We highlighted the lack of benefits-focused messaging, and urged the founders to reconsider the site\u2019s positioning. I ventured the opinion that offering payment processing through a mobile-friendly website wasn\u2019t a feature \u2013 it was an expectation, a remark that prompted nodding and murmured agreement from both the group and the founders. We offered actionable strategies that Knead could implement in the next three months that could help them <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/14\/increase-traffic-to-my-website\">drive traffic to their site<\/a> and increase the number of leads they received.<\/p>\n<p>After the event, I had a chance to talk with Knead\u2019s founders, both of whom were excited not just by our recommendations, but by the excellent advice and strategies the other groups had offered. Knead had gone from very few ideas to possibly too many to implement right away. I can\u2019t wait to see what Knead does in the next few months.<\/p>\n<h2>Overcoming Common Content Problems<\/h2>\n<p>Knead may be an early-stage startup, but the problems Knead\u2019s founders face are far from unique.

After the event, it occurred to me that this is a misstep that many new businesses \u2013 and not just startups \u2013 make. It doesn\u2019t matter how much traffic your content generates if you\u2019re targeting the wrong audiences, or targeting the right audiences in the wrong way.
