So, I asked 10 experienced marketers for their top marketing tips going into 2025.<\/p>\n<p>No surprise, there were several mentions of AI, but not in the way I expected. It wasn\u2019t about bigger, faster, cheaper.

Think outside the blog for SEO success<\/h3>\n<p>Informational SERPs aren\u2019t just a list of links to blog posts anymore. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/krisettecapati\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Krisette Lim<\/a>, a content marketing specialist with <a href=\"https:\/\/appetiser.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Appetiser Apps<\/a>, said if you want <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/seo\">SEO success<\/a> in 2025, you\u2019ll need to think beyond the blog.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn 2025 and beyond, SEO and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/13\/content-marketing-strategy\">content marketing<\/a> will cover a broad spectrum of channels where your brand is represented\u2014from websites to social media and community forums,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cSearch on Google will capture these touchpoints\u2014not just your website\u2014as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/28\/user-generated-content\">user-generated content (UGC)<\/a> becomes more prominent on search results.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an illustration of Krisette\u2019s point. Try searching something like \u201cHow do I get out of a shadowban.\u201d Below the AI overview and \u201cPeople Also Ask\u201d feature, you\u2019ll see results from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-smart-bidding\">Reddit<\/a>, Quora, and YouTube.

That\u2019s a sure-fire way to publish posts people want to read and search engines want to promote.<\/p>\n<div id=\"empower-your-internal-influencers\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Empower your internal influencers<\/h3>\n<p>If you post <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/types-of-social-media-content\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media content<\/a> on your brand\u2019s account, you know how tough of a slog it can be to grow organic engagement.

Hearing from the people behind a company is the best way to humanize it,\u201d Brianne said.<\/p>\n<p>While individual results will vary, I can vouch for how this works. When I share a content link from my personal LinkedIn account, it gets as much or more engagement as a similar post on our business account.

Good old-fashioned <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/01\/email-marketing-tips\">email marketing<\/a>. \u201cIf you have a large enough email list, you\u2019ll be able to sell your products and services, period.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/05\/increase-email-signups#:~:text=Put%20up%20an%20email%20signup,in%20exchange%20for%20a%20resource.\">Growing your email list<\/a> takes time. But when it becomes your goal, you\u2019ll start seeing all sorts of ways to do it. Here are a few of the ways I\u2019ve seen brands speed that process up:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Run a contest or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/giveaway-ideas\">giveaway<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Offer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/15\/lead-magnet-ideas\">lead magnets<\/a> like big content assets.<\/li>\n<li>Put subscription forms in page popups, sidebars, headers, and footers.<\/li>\n<li>Ask new customers to sign up and incentivize them to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/14\/referral-program-ideas\"> invite friends<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Instead of trying to wring more site visits from an unstable traffic source, consider Jeff\u2019s advice and invest those resources in building an audience on a platform you have more control over. \u201cI would take 10K email addresses over 100K visitors per month.\u201d<\/p>\n<div id=\"train-ai-t0-write-like-you\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. Train your AI to write like you<\/h3>\n<p>AI isn\u2019t going away. Nor should it. You can gain so much efficiency\u2014and free yourself up for more creativity\u2014by letting your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency\">AI tools<\/a> shoulder repetitive work.<\/p>\n<p>But you can\u2019t just throw in an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-prompts\">AI prompt<\/a> and expect to get a marketing asset that stands out from the rest of the robo-content, said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/ehtisham-hussain-0b12b860\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ehtisham Hussain<\/a>, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ehtishamhussain.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fractional head of marketing<\/a> with AI experience. \u201cYour competitors will flood the internet with AI-generated written, audio, and video content like never before.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ehtisham reckons you don\u2019t need to ditch AI to be different. \u201cYour biggest challenge will be making your content rise above the noise. To do that, I recommend training your AI tools on past, human-written content that embodies your voice and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-create-a-brand-identity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">brand identity<\/a>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve seen people cajole AI into writing like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/article\/i-used-chatgpt-to-rewrite-my-text-in-the-style-of-shakespeare-c3po-and-harry-potter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shakespeare and C3PO<\/a>. It can because it has content in those voices to train it. You probably have lots of content in your preferred style. Ehtisham suggested feeding it to your AI copywriter. \u201cBy doing so, you will get your AI tools to produce new content in your voice and style,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have your AI co-writer thinking like you, Ehtisham said to apply it to content others aren&#8217;t writing. \u201cLean heavily into POV-driven content. Everyone will do the AI-generated &#8216;what, why, how&#8217; pieces, and they will all sound the same. Your real stories, opinions, and advice based on personal experiences will give you a better chance of standing out.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div id=\"focus-on-solving-problems\"><\/div>\n<h3>7.

But the real gold is that it can create a marketing moat other businesses can&#8217;t cross. \u201cNone of our competitors have access to this information, so it made our articles unique,\u201d Stella explained.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Stella said she recently conducted a series of customer interviews.

Break through selective attention<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/colby-flood\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Colby Flood<\/a>, Founder at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brighterclick.com\/ugc-agency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brighter Click<\/a>, said that in 2025, marketers will need to really think about what they post on social media.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeople are on social media to find content that entertains, educates, or connects with them emotionally and will likely filter out everything else due to what we call \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/osheenjain.medium.com\/science-of-selective-attention-how-we-filter-information-and-why-it-matters-644582c9e844\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">selective attention<\/a>,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Selective attention is our brains\u2019 defense mechanism against being overwhelmed in buzzy environments. It\u2019s how we filter out the drone of a city street but can hear a favorite song from half a block away. It\u2019s also how we can scroll through a dozen posts at speed and automatically stop on one that interests us.<\/p>\n<p>So, how do we stop speedy scrollers?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLean into UGC and influencer content to craft authentic, engaging ads,\u201d Colby said. \u201cConsider ways to naturally incorporate your product into stories or scenarios that resonate with your target audience.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/13\/ugc-instagram\">User-generated content works well<\/a> because it\u2019s peer-to-peer marketing. The content creator will naturally hit themes that resonate with other people like them.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Expert-marketing-tips-UGC-1.webp\" alt=\"Expert marketing tips - UGC social media post.\" width=\"329\" height=\"566\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87373 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Expert-marketing-tips-UGC-1.webp 329w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Expert-marketing-tips-UGC-1-174x300.webp 174w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>UGC features people relevant to your target audience, cutting through their selective attention.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t stress out trying to be the next GoPro of user-generated content. Here are a few easy ways you can turn product users into social media content creators for your brand:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add user-generated FAQs to your website and share them on social media.<\/li>\n<li>Post snippets from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/03\/testimonial-advertising\">user testimonials<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Promote your reviews.<\/li>\n<li>Ask users to add a branded hashtag like #[product]results when they post about the great things they\u2019ve done with your product.<\/li>\n<li>Use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/25\/social-listening-boolean-search\">social listening<\/a> to find positive conversations about your brand, then ask if you can share them on your feeds.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We\u2019re talking about marketing here, so Colby added a reminder to use those same attention-grabbing tactics to convert social scrollers. \u201cCap it off with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-pros-write-calls-to-action\">powerful CTA<\/a> that speaks directly to your audience\u2019s needs, sparking action that feels rewarding, not forced.\u201d<\/p>\n<div id=\"leave-negative-space-in-your-campaign\"><\/div>\n<h3>10. Leave negative space in your campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cNegative space\u201d is the blank area that separates design elements on a page. It makes important text and graphics feel more important and helps viewers process the information they\u2019re receiving.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/reaserios\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rease Rios<\/a>, Director of Content at <a href=\"https:\/\/qase.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Qase<\/a>, says that you should apply the same principle to your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-calendar\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing calendar<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t become white noise,\u201d she said. \u201cSpace out your big launches so your audience has time to get curious about what you\u2019ll come up with next. If you run back-to-back major campaigns all year long, you\u2019ll burn out your audience.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not just your audience\u2019s attention at risk, Rease warned. \u201cKnow when it\u2019s time to push and when it\u2019s time to rest,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll also burn out your team. They need room to be creative.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The right cadence depends a lot on your business, especially its size and structure. One large campaign a quarter is a great goal for most, though. That allows time to gather results from a few tactics (like repurposing) that\u2019ll inform the next big campaign.<\/p>\n<h2>The main marketing tip for 2025: Connect authentically<\/h2>\n<p>I didn\u2019t use AI to write this article, but if I had, this is where it would say, \u201cIn the quickly evolving landscape of marketing, you\u2019ll need new strategies and ideas to succeed.\u201d And it wouldn\u2019t be wrong.<\/p>\n<p>Just a few years ago, none of us probably thought that Google would use AI to shove our links further down the page. We couldn\u2019t imagine spinning up a dozen clone articles to heist SERP spots. Nor would we guess at the dramatic changes in how Twitter (ahem\u2026X), Facebook, and TikTok operate.<\/p>\n<p>But what\u2019s interesting to me is that the marketing tips I got weren\u2019t a bunch of complex, technical processes to hijack algorithms or game Google Ads. They all described some version of making marketing more human, which makes sense. No matter how many tech tools we throw at the job, we\u2019re still people selling to people.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\"
