Two Campaigns Utilising Campaign Priorities<\/h2>\n<p>The idea behind using two campaigns each is to give you more control on the search terms that your products show for by using the campaign priority setting and negative keyword lists.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"34a9f5d9-e6bf-436f-a7d4-b6c9b94deafb\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-shopping-campaign-structure-priority.jpg\" alt=\"structing adwords shopping campaigns by priority\" width=\"1448\" height=\"653\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Setting Shopping Campaign priority in the new Google AdWords interface<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Good points<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Easy to set up.

Profit Margins<\/h2>\n<p>This approach entails setting up your campaigns to include product categories based on profit margins.

However, in my opinion this approach has limitations.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Dividing out categories, products, brands, price and IDs is a pain if you have tens of thousands of products.<\/h3>\n<p>Seasonal products will be hard to manage and exclude.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2c79a94d-4639-4001-83d5-b35962bdc811\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-structure-shopping-campaigns-with-many-products.jpg\" alt=\"campaign structure for account with many products\" width=\"798\" height=\"589\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>2. If products change prices or categories, your data will become harder to interpret as the product SKUs that did well will disappear from product group divisions.<\/h3>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3a367725-2edd-4584-8de8-600065664a2b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/shopping-campaign-data-analysis-problems.jpg\" alt=\"how many ad groups per shopping campaign\" width=\"800\" height=\"569\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>3. It isn\u2019t possible to see what keywords are triggering specific products.<\/h3>\n<p>If you have hundreds or even thousands of products within one Ad Group, you won\u2019t be able to associate poor or great converting products with the search terms that are triggering the clicks. You could exclude a search term that may well convert if triggered by a better product offering.<\/p>\n<h3>4. It is harder to control branded product search terms for brands that you sell, than products that you don\u2019t sell.<\/h3>\n<p>Brand searches for brands that you sell, but products within made by that brand will trigger impressions and clicks and you won\u2019t be able to easily prevent this.<\/p>\n<p>For example: if you sell Swan kettles but not Swan fridges or Swan freezers and sell other brands of dishwashers, you will have to work harder on your negative keywords compared to splitting out the product categories, product brands or even product SKUs into separate Ad Groups.<\/p>\n<p>With tens of thousands of products and hundreds of brands within one Ad Group, this simple issue could become a significant problem.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Controlling and excluding poor performing products is more time consuming with hundreds or thousands of products within one Ad Group.<\/h3>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1a5d520a-c421-43d4-8e88-f7a6db44c86f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-structure-a-shopping-campaign-in-adwords.jpg\" alt=\"campaign structure for ecommerce ppc accounts\" width=\"796\" height=\"312\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>6.
