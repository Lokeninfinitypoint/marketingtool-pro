Why? Because trust cannot be bought; it must be earned.<\/p>\n<p>However, building and maintaining customer trust is about far more than increasing sales. A company\u2019s trustworthiness is a fundamental part of its identity. Even today, when <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/06\/online-reputation-management\">reputation management<\/a> firms craft carefully constructed public relations campaigns for the most disreputable companies, trust is one of the few commodities that is not for sale.<\/p>\n<h3>Seeing Is Believing<\/h3>\n<p>Last year, customer experience research firm Temkin Group conducted an extensive survey to gauge which were <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dmnews.com\/which-brands-are-the-most-and-least-trusted\/article\/345811\/\">the most and least trusted companies in America<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d41f9705-42e5-4a87-a09f-00748c6a7ee0\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-testimonials-temkin-group.png\" alt=\"Customer testimonials most trusted companies in America\" width=\"528\" height=\"731\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via Temkin Group<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Financial services giant USAA took the top honors in the top three categories \u2013 Banks, Insurance Carriers, and Credit Cards, with consumer trust ratings of between 80-85%.

Comcast, <a href=\"http:\/\/consumerist.com\/2014\/04\/08\/congratulations-to-comcast-your-2014-worst-company-in-america\/\">one of the most hated companies in the United States<\/a>, managed to rank among the least-trusted brands in not one but two categories \u2013 TV Service and Internet Service, both of which are its core product offerings.

This is a PR problem that no sum of money can solve, and serves as a valuable lesson in the importance of trust and its influence on a brand\u2019s image.<\/p>\n<h2>Social Signals as a Selling Tool<\/h2>\n<p>Despite the fact that consumers are more savvy than ever before, the Internet is still rife with poor-quality products, con artists, and blatant scams using falsified customer testimonials to peddle their wares. You know the type \u2013 \u201cglowing\u201d testimonials like this:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"25f15588-f6dc-49d3-929f-c3efdb87cce9\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-testimonials-fakes.png\" alt=\"Customer testimonials fakes\" width=\"505\" height=\"341\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Results may vary.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>You might think that the fact that these testimonials are obviously bogus means that all customer testimonials are equally useless. However, this is most definitely not the case, because more and more companies are turning to social validation to add credibility to their <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/27\/trust-signals\">trust signals<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Social trust signals are incredibly powerful for two reasons. Firstly, the authenticity that <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/10\/social-proof-guide\">social proof<\/a> offers is almost invaluable to marketers. Simply <strong>using real responses from real people<\/strong> in your marketing materials can go a long way toward not just persuading prospective customers of your product or service\u2019s value, but demonstrates that your company has actual, flesh-and-blood fans that are ready and willing to say great things about you \u2013 not falsified testimonials from imaginary customers.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"840f5f61-a523-49c3-a746-783bd3bc2d89\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-testimonials-zappos-facebook.png\" alt=\"Customer testimonials Zappos Facebook \" width=\"884\" height=\"328\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The second reason why social proof is such a powerful marketing tool is because social media is where a vast amount of people\u2019s interaction with a brand takes place.<\/p>\n<p>Today\u2019s consumers live and breathe social media, making the inclusion of social proof a logical choice for brands hoping to attract followers (and ultimately, brand evangelists) from an environment with which they\u2019re already comfortable and intimately familiar. The fact that brands can also easily demonstrate that they\u2019re aware of and actively responding to fans\u2019 social interactions at the same time is a major bonus, and further contributes to positive perceptions of the brand.<\/p>\n<h2>Types of Customer Testimonials<\/h2>\n<p>Although customer testimonials are often very similar in content, there are several distinct types of testimonial, each of which offers brands something different. Let\u2019s take a look at each of these types in more detail, as well as the benefits of using each.<\/p>\n<h3>The Social Media Interaction<\/h3>\n<p>The first type of customer testimonial is the social media interaction.<\/p>\n<p>Many brands use this as their primary format of customer testimonial because of its inherently organic, natural \u201cfeel.\u201d Captured from social media accounts \u201cin the wild,\u201d these testimonials are often reproduced as-is, with no fancy formatting applied and no editing of the message. Oftentimes, they\u2019re pulled directly from Facebook or Twitter.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"827c9107-a4e8-4d7d-a819-6ff2cbe8db96\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-testimonials-social-media-interaction.png\" alt=\"Customer testimonials social media interaction\" width=\"401\" height=\"316\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The example above is a social media interaction that was pulled from the Facebook News Feed of fashion retailer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.verrierboutique.com\/\">Verrier Handcrafted<\/a>. The Facebook comment references a specific experience the customer had with a specific product, and highlights just how happy she was with her purchase.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s short, gets right to the point, and has nothing but praise for the quality of the garment. Notice how the customer freely offers to provide Verrier Handcrafted with a more detailed customer testimonial without any prompting from the retailer.<\/p>\n<p>This example goes to show how effective focusing on quality and customer service can be, and the power that a simple comment on Facebook can have.<\/p>\n<h3>The \u2018Industry Insider\u2019 Testimonial<\/h3>\n<p>Another common form of customer testimonial is the \u201cindustry insider\u201d testimonial. Similar to a testimonial from a typical customer, these testimonials feature the opinions of a respected individual or thought leader within a given industry.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"da85c1d8-2a18-46f1-9a39-ffd049214fdd\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-testimonials-shopify.png\" alt=\"Customer testimonials thought leader\" width=\"713\" height=\"269\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>This type of testimonial is ideal for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/07\/18\/b2b-ppc-guide\">B2B companies<\/a>, because it not only leverages the power of a typical testimonial, but also capitalizes on the knowledge and expertise of the individual featured. This is also an excellent opportunity to highlight the brands that are among your satisfied customers, as HubSpot does in this example:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"70c97a35-c98a-4b61-a719-a66a3991f4f9\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-testimonials-groove.png\" alt=\"Customer testimonials HubSpot Groove\" width=\"841\" height=\"357\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>The \u2018Satisfied Customer\u2019 Testimonial<\/h3>\n<p>The structure and format of the \u201csatisfied customer\u201d testimonial will be instantly familiar to most people \u2013 a quote from the customer explaining why the product or service is so great, an image of the person, and their name.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"85666ff7-488e-42e5-a8e6-953fb7701f89\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-testimonials-helpscout.png\" alt=\"Customer testimonials Help Scout\" width=\"983\" height=\"360\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The examples above, from helpdesk software provider Help Scout, don\u2019t include job titles, but that doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 these testimonials are supposed to be digested quickly, and focus on the praise, not the person\u2019s position.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to use this type of testimonial in your marketing materials, it\u2019s <em>essential<\/em> to include an image of the customer being quoted. Without a picture, it\u2019s virtually impossible for the prospect to form a connection with the individual, which dilutes any impact the testimonial itself might have had.<\/p>\n<p>There are other ways you can incorporate trust signals into satisfied customer testimonials. Email marketing tool provider AWeber states how long each individual featured in its testimonials has been a customer, providing the prospect with an at-a-glance view of how long AWeber\u2019s user lifecycle can be:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"557240ca-5f0f-4cc9-887f-2f1443263770\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-testimonials-aweber-lifecycle.png\" alt=\"Customer testimonials customer lifecycle\" width=\"1068\" height=\"604\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>The Video Testimonial<\/h3>\n<p>More and more companies are using video to highlight their customer testimonials. Yes, the overhead involved in actually <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/05\/marketing-videos\">producing videos<\/a> is higher, but the results can be well worth the effort.<\/p>\n<p>One of the major benefits of video testimonials is that they deviate pretty radically from typical testimonials, offering brands much more creative license to show how<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/14\/goal-talk-episode-10\"> happy their customers are<\/a>. Video testimonials go far beyond the usual quotes to offer the prospect a glimpse at how users are actually interacting with the product. They also offer an incredible opportunity for prospects to connect with the satisfied customer on a completely different level.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Use Customer Testimonials<\/h2>\n<p>Before you throw any old quotes onto your homepage, think about what you want the inclusion of testimonials to actually accomplish.<\/p>\n<h3>Put the Customer First<\/h3>\n<p>Before you do anything, approach your website from the perspective of a would-be customer.<\/p>\n<p>Think about what brought them to your site in the first place; a PPC ad, a social promotion, an organic search result. Although each prospect&#8217;s journey will be different, the desired result is the same \u2013 they want you to make their lives better by solving a problem.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5a694605-afff-4160-acd7-26120c34ccc0\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-testimonials-user-intent.png\" alt=\"Customer testimonials user intent\" width=\"865\" height=\"343\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/lessaccounting.com\/\"><em>Less Accounting<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\">Considering <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/30\/commercial-intent-keywords\">the intent of prospective customers<\/a> is crucial, because once you understand why people are coming to your site, you can start thinking about how customer testimonials can be used as a trust signal.<\/p>\n<p>Are you operating in a crowded market with numerous competing products? A well-positioned testimonial can emphasize your commitment to customer service (or whatever your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/07\/unique-selling-proposition\">unique selling proposition<\/a> happens to be). Does your product or service carry greater perceived risk? A testimonial can offset would-be customers\u2019 hesitation and preemptively address common concerns.<\/p>\n<h3>Highlight Your Perfect Customers<\/h3>\n<p>Just as marketers are always pursuing the \u201cperfect\u201d prospect, your testimonials should highlight your perfect customers.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a7f57da0-2eb8-409a-a708-50f98ca6427f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-testimonials-ideal-customers.jpg\" alt=\"Customer testimonials highlight ideal customers\" width=\"571\" height=\"547\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.helpscout.net\/blog\/customer-testimonials\/\"><em>Help Scout<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Think of customer testimonials as an opportunity to show prospects who your ideal customer is. If your product or service is aimed at women who run small businesses with less than 10 employees, feature someone who matches these criteria in your customer testimonials.<\/p>\n<p>This technique also has the potential for prospects to identify with your existing customers more strongly; if they see someone just like them happily using your product, they\u2019ll be much more likely to envision themselves being happy using it because we unconsciously identify with people who are like us. An added bonus of using this technique is that it subtly tells your prospects that you\u2019re familiar with your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/18\/beginners-guide-to-target-markets\">target market<\/a> and understand the needs of people just like them.<\/p>\n<h3>Emphasize Your USP<\/h3>\n<p>Customer testimonials can be very powerful, but it isn\u2019t enough to simply have a few of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/18\/loyalty-marketing\">your most loyal fans<\/a> gush about how happy they are \u2013 you need to include reasons why prospects should choose <em>your<\/em> business over another. The best way to do this is incorporate your USP into your customer testimonials.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6b5569fc-a5fb-4707-b43d-49e81e3fb32c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-testimonials-unique-selling-proposition.png\" alt=\"Customer testimonials highlight USP\" width=\"812\" height=\"537\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Ideally, this is something that your existing customers will do on their own, without being prompted. After all, there is probably at least one reason your customers have chosen to do business with you rather than a competitor. Use this as the basis for your customer testimonials.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever sets you apart from the competition \u2013 whether it\u2019s your commitment to amazing customer service or a genuinely innovative feature that no other company can match \u2013 make it obvious in the testimonials you choose to feature.<\/p>\n<h3>Focus on a Different Selling Point in Each Testimonial<\/h3>\n<p>Most businesses do at least one thing really well. Zappos, for instance, is famed for its commitment to providing exceptional customer service. However, some companies excel at not just one, but several things. If your brand can boast several reasons why your customers are so happy, focus on each of these selling points in a different testimonial.<\/p>\n<p>This approach does more than allow you to convey several aspects of your product or service to prospective customers. It avoids repetition, which can still be perceived negatively even when focusing on positive qualities, and adds dimension to your brand. After all, how many people do you need to explain that your customer service is awesome?<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"0c429d84-3b34-4bff-995a-ddcabe32f6fb\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-testimonials-several-selling-points.png\" alt=\"Customer testimonials focus on several selling points\" width=\"770\" height=\"146\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Focusing on numerous selling points across several testimonials also lets you preemptively address more than one potential objection your prospects might have. This can be especially effective if your product is more complex, or has numerous benefits that may not be immediately obvious (SaaS companies, I\u2019m looking at you).<\/p>\n<h3>Let Your Products Do the Talking<\/h3>\n<p>My final tip on how to use customer testimonials won\u2019t work for everyone. It might even seem outright counterintuitive to some of you. However, eschewing the typical testimonial in favor of a more unorthodox approach may be many times more effective than even the most positive <a href=\"\/reviews\">customer review<\/a> or a quote lavishing your company with praise. One brand that utilizes this technique to great effect is Saddleback Leather.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve talked about Saddleback\u2019s remarkable approach to marketing before, and I\u2019m just as impressed with the brand\u2019s approach to customer testimonials as I am with it\u2019s almost unbelievable 100-year \u201cThey\u2019ll fight over it when you\u2019re dead\u201d warranty.<\/p>\n<p>Although Saddleback\u2019s customer testimonials <em>do<\/em> feature a quote from a satisfied customer, most of them don\u2019t include an image of the customer themselves.
