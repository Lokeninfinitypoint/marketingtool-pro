And, so far, it doesn\u2019t look much different than December 2019. That\u2019s why we asked dozens of digital marketers for their best marketing strategies of last year\u2014and, boy, did they deliver.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a look at what tops the list for marketing experts\u00a02019\u2014and what we think are the 16 best marketing strategies you can take into 2020.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Educate with your content<\/h2>\n<p>Content has long been king and 2019 was no different.<\/p>\n<p>Citing figures from the Content Marketing Institute\u2019s 2019 trends report, Robin Barendsen, head of digital marketing at office space rental company WehaveAnyspace, noted 77% of B2B marketers use content marketing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn fact, the majority of B2B content marketers use educational assets to nurture leads and build audience trust, which is absolutely essential for inbound marketing,\u201d he said. \u201cThink about informational blogs, white papers or quizzes.\u201d<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-marketing-strategies-educational-content.jpg\" alt=\"best marketing strategies graph of types of content \" width=\"750\" height=\"527\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/contentmarketinginstitute.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/2020_B2B_Research_Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re likely preaching to the choir here, but, generally speaking, brands should create content that is relevant, authoritative and, of course, educates its audience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RELATED:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/12\/13\/best-worst-marketing-campaigns\">The 20 Best (and Worst!) Marketing Campaigns of 2021<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>2. Personalize your marketing messages<\/h2>\n<p>Peter Wilfahrt, managing director of digital agency Versandgigant, said marketers should personalize every single message in 2020 by digging into analytics and understanding demographics, affinity categories and in-market segments. More on that in a moment.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOnly very few brands execute a personalized messaging strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not talking about adding the first name to your email greeting \u2026 really dig into your prospect\u2019s mind and discover what they fear, wish and want.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While Brock\u00a0Murray, COO of digital marketing agency seoplus+, agrees consumers should be made to feel special, he argues automation is the way to go because it allows advertisers to create ads that dynamically change based on whoever is searching. And, Murray said, results show consumers want this type of customization.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/linkedin-advertising-elevate.jpg\" alt=\"LinkedIn Elevate\" width=\"880\" height=\"530\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cWith that being said, timeliness also proved to be a critical part of any strategy as users proved they still don&#8217;t want to be bombarded with content, particularly if it isn&#8217;t even relevant to them,\u201d Murray added. \u201cOverall, all of your content and markup should be concise and easily understandable to ensure your users receive value with each interaction. Transparency and respect of users\u2019 privacy should also be a critical component of any digital marketing strategy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Frank Spear, content marketer at WordPress contest plugin RafflePress, said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/06\/personalized-marketing\">personalization<\/a> boosted his marketing strategy far beyond his expectations in 2019.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe tried to implement personalized content in virtually every aspect of our strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cOur opt-in ads change based on the content users read before the\u00a0popup was triggered. The relatable promotion is designed to show consumers that we understand their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/28\/pain-points\">pain points<\/a> and want to help.

Let data drive your creative<\/h2>\n<p>According to Natalia Wulfe, CMO of digital marketing agency Effective Spend, platforms like Google and Facebook are taking control more control of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/15\/audience-targeting\">audience targeting<\/a> as they simultaneously move away from manual bidding capabilities. Meanwhile, their algorithms have become adept at understanding which ad images and copy will drive the best click-through and conversion rates.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-conversion-rate-benchmarks_0-1.png\" alt=\"google-ads-conversion-rate-benchmark-data\" width=\"764\" height=\"895\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cWith these shifts, we\u2019ve seen creative emerging as a serious performance driver, carrying equal weight to other key drivers like placement selection and audience targeting,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, Effective Spend overhauled its creative design process to incorporate a data-first approach.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe analyze the performance metrics of existing creative, identify where the gaps are, and then design new creative that directly impacts those poor performing metrics,\u201d she added.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Invest in original research<\/h2>\n<p>One of the best marketing strategies of 2010 was investing in original research.<\/p>\n<p>Tamas Torok, head of online marketing at Javascript development company Coding Sans, said Coding Sans has been publishing its own research on software development trends since 2017, and these reports have generated links from reputable websites and yielded thousands of subscribers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis strategy worked because we came up with something new,\u201d he said. \u201cNew data attracted links and it was beautifully presented, which made people share it on social media.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Coding Sans plans to publish at least three new reports with original research in 2020.<\/p>\n<p>Matthew Zajechowski, outreach team lead at digital marketing agency Digital Third Coast, agreed using proprietary data to create <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/05\/longform-content\">long-form content<\/a> with graphics has been an effective 2019 strategy, resulting in backlinks from thousands of high-authority publications.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPublishers want new story angles to cover on a subject even if they\u2019ve covered it a billion times before,\u201d he added. \u201cHaving proprietary data allows us to have that unique angle and presenting it with graphics makes it easy for them to share. We look for writers and publications who cover that subject and present it to them as new research or a study.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>5. Update your content<\/h2>\n<p>And don\u2019t forget the content you\u2019ve already published.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, Cyrus Yung, co-founder of SEO company Ascelade, said updating old content is a strategy that has served Ascelade well as Google has a freshness ranking factor and most sites eventually see content decay.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey have old articles that have ranked well previously and have attracted backlinks, but the search traffic for that particular article is on a downward trend,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Mark Webster, co-founder of online marketing education company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.authorityhacker.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Authority Hacker<\/a>, said 2019 was the year Authority Hacker focused on this tactic of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/03\/repurposing-content\">refreshing older content<\/a> instead of just pumping out new, high quality content.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAfter some testing, we found that making simple updates and tweaks and, most importantly, changing the date of the article to represent the newest revision [made] our rankings instantly [jump] up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt&#8217;s no secret Google prefers fresh content but we had not anticipated this to be such an easy win.\u201d<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-marketing-strategies-updated-content.jpg\" alt=\"best marketing strategies updated content example\" width=\"886\" height=\"243\" \/><\/div>\n<p>What\u2019s more, it\u2019s cheaper to refresh old content, so Webster this small technique a \u201chuge win.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Jeroen Minks of PPC agency Vazooky Digital, too, called updating existing website content \u201cone of the best and most successful marketing strategies that I [used] last year.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBy going through each article and page individually and [updating] them, I have seen a big increase in organic rankings which have led to more website traffic and new customers,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of the content optimization was to involve other experts in my articles, which led to more external links and a better social media presence.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>6. Try subscribing to HARO<\/h2>\n<p>Another popular 2019 strategy was responding to queries from journalists on services like Help A Reporter Out (HARO), as they are constantly looking for experts in a range of fields.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, Olga Mykhoparkina, CMO of chat platform Chanty, called answering HARO queries \u201cby far the best marketing activity we\u2019ve done this year\u201d\u2014more so than even guest blogging and fixing broken links.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s because Chanty gets an average of five to ten links a week by responding to relevant queries.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-marketing-strategies-HARO-tweet.jpg\" alt=\"best marketing strategies HARO twitter\" width=\"706\" height=\"307\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>An example HARO request from Twitter.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve come up with a methodology to pick the best and most relevant queries, send timely answers to them and, in the vast majority of cases, we\u2019ve gotten backlinks from high authority websites,\u201d she said. That list includes outlets such as American Express, Forbes, CMSWire, and Inc.com.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs a result, we\u2019ve grown our organic traffic and our domain authority has noticeably increased in a matter of just a few months,\u201d she added.<\/p>\n<p>Vartika Kashyap, marketing manager at project management software firm Proofhub, agreed, noting HARO has been a great source of authoritative backlinks and has helped boost content ranks.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd do you know what the best part is?\u201d asked Alexandra Zamolo, head of content marketing at communications platform <a href=\"https:\/\/www.beekeeper.io\/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Beekeeper<\/a>. \u201cIt&#8217;s absolutely free. All it takes is a little bit of your time to craft a few well-written quotes every day that apply to your industry.

Expand your guest blogging opportunities<\/h2>\n<p>Another way to expand your reach? Allow more people to create content for your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/01\/brand-strategy\">brand<\/a> through guest blogging. Pamela Bourgault, a digital marketing specialist at digital marketing and social media reporting platform DashThis, said DashThis has scaled its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/26\/content-promotion-strategies\">content strategy<\/a> by allowing clients to contribute to its blog.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis type of strategy is ideal for both of us since they can use this guest post contribution to leverage their expertise and we can use their knowledge to leverage our blog as a resource for relevant information and lead generation,\u201d she added. \u201cIn most cases, these articles bring in a lot of organic traffic and promising leads for us. We have some articles that our clients have written that still to this day bring in over 200+ leads per month.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>8. Use more video (again)<\/h2>\n<p>Video remained a popular digital marketing tactic in 2019, and it\u2019s a must marketing strategy for this year, too.<\/p>\n<p>Stuart Leung, vice president of marketing for vaping brand Breazy, said videos forge stronger bonds with consumers, which, in turn, makes them more likely to purchase a product. Options include tutorials, testimonials and behind-the-scenes footage.<\/p>\n<p>Case in point: Chris Savage, CEO of video software company Wistia, said Wistia has paid close attention to the rise of streaming platforms and has seen more and more businesses take a page from the Netflix playbook, creating longer-form original content to build brand affinity.\u00a0That\u2019s why Wistia created its own late-night-style talk show, Brandwagon.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThroughout the series, I talk with some of the top minds in the marketing world to learn the secrets behind some of their biggest successes,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, we welcome some unexpected special guests and our team even buys a \u201991 wagon to transform into the ultimate Brandwagon along the way.\u201d<\/p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/8yvmtMpQS0A?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Wistia used social media to advertise trailers and clips and allows viewers to binge watch the entire show, resulting in a steady increase in brand search volume and an increase in overall time spent with the brand, Savage said.<\/p>\n<h2>9. Livestream<\/h2>\n<p>Morgan Lathaen, marketing specialist at printing company Thumbprint, noted livestreaming was on the rise in 2019 and will continue to dominate in 2020 because it is free, takes a short amount of time to produce, reaches a broader target audience, and offers authentic user engagement.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith that, live content has the ability to generate greater impressions than posts published in newsfeeds,\u201d she added.<\/p>\n<h2>10. Try explainer videos<\/h2>\n<p>Another option for video content is explainers. That\u2019s what Raj Vardhman, editor-in-chief of remote work resource GoRemotely.net, said his site opted to do in 2019 to make complex concepts easier to understand.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Google algorithm continues to favor websites with video content, which makes these incredibly important both for marketing and SEO,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>Larissa Murillo, Marketing Manager at SEO and website marketing tool Marketgoo, said Marketgoo took this one step further by creating a course for online learning platform Udemy that was more educational than promotional.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-marketing-strategies-udemy-course.jpg\" alt=\"best marketing strategies Udemy courses example\" width=\"795\" height=\"419\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cThe idea behind this tactic was to build brand awareness of our SEO tool and use the course to teach basic SEO and how to use our tool to help with that effort,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>While conceding the attribution for signups was tricky because students were typing in URLs rather than clicking on links, Murillo said another advantage was the videos were reusable in other capacities, like blog posts.<\/p>\n<h2>11. Host or join podcasts<\/h2>\n<p>Digital marketing consultant <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ryanscollon.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ryan Scollon<\/a> called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/05\/podcast-advertising\">podcasts<\/a> \u201ca real breakthrough in 2019\u201d with a surge of shows in digital marketing in particular.<\/p>\n<p>Marketers can appear as guests on established podcasts or start their own, both of which Scollon said offer huge benefits with few downsides.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPodcasts are a great way at building a solid audience that returns every week without having to have your face in front of the camera,\u201d he said. \u201cIt&#8217;s also a great way for repurposing content that you may already have on your blog.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Stacy Caprio, founder of Accelerated Growth Marketing, said appearing on podcasts has been one of her most effective marketing strategies of 2019 because it has driven site traffic and brand awareness.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/podbay-top-podcasts.png\" alt=\"best podcasts for advertising\" width=\"815\" height=\"885\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cThe trick is to go on \u2026\u00a0podcasts\u00a0that have devoted audiences in your own niche, so the audience interest overlaps with your own,\u201d she said. \u201cThis works well when the podcaster has a large audience that trust them implicitly and will take their interviewing of you as an endorsement that they want to check out on their own.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>12. Prioritize local SEO<\/h2>\n<p>According to <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Dan Rice, marketing manager at recruiting firm Talent Locker, the most effective strategy in 2019 was optimizing and prioritizing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/27\/google-my-business\">Google My Business<\/a>, the free tool that allows businesses to manage their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/17\/increase-online-presence\/\">online presence<\/a> across Google, including search and maps.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-my-business-local-search.png\" alt=\"google-my-business-local-search\" width=\"638\" height=\"570\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u201cWe have used this as part of a wide-ranging digital marketing campaign designed to raise awareness of the brand and brand name,\u201d he said. \u201cThrough steadily producing posts, updates and actually helping drive people to our Google My Business listing, we have been getting strong results \u2026 it doesn\u2019t just appear to be helping <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/seo\/whats-difference-between-organic-seo-and-local-seo\/\">local SEO<\/a>, it is also highly significant in driving searches on brand names, too.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Digital marketing consultant Leslie Whittaker agreed, noting while most businesses have claimed a Google My Business listing, only a small percentage have optimized it. Plus, Google continually adds new features and many businesses aren\u2019t even aware they exist, which means they are missing out on opportunities to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/01\/lead-generation-ideas\">drive leads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/localiq-grader?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium\"><b><i>How strong is your online presence?

Another, a dermatologist with a new practice in Long Island and a new listing, has appeared 8900 times in search results and has received 280 site visits from said listing, along with 300 phone calls.<\/p>\n<p>Erin Sparks, CEO of digital marketing firm Site Strategics, said the new real estate from Google, along with lead funnel functionality, shows it wants customers to interact with its properties first, which is why Google is giving businesses the tools to connect with said customers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFrom the Get a Quote functionality to Custom Service Menus to the relatively new Google Guaranteed Local Service Ads, it is clear that Google wants you to interact with the customer as quickly as possible with its tools,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>Learn local SEO with the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/local-marketing-lab\/seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free Local SEO course in Marketing Lab<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h2>13. Set up automated email marketing campaigns<\/h2>\n<p>Maciej Baranowski, manager of customer engagement at career advice website ResumeLab, said ResumeLab started automating its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/03\/email-marketing-best-practices\">email marketing<\/a> campaigns in 2019, which was a \u201cresounding success.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s because the company can send almost four times as many newsletters, which more than compensated for the initial drop in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/19\/conversion-rate-benchmarks\">conversion rates<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIdeally, we want both, but math tells us that the tradeoff was more than worth it and we\u2019ve been surging ever since,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Automated email also allows for better customization with A\/B testing, infographics, sequences, time zones and CTA buttons, as well as data-backed optimization.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-marketing-strategies-automated-email-marketing.jpg\" alt=\"benefits of automated email marketing graph\" width=\"650\" height=\"407\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.emailmonday.com\/marketing-automation-statistics-overview\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith each subsequent week, we\u2019re getting smarter about what the ideal newsletter looks like,\u201d Baranowski said. \u201cIn the end, the juice was more than worth the squeeze. The transition pains have yielded a much smoother, smarter and efficient approach that we look forward to fine-tuning further.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>14. Prepare for voice technology<\/h2>\n<p>Continuing a trend from prior years, voice search was once again on marketers\u2019 minds in 2019.<\/p>\n<p>That includes chatbots, which Paige Arnof-Fenn, CEO of marketing consulting firm Mavens &amp; Moguls, noted cut costs and convert visitors into leads by answering FAQs, as well as optimizing for voice queries and long-tail keywords. Again.<\/p>\n<p>Arnof-Fenn said the latter will be key to maximize marketing and advertising opportunities via voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI predict that the brands that perfect the branded skill with more customer-friendly [and] less invasive ads are going to win big,\u201d she added.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-voice-search-uses.jpg\" alt=\"Google Voice Search uses data\" width=\"536\" height=\"600\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/googleblog.blogspot.com\/2014\/10\/omg-mobile-voice-survey-reveals-teens.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Faizan Ali, who does PR for WordPress resource site WPBeginner, said adding semantics and optimizing content for voice searches yielded a lot of featured snippets for WPBeginner, which helped increase traffic by 37% in 2019.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, Alexander Kehoe, operations director of web design firm Caveni Digital Solutions, said Caveni is using natural language\u00a0processing to\u00a0assess\u00a0the quality of its own human\u00a0contributors and create more value\u00a0for customers.<\/p>\n<h2>15. Test out augmented reality<\/h2>\n<p>Extending the personalization trend, <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Polly Kay, senior marketing manager at window treatment retailer English Blinds, said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/04\/interactive-content\">interactive content <\/a>that allows customers to preview products paid off well in 2019.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>For English Blinds, that means rolling out a tool <span lang=\"EN-GB\">for prospects to upload pictures of their home interiors to create window treatment designs to see how they\u2019d look.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis idea initially came from my seeing hair design websites in which women were able to upload a picture of their face and see how it would look with different hair styles overlaid to it,\u201d she said. \u201cThis proved to be hugely successful for us during testing, for many reasons.
