And every year, we find that Facebook ads remain one of the best investments in the digital marketing biz. They continually cost less per click and per lead, and those prices stay more stable than Google Ads.<\/p>\n<p>That said, we still see many businesses overspend on Facebook ads. With all the customizations and targeting options, it\u2019s easy to make mistakes (and miss opportunities).<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t want that to happen to you. So I\u2019ve asked several very experienced Facebook ad pros for their best advice to get more leads and waste fewer dollars on the platform.<\/p>\n<p>These aren\u2019t hypotheticals.

Don\u2019t fear \u201cugly\u201d ads<\/h3>\n<p>People have developed pretty good internal ad filters. When we see a shiny, slick ad in our Facebook feed, we skip right past it. The solution, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/alexandra-greifeld-18507411\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alexandra Greifeld<\/a>, an <a href=\"https:\/\/dtcfashiondecoded.com\/newsletter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eCom Growth Advisor<\/a>, is \u201cugly ads.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAn \u2018ugly ad\u2019 is anything that looks like platform-native content on Meta, i.e. an ad that looks like a photo or video shot by a real person, not a marketer,\u201d she explained in a recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/posts\/alexandra-greifeld-18507411_ugly-ads-creative-directors-hate-them-activity-7226596371993108480-kiwQ?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn post<\/a>. \u201cUgly ads bypass this filter because we clock them as organic content. So we\u2019re more likely to pay attention to the content of the photo\/video.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I wanted to see what Alexandra considers to be a good \u201cugly\u201d ad, and she sent me this example.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Facebood-ad-tactics-wordstream-ugly-ad-double.webp\" alt=\"Facebook ad tactics - Screenshots from a Facebook video ad.\" width=\"478\" height=\"554\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85195 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Facebood-ad-tactics-wordstream-ugly-ad-double.webp 478w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Facebood-ad-tactics-wordstream-ugly-ad-double-259x300.webp 259w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cUgly ads\u201d look like organic content, so Facebook users don\u2019t automatically filter them out as advertisements.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The video looks like something any of us could make\u2014no special lighting or graphics. Just a young woman talking about how \u201ccrazy\u201d it is that one of her tea cups is stained while the other isn&#8217;t. The woman explains that the cleaner cup was a happy accident after changing to a less-toxic dishwashing detergent (which she only shows at the very end).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis content doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be aesthetically offensive, but it can be,\u201d Alexandra said. \u201cThe key is making content that feels authentic and doesn\u2019t feel overproduced. Does the average Meta user know about the rule of thirds? Nope.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She typically sees much higher CTRs for \u201ca good \u2018ugly ad\u2019 that truly appears to be platform native.\u201d And, in fact, \u201cIf you\u2019re in a category with low CTRs (cough\u2026supplements), or you are hitting a wall in terms of ROAS, \u2018ugly ads\u2019 can help you break through,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>But don\u2019t expect your ROAS to go through the roof just because you served up a gritty, not-pretty video, Alexandra warned. \u201cDoes that mean that \u2018ugly ads\u2019 always perform? Nope. You have to convert that extra attention; the content of the ad has to be good\u2014either selling the product or selling the click.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The trick, she said, is to find the balance between realism and poor representation. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to make the product look bad, but you want to make it look as \u2018real\u2019 as possible. People know that eCom photos are heavily doctored. They want to know how your product is really going to look when they try it on.\u201d<\/p>\n<div id=\"feature-people-not-just-products\"><\/div>\n<h3>2.

Not bad, but not the best they could get.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe decided to refresh the advertising and created a short video of a team member talking through one of the product packs,\u201d Ann-Marie said. \u201cThis advert talked directly to their ideal customer, showing a more personal side to the business by meeting the butcher himself, thus building trust for the brand.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Facebood-ad-tactics-wordstream-butcher-ad.webp\" alt=\"Facebook ad tactics - Facebook ad for a butcher shop.\" width=\"843\" height=\"392\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85196 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Facebood-ad-tactics-wordstream-butcher-ad.webp 843w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Facebood-ad-tactics-wordstream-butcher-ad-480x223.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 843px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Your people, not your products, build brand trust on social media.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It was the same type of product shown in the static-image ad. <strong>But by creating an authentic, relatable experience featuring the people behind the brand, the business netted a huge jump in results.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis particular advert increased the ROAS to 12 within a week of going live, and current sales to date are 97% up on the previous period for the month of August,\u201d Ann-Marie said.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Facebood-ad-tactics-wordstream-ab-testin-1.webp\" alt=\"Facebook ad tactics - Graph of ad results.\" width=\"865\" height=\"479\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85198 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Facebood-ad-tactics-wordstream-ab-testin-1.webp 865w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Facebood-ad-tactics-wordstream-ab-testin-1-480x266.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 865px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The relatable video ad on Facebook helped the brand nearly double sales.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is important to talk in the language your customer would use and address the problem they have that your product or service solves,\u201d Ann-Marie added.<\/p>\n<p>There are three things Ann-Marie said you\u2019ll need to know to make this strategy work:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Know who you\u2019re selling to:<\/strong> \u201cThere is a process we go through to ensure the client really understands who the target audience is.\u201d (This guide will help you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">find your target audience<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Know the buyer\u2019s journey:<\/strong> \u201cUnderstand where the customer is in their buying journey and create campaigns that guide them seamlessly through the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/19\/customer-journey-map-templates\">funnel<\/a> from awareness to conversion.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Know how to test:<\/strong> \u201cContinual testing of different audiences at different stages of the funnel with different creatives and text is vital.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Ann-Marie gave me two additional tips to make these ads more successful. \u201cAt the moment, we are finding that short-form text is working better than long-form,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd where possible, include a five-star <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/facebook-reviews\">review<\/a>; this again builds trust and authority for the brand.\u201d<\/p>\n<div id=\"get-more-savvy-about-data\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Get more savvy about data<\/h3>\n<p>Over the last few years, we\u2019ve seen a significantly heightened focus on privacy and data protection. For Ann-Marie, that\u2019s an area brands need to put an increased focus on. \u201cThe introduction of policies like Apple&#8217;s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) has limited the scope of user data available for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/facebook-ad-targeting\">ad targeting<\/a>. As a result, advertisers need to pivot their strategies.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She called out three steps Facebook advertisers should take to improve how they collect, analyze, and use data.<\/p>\n<h4>Collect first-party data like its gold nuggets<\/h4>\n<p>Even though Google <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-privacy-sandbox-update\">rescinded its plan<\/a> to sunset third-party cookies, it\u2019s still harder than ever to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/customer-data\">collect data<\/a> (which is a huge plus for online privacy!).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt Purple Octopus Marketing, we&#8217;ve adapted by placing greater emphasis on first-party data collection,\u201d Ann-Marie said. \u201cWe encourage our clients to build robust customer data platforms (CDPs) and leverage tools such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/24\/facebook-lead-ad-examples\">lead generation forms within Facebook<\/a> to collect data directly from users, ensuring compliance while maintaining <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/scale-meta-ads-with-first-party-data\">effective targeting<\/a>.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>Don\u2019t rely on one source of analytics<\/h4>\n<p>Meta\u2019s platform offers a pretty robust suite of analytics reporting, but you can\u2019t always trust its conversion data. \u201cDue to the privacy issue, we request access to the [client\u2019s] ecommerce platform to measure the results,\u201d Ann-Marie said. \u201cWe have found that there has been approximately a 20% drop off in recorded sales on Facebook vs. what has actually been generated via the website.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So if you\u2019re running <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/facebook-learning-phase\">Facebook ads<\/a>, make sure to check the direct online sales data from your website and compare it to what you get from Meta.<\/p>\n<h4>Use data to improve sales and service<\/h4>\n<p>Ann-Marie said that Facebook ad data has uses beyond <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/27\/facebook-ad-targeting-options-infographic\">ad targeting<\/a> and testing. \u201cWe also use an app called Zapier to share lead data collected within the Facebook platform with the client so they can respond to it quickly.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For example, one of her clients likes to receive text messages with the lead information so they can immediately call the potential customer. Another one has their Facebook lead data pushed to a Google doc, where they can monitor all of their leads in one place.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udce3 <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt; <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/online-marketing-tips?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_130marketingtips_Download\">130 of the Best Online Marketing Tips for Generating More Traffic, Leads, &amp; Sales<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"use-facebooks-dynamic-ad-features\"><\/div>\n<h3>4.

To counter this, we regularly monitor our ad frequency and use Facebook\u2019s tools to cap the number of times an individual sees the ad within a set period.\u201d The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/audience-overlap-tool\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook Ads Audience Overlap Tool<\/a> can help here.<\/p>\n<p>Just by adding frequency caps, Jordan gets an average <strong>12% decrease in cost per conversion <\/strong>and keeps those audiences engaged and interested.<\/p>\n<div id=\"use-the-engagement-purchase-scale-method\"><\/div>\n<h3>5.

Ashley describes this as her \u201cfavorite tactic and most profitable strategy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how it works. She starts by running ads that warm up the audience. \u201cThis engagement campaign can be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/facebook-reviews\">client reviews<\/a> about the company, results, offers, guarantees, etc.,\u201d she said. \u201cAnything that will make someone stop the scroll and engage.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Facebood-ad-tactics-wordstream-review.webp\" alt=\"Facebook ad tactics - Facebook ad with social proof.\" width=\"421\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85201 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Facebood-ad-tactics-wordstream-review.webp 421w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Facebood-ad-tactics-wordstream-review-211x300.webp 211w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Make a big deal out of positive customer reviews in both engagement and purchase Facebook ad campaigns.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The brilliance of this strategy is that it works like a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/01\/content-marketing-funnel\">marketing funnel<\/a>. You start with broad targeting to see who\u2019s interested, then you spend on the people most likely to buy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOnce I have an audience of engaged customers, I <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/15\/retargeting-ads\">retarget them<\/a> with a purchase campaign,\u201d Ashley explained. \u201cSince the engagement campaign casts such a wide net, it\u2019s time to narrow the audience and find the purchasers\u2014hence the purchase campaign. A purchase campaign tells Facebook to find the section of the audience that is most likely to buy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s where Ashley sees less-experienced SMMs mistakenly choose cheap clicks over meaningful conversions. \u201cYou will see various strategies that tell you to \u2018optimize for link clicks\u2019 and \u2018drive traffic to your site\u2019, but the problem is that that audience isn\u2019t likely to make purchases\u201d because Facebook prioritized looking for people who would click, not buy, she said.<\/p>\n<p>Ashley added that while it\u2019s possible some of the people you attract with a click-optimized campaign might buy, what you\u2019ll also get is \u201ctons of spam clicks, high bounce rates, and low-quality leads. Nobody wants to spend their hard-earned money on low-quality traffic and leads.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why she suggests <strong>optimizing for purchases after your engagement campaign<\/strong>. \u201cOptimizing for purchases tells Facebook to find the audience that is most likely to purchase from you,\u201d she said. \u201cThis will cost more, but the traffic quality is much better and it will benefit you more in the long run.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Finally, Ashley scales the campaign by building a lookalike audience off of the original list, and increases the budget to hit new goals.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Facebood-ad-tactics-wordstream-ROAS-1.webp\" alt=\"Facebook ad tactics - Facebook ad results increased ROAS.\" width=\"877\" height=\"488\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85202 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Facebood-ad-tactics-wordstream-ROAS-1.webp 877w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Facebood-ad-tactics-wordstream-ROAS-1-480x267.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 877px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Here are the types of results Ashley gets with her three-step Facebook ads growth strategy.<\/em><\/p>\n<div id=\"let-the-algorithms-do-the-work\"><\/div>\n<h3>6.

In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/tyler-mask-38a47b24\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tyler Mask<\/a>, Senior Manager, Social Advertising and Custom Solutions at LocaliQ, told me that\u2019s one of the biggest mistakes he sees advertisers make.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMeta\u2019s algorithms have gotten smarter,\u201d he said. \u201cThe need for advanced, detailed targeting profiles is not as important as it used to be.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe most important thing an SMM can do now is focus on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ab-testing-examples\">A\/B testing creative<\/a> and brand messaging,\u201d Tyler continued. \u201cIf an ad is not getting through to an audience, it&#8217;s more likely to do with the story we are telling and less to do with the targeting.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He said you can\u2019t just throw a hundred variations at the wall to see what sticks. \u201cThe biggest thing less-experienced SMMs misunderstand is that less is more. While Meta&#8217;s algorithms are the best in the business, having too many ad sets and ads under a campaign makes it challenging for it to optimize properly.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Facebood-ad-tactics-wordstream-ab-testin.webp\" alt=\"Facebook ad tactics - Graphic showing what to AB test.\" width=\"936\" height=\"490\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85204 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Facebood-ad-tactics-wordstream-ab-testin.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Facebood-ad-tactics-wordstream-ab-testin-480x251.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Simplicity and a clear goal are the keys to successful A\/B testing.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It also makes it nearly impossible for SMMs to make sense of what\u2019s working and what needs to change, he added. \u201cIn short, well-thought-out A\/B testing is important for both Meta\u2019s AI and for SMM to make data-informed decisions.\u201d<\/p>\n<div id=\"use-the-conversion-setting-for-lead\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. Use the Conversion setting for Lead Ads (instead of lead forms)<\/h3>\n<p>The goal of many Facebook ad campaigns is to generate leads. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/mathewwendler\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mat Wendler<\/a>, Manager, Customer Solutions at LocaliQ, said that advertisers should take advantage of a change in how Facebook handles lead generation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/facebook-ad-objectives\">lead objective<\/a> has significantly evolved over the past few years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can now directly track attribution from a client\u2019s form on their website.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s because Facebook added the \u201cConversion\u201d setting for Lead Ads, which lets you drive leads to your website or app, instead of having them fill out a lead form on Facebook.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Facebood-ad-tactics-wordstream-conversion.webp\" alt=\"Facebook ad tactics - Facebook ad account management page.\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85205 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Facebood-ad-tactics-wordstream-conversion.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Facebood-ad-tactics-wordstream-conversion-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The \u201cConversions\u201d option in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/facebook-ad-objectives\">Facebook ad objectives<\/a> is how you drive people to lead generation forms on your website.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cAdvertisers often encounter an increase in \u2018spam\u2019 leads with Facebook forms,\u201d Mat added. \u201cWe\u2019ve observed great success with advertisers transitioning to their website forms, as the intent to complete these forms is higher compared to filling out a form directly on Facebook.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Of course, it\u2019s worth testing both options for your brand. You may find the additional spam leads an acceptable trade-off to an increase in overall leads. But Mat\u2019s experience is that you\u2019ll end up with a much higher lead quality if you have people fill out forms on your site.<\/p>\n<p>Besides better leads, you\u2019ll also be generating website traffic with the Conversion setting, which will let you further engage those visitors.<\/p>\n<h2>Use Facebook ads to really connect with customers<\/h2>\n<p>Even after all these years, Facebook ads are still an effective and efficient way to generate clicks, leads, and conversions. But they can be tricky, especially as the platform becomes more sophisticated.<\/p>\n<p>The overarching theme from the experts I spoke with is to <strong>focus on connecting with your audience in a way that feels natural to the platform<\/strong>. Then test variations in a manageable way (and give these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/advertising-techniques\">advertising techniques<\/a> a try, too).<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re still struggling to get a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/12\/facebook-ads-cost\">great ROAS from Facebook ads<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/marketing-services?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Demo_Blog_Demo\">contact us<\/a>.
