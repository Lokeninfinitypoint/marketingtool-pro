It\u2019s built to analyze large data sets. Which is why it\u2019s no surprise that Google Analytics 4 (GA4) has integrated many advanced AI-driven features into its capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we\u2019ll explore two key aspects of Google Analytics\u2019 AI features: Predictive metrics and predictive audiences. These tools are not just about data analysis; they&#8217;re about foresight and strategy, enabling businesses to make more informed decisions.<\/p>\n<h3>Table of contents<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#how-google-analytics-4-uses-ai\">How does Google Analytics 4 use AI?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#predictive-audiences-in-google-analytics-4\">What are predictive audiences in Google Analytics 4?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#predictive-metrics-in-google-analytics-4\">What are predictive metrics in Google Analytics 4?<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"how-google-analytics-4-uses-ai\"><\/div>\n<h2>How does Google Analytics 4 use AI?<\/h2>\n<p>Google Analytics 4 utilizes AI in two pivotal ways. The first is through predictive audiences, where AI algorithms segment users based on their likelihood of exhibiting specific behaviors, such as making a purchase or churning. This segmentation empowers marketers to tailor their strategies more effectively to different audience segments.<\/p>\n<p>The second way GA4 leverages <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-marketing-trends-2024\">AI<\/a> is through the integration of predictive metrics and segments into reports. This feature is not limited to mere predictive metrics; it also encompasses the creation of segments based on predictive data. This allows for a deeper analysis of potential customer actions, offering insights into how different segments might behave in the future.<\/p>\n<p>By adding these predictive insights directly into reports, businesses gain a comprehensive view of their audience, enabling them to anticipate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-trends-2024\">market trends<\/a> and user behaviors with greater accuracy. This advanced functionality of GA4 marks a substantial leap forward in data-driven business strategy and decision-making.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 Speaking of data-driven decisions&#8230;find out how your Google Ads are <em>really<\/em> performing with our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Free Google Ads Grader<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"predictive-audiences-in-google-analytics-\"><\/div>\n<h2>What are predictive audiences in Google Analytics 4?<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s start by exploring predictive audiences in GA4. This aspect to audiences is a transformative feature that, when linked to advertising accounts like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/21\/how-to-run-google-ads\">Google Ads<\/a> or Display &amp; Video 360, can amplify media performance throughout the Google Marketing Platform. They&#8217;re particularly effective in similar audience targeting, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/15\/retargeting-ads\">retargeting<\/a>, and audience suppression strategies.<\/p>\n<p>Predictive audiences are constructed using predictive metrics, which are based on machine learning models that analyze <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/28\/behavioral-segmentation\">user behavior<\/a> patterns to forecast future actions.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/predictive-audience-based-on-predictive-metrics.webp\" alt=\"predictive audience based on predictive metric church\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-80056\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/predictive-audience-based-on-predictive-metrics.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/predictive-audience-based-on-predictive-metrics-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Similar audience targeting<\/h3>\n<p>GA4&#8217;s predictive audiences augment the capabilities of Google Ads&#8217; similar audiences by identifying the top percentage of users most likely to make a purchase. Marketers can utilize this data to target new users who share characteristics with this high-value group, optimizing reach more effectively than traditional methods such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/14\/google-ads-budgeting-strategies\">budget increases<\/a>\u00a0or broadened targeting.<\/p>\n<h3>Retargeting audiences<\/h3>\n<p>Predictive audiences enhance retargeting by pinpointing users on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/conversion-value-rules\">cusp of conversion<\/a> based on their interactions, like viewing product details or cart activities. By targeting users identified as likely to convert in the short term, or those predicted as top spenders, marketers can tailor their approach to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/11\/increase-conversion-rates\">increase conversions<\/a> and revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Conversely, these audiences can also identify users at risk of churning. Targeting these users with specialized messages or offers can help maintain <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/09\/customer-retention-strategies\">customer retention<\/a>, prevent churn, and cultivate a loyal customer base.<\/p>\n<h3>Audience suppression<\/h3>\n<p>Predictive audiences can also inform strategies to suppress ads to those with a high likelihood of converting on their own, such as the top 10% of customers poised to convert soon. This allows for smarter media spend by focusing on users who may need more encouragement to complete a purchase.<\/p>\n<p>\u26a1\ufe0f Is your Google Ads account set up for success? <strong>Download now &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLAccountStructure.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_LastAccountStructureGuide_Download\">The Last Guide to Google Ads Account Structure You&#8217;ll Ever Need<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"predictive-metrics-in-google-analytics-4\"><\/div>\n<h2>What are predictive metrics in Google Analytics 4?<\/h2>\n<p>GA4 offers three predictive metrics:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Purchase probability:<\/strong> Gauges the likelihood of a user completing a conversion in the next 7 days based on their activity in the past 28 days.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Churn probability:<\/strong> Estimates the chance of a user not returning to the app or site in the next 7 days.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Predicted revenue: <\/strong>Projects the revenue from a user&#8217;s purchase conversions in the next 28 days.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Are you eligible to use predictive metrics in GA4?<\/h3>\n<p>To leverage GA4&#8217;s predictive metrics, such as purchase probability and churn probability, it&#8217;s essential to meet certain prerequisites for the machine-learning algorithms to train effectively.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what you need to configure:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Event configuration:<\/strong> Ensure the &#8216;purchase&#8217; event is properly configured in your GA4 property settings. This event is pivotal for the algorithms to recognize and learn from user transactions.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Data volume: <\/strong>A substantial data set is required for the AI to learn from. You&#8217;ll need at least 1,000 positive (purchasers) and 1,000 negative (non-purchasers or churned users) samples. This means you should have a user base where at least 1,000 users completed a purchase and another 1,000 who didn&#8217;t after triggering the predictive condition.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Model quality:<\/strong> Maintain consistent and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/14\/increase-traffic-to-my-website\">quality traffic<\/a> that generates purchase events over a minimum duration, typically a 28-day cycle. This allows the AI to discern patterns and make accurate predictions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For each user that meets these criteria, GA4 will calculate predictive metrics daily. If the prerequisites aren&#8217;t met or if the user count falls below the required threshold, GA4 may cease to update these metrics, making them unavailable.<\/p>\n<p>To monitor the status of your predictive metrics, navigate to the predictive section found within the &#8216;Audience builder&#8217; of GA4. Here you&#8217;ll find &#8216;Suggested audiences&#8217; templates, which provide insights into the performance and reliability of your predictions.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/google-analytics-ai-suggested-audiences.webp\" alt=\"suggested audiences in google analytics 4\" width=\"936\" height=\"460\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-80040\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/google-analytics-ai-suggested-audiences.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/google-analytics-ai-suggested-audiences-480x236.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Predicted channel value report<\/h3>\n<p>We&#8217;ve talked about audiences, and it&#8217;s also important to consider how incorporating AI into your reports can greatly enhance the accuracy and insights of your analysis, especially when creating a predicted channel value report.
