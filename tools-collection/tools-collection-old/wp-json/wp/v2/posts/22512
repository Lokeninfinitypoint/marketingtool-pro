Sponsored Posts<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/15\/facebook-sponsored-posts\">Facebook Sponsored<\/a> posts appear directly in the Facebook Newsfeed. Users see the ads as they are scrolling, and the feature as prominently as posts from close friends. Here\u2019s an example of a Sponsored post from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.farmhill.com\/\">Farm Hill:<\/a><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-facebook-ads-sponsored-post-example.png\" alt=\"best sponsored facebook ads\" width=\"496\" height=\"472\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Facebook Sponsored Post from Farm Hill<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>2.

These ads are smaller, but they can\u2019t be scrolled past like sponsored posts in the News Feed. Marketers often use right-hand column ads for retargeting purposes. Here\u2019s an example of a right-hand column ad from West Elm:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-facebook-ads-west-elm-example1.png\" alt=\"effective facebook ads\" width=\"305\" height=\"260\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>West Elm right-hand column ad<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> Sponsored posts include a fair amount of copy, so I\u2019ll be focusing on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/15\/copywriting-tips\">copywriting tips<\/a> for these posts, although the tips can be applied to right-hand column ads as well.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p>\u2734\ufe0f Want more Facebook advertising tips?<\/p>\n<p>Free guide &gt;&gt; <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLFBFundamentals.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FacebookFundamentals_Download\">The 7 Facebook Advertising Fundamentals You Need to Succeed<\/a><\/strong><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h2>But Does Copywriting for Facebook Ads Really Matter?<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Yes!<\/strong> When you envision a Facebook ad, you might think of a large image. Images are important in <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/social-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook Ads<\/a>, but copywriting is also essential.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/14\/facebook-advertising-cost\">spending money on a Facebook ad<\/a>, you want to make sure it does its job. Good ad copywriting can persuade your audience to click through to your website. Good copywriting functions as a guide\u2014it shows people where they need to go.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/12\/how-to-write-great-advertising-copy\">Great advertising copy<\/a> can persuade, excite, and entertain. It makes connections, cuts out excess information, and makes the choice to proceed seem obvious. It\u2019s an essential part of a successful ad.<\/p>\n<p>So here&#8217;s how to do it: Use these principles to write the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/06\/best-ads\">best ads<\/a> you can.<\/p>\n<h2>9 Strategies for Writing Your Best Facebook Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Here are our tips for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/26\/how-to-optimize-facebook-ads\">optimizing your Facebook ads<\/a> with great copy.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Use Facebook Targeting to Narrow Your Audience, then Write to It<\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to selling online, it\u2019s tempting to write like you\u2019re on stage at a conference. But if you want to be effective, you must write as though you\u2019re writing to one person\u2014and one person alone.<\/p>\n<p>This person, your target, is the one you need to woo and persuade. Just as though you were an in-person salesperson, you need to focus all your attention on this person and their needs.<\/p>\n<p>On your website, you have to write copy that speaks to all potential customers, and you probably have a few different personas. On Facebook, however, you can narrowly target your audience. What does it look like to implement this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/10\/facebook-advertising-tips-for-small-business\">Facebook Ad tip<\/a>? Here&#8217;s an example.\u00a0You can target your ads to <strong>women<\/strong> who are <strong>over 30 <\/strong>that <strong>live in the U.S.<\/strong> and are <strong>interested in fitness and wellness. <\/strong>Then you can write targeted ads that speak to that very specific audience.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ad-targeting-for-best-facebook-ads.png\" alt=\"facebook ad targeting help\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Facebook Audience Definition<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>2. Write Different Facebook Ads for Different People<\/h3>\n<p>This goes along with the idea of targeting. Your customers turn to you for a variety of reasons, so why would you use one blanket ad? Facebook\u2019s strength is its ability to target, so don\u2019t treat your ad like a billboard.<\/p>\n<p>For example, imagine you\u2019re a clothing retailer. You sell men\u2019s and women\u2019s apparel, as well as shoes, accessories, activewear, underwear, and even bath and body products. Many customers will be interested in some of what you have to offer, but many will be most interested in one area. Simply put, women will be interested in what you have for women.<\/p>\n<p>I love this video ad from Old Navy promoting its activewear. The ad is targeted to those who\u2019ve listed fitness as an interest. In this way, Old Navy reaches the right audience with its ad.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/old-navy-best-facebook-ad-example.png\" alt=\"the best facebook ads guide\" width=\"487\" height=\"456\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Old Navy&#8217;s &#8220;Get moving in style&#8221; Facebook video ad<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>3. Ensure Your Facebook Ad Copy Goes with Your Visual<\/h3>\n<p>Many smaller businesses\u2014and even larger ones, especially in the B2B space\u2014don\u2019t have a ton of visuals on hand. When it comes time to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-run-facebook-ads\/\">run a Facebook ad<\/a>, there\u2019s a scramble to make sure an image gets attached.<\/p>\n<p>This can result in an image that doesn\u2019t go together with the copy, which presents a jarring experience for a Facebook user. If the copy and the image don\u2019t line up, they\u2019ll wonder what the ad is actually advertising. They\u2019ll be unlikely to click, and your ad will be wasted.<\/p>\n<p>Starbucks stitched together three images to create a great visual for its \u201cWorld\u2019s Largest #StarbucksDate\u201d campaign. The copy mentions \u201cfrench press caffe Verona &amp; a chocolate brownie,\u201d which are then visualized in the photos. In this way, Starbucks reminds its audience what they\u2019ll get by coming into the coffee shop, resulting in an effective Facebook ad.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-facebook-ad-images.png\" alt=\"facebook image ads\" width=\"445\" height=\"441\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Starbucks&#8217; &#8220;#StarbucksDate&#8221; Facebook ad campaign<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re struggling to create images for Facebook ads, you can use image tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bannersnack.com\/\">Bannersnack<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.canva.com\/\">Canva<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.picmonkey.com\/\">PicMonkey<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/pablo.buffer.com\/\">Pablo by Buffer<\/a> to create your own.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Stay Focused with One Call to Action<\/h3>\n<p>The best Facebook ads have a clear goal. Are you trying to increase brand awareness, get a lead, or sell a product? No matter what, your ad should have a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/07\/call-to-action-marketing\">clear call-to-action<\/a>. Without it, Facebook users will see your ad, but they\u2019ll have no idea where to click, or what to do.<\/p>\n<p>Society6 sells iPhone cases, and they show off their products in their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/27\/facebook-ads-for-entrepreneurs\">Facebook ads<\/a>. But the ad is a lot more than an image of a lovely iPhone case\u2014it has a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/20\/call-to-action-buttons\">call-to-action button<\/a> (\u201cShop Now\u201d) encouraging users to come to the Society6 website to browse, shop, and ultimately buy.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-facebook-ad-calls-to-action.png\" alt=\"best facebook cta's\" width=\"498\" height=\"478\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Society6 Facebook ad, with one call to action\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Speaking of calls to action, did you know that &#8220;Call now&#8221; is also an option? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/17\/facebook-click-to-call-ads\">Learn more about click-to-call ads on Facebook here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Keep it Short and Lead with Value<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019re paying for an ad, so it can be tempting to cram in as much as possible. You have to explain your product to people, after all. However, to really <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/11\/21\/how-to-compete-in-facebook-ads\">compete in Facebook ads<\/a>, you need to keep it short, and lead with value.<\/p>\n<p>What does someone get out of using your product? How will it help them? These are the areas you should focus on in your copy, and you should get these points across in a clear, concise manner.<\/p>\n<p>For example, TaskRabbit helps people hire others to complete personal tasks, but the value is that users can get everything done when they\u2019re busy and overwhelmed. In the following ad, TaskRabbit shares its value with the copy: \u201cGetting everything done is easier than you think,\u201d \u201cHire a tasker instead,\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019ve got chores covered.\u201d Just three sentences completely explain the value of the service.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-facebook-ads-lead-with-value1.png\" alt=\"facebook advertising examples\" width=\"490\" height=\"435\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>TaskRabbit&#8217;s &#8220;Hire a Tasker&#8221; Facebook ad, with lead value<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>6. Use Simple Language that\u2019s Easy to Understand<\/h3>\n<p>Copywriting is not high literature. Maybe you were a poet in college, but flowery language will muddle your message. It\u2019s time to cut the verbosity.<\/p>\n<p>Your number one priority should be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/06\/10\/facebook-post-engagement\">writing a Facebook ad<\/a> that\u2019s easy to understand\u2014for anyone, even a 5th grader. When someone sees your ad, they should immediately know:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What you\u2019re offering<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\">How it benefits them<\/a><\/li>\n<li>What to do next<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>That\u2019s why I love this sponsored post from SoFi, which helps people refinance their student loans. The copy in this Facebook ad is refreshingly simple: <strong>Pay off loans faster. <\/strong>SoFi explains what it offers (refinancing of loans), the benefits (paying off loans faster), and what to do next (apply now).<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-facebook-ads-simple-language.png\" alt=\"best facebook ads tips\" width=\"492\" height=\"479\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>SoFi&#8217;s &#8220;Pay off loans faster&#8221; Facebook ad, with simple language<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>7. Be Upfront About the Numbers<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re selling a physical product, people want to know how much it costs. If you\u2019re running a sale, people want to know what percentage they\u2019re going to get off. A copywriting strategy that works? Lead with the numbers.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Ball Honda, a car dealership in San Diego, sponsors <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/01\/facebook-stories-ads\">Facebook ads<\/a> that drive home the nuts and bolts of how much it costs to get a car. They share the deal people can get if they lease a CRV, and give a date for when the promotion ends. They don\u2019t show the ad to everyone in San Diego\u2014they target those who have come to their website already.<\/p>\n<p>The ad isn\u2019t particularly sexy, but it\u2019s helpful, and it effectively reminds people to come to their dealership when they\u2019re ready to buy a car.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-facebook-ads-use-numbers.png\" alt=\"great facebook ad copywriting\" width=\"493\" height=\"478\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Ball Honda Facebook ad, with upfront numbers<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>8. Get Some Perspective<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019re working to market your brand every day, so it can be tough to step back and make sure the copy for your<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/26\/how-to-create-facebook-ads\"> Facebook ad<\/a> resonates. Scroll through your own Facebook feed and take a look at the ads. Which ones make you want to click? Which ones do you simply scroll past?<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a good idea to get some perspective from someone besides yourself. You can hire a freelance writer or editor to write the ad for you, or help you brainstorm. You can also bounce the ad off a few coworkers, especially ones outside the marketing department, to see if they think it\u2019s effective. Friends and family\u2014people outside the business\u2014can help as well.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Test your Ad Copy<\/h3>\n<p>The only way you can <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/27\/facebook-ad-copy-tests\">improve your Facebook ad copy<\/a> is if you run tests. Facebook makes it easy to spend a small amount of money to try things out. In the end, the only way you can ensure your copywriting works is through experience.<\/p>\n<p>Try running two different ads\u2014each with the same image, but different copy\u2014to see which resonates most with your audience. Which version gets the most likes, comments, and conversions?<\/p>\n<p>For example,<a href=\"http:\/\/www.socialmediaexaminer.com\/split-test-facebook-page-posts-ads\/\"> Post Planner posted the same ad,<\/a> but changed up the copy. In one ad, they asked a question. In the second ad, they made a statement. It\u2019s a subtle copy change, but it can spell out big changes in results.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/test-your-facebook-ad-copy.png\" alt=\"how to write great facebook ads\" width=\"442\" height=\"336\" \/><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/test-your-facebook-ad-copy-2.png\" alt=\"facebook ad testing\" width=\"445\" height=\"333\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Post Planner Facebook ad, with experimental ad copy.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>For more help with testing, check out our post on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/11\/facebook-ab-testing\">Facebook A\/B testing on a budget<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Write Copy That Drives Results on Facebook<\/h2>\n<p>The best ads on Facebook <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/21\/facebook-offer-ads\">ultimately lead to sales<\/a>.
