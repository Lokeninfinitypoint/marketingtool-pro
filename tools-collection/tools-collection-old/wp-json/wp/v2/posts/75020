The genius of automated rules is that they\u2019re nearly infinitely flexible in scheduling changes made to your Google Ads account. You can use an automated rule to post one change or thousands\u2013and can schedule them to run just one time or multiple times a day. You can use them to post big changes\u2013such as pausing every campaign in your account, or the smallest changes\u2013such as emailing you the results of your campaign when you return from vacation.<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft Advertising has <a href=\"https:\/\/help.ads.microsoft.com\/#apex\/ads\/en\/51130\/1-500\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">similar automated rules<\/a> for their advertisers that can be used in conjunction with Google\u2019s automated rules.

Or do you want to select certain campaigns (ads, keyword, etc.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Conditions: <\/strong>If you like, you can create additional conditions for Google to check before taking this action. These conditions can include any performance metrics (clicks, cost, conversions, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/cost-per-action\">CPA<\/a>, etc) or attribute you can view in Google Ads.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Frequency: <\/strong>This is how often you want Google to check this condition and potentially perform this action.

For instance, if you want Google to review data from earlier that day, month, or year.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Email results: <\/strong>Finally, you can optionally choose to have Google email you, your colleague, or your client. Google can send this email either every time it runs or any time it makes takes an action.<\/p>\n<div id=\"tips\"><\/div>\n<h2><strong>Best practices with Google Ads automated rules<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Letting Google automatically post changes in your account is a scary thought to many. Google Ads automated rules can morph from a helpful tool to an active saboteur with the wrong guidance, especially if you\u2019re just getting started.<\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #333333; font-size: 22px;\">1. Read your rules out loud first<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When creating your automated rule, the setup can feel and sound technical\u2013because it is! Like everything in Google Ads, automated rules were written by programmers, not marketers. To make sure your rules are written correctly, be sure to read back what you\u2019re telling Google to do first.<\/p>\n<p>Use the sentence structure:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201c<\/em>At <strong><em>[frequency]<\/em>, <\/strong>check to see if <strong><em>[conditions]<\/em><\/strong> are met using data from <strong><em>[date range in set in frequency]. <\/em><\/strong>If those conditions are met, then <em><strong>[perform action] <\/strong><\/em>in <strong><em>[apply to groups].<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>See? Technical sounding sentence on its own. Applied to a real rule, this could read:<\/p>\n<p>At <em><strong>3 p.m. every day, <\/strong><\/em>check to see if <em><strong>these campaigns have spent $5,000 <\/strong><\/em>so far <em><strong>this month<\/strong>. <\/em>If that\u2019s the case, then <em><strong>pause <\/strong><\/em>these <em><strong>selected campaigns<\/strong>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #333333; font-size: 22px;\">2. Always preview results<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Before saving your rule, Google allows you to \u201cpreview\u201d it in action. This allows Google to check the conditions you\u2019ve set and show you what it would do if that rule ran right now. Google doesn\u2019t post these changes, but it\u2019s a good way to check to see how many changes your new rule could potentially post.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-ads-automated-rules-preview.jpg\" alt=\"google ads automated rules - rule preview screenshot\" width=\"900\" height=\"309\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75027 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-ads-automated-rules-preview.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-ads-automated-rules-preview-480x165.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #333333; font-size: 22px;\">3. Be cautious of frequency<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One of the most common mistakes that I see advertisers making is having their rules run too frequently or using data from a different time period than their frequency. For instance, an automated rule that runs hourly using data from the day before will complete that action either 0 or 24 times, but never once. Your rule may be set to only raise your budget by $100, but this small mistake could raise it by $2,400 by the end of the day instead!<\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #333333; font-size: 22px;\">4. Start off with small changes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Fortune may favor the bold\u2014but don\u2019t automate your boldness! Small changes add up quickly and you don\u2019t want a rogue automated rule to spend your annual budget over the weekend or change your campaigns beyond recognition without your eyes on it! Start off by having Google post smaller changes in the ballpark of 5% to 10% of a value every time it runs first. Once you see that the automated rules are set up, working properly, and contributing to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords-analytics\">better performance<\/a>, then you can give them more power to make bigger changes.<\/p>\n<div id=\"rules\"><\/div>\n<h2><b>22 Google Ads automated rules every advertiser should know<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Automated rules have nearly unlimited potential to make<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/19\/google-ads-for-small-businesses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> managing your Google Ads<\/a> account easier. With proper planning, you can use them to launch your new campaigns on time, optimize your current ads, keep you informed of your performance, or set up a failsafe to pull in an emergency. Here are some common examples that I use frequently:<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Google automated rules for making campaign management easier<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Try these automated rules to make managing Google Ads easier.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>1. Pausing your campaigns before a holiday<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>If you know that your business is going to be closed for a few days in advance, you can use this rule to pause your campaigns on time.

Consider adding labels to your ads for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/13\/sales-promotion-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">different sales or promotions<\/a> to make automation easier.
