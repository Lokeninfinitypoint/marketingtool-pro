Here are the components:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>URL:\u00a0<\/strong>Also known as the destination, this is where users will land when they click on your ad.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Display path:\u00a0<\/strong>This is what appears after the URL, after the slash. It&#8217;s called &#8220;display&#8221; because it doesn&#8217;t have to be the actual URL of the page. It&#8217;s what gets displayed as a part of the ad and is used to provide more clarity to the user about the destination of the link. More on this in a bit.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Headline:\u00a0<\/strong>The headline is the large blue text that appears below the URL. This is the most prominent part of your ad and most likely the first (and sometimes only) thing users read. Ads can have two or three headlines, up to 30 characters each.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Description:\u00a0<\/strong>The description is the body text that appears below the headline and provides more details. These can be up to 90 characters.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Assets: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/16\/google-ads-extensions-now-assets\">Formerly known as extensions<\/a>, these are additional elements you can tack onto your ad to give it more appeal.

Think feature-benefit-<em>feeling<\/em><\/h3>\n<p>As we just learned above, not every headline needs to include the keyword you&#8217;re targeting\u2014some of them should include features and\/or benefits. Features and benefits are a staple in any sort of marketing copy, but all too often, we neglect the most important part: emotion.<\/p>\n<p>Why does the user want the benefit to happen? What, ultimately, is the good feeling they are trying to achieve or the bad feeling they&#8217;re looking to avoid?<\/p>\n<p>For example, let&#8217;s say you are running an ad for public speaking coaching:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Feature:<\/strong> One-on-one coaching<\/li>\n<li><strong>Benefit:<\/strong> Become a better public speaker<\/li>\n<li><strong>Feeling:<\/strong> Confidence<\/li>\n<li><strong>Headline:<\/strong> Speak with Impact &amp; Authority<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-feature-benefit-feeling.png\" alt=\"ppc ad copy tips - example of google ad with feature, benefit, and feeling\" width=\"720\" height=\"423\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65052 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-feature-benefit-feeling.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-feature-benefit-feeling-480x282.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For more inspiration, check out these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/21\/emotional-ad-copy-examples\">examples of emotional ad copy<\/a>\u2014which includes over 100 words and phrases to try out.<\/p>\n<ul><\/ul>\n<ul><\/ul>\n<h3>2. Include a differentiator<\/h3>\n<p>So you\u2019ve established your key features and benefits. Great. But guess what\u2014your competitors provide the same exact ones. Don&#8217;t worry, I know yours are different on a more detailed and nuanced level, but you can&#8217;t capture that in a single text ad, so for all intents ad purposes on the SERP, in consumers&#8217; eyes, it&#8217;s all the same.<\/p>\n<p>So you need to identify what makes you different. This is the key to any <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/16\/elevator-pitch-examples-templates\">good elevator pitch<\/a> or scenario where you have limited time and space.<\/p>\n<p>This is easy when you are any of the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The original<\/li>\n<li>The official<\/li>\n<li>The only<\/li>\n<li>The fastest<\/li>\n<li>The first<\/li>\n<li>The lowest-priced<\/li>\n<li>The top rated<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-number-one.png\" alt=\"ppc ad copy tips - example of google ad with differentiating feature\" width=\"720\" height=\"502\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65072 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-number-one.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-number-one-480x335.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But even if you&#8217;re not any of the above, you can still differentiate your business from competitors with things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specific numbers (such as reviews and ratings).<\/li>\n<li>A particular endorsement.<\/li>\n<li>A &#8220;not your typical&#8221; or &#8220;not your average&#8221; statement.<\/li>\n<li>A &#8220;this, not that&#8221; statement.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-different.png\" alt=\"ppc ad copy tips - example of google ad with differentiating feature\" width=\"720\" height=\"648\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65053 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-different.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-different-480x432.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Just something that makes your ad copy different from all the other ads around it. &#8220;Different&#8221; stands out. And standing out is attractive.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Show a little personality<\/h3>\n<p>Another way to differentiate your business from other ads on the SERP? Show a little personality. With no options for images or branding (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/21\/google-ads-image-extensions\">image extensions<\/a> don&#8217;t count), text ads give us little room for creativity, but it&#8217;s still doable.<\/p>\n<p>Take a look at the examples below. Same number of blue and black characters every other ad has, but the descriptions are packed with personality:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>We didn&#8217;t invent professional copywriting, we just changed everything about it.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>Enjoy artisanal content lovingly crafted by grass-fed, 100% organic copywriters.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-write-ad-copy-ad-personality-example.jpg\" alt=\"how to write ppc ad copy - personalized ad example\" width=\"900\" height=\"567\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81374 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-write-ad-copy-ad-personality-example.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-write-ad-copy-ad-personality-example-480x302.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>These ads stand out. Now I know that not every industry can be creative like this, but if it&#8217;s an option for you, I recommend taking a look at different <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/24\/google-ads-examples\">Google Ads examples<\/a> to get some inspiration.<\/p>\n<p>(Side note: if you ever want ad copy ideas, just search &#8220;ad copywriting services&#8221; and you can rest assured that ad copy services will provide some inspiration.)<\/p>\n<h3>4. Get competitive<\/h3>\n<p>You know what they say&#8230;keep your friends close and your enemies closer. Keep an eye on what your competitors are using in their ad copy and use it for your own positioning. In the example below, you can see Got Print&#8217;s ad offering 500 business cards for $8.50. Right above that is Overnight Print&#8217;s ad for $8.49.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a tiny detail\u2014and I&#8217;ll admit borderline cheap trick\u2014but does it catch your eye? Yes. And does this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/01\/headline-examples\">headline example<\/a> also show that Overnight Prints is on the ball? Also yes.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-competitive-copy-touche.png\" alt=\"ppc ad copy tips - example of competitive google ad copy\" width=\"720\" height=\"638\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65048 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-competitive-copy-touche.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-competitive-copy-touche-480x425.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>More <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/26\/competitive-ads\">competitive ad examples here<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s another example. We have an ad for a family-owned-and-operated HVAC company at the top of the SERP (excellent differentiator, in addition to &#8220;serving since 1957&#8221;), and then right below it an ad that reads &#8220;Don&#8217;t hire those guys, really &#8211; we can beat their prices.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-competitive-punch.png\" alt=\"ppc ad copy tips - example of competitive google ad copy\" width=\"720\" height=\"543\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65049 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-competitive-punch.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-competitive-punch-480x362.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a bold move, but being competitive reflects confidence in your business which imbues confidence in the audience. Plus, the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/05\/conversational-tone\"> conversational style of writing<\/a> gives it personality.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Include a CTA in your headlines&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>It would be naive to assume that every searcher reads every ad in its entirety, but headlines are difficult to skip over. So don\u2019t hide your call to action in the description, put it out there for the world to see in your headline. This is likely to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/14\/improve-google-ads-click-through-rate\">improve your CTR<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In the examples below, we have three ads. The first one doesn&#8217;t have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/05\/best-call-to-action-phrases\">call to action phrase<\/a> in the headline, but it does have a question. Questions do stand out and technically call forth some action in the form of thought. This one&#8217;s in the clear.<\/p>\n<p>The second one\u00a0has no CTA in the headline.\u00a0 Luckily there are CTAs in the description. The third one has a crisp and clean CTA to book a free 30-minute consult. Bingo.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ad-copy-tips-cta-no-cta.png\" alt=\"ppc ad copy tips - example of google ads with and without CTAs\" width=\"720\" height=\"610\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65054 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ad-copy-tips-cta-no-cta.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ad-copy-tips-cta-no-cta-480x407.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>&#8230;highly specific CTAs<\/h3>\n<p>Notice how the CTA in the example above is super-clear?

Reiterate and reinforce, but don&#8217;t be redundant<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, you want to make use of the space available to you in your ad, and yes, relevance to the keyword is important for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/quality-score\">Quality Score<\/a>. But no, repeating the same keywords and phrases isn\u2019t going to get you anywhere.<\/p>\n<p>Including it once in your headline, display path, and\/or description should be enough. Use the rest of the space for features, benefits, or related keywords. The idea is to reinforce or reiterate without being redundant.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-repetition-redundant-reinforce.png\" alt=\"ppc ad copy tips - example of google ads that are repetitive, redundant, and reinforcing\" width=\"720\" height=\"501\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65056 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-repetition-redundant-reinforce.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-repetition-redundant-reinforce-480x334.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>8. Try seasonal modifiers<\/h3>\n<p>Try using a seasonal headline in your ad, even if you offer your product or service year-round. This can encourage a sense of novelty and urgency and prompt clicks. In the example below, the headline reads &#8220;Fall Promo Ends 12\/1.&#8221; Extra bonus points for the specificity of the date.<\/p>\n<h3><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-seasonal-modifier.png\" alt=\"ppc ad copy tips - example of google ad with seasonal modifier\" width=\"720\" height=\"617\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65060 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-seasonal-modifier.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-seasonal-modifier-480x411.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/h3>\n<h3>9. Address objections with the magic words<\/h3>\n<p>Even though intent to buy is pretty high on search, consumers are, by default, programmed with objections. These are specific to your product or service, but in general, they fall into one of three buckets:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>I can&#8217;t afford it<\/li>\n<li>It\u2019s too much of a hassle<\/li>\n<li>I don&#8217;t need it<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Fortunately, I&#8217;ve got a handful of magic words (and synonyms) that are excellent antidotes to these objections. They are as follows:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Free:<\/strong> No cost, low cost, save, affordable, as low as, % off, only, cheap, bargain.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Easy:<\/strong> Fast, instant, easy, simple, just, in minutes\/days\/hours, immediate, quick, jif<\/li>\n<li><strong>Worth it:<\/strong> Return on investment, used by thousands, game-changing, you&#8217;ll never turn back.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul><\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-objections.png\" alt=\"ppc ad copy tips - example of google ad with objection addressed\" width=\"720\" height=\"353\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65070 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-objections.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-objections-480x235.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>10. Use relationships to evoke emotion<\/h3>\n<p>Coming full circle back to tip #1: Emotion is the most powerful ad copy tool at your disposal. Both positive and negative emotions influence behaviors. And what&#8217;s the best source for emotional ad copy? Relationships.<\/p>\n<p>Way back when, Perry Marshall devised a structured approach to persuasive ad copy called the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.perrymarshall.com\/marketing\/sak\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Swiss Army Knife<\/a>. Blade #1 focuses on relationships, and in the model you have six key players:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The customer<\/li>\n<li>Your business<\/li>\n<li>Something they love<\/li>\n<li>Something they hate<\/li>\n<li>Their best friend<\/li>\n<li>Their worst enemy<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-write-ppc-ads-perry-swiss-army-knife-infographic-1024x656.jpg\" alt=\"how to write ppc ads - perry marshall swiss army knife chart\" width=\"1024\" height=\"656\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81393 size-large\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-write-ppc-ads-perry-swiss-army-knife-infographic-980x628.jpg 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-write-ppc-ads-perry-swiss-army-knife-infographic-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" \/><\/h3>\n<p>Among these six players there are 15 relationships you can play off of to create emotional hooks for your ads. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don&#8217;t let [worst enemy] prevent you from [something they love].<\/li>\n<li>When [something they hate happens], [your business] [something they love].<\/li>\n<li>Free up time to [something they love] with [someone they love].<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Just keep in mind that you don&#8217;t need to go over the top with your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/03\/emotional-marketing-copy\">emotional words and phrases<\/a>\u2014especially with search ads. You want to evoke emotions so they inspire action, but not provoke them so they distract or come off as desperate or salesy. Oftentimes, a subtle approach works best.<\/p>\n<p>In the example below, the headline reads &#8220;When Banks Say No, We Say Yes.&#8221; There aren&#8217;t even any emotional words in there, but you feel rejection and relief in a matter of seconds.<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-relationships.png\" alt=\"ppc ad copy tips - example of google ads using emotional ad copy\" width=\"720\" height=\"376\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65069 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-relationships.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-relationships-480x251.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>11. Use AI&#8230; sparingly<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019ve tried all 10 tips so far but still experience a bit of writer\u2019s block when attempting to craft exceptional ad copy, AI can be a handy fallback. While AI should never be used for your finalized ad copy, it can help you start to brainstorm new headline and description ideas when you\u2019re in a pinch.<\/p>\n<p>If you decide to go this route, you\u2019re not alone. In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/ai-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI statistics<\/a> show that two-thirds of businesses use AI to brainstorm content. Just be sure to perfect your AI prompt first to get a high-quality response from your AI tool and leave yourself time to manually edit and finalize any of your AI-generated ideas.<\/p>\n<p>Here is an example of an AI prompt you could use to jumpstart your PPC ad copywriting:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Brainstorm five different ad headlines under 30 characters that promote booking services with my local full-service salon targeting keywords like [insert keywords].&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span>\ud83e\udd16 <\/span>Learn more about how AI can help your business&#8217;s Google Ads strategy with our free, complete guide to <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteAIinMarketingGuide.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_AIMarketing_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI in marketing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a id=\"template\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Part four: The free PPC ad copy template<\/h2>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s time to put these best practices and tips together.
