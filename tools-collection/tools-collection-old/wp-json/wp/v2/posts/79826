Google expanded the new Ads Transparency Center, colloquially known as the Google Ads Library.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>This means that Google now has a searchable ads library, just like Meta and TikTok!

Instead, you can find all active ads through the <a href=\"https:\/\/adstransparency.google.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads Transparency Center<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Search for ads using the Google Ads library<\/h3>\n<p><span>When searching for ads, you can search by advertiser name or by website URL. I find the website URL search to be much easier and more accurate than trying to weed through advertiser names, since many companies may be verified through a parent company or through their agency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>For example, if you try to find ads for the clothing company Gap, you\u2019ll find a whole range of companies with \u201cGap\u201d in their name, but not <em>the<\/em> Gap.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/google-ad-library-google-ads-transparency-center-home.jpg\" alt=\"google ads library - google ads transparency center screenshot\" width=\"864\" height=\"454\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-79851 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/google-ad-library-google-ads-transparency-center-home.jpg 864w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/google-ad-library-google-ads-transparency-center-home-480x252.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 864px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>Add \u201c.com,\u201d however, and it becomes quite clear which one is the Gap clothing company. As you can see, different domain suffixes, like .com vs. .co.uk vs. .ca, will come up separately when you use the website URL search.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/google-ads-library-search.jpg\" alt=\"google ads library - refined google ad transparency search example\" width=\"847\" height=\"412\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-79856 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/google-ads-library-search.jpg 847w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/google-ads-library-search-480x233.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 847px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 Find more ways to get ahead of your competition with our free <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads Grader<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h3>Filter Google Ads library results<\/h3>\n<p><span>There are four filters you can use in the Google Ads library to help you find what you\u2019re looking for: date range, geography, format, and all topics vs. political ads.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>I recommend using the date range filter to look at the last 30 days, rather than \u201cAny time,\u201d when looking for ad inspiration. The exception would be if you have a specific reason you want to look back further in time. Perhaps you\u2019d like to get inspiration for your Valentine\u2019s Day ads by looking at ads that ran during last Valentine\u2019s Day. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Next, there is a country filter. By default, the Google Ads Transparency Center will filter results to those ads that ran in your country, so be sure to adjust this if needed. For example, I&#8217;m in Canada and I often want to see what US-based advertisers are doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The third filter lets you search by ad format, image, text, or video. I find this feature to be a bit buggy, so I recommend keeping it on the default, which is all formats.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The final filter, all topics vs. political ads, works similarly to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/06\/facebook-ad-library\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Meta Ads library<\/a>. You\u2019re probably going to want to keep that one on all topics unless you\u2019re managing some kind of political or cause-based campaign.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"find-competitors-on-google-ads-library\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to use the Google Ads library to find your competitors&#8217; ads<\/h2>\n<p><span>To demonstrate how you can use the Google Ads library to find your competitors (and learn from their wins or mistakes!), let\u2019s use the luxury athleisure company Lululemon as an example.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/google-ads-library-example.jpg\" alt=\"google ads library - example of searching lululemon in google ads transparency center\" width=\"836\" height=\"547\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-79855 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/google-ads-library-example.jpg 836w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/google-ads-library-example-480x314.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 836px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>You\u2019ll notice that if I type in Lululemon, a whole bunch of verified advertisers and domains show up.
