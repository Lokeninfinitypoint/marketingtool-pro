Life events can be drilled down to between users preparing for a life event (about to graduate college, get married, moving soon) and immediately after the event (recently graduated college, got married, moved).<\/p>\n<p>Life events can be layered with in-market audiences, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/23\/custom-affinity-audiences\">affinity audiences<\/a> remarketing lists, or similar audiences to further refine your target audience.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2ad61d30-d02a-48b9-adf3-f8c9e46bc5bf\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-layering-life-events-targeting-2.png\" alt=\"adwords life event targeting added in 2017\" width=\"939\" height=\"401\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Within Gmail, an audience can either be added as a target (restricting the reach of your ads) or as an observation (allowing you to adjust your bid for this audience experiencing a life event). Similarly, Life event targets can be added as exclusions. Exclusions can be added at either the campaign or ad group level.<\/p>\n<h2>Targeting Important Life Events<\/h2>\n<p>Today, Google has three main life events for users to target: College Graduation, Marriage, and Moving.<\/p>\n<h3>College Graduation<\/h3>\n<p>Targeting students entering the \u201creal world\u201d has obvious potential for businesses advertising job-hunting services or companies that are <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/25\/ppc-jobs\">looking to attract new talent<\/a> (by the way, all the kids are <a href=\"\/jobs\">applying to work at WordStream<\/a>), or potentially settle or refinance their student debts.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"48123ddd-9d32-4286-9da6-66038dae03a0\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/recently-graduated-life-event-targeting1.jpg\" alt=\"targeting recently graduated audience\" width=\"550\" height=\"825\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>However, as people graduate college, there\u2019s also a lot subtle needs that advertisers can capitalize on.
