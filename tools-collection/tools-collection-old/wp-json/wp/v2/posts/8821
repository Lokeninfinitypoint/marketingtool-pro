They can provide your business with high-quality potential customers and clients who already have some level of trust in your company. Because of this inherited trust, these newcomers are likely to become loyal, recurring customers who are quite valuable to your business and its growth. Customer referrals are also more telling than you may realize and speak volumes to your company\u2019s success and quality. After all, a customer won\u2019t refer a company, especially to friends or family, that isn\u2019t worthy of referral.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/referral-marketing-header-1.png\" alt=\"referral marketing ideas\u2014instagram referral promotion post\" width=\"700\" height=\"447\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The importance of getting referrals from clients cannot be understated.

And that&#8217;s why you should read on.<\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">Types of referrals you can get<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Before starting any kind of referral marketing strategy, you have to first know who can refer business to your company. Below are\u00a0the most common and popular referral sources that you should consider targeting.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span lang=\"EN\">Customer referrals<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">By far the most popular, <span lang=\"EN\">existing customers are one of your greatest sources of new business<span lang=\"EN\">. If they absolutely loved your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/29\/how-to-promote-a-product\">product or service<\/a>, there\u2019s a good chance that they will share their experience with friends and family that have the same pain points and desires.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span lang=\"EN\">Employee referrals<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">You\u2019re not just selling customers on the fact that your product or service is great, but your employees too. When you have<span lang=\"EN\"> employees that genuinely believe your product is helpful<span lang=\"EN\">, or you have a rewarding referral program in place, they\u2019re much more likely to spread the word. This is why it&#8217;s important to keep your employees clued in on not just your offerings, but your overall <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/12\/07\/company-mission-statements\">mission<\/a>\u2014the &#8220;why&#8221; behind what you do and the impact you&#8217;re trying to make.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span lang=\"EN\">Partner referrals<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Rather than keeping your sphere of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/23\/how-to-become-a-social-media-influencer\">influencers<\/a> narrow, cast a wider net by tapping into referral partners. These can be individuals that can send valuable traffic to your company through review articles or feedback that they share with their following via social media or their website. Or, you can partner with associations centered around a particular <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/28\/niche-marketing\">niche<\/a> within your audience.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span lang=\"EN\">Vendor referrals<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Lastly, don\u2019t forget about the vendors with whom\u00a0you\u2019ve formed a symbiotic relationship. This is a crucial part of networking and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2010\/10\/14\/building-relationships-with-bloggers\">relationship building<\/a>. Once you have loyal vendors to whom you send business,\u00a0they\u2019re more likely to reciprocate and send their customers your way.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/referral-marketing-vendor-referral-1.png\" alt=\"referral marketing ideas\u2014twitter post about partner program\" width=\"490\" height=\"370\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>Best practices for referral programs<\/h2>\n<p>Before implementing your referral marketing strategy or program, be sure to take these points into consideration.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Determine your offer<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>What is of most value to your customers? Is it cash back? Freebies? Double the rewards points? Steep discounts? Keep in mind that you don\u2019t have to offer expensive incentives. In fact, one study showed that o<span lang=\"EN\">ffering a reward increases the likelihood of a referral, but the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.saasquatch.com\/blog\/rs-7-surprising-stats-about-customer-referral-programs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">size of that award doesn\u2019t matter<\/a>. So whether it\u2019s a dollar or a $50 voucher, it\u2019s worth trying!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Make it easy to find<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you do have an official program, include an element in your main navigation for your referral program information page, or add it to a sticky sidebar that persists regardless of the page or post a reader is on.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Promote it regularly<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll of course want to promote your referral program or offer once it launches, but it&#8217;s also important to continue reminding customers over time. Post about it on social media once or twice\u00a0week, include it in your emails, and keep a sign or flyer up in your store.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/referral-marketing-promote-1.png\" alt=\"referral marketing ideas\u2014facebook post promoting referral program\" width=\"500\" height=\"605\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Be specific<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re creating content around your referral programs, be specific about the details. It should be crystal clear to customers exactly what the program entails. Be sure to outline:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What the reward or offer is<\/li>\n<li>How their information will (or will not) be used<\/li>\n<li>Exactly how they can refer friends and family<\/li>\n<li>How they can keep track of progress or rewards<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The more details your clients have about your program, the more comfortable they will be with participating.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Keep it simple<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On the flip side, be sure not to bombard your customers with all of the details upfront. A tidal wave of text is the best way to scare them away. Lay out the important facts at the top of your page, and then get into details further down or in a separate link if necessary.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/referral-marketing-details-1.png\" alt=\"referral marketing ideas\u2014hello fresh referral program FAQ page\" width=\"800\" height=\"444\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Get the timing right<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When is the best time to encourage customers to refer your business? Is it right after a purchase, when they\u2019ve got your excellent customer service experience fresh in their heads, or is it a little further down the road when they\u2019ve had a chance to use your products or services more consistently? Or is it after they<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\"> leave a review<\/a> for your business?<\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Track your referral data<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>By tracking referral data, you\u2019ll be able to easily pinpoint who\u2019s actually sending over interested customers and who\u2019s coming up empty-handed. After all, you don\u2019t want to be <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/08\/26\/adwords-budget-management\">wasting your budget<\/a> and efforts on something that\u2019s never going to pay off. You may be surprised to find that your best referrals are coming from customers that purchased a particular product, or from a referral partner with a highly targeted audience. Once you gain these invaluable insights, you\u2019ll be able to harness the strengths of\u00a0your campaigns to yield even better results.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Thank referrers<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As obvious as this may sound, it cannot be stressed enough. While giving the referrer a discount or some kind of gift will surely incentivize and reward them, it\u2019s still imperative that you individually thank your customers who refer you\u2014whether through a simple greeting card, a personalized email, or an in-person thank you. This little gesture can go a long way in strengthening your client relationships and encouraging ongoing referrals.<\/p>\n<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\ud83d\udce3 <strong>Free guide<\/strong> &gt;&gt; <\/span><span><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite30BestWaysToPromote.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Marketing_The30BestWaysToPromoteYourBusiness_Download\" class=\"waffle-rich-text-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The 30 Best Ways to Promote Your Business (With or Without Money)<\/a><\/span><span>\u00a0<\/div><\/div><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">15 ideas and examples of referral programs to try now<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Now that you understand the benefits and best practices of referral marketing, let&#8217;s talk about ways to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/customer-referral-program\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">build a referral program<\/a> for your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">1. Add a referral submission form to your website<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">One of the easiest ways to begin collecting referral information is by implementing a submission form on your website. Capture the attention of your existing customers by telling them about rewards or special discount codes for new business they refer. This can be a form on an existing page or even a <span lang=\"EN\">landing page<span lang=\"EN\"> where they input their and the referrer&#8217;s information. To make the process simple and enticing, provide them with a clear outline that states their reward and how they can redeem it.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/referral-marketing-ideas-landing-page-1.png\" alt=\"referral marketing ideas\u2014example of referral form on website\" width=\"800\" height=\"856\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/referralrock.com\/blog\/landing-page\/\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>2. Hand out referral cards<\/h3>\n<p>Another strategy that can have you reapin&#8217; in the referrals is through referral cards. These simple cards are perfect for handing out to customers upon purchasing so they can then share them with friends and family. You can decide on the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/13\/sales-promotion-examples\">special offer or discount<\/a> which is redeemable to anyone who has the card and makes a purchase. And you can track them by asking for the name of the referring customers. This will allow you to provide an extra reward to the customer that refers the most customers in a time period.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/referral-marketing-referral-card-1.png\" alt=\"referral marketing ideas\u2014example of business card promoting referral program\" width=\"747\" height=\"413\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>3. Use referral apps<\/h3>\n<p>If your business has a mobile app, incorporating a rewards program into the interface is a good move. Did you know that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ciodive.com\/news\/70-of-internet-traffic-comes-from-mobile-phones\/510120\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">70% of internet traffic comes from mobile phones<\/a>? Plus, consumers have access to their social media feeds and contacts in just a few taps. Some referral program apps for small businesses include <a href=\"https:\/\/invitebox.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">InviteBox<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.referralcandy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Referral Candy<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/paykickstart.com\/affiliate-management\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PayKickstart<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/referral-marketing-referral-candy-1.jpg\" alt=\"referral marketing ideas\u2014referral program apps\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.referralcandy.com\/blog\/sloyalty-integration\/\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>4. Build relationships with other businesses<\/h3>\n<p>At the end of the day, every business wants to make money. Whether you want to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/25\/networking-strategies\">network<\/a> through LinkedIn or attend local functions, building relationships with businesses that have the same target audience as you (though not competing with your product or service) is a great way to create a steady stream of new customer referrals.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Run a referral contest<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">You can implement a standalone referral contest or use one to augment and remind customers of your current referral program. Spread the word about your contest on your website, through <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/03\/email-marketing-best-practices\">email blasts<\/a>, and on social media. There are many referral contest ideas that can be found online, but standard contests most commonly offer exclusive prizes or cash bonuses after a certain number of referrals is achieved. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Markers can be placed at 10, 20, 50, or 100 referrals, for example. You can also offer a bonus for the person who refers the most people during the contest. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/referral-marketing-referral-contest-1.png\" alt=\"referral marketing ideas\u2014referral contest on facebook\" width=\"600\" height=\"751\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>6. Seasonal\/event referral campaigns<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">A great way to kick up excitement for your referral program is to offer a seasonal or event-related contest or campaign. Papa John\u2019s, for example, is famous for offering discounts on its pizzas on game days. Occasionally, they\u2019ll offer special bonuses if you refer a friend who buys a pizza in football season. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Rocket Mortgage recently ran a squares contest during the Super Bowl in which registrants started out with one square, but could get an additional square for every friend they referred\u2014with a maximum of ten.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/referral-program-ideas-rocket-mortgage-1.png\" alt=\"referral program ideas\u2014rocket mortgage superbowl referral program\" width=\"800\" height=\"303\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>7. Patient referral programs<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Businesses who work with patients like dentists and chiropractors are sometimes limited to what they can do in terms of referral programs. If giving a discount isn&#8217;t an option due to insurance entanglements and what not, try giving out a gift card\u2014maybe even to a neighboring business across the street!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/referral-marketing-patient-referral-1.png\" alt=\"referral marketing ideas\u2014patient referral instagram post \" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>8. Holiday referral offers<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The holiday season is the most popular for shopping. Starting with Black Friday and all the way through to Christmas and New Years,\u00a0consumers are emptying their wallets for gifts, winter items, and more. It\u2019s a great time to recruit new customers! Huckberry, an <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/08\/how-to-build-an-ecommerce-website\">ecommerce site<\/a>, ran a short referral contest prior to holiday season offering referrers the opportunity to win a first-class ticket home, with a pack of Huckberry swag to boot!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">While this is a big-ticket item, you can easily do the same by offering referrers a special holiday-themed product or mini service for referring another customer to your business during the holiday season. Or, in the spirit of giving, part of the reward could be a donation to a particular charity in the referrer\u2019s name.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/referral-marketing-holiday-referral-1.png\" alt=\"referral marketing ideas\u2014holiday referral program\" width=\"800\" height=\"346\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>9. Social gifting referrals<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Here&#8217;s a client referral program type that is gaining in\u00a0popularity.\u00a0What is social gifting? Some referral programs offer no monetary or financial reward. Instead, the incentive for the referrer is pure altruism.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Subscription boxes, for example, offer referrers an exclusive code that they can use to gift\u00a0a free trial to a certain number of friends. This lets the referrer spread the love to anyone of their choice, who can cash in at no cost. And chances are, they&#8217;re going to pick the friends, coworkers, and family members to whom the gift will benefit best.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">After experiencing a free trial of your offering, they are more\u00a0likely to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/07\/marketing-funnel\">convert into returning customers<\/a>.\u00a0Just make sure they don&#8217;t get looped into an automatic renewal situation where they get charged if they don&#8217;t cancel. That&#8217;s a bad look for both the referrer and your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">10. Give-to-get referrals<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Your customers are more likely to refer a friend if both parties receive benefits. For example,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.referralcandy.com\/blog\/dropbox-referral-program\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DropBox<\/a> ran a \u201cgive-to-get\u201d program that helped increase their registered user base from 100,000 users to 4 million over the span of just 15 months<span lang=\"EN\">.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/referral-marketing-dropbox-1.png\" alt=\"referral marketing ideas\u2014give-to-get referral program example dropbox\" width=\"800\" height=\"378\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.referralcandy.com\/blog\/47-referral-programs\/\">Image source<\/a><\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This tactic works very well if you have an <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/18\/ecommerce-tools-for-local-business\">ecommerce business<\/a> because it\u2019s so easy to make the referral. Simply asking your customer to enter in a friend\u2019s email address to reap the benefits of the recommendation is a no-brainer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">You may opt to hold off on administering the referral benefits until a specific action is taken. For example, your referral program offers the referrer a $15 credit toward their next purchase while the referred gets $15 off their first purchase with a minimum order amount of $50. This increases the odds that both parties will eventually make a purchase since the benefit is only applicable if they spend money with you. It&#8217;s a win-win.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/referral-marketing-win-win-1.png\" alt=\"referral marketing ideas\u2014happy bear\" width=\"500\" height=\"289\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Victory demonstration courtesy of Alfred Forns.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">11. Point system referrals<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This is a simple referral program to run and fits just about any business model. Essentially, you award points to customers for sending you referrals. The points should be redeemable for benefits or activities that <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/30\/social-media-engagement\">get your clients more engaged with your business<\/a>. For example, if you run a small gym, your client may redeem points for inviting a friend to a class, a free tour, or an event, and points can be used for a free personal training session or branded gear.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/referral-marketing-points-system-1.jpg\" alt=\"referral marketing ideas\u2014gym referral program with points\" width=\"800\" height=\"677\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">You can also award extra\u00a0points if the referral turns into a paying customer. Once the referral makes their first purchase, award your client additional points or benefits so their one-time action sees multiple rewards at various stages. This not only keeps your original client engaged with your business but motivates them to encourage their friends to spend money with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">12. Month-long campaigns<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Turning the referral process into a campaign with a catchy name can generate excitement and increase participation. Verafin, a fraud detection company,<a href=\"https:\/\/influitive.com\/blog\/how-to-get-high-quality-leads-by-gamifying-your-referral-marketing-strategy\/\"> ran a month-long campaign<\/a>\u00a0called Referral Rally<span lang=\"EN\">. They maximized results by creating\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/31\/email-marketing-with-buyer-personas\">customer personas<\/a> and providing three different\u00a0ways to submit their referral (email, social media, etc.)\u2014with how-tos on each method.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/referral-marketing-referral20rally-1.png\" alt=\"referral marketing ideas\u2014referral rally example\" width=\"800\" height=\"741\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Choose a different winner every week to keep people interested over the life of the program. At the end of the campaign, Verafin provided various prizes customers could use their points to purchase \u2013 think tickets at an arcade.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>13. Stackable rewards<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If you have a subscription-based product requiring monthly dues, stackable rewards are very enticing to your users. Examples of businesses whose customers would benefit most from a stackable rewards program would be:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Gyms<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Lash bars<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Massage therapists<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Children\u2019s classes (swim class, gymnastics, music lessons, etc)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Offer the referring party and the referee permanent <span lang=\"EN\">discounts<span lang=\"EN\"> on their monthly dues for as long as both parties are members. You may choose to stop here but the program becomes \u201cstackable\u201d if the customer receives that benefit for every successful <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/06\/referral-marketing\">referral<\/a> they provide. The idea is they could eventually pay $0 for your services and you would have at least 10 new customers. Remember, that benefit only lasts as long as both parties are active members.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>14. Exclusive perks<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">While we may not all be Elon Musks, we can certainly take a tip or two from his <span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tesla.com\/support\/referral-program\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tesla referral program<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">. Offering exclusive perks\u2014the type that money can\u2019t buy\u2014is a tremendous incentive to produce referrals. Benefits for passing on quality referrals range from straight cash to (here\u2019s the exclusive part) an invitation to their next VIP unveiling event and an early access token to be one of the first Tesla owners to have a Solar Roof installed. They even <span lang=\"EN\">created a Facebook page<span lang=\"EN\"> dedicated to the program.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/referral-marketing-tesla-1.png\" alt=\"referral marketing ideas\u2014tesla exclusive perks\" width=\"800\" height=\"894\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Ok, so how do we turn this into something a small business can use?\u00a0Customer events are likely part of your marketing mix. Think about holding an exclusive customer appreciation event, by invite only, for customers who have sent you a predetermined number of quality referrals. Be sure to<span lang=\"EN\"> spice the event up <span lang=\"EN\">to motivate your customers by having killer giveaways, a keynote speaker, special guests, and interesting activities.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Land quality customers and increase sales through referral programs<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As you now know, customers attained through referral marketing are of the highest long-term value for your business.
