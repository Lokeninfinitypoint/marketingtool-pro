Google offers a variety of Smart Bidding strategies that can allow you to drive more conversions at a cost you are comfortable with. However, if you want to take that strategy to the next level and focus solely on driving a positive return on investment, you may want to consider Target ROAS (tROAS) bidding. This automated bidding strategy isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all solution to making every advertiser money on Google Ads, however, for many, it can make a huge impact. In this post, I will dive into:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is Target ROAS?<\/li>\n<li>Who should use it<\/li>\n<li>How to set your tROAS<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;ll also be sharing tips throughout to get the most out of your budget.

It&#8217;s ROI, where the investment is your spend on ads\u2014in this case, Google Ads. You can measure ROAS at the account, campaign, ad group, and ad level in Google Ads. In the case of bidding strategies, these are set at the portfolio, campaign, or ad group level.<\/p>\n<h2><span>The path to Target ROAS<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span>In order to truly understand tROAS, you need to understand its relatives on the bidding strategy evolutionary tree.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Max Conversions<\/h3>\n<p><span>Maximize Conversions or \u201cMax Conversions\u201d is an automated bid strategy that is designed to get you as many conversions as possible within your daily budget. This automated setting has a number of pros and cons that I won&#8217;t go too far into in this post\u2014you can find the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/19\/google-ads-automated-bidding\">pros and cons of every automated bidding strategy here<\/a>)\u2014but I will say that <strong>conversion quality is not taken into consideration <\/strong>when using this bidding strategy as Google bids aggressively for you in order to drive as many conversions as possible.

Outside of intelligent campaign planning and structure, the most important factor in efficient Smart Bidding is how much data Google is receiving to make the proper optimizations for you.<\/p>\n<p>Correctly establishing the proper tracking is half the battle when it comes to running successful tROAS campaigns. You will want to make the necessary adjustments at the ad group level as well as make data-driven decisions in regards to the ROAS percentage that you are trying to accomplish. Google Ads is a marathon, not a race, and it is important to keep this in mind if your efforts don\u2019t appear to be successful on the first try.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google Ads Smart Bidding can sometimes make us feel&#8230;not very smart.
