It often takes multiple encounters with a business before a person becomes a customer, so with their contact information, you can initiate these encounters\u2014and make them impressionable\u2014through useful content.<\/p>\n<p>The idea is to build trust and stay top of mind so that eventually, when these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/hot-leads-vs-cold-leads\">hot leads<\/a> are ready to buy, they choose you.<\/p>\n<p>Lead generation is especially important for businesses that involve:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Big ticket purchases: real estate, financial services, solar<\/li>\n<li>High returns on new leads: law firms<\/li>\n<li>Slower sales cycle: B2B SaaS<\/li>\n<li>Ecommerce: coupons<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a id=\"basics\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>How to generate leads: The basics<\/h2>\n<p>Every lead generation strategy is going to look different from business to business, but regardless, there are four fundamentals that apply across the board.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Offer<\/h3>\n<p>Every lead generation strategy needs something that your prospective leads feel is worth exchanging their contact information for\u2014also known as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/15\/lead-magnet-ideas\">lead magnet<\/a>. In addition to being of value, make sure it\u2019s also relevant to your products and services so that you\u2019re attracting quality leads.<\/p>\n<p>Examples of offers include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Content (reports, checklists, guides, cheat sheets)<\/li>\n<li>Free tools (calculators, graders, quizzes)<\/li>\n<li>Newsletters<\/li>\n<li>Swag<\/li>\n<li>Free trials<\/li>\n<li>Demos<\/li>\n<li>Free consults<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-generate-leads-lead-magnets.png\" alt=\"how to generate leads - lead magnet examples\" width=\"546\" height=\"517\" class=\" wp-image-67927 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-generate-leads-lead-magnets.png 546w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-generate-leads-lead-magnets-480x455.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 546px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The best offer will vary depending on the channel you&#8217;re promoting it on (such as your website, search engines, or social media), the segment of your audience you are targeting, and their intent and mindset.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Landing page and form<\/h3>\n<p>Your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/great-landing-pages\">landing page<\/a> is the page the person lands on after clicking the call to action button for the offer. This page contains all of features and benefits of the offer, plus the form the user fills out to obtain it.<\/p>\n<p>Tips for your lead generation landing pages:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure the messaging is the same as the ad or piece of content leading to it.<\/li>\n<li>Keep form fields to a minimum.<\/li>\n<li>Test your forms to make sure they populate leads in your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/09\/crm-for-small-business\">CRM<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Use anything BUT \u201csubmit\u201d as your<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/20\/call-to-action-buttons\"> CTA button language<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/05\/perfectly-optimized-landing-page-wordstream.png\" alt=\"a perfectly optimized landing page\" width=\"402\" height=\"647\" class=\"wp-image-65458 aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>3. Thank you page<\/h3>\n<p>The<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/23\/thank-you-page-examples\"> thank you page<\/a> is where the user lands after submitting their contact information. You achieve this by making the URL for the form submit button the thank you page.<\/p>\n<p>A good thank you page has the following qualities:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Confirms for your potential customer that the transaction is complete.<\/li>\n<li>Thanks them for their interest in your business.<\/li>\n<li>Contains the offer such as a link to a PDF or the steps to obtain it (like check your inbox).<\/li>\n<li>Promotes a secondary offer.<\/li>\n<li>Tracks conversions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>4. Tracking and CRM<\/h3>\n<p>Generating leads is only the first step. You need to follow up with them and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ehanced-cpc-going-away\">nurture them<\/a> so they become customers. If you have a small business, a spreadsheet may do. But even then, it\u2019s hard to keep track of each individual lead\u2019s journey. And this is important because you want to cater your communication to whichever stage they\u2019re at, and whatever touchpoint brought them to your business. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/09\/crm-for-small-business\">customer relationship management<\/a> (CRM) or <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-lead-management\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lead management<\/a> software can help you automate personalized and meaningful communication.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-generate-leads-lead-management-example.jpeg\" alt=\"how to generate leads - lead management example\" width=\"720\" height=\"408\" class=\"size-full wp-image-67926 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-generate-leads-lead-management-example.jpeg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-generate-leads-lead-management-example-480x272.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\n<a id=\"how\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>How to generate leads with your website<\/h2>\n<p>While there are many<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/lead-generation-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> ways to generate leads for your business<\/a> off your website, the majority of your leads will be captured on it. The idea is to optimize each page for lead generation and then drive relevant traffic to your site.<\/p>\n<h3>Step #1: Optimize your website to generate leads<\/h3>\n<p>Ideally, every page on your website should provide an opportunity for a visitor to become a lead. This can be done in a tasteful way using a mix of strategies. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Anchor text:<\/strong> Plain old text links in the body copy of your pages can capture high-intent leads who are actually reading your content line by line.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Buttons:<\/strong> Be sure to use active language and appropriate color contrast so they stand out.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Embedded forms:<\/strong> Rather than always sending users to a landing page, you can embed one- or two-field forms right on a page of your site, such as at the bottom or side rail for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/05\/increase-email-signups\">newsletter signup<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Chatbots:<\/strong> Before connecting a user to a live person, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/26\/how-to-use-chatbots-for-lead-generation\">use a chatbot to collect their information<\/a> in case of disconnect. Or you can have a bot promoting an offer that captures the information and shares the offer all in that one chat.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Popups:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/26\/pop-up-strategy\">[Non-annoying] pop-ups<\/a> are great for capturing leads. They can have a form embedded right in them or link to a landing page. Popup software that allows you to cater offers to particular blog categories and page targeting is ideal.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sticky widgets:<\/strong> Sidebars and bottom rails that persist no matter which page a user is on.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-generate-leads-sticky-sidebar.png\" alt=\"how to generate leads - sticky sidebar offer example\" width=\"720\" height=\"564\" class=\"size-full wp-image-67928 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-generate-leads-sticky-sidebar.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-generate-leads-sticky-sidebar-480x376.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Step #2: Match offer with intent<\/h3>\n<p>Keep in mind that a visitor&#8217;s intent will be different on different pages of your site, so cater your offers accordingly.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Homepage:<\/strong> Your homepage should have a prominent call to action for your main product or service above the fold, with secondary lead-generating offers below the fold. However, if you are a lead gen-focused business, your primary offer may be a lead-focused offer such as a free consult or trial.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Contact us page: <\/strong>The only lead-generating offer on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/11\/contact-us-page\">your contact us page<\/a> should be a contact form. Rather than providing an email address, replace it with a form that will send a notification to your email.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Products and services page: <\/strong>Be careful with your products and services pages. The main CTA on these pages should be to purchase the product or service, but you might want to use a live chat widget for those who may have questions before committing.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Testimonials page. <\/strong>Your<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/19\/customer-testimonial-examples\"> testimonials page<\/a> will attract well-qualified traffic, but you may not want to interrupt their research process with other offers. You might leave a chat widget on this page or test out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/18\/gated-content\">gating your success stories<\/a>. Those who care enough to fill out a form to view the story are going to be highly interested in your business.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Blog posts: <\/strong>Intent to buy on your blog is going to be lower than intent to learn. Your lead magnets on your blog posts should be lower-funnel, such as guides, checklists, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/11\/call-to-action-examples-for-email-newsletter-signups\">newsletter signups<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/content-marketing-funnel.png\" alt=\"content marketing funnel\" width=\"496\" height=\"443\" class=\"wp-image-59654 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/content-marketing-funnel.png 496w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/content-marketing-funnel-480x429.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 496px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Step #3: Drive traffic to your lead-generating website<\/h3>\n<p>Once your website is optimized to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usehatchapp.com\/blog\/how-to-generate-leads-home-improvement-business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">generate leads<\/a>, now it\u2019s time to optimize it to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/14\/increase-traffic-to-my-website\">generate traffic<\/a>.

Take a look:<\/p>\n<h3>Run conversion campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>Rather than sending people to your website to just come across your lead magnets (like guides, checklists, and free tools), you can directly promote those offers using paid media campaigns through search, social, display, and YouTube ads. These are the &#8220;conversion&#8221; campaigns I talked about a little bit ago. Be sure to create dedicated landing pages for those offers, catered to that channel and that specific target audience.<\/p>\n<p>Why spend money to generate leads rather than customers? Because you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/30\/lead-nurturing-campaign-emails\">nurture these leads<\/a>. And with the targeting capabilities of online advertising, you can capture highly qualified, highly nurturable leads.<\/p>\n<h3>Experiment with lead form ads<\/h3>\n<p>Most ad platforms offer a lead form ad (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/24\/facebook-lead-ad-examples\">Facebook offers lead ads<\/a>, Google offers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/31\/google-lead-form-extensions\">lead form extensions<\/a>), which means that when a user clicks on the ad, they aren&#8217;t directed to a landing page on your site; instead, a form appears right on that platform. This lower-friction approach can be useful in generating higher volumes of leads than with landing page campaigns, but you do have to be mindful of lead quality with these.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-generate-leads-google-lead-form-extensions.png\" alt=\"how to generate leads - lead form ad example on google\" width=\"640\" height=\"411\" class=\"size-full wp-image-67968 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-generate-leads-google-lead-form-extensions.png 640w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/how-to-generate-leads-google-lead-form-extensions-480x308.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 640px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Here&#8217;s an example of a lead form ad on Google.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Host contests &amp; giveaways<\/h3>\n<p>Everyone likes free stuff, so what better way to generate leads than by doing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/instagram-giveaways\">contests and giveaways<\/a>? Just be sure to offer something relevant to your business, and to have a way of collecting contest entrant contact information.

To find the right publications for your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/best-print-ad-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">print ads<\/a>, consider the volume and frequency of distribution, the characteristics of its readers, and the cost. Contacting your business via a print ad or postcard may have a little more friction than an online CTA, but you may also find that the people who take the action despite the friction are high-quality leads.<\/p>\n<h3>Send direct mail<\/h3>\n<p>A well-designed and properly targeted postcard or care package can be a great way to stand out from your competitors.
