Instead of only being able to search profiles, hashtags, and locations, <strong>you can now search general keywords<\/strong> and it will show all posts that include those exit words.<\/p>\n<p>This means two things: the first is that the Instagram algorithm has changed. The second is that Instagram SEO needs to be a part of your marketing strategy.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re all familiar SEO for Google, but we must remember that social media platforms have widely used search functions, too! And with this expanded search function on Instagram, optimizing your profile and posts for Insta search is a great way to grow your reach get a leg up on your competition.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-seo-search-results_0-1.png\" alt=\"instagram seo search results\" width=\"350\" height=\"714\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>You&#8217;ll now notice the &#8220;Top&#8221; tab for results, in addition to tags, accounts, and people.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In this guide, we&#8217;re going to cover exactly what Instagram SEO is, why it&#8217;s important, and then provide five steps to optimize your account for search.

And though it may not have the same appeal as <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/30\/instagram-live\">live streams<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/23\/instagram-carousel-ads\">carousel ads<\/a>, it\u2019s as worthy of your time as anything else. By following Instagram SEO best practices \u2014 which we\u2019ll discuss shortly \u2014 <strong>you improve your chances of being discovered by users who are searching keywords related to your business<\/strong>. That means more views, more likes, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/19\/get-more-instagram-followers\">more followers<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s use gardening content as an example. Type \u201cgardening\u201d into the Instagram search bar and you\u2019ll see this:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-seo-gardening_1-1.png\" alt=\"instagram seo\u2014see more option in instagram search\" width=\"400\" height=\"711\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Go ahead and click \u201csee more,\u201d and the list of suggested search queries will expand:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-seo-gardening-see-more-1.png\" alt=\"instagram seo\u2014results for a search for the keyword &quot;gardening&quot;\" width=\"400\" height=\"710\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Selecting \u201cgardening ideas\u201d brings you to this page:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-seo-gardening-ideas-1.png\" alt=\"instagram seo\u2014search results for &quot;gardening ideas&quot;\" width=\"400\" height=\"710\" \/><\/div>\n<p>And if you were to click on the top result \u2014 the image in the top left corner, directly below the word \u201cvegetable\u201d \u2014 you\u2019d be brought to this post:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-seo-gardening-ideas-post-1.png\" alt=\"instagram seo\u2014screenshot of the post that was the first result for &quot;gardening ideas&quot; search \" width=\"400\" height=\"709\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Nice picture, right? Well, if you were to navigate to the page that posted it, you\u2019d see that it belongs to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/05\/instagram-ecommerce\">small business<\/a> \u2014 check out the link in the bio!<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-seo-garden-mylove-1.png\" alt=\"instagram seo\u2014small business bio\" width=\"400\" height=\"710\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Rather than buying an ad, this business made us aware of their merchandise simply by optimizing their content for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">relevant keyword<\/a>: \u201cgardening ideas.\u201d They did this, of course, because they know that users who search for this keyword are likely to be interested in their gardening-related products.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s Instagram SEO in action!<\/p>\n<p>Now, before we go further, we should emphasize that <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/08\/instagram-ads-cost\">buying ads on Instagram<\/a> is an incredibly effective tactic for many businesses. As such, Instagram SEO should be used as a <em>complement <\/em>to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/20\/instagram-advertising\">Instagram advertising<\/a> \u2014 not as a replacement for it.<\/p>\n<p>We should also note that Instagram SEO is not exclusively about individual posts ranking for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/11\/07\/how-to-find-long-tail-keywords\">long-tail keywords<\/a> (e.g., gardening ideas). Let\u2019s take a second look at the suggestions we get when we simply type \u201cgardening\u201d into the search bar:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-seo-gardening-knowhow-1.png\" alt=\"instagram seo\u2014suggestions in search bar\" width=\"400\" height=\"712\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As a user, rather than expanding the list of suggested searches, you could simply go straight to one of these gardening-related profiles. And it\u2019s no accident that these specific profiles are at the top of the list of suggestions. Once again, this is Instagram SEO in action!<\/p>\n<h2>Why is Instagram SEO important?<\/h2>\n<p>Instagram SEO is important because it enables you to connect with people who are actively searching for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/15\/quality-content-defined\">content related to your business\u2014<\/a>not just anywhere, but on one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/11\/most-popular-social-media-platforms\">most popular social media platforms in the world.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Think of it this way: Each time a user types in a keyword that\u2019s related to your business, you have an opportunity to make a positive impression and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/19\/get-more-instagram-followers\">drive high-quality traffic to your profile<\/a> (and your website). Instagram SEO is the key to capitalizing on these opportunities \u2014 the key to engaging prospective customers who are more likely than others to convert.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s all well and good, but there\u2019s a crucial question we need to address: Do people actually use Instagram to interact with businesses in this fashion? Is it really worthwhile to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/19\/get-on-first-page-google\">optimize your content in order to rank higher in the search results<\/a>?<\/p>\n<p>Yes and yes. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/adespresso.com\/blog\/instagram-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AdEspresso<\/a>, more than 200 million Instagram users visit a business profile on a daily basis. 66% of those visits come from users who do not yet follow the profiles they\u2019re visiting. Plus, 60% of all Instagram users say they\u2019ve learned about <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/29\/how-to-promote-a-product\">new products<\/a> through the platform.<\/p>\n<p>Evidently, many people \u2014 your prospects included \u2014 see Instagram as a way to discover new businesses, new brands, and new products.<\/p>\n<p>To be fair, searching for specific keywords is only one of several ways that users discover new businesses. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/22\/best-instagram-ads\">Instagram ads<\/a> drive discovery, and the Explore tab does, too. Instagram SEO, in other words, is not the be-all and end-all.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-seo-moment-1.png\" alt=\"instagram seo\u2014example instagram story with &quot;swipe up&quot; \" width=\"400\" height=\"710\" \/><\/div>\n<p>It is, however, the only way to organically connect with prospects who show an active interest in your content\/business. Ads are not organic, and they do not connect you with proactive prospects. Discovery via the Explore tab is organic, but, again, there is no element of proactivity.<\/p>\n<p>Now that we understand the value that Instagram SEO presents to marketers, here are four tips to help you successfully execute it at your company.<\/p>\n<h2>4 tips to help you succeed with Instagram SEO<\/h2>\n<p>As we walk through these tips, keep in mind the ultimate goal: Getting your profile and individual posts to rank as high as possible for the keywords you care about.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Identify and prioritize your keywords<\/h3>\n<p>Which keywords do you want to rank for? An answer to this question is absolutely necessary before you make a single change to your Instagram profile\/content.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Use keyword research tools<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You can use regular keyword research tools to come up with Instagram keywords, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>WordStream&#8217;s <a href=\"\/keywords\">Free keyword tool<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEMRush<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ahrefs<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Just keep in mind that what your followers search for\u00a0on Instagram may not be the same as what they\u00a0search for on Google.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In that regard, it may be best to use hashtag research tools, like<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keyword.io&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/keywordtool.io\/instagram\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram hashtag tool<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Ingramer&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/ingramer.com\/tools\/instagram-hashtag-generator\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hashtag Generator Tool<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-seo-hashtag-search-tool-1.png\" alt=\"hashtag generator tool for instagram seo\" width=\"800\" height=\"464\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ingramer.com\/tools\/instagram-hashtag-generator\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Distinguish between broad and specific keywords<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As you\u2019re brainstorming, make sure to distinguish between relatively broad keywords \u2014 a.k.a. head terms \u2014 and relatively specific keywords \u2014 a.k.a. long-tail keywords.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Head terms (e.g., gardening) are searched frequently, and they typically indicate low commercial intent in the mind of the user.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/11\/07\/how-to-find-long-tail-keywords\">Long-tail keywords<\/a> (e.g., gardening ideas) are searched infrequently, and they typically indicate high commercial intent in the mind of the user.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Which is more important to you: increasing traffic to your profile, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/15\/selling-on-instagram\">driving more conversions<\/a>? If it\u2019s the former, you\u2019re probably going to prioritize head terms over long-tail keywords. If it\u2019s the latter, you\u2019ll likely do the reverse.<\/p>\n<p>You could argue that these two objectives go hand-in-hand\u2014 i.e., you want to increase traffic to your profile in order to drive more conversions. It\u2019s a fair point, and most of you will end up optimizing your profile\/content for both head terms and long-tail keywords. As we\u2019ll discuss shortly, however, not all optimizations carry the same weight \u2014 and that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to establish your priorities from the jump.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Pro tip:<\/strong> If you\u2019re having trouble brainstorming keywords, simply open up the Instagram search bar and start typing words related to your business.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>2. Establish KPIs to measure impact<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s one more question you need to answer before you start optimizing: How are you going to measure the impact of your Instagram SEO efforts? Measuring impact is an essential part of the process, as it enables you to determine which optimizations are (un)successful.<\/p>\n<p>To set yourself up for success, make sure to establish a few key performance indicators (<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/17\/content-marketing-kpis\">KPIs<\/a>). With Instagram Insights \u2014 the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/01\/instagram-analytics\">native analytics tool<\/a> that comes with your business profile \u2014 you can track KPIs such as these (both at the profile level and the individual post level):<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Impressions<\/li>\n<li>Reach<\/li>\n<li>Profile visits<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/19\/get-more-instagram-followers\">Followers<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Website clicks<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-seo-metrics-1.png\" alt=\"instagram seo\u2014reporting through instagram insights\" width=\"400\" height=\"713\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Via <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.socialmediaexaminer.com\/4-ways-to-use-instagram-insights-to-improve-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Social Media Examiner<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Once you know which KPIs you\u2019re going to track, you\u2019ll be able to measure the impact yielded by your optimizations.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Optimize your profile (username &amp; bio)<\/h3>\n<p>Now that you know (1) which keywords you\u2019re going to target and (2) how you\u2019re going to track your ROI, it\u2019s time to optimize both your profile as a whole and your individual posts.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s begin with your profile as a whole \u2014 we\u2019re going to optimize your username and your bio. (Remember when we said not all optimizations carry the same weight? Well, your username and your bio are the heavy hitters; optimizing these two assets can make a huge impact). Your username is straightforward: You need to incorporate the keyword you consider most valuable. Clearly, the person who owns this profile wants to rank for \u201cgardening ideas.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-seo-gardening-ideas-tips-1.png\" alt=\"instagram seo\u2014keyword in username\" width=\"400\" height=\"710\" \/><\/div>\n<p>For some of you, this may cause concern: What if you already have a well-established business name \u2014 one that doesn\u2019t include your primary target keyword? Fortunately, Instagram allows you to differentiate between your business name and your username:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-seo-homegardeninginstyle-1.png\" alt=\"instagram seo\u2014screenshot of profile with username and business name\" width=\"400\" height=\"713\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If possible, try to incorporate both your brand name and your primary target keyword into your username. For example, if you were the owner of an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/05\/ecommerce-digital-marketing\">ecommerce business<\/a> called Nellie\u2019s and you were trying to rank for \u201cwinter hats,\u201d your Instagram username could be \u201cwinterhatsbynellie\u201d or \u201cnellieswinterhats.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/09\/instagram-bios\">Optimizing your Instagram bio<\/a> is equally straightforward: This is your opportunity to target any high-value keywords that didn\u2019t quite make the cut for your username. The owner of this profile, for example, wants to rank for \u201cgardening tips.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-seo-gardeningknowhow-gardening-tips-1.png\" alt=\"instagram seo\u2014keyword in bio description\" width=\"400\" height=\"710\" \/><\/div>\n<p>With your username and bio optimized, your Instagram profile as a whole should be in good shape. Now, let\u2019s wrap up by discussing the optimization of your individual posts.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Optimize your individual posts (captions, hashtags)<\/h3>\n<p>Is optimizing each individual post as important as optimizing your username and bio? No, probably not. But let\u2019s recall the original example we used to illustrate Instagram SEO in action.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-seo-gardening-ideas-mylove.ins_-1.png\" alt=\"instagram seo-keyword in caption\" width=\"400\" height=\"712\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Had the person who posted this picture not used the caption to target \u201cgardening ideas,\u201d we may have never come across their profile, their website, or their products. That\u2019s a big deal! And considering the minuscule effort required to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/23\/instagram-captions\">optimize your captions<\/a>, there\u2019s no reason not to do it.<\/p>\n<p>As you can see, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/29\/instagram-hashtags\">hashtagging<\/a> played a role in getting this post to rank for \u201cgardening ideas.\u201d However, this clearly wasn\u2019t the only keyword being targeted by the person behind the post.<\/p>\n<p>In general, when you\u2019re optimizing an individual post, you should:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the main body of the caption to target a specific high-value keyword<\/li>\n<li>Use hashtags to reinforce that keyword <strong>and <\/strong>target ancillary keywords<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As an example, if you wanted to further optimize the post that ranks for \u201cgardening ideas,\u201d you could add a second sentence to the main body of the caption: \u201cGorgeous rooftop garden in New York. Check out our profile for more #gardeningideas!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The more descriptive you are in your caption, the better optimized your post is for Instagram SEO. While the algorithm really only supports general terms right now, there&#8217;s no doubt in our minds that it will become more and more advanced over time.<\/p>\n<p>And speaking of time, you may want to consider <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/12\/01\/best-time-to-post-on-instagram\">posting at the right time<\/a> to gain favor with the Instagram algorithm.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Add alt text to images<\/h3>\n<p>You know about alt text for website and blog<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/08\/image-seo\"> image optimization<\/a>, but you may not know that you can add it for your Insta images too. Once you&#8217;ve added an image and are brought to the caption screen, head to the bottom and select &#8220;Advanced Settings&#8221;.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-seo-alt-text-1.png\" alt=\"how to add alt text to images for instagram seo\" width=\"400\" height=\"568\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/later.com\/blog\/instagram-seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Scroll down to the &#8220;Accessibility&#8221; section and add your alt text from there.<\/p>\n<p>Not only does this make your posts\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/30\/email-accessibility\">accessible<\/a>, but it also enhances your Instagram SEO.<\/p>\n<h2>Don\u2019t neglect Instagram SEO!<\/h2>\n<p>Instagram SEO is a no-cost, high-impact tactic for anyone who wants to grow their reach, increase traffic to their profile\/website, and drive more conversions.
