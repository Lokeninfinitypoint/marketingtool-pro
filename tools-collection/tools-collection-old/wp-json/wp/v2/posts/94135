It\u2019s constantly trying to balance the best quality ad for the user while also showing ads that will provide the platform with the most ad revenue.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why your keyword <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/19\/does-quality-score-still-matter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quality Score<\/a> plays a role in Google Ads budget and bid planning. The better your ad relevance, expected click-through rate, and landing page experience (the three factors that go into Quality Score), the less you\u2019ll have to pay per click. This is because Google\u2019s algorithm views your ad as one that provides a higher-quality experience for its users\u2014making them want to come back to Google for more.<\/p>\n<p>All that to say, <strong>your Google Ads budget should reflect how you expect to perform in the ad auction<\/strong>.
