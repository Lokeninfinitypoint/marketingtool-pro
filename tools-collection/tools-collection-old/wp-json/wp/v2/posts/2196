Read on to learn how to write CTAs that drive conversions no matter where they are (see what we did there?).<\/p>\n<h3>1. Use a strong verb to start your CTA<\/h3>\n<p>You don\u2019t have a ton of space to get your point across. Don\u2019t dilly or dally. Let your audience know exactly what you want them to do by leading each <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/20\/call-to-action-buttons\">CTA button<\/a> with an action verb.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/call-to-action-example-lockin.jpg\" alt=\"call to action - screenshot of a call to action page promoting free gift\" width=\"936\" height=\"571\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76601 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/call-to-action-example-lockin.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/call-to-action-example-lockin-480x293.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There are different action verbs depending on the type of business you run and what you want your customer to do. Here are a few ideas:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>For an ecommerce website:<\/strong> Start your CTA with words like \u201cbuy,\u201d \u201cshop,\u201d or \u201corder\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>If you\u2019re promoting a newsletter or piece of content:<\/strong> Start your CTA with words like \u201cdownload\u201d or \u201csubscribe\u201d<\/li>\n<li><b>For a service-based business:<\/b> Try CTAs that begin with \u201ccall now\u201d or \u201cbook your appointment.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>What you don\u2019t want is to simply say something exists. \u201cOur newest fashions are available\u201d won\u2019t stir people to action, whereas \u201cclick here for the latest trends\u201d feels kinetic and is more likely to improve your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/click-through-rate\">click-through rate<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Include words that provoke emotion or enthusiasm<\/h3>\n<p>If you want more clicks and conversions, you need to elicit a strong response from your audience. An enthusiastic CTA that taps into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/03\/emotional-marketing-copy\">emotional copywriting<\/a> is just the thing to get it done.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/call-to-action-example-donedone.jpg\" alt=\"call to action - screenshot of a landing page from brand Done Done\" width=\"817\" height=\"583\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76602 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/call-to-action-example-donedone.jpg 817w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/call-to-action-example-donedone-480x343.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 817px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say someone is looking to book a trip with their family. They come across a CTA like \u201cplan your dream vacation today!\u201d That\u2019ll get them hyped and thinking about what their dream vacation looks like. They\u2019ll eagerly click the link in your ad.<\/p>\n<p>Some other ways your CTAs can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/13\/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing\">tap into emotion include<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reducing risk and insecurity<\/li>\n<li>Building trust<\/li>\n<li>Creating urgency<\/li>\n<li>Communication value<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Don\u2019t forget punctuation. Add an exclamation point to the end of your CTA to max out the excitement. It\u2019ll make your CTA pop and give it a little extra kick.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Give your audience a reason to act<\/h3>\n<p>In other words, tell people what\u2019s in it for them if they click. Will it help them do their jobs better, lose weight, or save money? This will tie in heavily with your value proposition, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/07\/unique-selling-proposition\">unique selling point<\/a> (USP). Your USP is arguably one of the most important pieces of acquiring new leads, so creating a nice USP\/CTA mash-up is a great way to increase clicks.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/call-to-action-example-slider.jpg\" alt=\"call to action - screenshot of landing page with CTA from brand slider\" width=\"842\" height=\"589\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76603 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/call-to-action-example-slider.jpg 842w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/call-to-action-example-slider-480x336.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 842px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A good <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/13\/call-to-action-examples\">example of a call to action<\/a> here would be something like \u201ccall us to start saving money today!\u201d Not only have you stated the action you want the user to take (call today), but you have also provided them with a reason why they should take that action (save money).<\/p>\n<h3>4. Take advantage of FOMO<\/h3>\n<p>This is actually one of my favorite tactics when it comes to a successful CTA. Fear of missing out, otherwise known as <a href=\"http:\/\/psychcentral.com\/blog\/archives\/2011\/04\/14\/fomo-addiction-the-fear-of-missing-out\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FOMO<\/a>, is an extremely effective motivator. When people think they might lose out on an opportunity that might not come around again, they\u2019ll be mighty quick to hop on the bandwagon.<\/p>\n<p>One of the best uses of FOMO in your CTA is to mention a sale or promotion that your company is holding, and which won\u2019t last forever.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/call-to-action-example-curbside-1.jpg\" alt=\"call to action - Screenshot of an ad with CTA for shop now\" width=\"370\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76604 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/call-to-action-example-curbside-1.jpg 370w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/call-to-action-example-curbside-1-185x300.jpg 185w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You probably get emails with this sort of messaging all the time, I know I sure do. I\u2019m talking about messaging like \u201cShop today! Sale ends on Monday,\u201d perhaps during a three-day weekend. Or even \u201cbuy now while supplies last!\u201d during the holiday season. It\u2019s tough to ignore a prompt like that, especially during a time-sensitive, under-the-gun type of situation (e.g. the Christmas season).<\/p>\n<p>Similar to provoking enthusiasm as we discussed earlier, provoking fear of missing out in your CTA is sure to get you some additional clicks.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Match CTA to device type<\/h3>\n<p>Creating a killer call-to-action is important, that\u2019s no secret. But I also urge you to consider customizing your CTA based on the device being used by your audience. Google considers <a href=\"http:\/\/searchengineland.com\/the-real-reason-why-google-is-dropping-the-tablet-vs-desktop-distinction-its-the-user-context-stupid-149738\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">desktop and tablet as the same device<\/a>, since the screen sizes are roughly the same. People also use them for search in similar scenarios.<\/p>\n<p>For example, someone sitting on the couch at night sees an ad on TV for a product they\u2019re interested in. It\u2019s common for them to grab their laptop or tablet and search for more information on it. It might be best to lead them with a \u201clearn more\u201d or \u201cshop now\u201d CTA.<\/p>\n<p>However, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/18\/mobile-ad-strategies\">mobile devices tend to have different user behavior<\/a> and search intent than desktop\/tablets. Since <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/local-seo-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">80%<\/a> of searches for local business on mobile devices convert, it\u2019s prudent to tailor your CTA based on device..<\/p>\n<p>One big difference between desktop and mobile is that on mobile, people have the ability to place a call from the device they\u2019re shopping with. My advice is to create more phone call-centric CTAs that appear on mobile devices, especially for service-based businesses. This lawn care company has a clickable phone number on their landing page.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/call-to-action-example-landscape.jpg\" alt=\"call to action - screenshot of a landscapers website with clickable phone number\" width=\"356\" height=\"595\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76605 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/call-to-action-example-landscape.jpg 356w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/call-to-action-example-landscape-179x300.jpg 179w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Some possible <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/powerful-call-to-action-phrases\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CTA phrases<\/a> to try could be \u201ccall now to get started\u201d or \u201ccall us today for more information\u201d to guide your target audience to take the action you want them to take.<\/p>\n<h3>6. A\/B test your CTAs<\/h3>\n<p>A good, old-fashioned <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/09\/25\/a-b-testing\">A\/B test<\/a> is a great way to identify which CTA\u2019s bring you clicks, and which CTA\u2019s bring you frowns. While your tried and true <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/20\/call-to-action-examples\">calls-to-action<\/a> like the ones we\u2019ve already discussed are always good to use, you really never know how they\u2019ll perform in your account until you actually use them.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/call-to-action-example-dewalt.jpg\" alt=\"call to action - Comparision of two ads from Dewalt\" width=\"926\" height=\"384\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76606 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/call-to-action-example-dewalt.jpg 926w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/call-to-action-example-dewalt-480x199.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 926px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Digital marketing is definitely a game of trial and error (which is why it can be frustrating!), and your calls-to-action are no exception to the rule. Something could look great on paper, or may sound great when a colleague recommends it to you, but the only way you\u2019ll absolutely know for sure if something will work for your account is if you test it out.<\/p>\n<p>Your target audience may not respond well to what could be considered a \u201csurefire CTA,\u201d which is enough to make you pull your hair out. By A\/B testing, you can trial some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2010\/09\/29\/unusual-effective-calls-to-action\">creative CTAs<\/a> and compare them to your old standards. If your target audience isn\u2019t responding well to your ads, you might as well try to think outside the box a bit!<\/p>\n<p>Start with:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check out today\u2019s deals!<\/li>\n<li>Fill out a form to get started<\/li>\n<li>Call today for more information<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And test against:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tons of deals at your fingertips<\/li>\n<li>A healthier life starts now!<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t miss out, call us today!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>7. Add numbers when possible<\/h3>\n<ol start=\"7\"><\/ol>\n<p>We consumers respond well to seeing numbers such as pricing, discounts, promotions, incentives, etc. It helps us to determine whether or not it\u2019s worth splurging on items we desperately want, but probably aren\u2019t essential to everyday life. So when the opportunity arises, why not appeal to your target audience that way?<\/p>\n<p>I am always a big proponent of including pricing information in your ad copy in general, and that includes your CTA. If a user sees your pricing information in your ad, and decides to click through to your site, then you know they are still interested in the product or service you are offering. Now you know you have yourself a valuable click, and an increased chance at generating a conversion.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/call-to-action-example-luna.jpg\" alt=\"call to action - landing page from brand Luna with subscribe CTA\" width=\"557\" height=\"584\" class=\"wp-image-76607 size-full aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/call-to-action-example-luna.jpg 557w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/call-to-action-example-luna-480x503.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 557px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But, if you don\u2019t include your pricing information in your ads, someone may click through to your site, excited about your products\/services, but then get scared off by your prices. Now you have yourself a less than desirable situation. This leads to the dreaded wasted spend in your account, and who wants to deal with that?<\/p>\n<p>Try experimenting with your pricing information in your CTA, as well as any other applicable numerical information. A CTA such as \u201cShop today for TVs under $300!\u201d not only shows a user how little they will pay for a TV, but it also hits on the FOMO element as well (pretty sneaky huh?).<\/p>\n<p>If you run a special promotion for shipping, you could try something like \u201corder by Sunday for 1-day shipping.\u201d Maybe you are an auto body shop looking to incentivize your audience with a discount; your CTA might look something like \u201cBook today! 15% off your next visit.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc4b Want more tips on creating ads that convert?

Be bold in your CTA copy<\/h3>\n<p>This can be a little risqu\u00e9, but adding a dash of brash to your CTA copy can be pretty effective in catching someone\u2019s eye.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/call-to-action-example-unspam.jpg\" alt=\"call to action - screenshot of an ad for a conference with a bold CTA\" width=\"789\" height=\"587\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76608 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/call-to-action-example-unspam.jpg 789w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/call-to-action-example-unspam-480x357.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 789px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>One option that can be tough to pull off is using negative words to motivate a person to change something they are self-conscious about. For example, if I was on Google looking to lose weight and saw a call-to-action such as \u201cend your crappy diet today,\u201d I might just want to click. Sure, it\u2019s a bit over-the-top, which is why I recommend using this technique sparingly, but it definitely commands attention.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s another example. Say I want to fix the brown patches in my lawn. I\u2019m perusing Google and see an ad with a CTA like \u201cyour yard sucks, let us fix it.\u201d Not only would I probably chuckle, but I would also probably click just to see exactly what that lawn company could do for me.
