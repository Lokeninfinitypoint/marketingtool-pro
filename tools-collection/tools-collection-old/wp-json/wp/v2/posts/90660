That\u2019s one reason Google Ads has the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adspolicy\/answer\/15936768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">unfair advantage policy<\/a> in place. It limits the same account from having multiple ads rank in any given auction, and it\u2019s certainly not going anywhere anytime soon.<\/p>\n<p>However, with Google evolving its ad auction approach and individual ad placements having their own <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/google-ads-srun-different-auctions-for-each-ad-location-452749\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">separate auctions<\/a>, the unfair advantage policy is getting a mini facelift. On April 14, 2025, Google will enact a slight change to this policy that, for the first time ever, will allow the same brand to rank in multiple ad locations on the same page.<\/p>\n<p>This is a pretty big change. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the potential repercussions of this update.<\/p>\n<h3>Contents<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#google-ads-unfair-advantage-policy-change\">What\u2019s changing<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#google-ads-unfair-advantage-policy\">What this means for advertisers<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#google-ads-unfair-advantage-policy-tips\">Tips to maintain your Ad Rank<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"google-ads-unfair-advantage-policy-change\"><\/div>\n<h2>What\u2019s changing<\/h2>\n<p>In April 2025, <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adspolicy\/answer\/16083544?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google updated its unfair advantage policy<\/a> so that the limit for the same account showing multiple ads<strong> only applies per single ad location<\/strong>\u2014rather than across <em>all<\/em> locations as the policy previously stated. So, you can have multiple ads for the same business, app, or site in different locations on the same <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/serp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search results page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, Google <a href=\"https:\/\/www.seroundtable.com\/google-ads-double-serving-38595.html#:~:text=Google%20has%20confirmed%20it%20is,PAGE%20In%20The%20SERPS!!!\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">had been testing multiple ads<\/a> from the same brand on the page to provide more opportunities for visibility and clicks for top advertisers. This is just the latest change in a series of other experiments Google has been running in the past year or so, like blending ads with organic results and redefining top ad placements. Between <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ai-overviews\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI Overviews<\/a>, the new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ai-mode\">AI Mode<\/a>, and more, there\u2019s no doubt the standard search results are changing, so with this update, there are more potential placements your business can show.<\/p>\n<p>Here is the full announcement from Google:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOn April 14, 2025, Google will update its Unfair advantage policy to clarify that our prohibition on showing more than one ad at a time for your business, app, or site <strong>applies only to a single ad location<\/strong>. Specifically, the Unfair advantage policy will be updated to read:<\/p>\n<p>The following is not allowed:<\/p>\n<p>Using the Google Network to gain an unfair traffic advantage over other participants in the auction<\/p>\n<p>Examples (non-exhaustive): Affiliates that advertise on Google Ads against the applicable affiliate program rules; trying to show more than one ad for your business, app, or site<strong> in a single ad location<\/strong>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>You can already start to see this update in action. In the example below, there are ads for JustAnswer in the top ad spot and then again further down the page.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-unfair-advantage-policy-update-serp-png.avif\" alt=\"google ads unfair advantage policy - example ad\" width=\"900\" height=\"427\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90674 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-unfair-advantage-policy-update-serp-png.avif 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-unfair-advantage-policy-update-serp-300x142.avif 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-unfair-advantage-policy-update-serp-768x364.avif 768w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-unfair-advantage-policy-update-serp-480x228.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-unfair-advantage-serp-png.avif\" alt=\"google ads unfair advantage policy - serp example\" width=\"900\" height=\"395\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90671\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-unfair-advantage-serp-png.avif 827w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-unfair-advantage-serp-300x132.avif 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-unfair-advantage-serp-768x337.avif 768w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-unfair-advantage-serp-480x211.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u2753<strong>Is your Google Ads account ready to take on the latest platform updates? <\/strong>Find out with our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Free Google Ads Grader<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-unfair-advantage-policy\"><\/div>\n<h2>What this means for advertisers<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re wondering what this all means for your business\u2019s Google Ads account, here are the top things you need to know (so far).<\/p>\n<h3>Ad competition and costs could be majorly impacted<\/h3>\n<p>Since this is the first time ever that the unfair advantage policy has been adjusted to permit double serving, there\u2019s no doubt that this update could have a major impact on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/why-google-ad-costs-are-rising-in-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads competition and costs<\/a> (which, as we recently covered, have been increasing steadily).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI see this change as a big deal, especially for smaller advertisers,\u201d said Cliff Sizemore, Senior Growth Marketing Manager at LocaliQ.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis update gives even more reason to diversify your placements as a small business advertiser. Eventually, if it drives up costs too high, I can see some of the smaller advertisers shifting their paid search strategies entirely,\u201d said Cliff.<\/p>\n<p>For example, aligning with the updated unfair advantage policy might mean rethinking your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/14\/google-ads-budgeting-strategies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">campaign budgets<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMedium-budget advertisers theoretically could allocate more resources toward dominating search results for a particular service line (e.g., siding repair),\u201d said Guy Philosoph, Head of Product Management for LocaliQ\u2019s Lead Generation Paid Media Products.<\/p>\n<p>So, with more opportunities for the same brands to show on the page, advertisers with smaller budgets may need to reallocate funds across campaigns (or reprioritize campaigns entirely) to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/17\/google-ads-bid-management\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">maximize their bids<\/a> and maintain their Ad Rank.<\/p>\n<p>Long story short, small businesses are most likely going to be feeling the downsides of this update the most. For instance, Chris Chambers, Head of Paid Search at Understory, commented the following <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/update\/urn:li:activity:7311501557420716032?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7311501557420716032%2C7311519420198076417%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287311519420198076417%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7311501557420716032%29\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on LinkedIn<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt seems like now the advertisers with the most to spend in each niche will get even more real estate and be able to show twice, potentially cutting out smaller competitors completely from the first page.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-unfair-advantage-policy-comment-png.avif\" alt=\"google ads unfair advantage policy updated - linkedin comment\" width=\"692\" height=\"299\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90670 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-unfair-advantage-policy-comment-png.avif 692w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-unfair-advantage-policy-comment-300x130.avif 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-unfair-advantage-policy-comment-480x207.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 692px) 100vw, 692px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u26a1 <\/strong><strong>Learn how to improve your Quality Score and <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/ways-to-save-money-in-google-ads?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_SaveMoneyinGoogleAds_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>save big in Google Ads<\/strong><\/a><strong> here! <\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>Advertisers may have trouble measuring results<\/h3>\n<p>While, initially, it\u2019s safe to assume that the updated unfair advantage policy could make the ad auction more volatile, this change is still fresh. So far, the overall sentiment from the PPC community is that more time is needed before solid predictions can be made regarding the impact the updated unfair advantage policy will have. On top of that, it\u2019s going to be difficult to fully track the impact of this update, and advertisers may have trouble measuring results.<\/p>\n<p>Navah Hopkins, Brand Evangelist at Optmyzer, writes on LinkedIn:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGoogle is officially making it fair game to have more than one spot on the SERP&#8230; I want to see how performance actually shakes out in Q2.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-unfair-advantage-policy-update-post-png.avif\" alt=\"google ads unfair advantage policy update - linkedin post\" width=\"674\" height=\"194\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90669 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-unfair-advantage-policy-update-post-png.avif 674w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-unfair-advantage-policy-update-post-300x86.avif 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-unfair-advantage-policy-update-post-480x138.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/posts\/navahhopkins_google-is-officially-making-it-fair-game-activity-7311501557420716032-wpNW?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAB-ca78B25iHsjZ3_182VZCylMwB9QWNnaA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Some of the comments in reply to her post, however, still raise concerns about increased impressions and clicks to the same business, equating to wasted spending.

It means Google can also rank themselves multiple times,\u201d said Cliff.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, keywords relating to digital marketing strategies and solutions that include a platform name, like \u201cFacebook Ads,\u201d are already extremely competitive both from the paid and organic perspectives. Now, the platforms themselves could make this even worse by showing multiple times throughout the SERP thanks to their mega budgets\u2014pushing ads from marketing agencies down even further.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-unfair-advantage-policy-example-serp-png.avif\" alt=\"google ads unfair advantage policy - example branded search serp\" width=\"702\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90673 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-unfair-advantage-policy-example-serp-png.avif 702w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-unfair-advantage-policy-example-serp-300x256.avif 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-unfair-advantage-policy-example-serp-480x410.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Facebook Ads dominates the SERP for this brand-related search. <\/em><\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-unfair-advantage-policy-tips\"><\/div>\n<h2>Tips to maintain your Ad Rank across ad locations<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re concerned your competitors\u2019 ads may start to show more than yours throughout the SERP, here\u2019s our advice.<\/p>\n<h3>Don\u2019t make any major changes&#8230;yet<\/h3>\n<p>The Google Ads unfair advantage policy goes into effect on April 14, 2025. Regardless of whether your business sees a positive or negative change in performance (or any change at all) because of this update, it would take a few months\u2019 worth of data before you\u2019d know for sure.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes, the hardest part of PPC is patience. While it can be tempting to start <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/10\/google-ads-account-structure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">restructuring your campaigns<\/a> now, you\u2019ll want to avoid any major budget or account changes while this update takes effect over the next few months. That way, you\u2019ll be able to make the most informed, data-backed decisions when it comes time to reoptimize.<\/p>\n<p>For now, use reports like Auction Insights within Google Ads to keep a close eye on your rank in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/14\/how-does-google-ads-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ad auction<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-unfair-advantage-auction-insights-png.avif\" alt=\"google ads unfair advantage policy update - auction insights screenshot\" width=\"900\" height=\"274\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90672 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-unfair-advantage-auction-insights-png.avif 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-unfair-advantage-auction-insights-300x91.avif 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-unfair-advantage-auction-insights-768x234.avif 768w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/google-ads-unfair-advantage-auction-insights-480x146.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Rethink your keyword and budget strategies<\/h3>\n<p>As this update evolves, be sure to use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/2024-google-ads-benchmarks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">industry benchmarks<\/a>, as well as your own key <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/19\/ppc-metrics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PPC metrics<\/a>, to see if your account\u2019s costs sway.
