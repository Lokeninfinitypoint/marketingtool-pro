Here are some tips, prompts, and ideas to help you get a fruitful business naming brainstorm.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Write out your story<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, I know, this can be a pain in the butt, but you absolutely need to do this. It doesn&#8217;t have to be perfect\u2014that&#8217;s not the point. This isn&#8217;t for anyone to read. It&#8217;s for you to write (or type). Because you&#8217;ll be amazed at what surfaces when you write about something versus talk or think about it. Depending on what stage you&#8217;re at, write about how you came up with your business idea, why you started or want to start it, what challenges or opportunities arose, and where you want it to go.<\/p>\n<p>This will get the gears turning and will also come in handy later on down the line when it comes to writing your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/02\/how-to-write-a-business-mission-statement\">mission statement<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/27\/guide-to-about-us-pages\">about us page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Take a personal inventory<\/h3>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s time to see if there are any personal attributes you could potentially incorporate into your business name. Take some more time to jot down your:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Passions<\/li>\n<li>Nicknames<\/li>\n<li>Favorite books, songs, and quotes<\/li>\n<li>Upbringing<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/09\/company-core-values\">Core values<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As well as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How people describe you<\/li>\n<li>People, places, and things that are important to you<\/li>\n<li>What inspires you<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul><\/ul>\n<p>Did you know that IKEA is an acronym for Ingvar Kamprad Elmtaryd Agunnaryd? That is, the founder&#8217;s first name, last name, farm he grew up on, and home villiage.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name-ikea.jpeg\" alt=\"how to come up with a business name - story behind ikea's name\" width=\"569\" height=\"300\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-57651\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name-ikea.jpeg 427w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name-ikea-300x158.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 569px) 100vw, 569px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>3. Look at other business names in your industry<\/h3>\n<p>This strategy is helpful in a number of ways. First, it will tell you what <em>not<\/em> to name your business if you want to stand out. Second, it can give you creative ideas. Third, it will also give you some general themes to stick to. As we&#8217;ll get to later, most business names require <em>some<\/em> level of conformity, as you don\u2019t want to be so unique that you\u2019re foreign.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Search industry-specific directories.<\/li>\n<li>Look up your business category in Google maps for different states or countries.<\/li>\n<li>Literally Google \u201clist of [industry] businesses.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Check out our epic list below<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>&gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/08\/business-name-ideas\">268 Catchy and Creative Business Name Ideas (Curated, Not Generated!)<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>4. Look at other industry business names<\/h3>\n<p>There are so many approaches you can take to naming a business regardless of industry, so don\u2019t do yourself a disservice by only looking up business names in your niche. Take, for example, Happy as a Clam Dock Builders.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name-happy-clam.png\" alt=\"how to come up with a business name - happy as a clam dock builders\" width=\"398\" height=\"409\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-57652\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This inspires&#8230;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cool as a Cucumber Salon?<\/li>\n<li>Light as a Feather Weight Loss?<\/li>\n<li>Pleased as Punch Tiki Bar? Boxing gym?<\/li>\n<li>Right as Rain Law Firm? Just kidding, we&#8217;ll get to that later).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>5. Do an emotional brainstorm<\/h3>\n<p>Think about how your customers want to\/will feel as a result of your products and services. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/13\/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing\">One word that stirs up an emotion<\/a> can make a powerful and attractive business name that markets itself. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Online pet store customers want to feel<strong>:<\/strong> proud, relieved, joy, laughter, excited, loved.<\/li>\n<li>Gym members want to feel: strong, competitive, progress, admired, accomplished.<\/li>\n<li>Speech therapy students want to feel: secure, confident, happy, belonging.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name-confidence-connection.png\" alt=\"how to come up with a business name - confidence connection\" width=\"634\" height=\"467\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-57653\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name-confidence-connection.png 634w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name-confidence-connection-480x353.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 634px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Confidence Connection: emotional and alliterative business name.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/03\/emotional-marketing-copy\">list of emotional words here<\/a> to help get you started.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Check the thesaurus<\/h3>\n<p>Take the words you&#8217;ve come up with so far in your brainstorm, like emotions and core values, and plug them into the thesaurus. There are dozens of cool, fancy, and fun to say words that make great business names. Take the word &#8220;bravery,&#8221; for example. Synonyms include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gallantry (Gallantry Web Design)<\/li>\n<li>Grit (Grit n Glory clothing line brand)<\/li>\n<li>Fortitude (Fortitude Fitness Academy)<\/li>\n<li>Intrepidity (Intrepid Detox \u2022 Residential).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The possibilities are endless.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-name-a-business-thesaurus.png\" alt=\"how to name a business - ideas from thesaurus\" width=\"720\" height=\"367\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-57660\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-name-a-business-thesaurus.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-name-a-business-thesaurus-480x245.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>7. Mull over mythology, movies &amp; legends<\/h3>\n<p>Do you have any favorite movie characters or quotes that you can somehow incorporate into your business name? For example:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/unique-business-name-ideas-jarvis.png\" alt=\"business name ideas - jarvis surgical\" width=\"550\" height=\"130\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-49605\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/unique-business-name-ideas-jarvis.png 550w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/unique-business-name-ideas-jarvis-480x113.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 550px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>J.A.R.V.I.S is a character in the Marvel movies, standing for Just A Rather Very Intelligent System.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name-archimedes-digital.png\" alt=\"how to come up with a business name - archimedes digital\" width=\"500\" height=\"117\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-57657\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name-archimedes-digital.png 500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name-archimedes-digital-480x112.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Archimedes is a Greek mathematician.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name-dionysos-wine.png\" alt=\"how to come up with a business name -dionysos imports\" width=\"500\" height=\"178\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-57656\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name-dionysos-wine.png 500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name-dionysos-wine-480x171.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Dionysus is the god of wine.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>There are plenty of characters in history and pop culture that can signify concepts related to your brand, so do some research!<\/p>\n<h3>8. Use a business name generator<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019m not too keen on this idea, and I doubt that you\u2019ll actually land a business name using one of these. But they can still give you starting points for good ideas, or at least a few laughs.

It&#8217;s time to take the names you came up with in your brainstorm and test them in the wild.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Check for availability:\u00a0<\/strong>This means checking against state and national databases, domain, and social availability.

Which brings me to the next section:<br \/>\n<a id=\"mistakes\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Checklist for creating a business name<\/h2>\n<p>Okay so you&#8217;ve done your brainstorming and testing and your business name choices are available. Great, but you&#8217;re not done yet. After all some business names are available for a reason. Sort of like how banana flavored lollipops are always in abundance. Here are some questions to ask to make sure your business name is fool-proof.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Does it make sense?<\/h3>\n<p>It might be super clever, but if it only makes sense to you or a few within your audience, it\u2019s probably not a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-brainstorm-business-ideas\">good idea<\/a> to use. Think about having to explain the name at every networking event or to every customer. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to test out the name with people familiar and unfamiliar with your business and you as a person.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-name-a-business-cartoon.jpg\" alt=\"how to name a business - cartoon about name that doesn't make sense\" width=\"526\" height=\"636\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-57704\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-name-a-business-cartoon.jpg 526w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-name-a-business-cartoon-480x580.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 526px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>2. Is it a good fit for your industry?<\/h3>\n<p>There are plenty of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/08\/persuasive-landing-pages\">powerful words<\/a> out there, but make sure they hold the right kind of power for your industry. For example, words that allude to strength and steadfastness are good for locksmiths and security companies, but for nursing homes or home care? Not so much. It would be better to use words associated with gentleness and kindness.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name-right-as-rain.jpeg\" alt=\"how to come up with a business name - right as rain\" width=\"599\" height=\"287\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-57661\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name-right-as-rain.jpeg 599w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name-right-as-rain-480x230.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 599px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Right as rain. Perfect for sprinkler repair. Clever for a lawyer, but not a tone fit.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>3. Is it future-proof?<\/h3>\n<p>We can\u2019t predict the future (otherwise 2020 wouldn\u2019t have happened) but you do need to account for all possibilities when coming up with a business name.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you could move or expand to other locations, avoid names like <strong>Canton<\/strong> Dry Cleaners, or Manny&#8217;s on <strong>Main<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>If there\u2019s a chance that you might expand your offerings, avoid names like <strong>Breakfast<\/strong> at Tiffany\u2019s or Suro <strong>Laptop<\/strong> Repair.<\/li>\n<li>If there&#8217;s a possibility to pivot, avoid names that target your audience like Clear Paths for <strong>Seniors.<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>4. Is it easy to spell?<\/h3>\n<p>A business name might roll right off the tongue, but is the spelling intuitive? You want people to be able to find your business easily in a search, and you also want to avoid confusion with anything related to invoicing or legal measures. For example, prints &amp; printsess pottery is fun but if you want to tell someone to go to your website, you\u2019ll lose their attention before you even finish explaining how to spell it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name-spelling.jpeg\" alt=\"how to come up with a business name - unusual spelling example\" width=\"274\" height=\"280\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-57701\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>&#8220;So it&#8217;s prince and princess but instead of the c&#8217;s it&#8217;s t&#8217;s&#8230;.except for the two s&#8217;s at the end&#8230;&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>5. Is it easy to pronounce?<\/h3>\n<p>Your business name can be a piece of art in and of itself. But if you have to manipulate the letters to indicate the pronunciation or meaning, it might lead to confusion.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/coming-up-with-a-business-name-validatek.png\" alt=\"coming up with a business name a- make it easy to say\" width=\"504\" height=\"131\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-57663\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/coming-up-with-a-business-name-validatek.png 504w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/coming-up-with-a-business-name-validatek-480x125.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 504px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>This business name looks great on paper&#8230; but is it vali-DATE-tech? or va-LID-a-tech? <\/em><\/p>\n<h3>6. Is it easy to remember?<\/h3>\n<p>Spelling and pronunciation factor into the memorability of a business name, as well as length. Short is easy to remember, but it could get lost in the shuffle. Too long, and it could be a barrier to entry for customers searching for you, not to mention a design issue. Think also about how closely related it is to your product or service. This might help with brand recall, but then again, unique and catchy names are easy to remember too. It&#8217;s all about balance.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/coming-up-with-a-business-name-cartoon.jpg\" alt=\" how to name a business - cartoon on long business name\" width=\"430\" height=\"296\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-57715\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a id=\"name\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>How to name a business [officially]<\/h2>\n<p>Alright, you are now ready to officially name your business!

Here\u2019s how to do it.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Determine your entity<\/h3>\n<p>First, pick your entity type.

Here are some common business structures:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sole proprietorship:<\/strong> One person owns the business, unlimited personal liability, self-employment tax and personal tax. business assets and liabilities are not separate from personal assets and liabilities<\/li>\n<li><strong>Partnership:<\/strong> Two or more people; unlimited personal liability unless structured as a limited partnership, self-employment tax (except for LP) and personal tax.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Limited liability company (LLC):<\/strong> One or more people; owners not personally liable; self employment tax, personal tax or corporate tax<\/li>\n<li><strong>Corporation:<\/strong> same as LLC except corporate tax.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name-busines-structures.jpg\" alt=\"how to come up with a business name - business structures summary chart\" width=\"464\" height=\"392\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-57504\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mbopartners.com\/blog\/how-grow-small-business\/how-to-choose-the-right-business-structure-for-your-independent-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/business-guide\/launch-your-business\/choose-business-structure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Learn more about these structures with the SBA<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Check business name availability (state &amp; national)<\/h3>\n<p>Depending on your state and entity, you may or may not have to register your name.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>To check for state availability:<\/strong> Each state has different naming rules and requirements. Sites like <a href=\"https:\/\/howtostartanllc.com\/llc-name-search\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this LLC name search site<\/a> will direct you to the page for each state where you can search for entity name availability<\/li>\n<li><strong>To check for national availability,<\/strong> go to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uspto.gov\/trademarks\">\u200b\u200bUS Trademark Electronic Search System<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name-trademark-electronic-search-system.png\" alt=\"how to come up with a business name - united states trademark electronic search system\" width=\"720\" height=\"285\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-57502\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name-trademark-electronic-search-system.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name-trademark-electronic-search-system-480x190.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Not the friendliest of websites&#8230;<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>3. Check domain availability<\/h3>\n<p>As in love with your business name as you may be, it&#8217;s not worth using if you can&#8217;t have a website that closely matches that name. It&#8217;s already hard enough to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/17\/website-visibility\">make your website more visible<\/a>; don&#8217;t make it harder.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you can differentiate your domain by adding something like &#8220;get&#8221; or &#8220;go&#8221; in front of the name, it may not be worth it. Potential customers performing direct searches won&#8217;t know to do this and will likely end up on the existing site. If it&#8217;s a competitor, you&#8217;ve lost someone. If it&#8217;s not, they might just abandon the cause.<\/p>\n<p>You can use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.godaddy.com\/domains\/domain-name-search\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GoDaddy&#8217;s domain name checker<\/a> for this.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Check social media<\/h3>\n<p>Also make sure that you can create social handles that are closely associated with your name\u2014and that you can have the same handle across all channels. If there is already a handle using your exact name, check to see how popular it is. Because even if you come up with something close enough, if the real thing is a major account that could make yours look like an unverified or fake version of that account, you\u2019ll want to steer clear.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Register your business name<\/h3>\n<p>Be sure to register your domain name as soon as possible (before it gets snatched up!) and then depending on your business, you may or may not need to register your entity name, trademark, dba, or all three. Learn more about registering your business <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/business-guide\/launch-your-business\/choose-your-business-name\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">from the SBA<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>How to come up with a business name [recap]<\/h2>\n<p>So as you can see, naming a business is a bit of a process, but with something so final, you want to make sure all your bases are covered.
