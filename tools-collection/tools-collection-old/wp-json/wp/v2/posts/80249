Suffice it to say that we know a thing or two about SEO. But all that we\u2019ve learned has not come to us on a silver platter. It\u2019s been through the challenges we\u2019ve faced and how we handled them.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we\u2019re sharing some of the most common SEO issues and what to do about them so you can keep your traffic and rankings in top shape.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the six SEO issues we\u2019ll cover:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#keyword-competition\">Keyword competition<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#algorithm-updates\">Not keeping up with algorithm updates<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#slow-page-speed\">Slow page speed<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#local-ranking\">Low local ranking<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#not-indexing\">Page not indexing<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#resource-constraints\">Resource constraints<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>With the goal of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/seo\">SEO<\/a> being to rank high and increase traffic, one might think that the only two SEO issues out there are a drop in ranking or a drop in traffic. But because SEO is dependent on so many practices, there is actually a slew of SEO issues that could be behind these performance dips. Let\u2019s take a deeper look at six of them.<\/p>\n<div id=\"keyword-competition\"><\/div>\n<h2>SEO issue #1: Keyword volume and competition<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re seeing less than stellar results for a piece of content, check up on the keyword volume (how many times the keyword is searched per month) and competition (how difficult it is to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/06\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google\">rank for the keyword<\/a>). Depending on the keyword, you may see volume and competition fluctuations due to seasonal, cultural, industrial, and economic trends.<\/p>\n<p>Also, some keywords simply get harder to rank for over time, while others get easier.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/SEO-issues-wordstream-difficulty-graph.jpg\" alt=\"SEO issues - Graph showing change in keyword difficulty.\" width=\"764\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-80250 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/SEO-issues-wordstream-difficulty-graph.jpg 764w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/SEO-issues-wordstream-difficulty-graph-480x377.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 764px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Keyword volume and competition can fluctuate for certain keywords.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>How to fix it<\/h3>\n<p>Here are two recommendations for dealing with this pesky SEO issue.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Improve the quality of the content<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>If competition has gone up, make sure your content is up to date, in line with what other ranking results show, and refreshed with new links.

By targeting lower competition and lower volume keywords, you can accrue traffic and engagement, which sends positive signals to Google and increases your SEO strength. This can help you rank faster\u2014and maintain rank\u2014for those higher competition keywords.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc4b SEO is just one way to get more visitors.

The dozens of small updates it makes each month, like for spam, are usually harmless.<\/p>\n<p>However, core algorithm updates, which target those stronger SEO signals, can cause strange fluctuations in traffic and performance. Examples of more impactful updates include the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/19\/core-web-vitals-google-page-experience-update\">page experience update<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/01\/22\/google-speed-update\">page speed update<\/a>, and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/26\/google-page-title-update\">page title update<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/SEO-issues-wordstream-title-rewrite.jpg\" alt=\"SEO update- graph showing traffic change due to googles title update.\" width=\"801\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-80251 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/SEO-issues-wordstream-title-rewrite.jpg 801w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/SEO-issues-wordstream-title-rewrite-480x360.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 801px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/26\/google-page-title-update\"><em>page title update<\/em><\/a><em> caused some major problems for us!<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>How to fix it<\/h3>\n<p>Fixes for this depend on exactly what\u2019s happening.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Update pages<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Sometimes, with an algorithm update, some of your old content simply loses its value in relation to other content on the web. In this case, you\u2019ll want to examine any pages that dropped in traffic and look for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/03\/get-more-traffic-from-evergreen-content\">updates you can make<\/a>. While this can be disappointing, you may also find that some of your newer content begins to rank higher.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Give it time<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Other times your traffic drops because the changes to the algorithm may shift the way things rank initially, putting some pages on top that shouldn\u2019t be there. Since the algorithm factors in user behavior, the pages end up in their right places over time. In this case, the best thing to do is to let the results pages settle. Wait about 30 days to see if the page finds its way back to its due ranking.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Stay in the know<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Regardless, it\u2019s best to stay on top of algorithm updates. Know what they are ahead of time so you can prepare if possible, and once they happen, use SEO forums to see if other people are experiencing the same problems. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.seroundtable.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO Roundtable<\/a>, the <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/blog#google-search-core-updates-ranking-changes-and-algorithm-updates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Search Central algorithm update blog<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/status.search.google.com\/products\/rGHU1u87FJnkP6W2GwMi\/history\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google\u2019s ranking updates release history<\/a> can be really helpful here.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/SEO-issues-wordstream-dashboard.jpg\" alt=\"SEO update- Google search status dashboard.\" width=\"936\" height=\"586\" class=\"wp-image-80252 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/SEO-issues-wordstream-dashboard.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/SEO-issues-wordstream-dashboard-480x301.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Use the <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/status.search.google.com\/products\/rGHU1u87FJnkP6W2GwMi\/history\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Google Search Status Dashboard<\/em><\/a><em> to stay in the loop on algorithm and ranking updates.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Focus on quality<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Though the Google algorithm is always evolving, it\u2019s not exactly a moving target.

Google does not like pages that load slowly because users don\u2019t like pages that load slowly. In fact, after about five seconds, every one-second delay reduces user satisfaction by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.browserstack.com\/guide\/how-fast-should-a-website-load\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">16%<\/a> and decreases conversion rate by 4%.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/SEO-issues-wordstream-load-times.jpg\" alt=\"SEO update- graph showing effect of slow page speed.\" width=\"936\" height=\"520\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-80254 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/SEO-issues-wordstream-load-times.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/SEO-issues-wordstream-load-times-480x267.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/blog\/page-speed\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Google has always prioritized page speed, but it became even more important in 2021 with the page experience update and introduction of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/02\/improve-core-web-vitals\">Core Web Vitals<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>How to fix it<\/h3>\n<p>There are many reasons for slow page speed. Luckily, the <a href=\"https:\/\/search.google.com\/search-console\/core-web-vitals?resource_id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usehatchapp.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Core Web Vitals report<\/a> within Search Console and <a href=\"https:\/\/pagespeed.web.dev\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google\u2019s PageSpeed Insights tool<\/a> will help you identify the culprits. Here are some of the common ones.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Compress large files<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Make sure your images are compressed to the smallest file size without compromising quality. You can usually get a good image at around 70-100KB. There are plenty of free compression <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/best-seo-tools\">tools<\/a> like <a href=\"https:\/\/tinypng.com\/\">Tinify<\/a>. Also, be careful with videos and GIFs. Embed videos wherever possible and avoid or compress GIFs, as they can take up a LOT of space.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/SEO-issues-wordstream-compression.jpg\" alt=\"SEO update- three images of different compressions that look similar.\" width=\"936\" height=\"311\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-80255 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/SEO-issues-wordstream-compression.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/SEO-issues-wordstream-compression-480x159.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Compressed images are much smaller in size but still look the same, as you can see in <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/bitmovin.com\/lossy-compression-algorithms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>this example<\/em><\/a><em>.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Optimize your code<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>There are different ways to do this. For example, minification involves reducing excess characters from the code; asynchronous loading allows elements to load at the same time; and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/08\/lazy-loading-seo\">lazy loading <\/a>loads the visible elements on a page first.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Enable caching<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Caching occurs when your browser saves a copy of a webpage so that when a user returns to it, it doesn\u2019t have to reload the entire thing. You can enable caching at the browser or server level on your site.<\/p>\n<p>You can find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/22\/google-page-speed\">more tips for improving page speed here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"local-ranking\"><\/div>\n<h2>SEO issue #4: Low local rankings<\/h2>\n<p>Another common SEO issue, which impacts small businesses in particular, is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/09\/google-ranking-factors\">local ranking<\/a>. When you search for your service, you\u2019re either not showing up or you\u2019re seeing competitors rank higher than you. This is a big problem since so many buyer journeys start with a search engine.<\/p>\n<h3>How to fix it<\/h3>\n<p>Luckily, the fix for this is pretty easy. It\u2019s all about local SEO. We offer a free <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/local-marketing-lab\/seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Local SEO course<\/a> via LocaliQ\u2019s Marketing Lab, but here are some basics.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/local-keyword-research\/\">local keyword research<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Make sure your website targets keywords that represent your services and your location. Include those keywords in page titles, URLs, headings, image files, alt text, and body text.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Optimize your listings<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Get on the top <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/03\/01\/business-directory-listings\">business directories<\/a> and fill out your profiles completely. Leave no sections blank and keep your information as consistent as possible across platforms.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Get more reviews<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>This one is huge.

Use our post on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/16\/get-more-google-reviews\">how to get more Google reviews<\/a> so you can stand out above competitors in results.<\/p>\n<p>In some cases, however, competitors are going to win out simply due to proximity. In the example below, I searched \u201celectricians stoughton.\u201d While Edward Flagg has the most reviews and is open, it ranks below both Suburban and Dykeman because those two companies are in Stoughton. In this case, you can\u2019t do a whole lot to improve your ranking.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/SEO-issues-wordstream-electrictian.jpg\" alt=\"SEO update- marked up google search result showing reviews for several results.\" width=\"668\" height=\"600\" class=\"wp-image-80256 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/SEO-issues-wordstream-electrictian.jpg 668w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/SEO-issues-wordstream-electrictian-480x431.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 668px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"not-indexing\"><\/div>\n<h2>SEO issue #5: Pages not indexing<\/h2>\n<p>If a page is set to \u201cindex,\u201d this means Google can find it, categorize it, add it to its index (picture a big website page library), and retrieve it for relevant searches. In simple terms, \u201cindexed\u201d means \u201cit can show up on Google.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There are certain cases where you will deliberately de-index a page\u2014such as with duplicate or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/18\/gated-content\">gated content<\/a>.

Sometimes it\u2019s a snippet of code and other times it\u2019s a simple checkbox.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Request indexing<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>If the above setting was the issue, make the fix and then submit the page for indexing. You can do this by going to Google Search Console and entering the URL in the box at the top.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/SEO-issues-wordstream-inspect-url.jpg\" alt=\"SEO update- Google search console\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-80259 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/SEO-issues-wordstream-inspect-url.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/SEO-issues-wordstream-inspect-url-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Once Google retrieves the URL, you\u2019ll see the option to request indexing:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/SEO-issues-wordstream-request-indexing.jpg\" alt=\"SEO update- Google ask to index screen\" width=\"936\" height=\"369\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-80258 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/SEO-issues-wordstream-request-indexing.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/SEO-issues-wordstream-request-indexing-480x189.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Further inspect the URL<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>If you can\u2019t figure out the issue, take the same step above of inputting the URL into Google Search Console.

Once you make the fix, submit for indexing.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Add links<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Google is always re-crawling sites to update its index with new pages. So, it can usually be counted on to find new pages you publish on its own. But some pages are harder to find than others. When you publish a new page, make sure there are links pointing to and from it so that there are multiple ways for Google to access the page.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Republish the page<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>We\u2019ve had blog posts where, despite doing all the steps above, they just couldn\u2019t find their way onto the SERP.
