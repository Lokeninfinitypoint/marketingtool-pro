They attract qualified leads, they showcase your expertise, and they can be geared for any stage of your funnel.<\/p>\n<p>The only catch is, it has to be good. And you have to create it.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s right. You have to extract the knowledge in your head and put it down on (digital) paper. I\u2019ve created hundreds of ebooks at this point, and let me tell you: this takes time, but it is well worth it. And once you get the hang of it, it\u2019s rinse, repeat, and reap the benefits.<\/p>\n<p>Read on for my five-step process to write an ebook that both gratifies you and grows your business.<\/p>\n<h3>Contents<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#steps-to-write-an-ebook\">How to write an ebook<\/a>:\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#ebook-topics\">Determine your topic<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ebook-content\">Plan your content<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#how-to-write-an-ebook\">Populate the content<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ebook-design\">Design it<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ebook-promotions\">Promote and distribute<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ebook-examples\">Ebook examples<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ebook-template\">Copy-and-paste ebook template<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"steps-to-write-an-ebook\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to write an ebook in 5 steps<\/h2>\n<p>Follow these five steps to write an ebook that educates and adds value for your audience, and that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/12\/how-to-generate-leads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">generates leads<\/a> for your business.<\/p>\n<div id=\"ebook-topics\"><\/div>\n<h3>1. Determine your topic<\/h3>\n<p>First, off, you need to come up with a compelling topic. It doesn\u2019t have to be something novel or mind-blowing; it just has to be interesting and relevant to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/resources\/how-to-find-your-target-audience\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">your audience<\/a>. This will ensure you get the right people downloading it.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some tips for determining a topic for your ebook:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keywords.<\/strong> Use a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keyword tool<\/a> to find words and phrases your audience is looking up online. Make sure they are broad enough for sufficient volume while not being too broad where you won\u2019t attract your target customers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Popular blog posts. <\/strong>Take a look at your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-metrics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content performance metrics<\/a> and see which topics resonate with your audience the most. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/content-repurposing\">Repurposing blog posts<\/a> into ebooks is one of the oldest, and best, tricks of the trade.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Trending topics.<\/strong> Scroll through your social feeds, do some industry report investigation, talk to your customers, or check out <a href=\"https:\/\/explodingtopics.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Exploding Topics<\/a>. Find out if there\u2019s anything new and notable that you can cover or use to put a twist on an evergreen topic.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ideation tools.<\/strong> Why not try AI to get some ideas? This is one of the many ways you can <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/ai-for-small-business-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">use AI for small business marketing<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Pro tip:<\/strong> Write blog posts with the intention of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/03\/repurposing-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">repurposing<\/a> them into ebooks. You can turn a single post into an ebook or combine several into one longer ebook.

Plan your content<\/h3>\n<p>Once you have your ebook topic, now it\u2019s time to plan out the content and the copy.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Identify the best format.<\/strong> Will this ebook be a how-to, a listicle, a beginner\u2019s guide, or a report? There are more formats than just these, and whichever one you choose is fine. Just identify it ahead of time so you can outline it accordingly.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Identify themes and messaging: <\/strong>Before you start outlining, take a minute to consider which brand messages and <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLValuePropositionGuide.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_ValuePropositionGuide_Download\">key value propositions<\/a> about your product or service you want this guide to support. This is not the same as the topic of the guide. The topic is the main focus, but you can teach on that topic in a way that organically showcases your expertise, and trustworthiness, and reinforces the value of your products or services.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Come up with your title.<\/strong> Once you have your topic and key messaging points, come up with a title for your ebook. You may tweak it later on down the line, but you need to have the core in place, as something by which to anchor your content. For tips on compelling titles, check out these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/01\/headline-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">headline examples and tips<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Outline the content.<\/strong> If you\u2019re not repurposing a blog post, create your outline. Outlining the whole ebook first will help you maintain a cohesive story from start to finish.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Pro tip:<\/strong> Don\u2019t veer away from the ebook title\u2019s promise. It happens to the best of us. We start writing, we get carried away, and next thing you know the final piece is a one too many steps removed from the original title. This is why outlining is essential. It will keep you on track to deliver what your ebook promises!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/how-to-write-an-ebook-outline-template.webp\" alt=\"how to write an ebook - ebook outline template\" width=\"935\" height=\"533\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84409 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/how-to-write-an-ebook-outline-template.webp 935w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/how-to-write-an-ebook-outline-template-480x274.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 935px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/18dFF1S6C11BAF0Vq0B0FQaOrUP99g7z55AVWVInuS0I\/copy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to make a copy of a handy template for writing your book!<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-write-an-ebook\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Populate the content<\/h3>\n<p>The next step in writing your ebook is to, well, write it! If you\u2019re repurposing already existing content, this will be easy. If you\u2019re writing from scratch, make sure it is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Concise and clear. <\/strong>Just because it\u2019s an \u201cebook\u201d doesn\u2019t mean it has to be a book. As with any <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/06\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">copywriting<\/a>, keep it free of \u201cfluff\u201d and filler words and get right to the point.<\/li>\n<li><strong><\/strong><strong>Actionable.<\/strong> Don\u2019t just provide the \u201cwhat\u201d or \u201cwhy\u201d\u2014provide the \u201chow,\u201d too! This is where your ebook will demonstrate its true value.<\/li>\n<li><strong><\/strong><strong>Digestible.<\/strong> Break complex concepts down into simpler ones and use short paragraphs, lists, sections, and headings to make the information easy to absorb.<\/li>\n<li><strong><\/strong><strong>Visuals.<\/strong> No one wants a block of text! At the bare minimum, add stock images, but ideally, your images illustrate concepts and provide examples of the surrounding text.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/how-to-write-an-ebook-visual-example.webp\" alt=\"how to write an ebook - visual ebook example\" width=\"801\" height=\"581\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84410 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/how-to-write-an-ebook-visual-example.webp 801w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/how-to-write-an-ebook-visual-example-480x348.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 801px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Pro tip:<\/strong> You can reference case studies and examples of your own product\/services in your ebook, but keep it to a minimum. Adding value through educational content will be more effective in promoting your business than directly pitching it.<\/p>\n<div id=\"ebook-design\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Add the design touches<\/h3>\n<p>Now it\u2019s time to add the finishing touches that will make your ebook unique to your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/small-business-brand-kit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">brand\u2019s style<\/a>. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t need to be a designer to achieve these!<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Give it a polished look.<\/strong> Professionalize your ebook with a table of contents, an introduction, a conclusion, and a footer (or header) on every page with the ebook title, page numbers, and your logo.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Create an eye-catching cover.<\/strong> For inspiration, browse <a href=\"https:\/\/www.canva.com\/ebook-covers\/templates\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Canva\u2019s ebook cover template library<\/a>, scroll around on LinkedIn, or even do a Google Image search.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/how-to-write-an-ebook-ebook-cover-example.webp\" alt=\"how to write an ebook - ebook cover examples\" width=\"574\" height=\"502\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84414 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/how-to-write-an-ebook-ebook-cover-example.webp 574w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/how-to-write-an-ebook-ebook-cover-example-480x420.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 574px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Add callouts.<\/strong> Use callouts to bring attention to key points throughout the ebook. These could be supporting stats, links to additional resources, or an important point you want to reinforce.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Create a CTA page at the end.<\/strong> The last page of your ebook should include a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-write-a-business-description\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">description of your business<\/a> with a CTA, such as to call for a consult, book a demo, start a free trial, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Pro tip:<\/strong> While Canva and Adobe are great resources for creating ebooks, you can also use Google Slides! It\u2019s super easy, and you can even change the dimensions to be portrait-style. <a href=\"https:\/\/offers.hubspot.com\/ebook-templates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HubSpot has some templates<\/a> you can use.<\/p>\n<div id=\"ebook-promotions\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Promote and distribute<\/h3>\n<p>And finally, it\u2019s time to publish, distribute, and promote your ebook. If you\u2019re looking to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/13\/content-marketing-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">generate leads with this content<\/a>, you\u2019ll want to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/18\/gated-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gate it<\/a> behind a form. This means you\u2019ll need to upload the ebook to your CRM, create a landing page for it with a form, and then have that form trigger a thank you page and\/or delivery email.<\/p>\n<p>Once your workflow is in place, here are some channels you can use to promote and distribute:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Search: <\/strong>Create an SEO-optimized landing page so it can get found on organic search, or write a supporting blog post with some \u201cteaser\u201d information and a link to the guide. You could also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/21\/how-to-run-google-ads\">create a Google Ad<\/a> for it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/how-to-write-an-ebook-contact-centers.webp\" alt=\"how to write an ebook - example ebook promotion search ad\" width=\"710\" height=\"486\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84413 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/how-to-write-an-ebook-contact-centers.webp 710w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/how-to-write-an-ebook-contact-centers-480x329.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 710px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>It\u2019s true\u2026gated content appears in paid results all the time now!<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Social: <\/strong>Promote your ebooks across social media, whether through paid or organic posting.

Even better, you could do a cobranded ebook with them, or get their quotes\/commentary, and they may naturally promote it to their audience.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Website: <\/strong>Create call-to-action buttons on your website\u2014particularly your blog\u2014in the form of side bars, nano bars, in-line CTAs, and more. This is a great way to increase engagement with your site and conversion.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Pro tip: <\/strong>Repurpose your ebook! Turn it into a webinar. Use it for ads. Create social posts with facts from the guide. Break it up into blog posts. Not only does this make for more content, but you can refer back to the ebook in each piece, driving more traffic and downloads. (P.S. Even if the ebook is already repurposed from existing blog posts, I find that the finished product is always different enough from the originals where it could be a new piece of content.)<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 Be sure to convey the value of your ebook using our free <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLValuePropositionGuide.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_ValuePropositionGuide_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">guide to unique value propositions<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"ebook-examples\"><\/div>\n<h2>Ebook examples<\/h2>\n<p>Here are some great ebook examples to model after.<\/p>\n<p><strong> 1.<\/strong> <strong>Intercom\u2019s<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intercom.com\/campaign\/ai-metrics-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Customer Service Metrics Are Evolving in the Age of AI<\/a> is a great example of a data-centric report, with digestible visuals and strong branding.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/how-to-write-an-ebook-ai.webp\" alt=\"how to write an ebook - intercom example\" width=\"555\" height=\"404\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84411 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/how-to-write-an-ebook-ai.webp 555w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/how-to-write-an-ebook-ai-480x349.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 555px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>2.
