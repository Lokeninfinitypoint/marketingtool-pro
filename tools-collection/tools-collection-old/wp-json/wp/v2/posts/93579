Use historical data to forecast future fluctuations<\/h3>\n<p>History might repeat itself, or it might rhyme, but either way, regular trends are something you should be aware of and ready for.<\/p>\n<p>The first step in optimizing your accounts for these trends is to know when they\u2019re coming and to know with enough heads up that you can actually do something about it.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some places you can go to get insights on how these seasonal trends are impacting your campaigns and start to understand what each portion of the year holds for your accounts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ad platforms:<\/strong> Every self-serve ad platform includes some form of visualization. Leverage a long lookback window and review performance trends for high\/low conversion rates, increased\/decreased costs, and any other anomalous performance. Note the time of year they occur and for how long, then see if there\u2019s a repeating pattern.<\/li>\n<li><strong>GA4:<\/strong> Review overall site trends for your company, not just your campaigns. Are there performance spikes or dips that happen regularly? Do you see common trends in year over year data?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Internal teams:<\/strong> Depending on your business model, the best insights around seasonality might come from your sales teams or another team within your company. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/20\/google-ads-for-lead-generation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">B2B lead gen<\/a>, for example, usually has some component of personal selling that happens, and I\u2019ll pretty much guarantee that if there\u2019s a salesperson at your company who\u2019s been there for more than a year, they\u2019ll know the different trends that occur within the year and why.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Once you\u2019re able to pinpoint when these fluctuations are happening (and ideally why they\u2019re happening), review the performance of your individual keywords, ad sets, and campaigns during that time to see if there are standouts or duds. Just because the account saw a big slowdown or spike doesn\u2019t mean it was uniform across the account. Use those insights to inform your campaign strategy for the next time that the seasonality effect comes around.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span data-contrast=\"auto\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" lang=\"EN-US\" class=\"TextRun SCXW232331268 BCX0\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW232331268 BCX0\">\ud83d\udcc6 Need ideas for seasonal PPC campaigns?<\/span><\/span><\/strong> Download our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/marketing-calendar?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2025MarketingCalendar_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free marketing calendar template<\/a> filled with ideas, tips, and more for every month of the year!<\/p>\n<div id=\"expand-targeting\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Revisit and expand targeting to accommodate trends<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019re mostly talking about how buyer behavior changes during these seasonal periods, but don\u2019t forget to think about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-audience-targeting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">who your audience is<\/a> or how their shopping behavior might be changing.<\/p>\n<p>For search campaigns, revisit your keywords. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/google-revisits-15-unseen-queries-statistic-in-context-of-ai-search\/543160\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">15%<\/a> of queries are new every day and have never been seen before. That trend doesn\u2019t go away during seasonal shifts. If anything, there may be outside factors influencing your audience to search differently than they have before.<\/p>\n<p>Use tools like the Google Keyword Planner, Google Trends, and regularly review your search terms report to find new keywords to add to your account to capture any shifting behaviors.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-google-trends.webp\" alt=\"seasonal ppc - google trends\" width=\"713\" height=\"397\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93602 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-google-trends.webp 713w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-google-trends-480x267.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 713px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In some cases, you might even need to reach an entirely different audience than your regular clientele. If you\u2019ve ever lived in a college town, you know the summers and winter break are drastically different from the school year. With many students going home over those time periods, it makes sense for bars and restaurants to take a more family-friendly stance than they might when students are in session and they\u2019re only interested in what the drink specials are.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t be afraid to think outside the box with your targeting and challenge your usual assumptions.<\/p>\n<div id=\"customize-ad-copy\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Customize ad copy<\/h3>\n<p>This is probably the most obvious adjustment for seasonal campaigns and the one you normally think of when it comes to promotional times.<\/p>\n<p>The most common way I see advertisers incorporate these messages is to adjust their existing ads\u2019 headlines and descriptions to include the new messaging. While that strategy is totally acceptable and fine, I\u2019d caution against that. Each time you adjust your ad, the data will get muddied and make it hard to tell how things are doing over time.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, I\u2019d suggest you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-run-google-ads\">create an entirely new ad unit<\/a> that contains the seasonal messaging. This could run alongside your existing creative, or you could pause them. That\u2019s up to you, just know Google might not serve your new creative if it doesn&#8217;t feel confident in how it will perform.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t want to make entirely new ads, there\u2019s a good middle ground that I\u2019m a pretty big fan of as well.<\/p>\n<p>Use headline and description ad assets when you can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to update your existing RSAs. These will rotate individual headlines and descriptions into your existing RSAs. These can be scheduled to run during only your promotional period and then turn off when it\u2019s over. Just remember that these will honor any pinning strategies you have in place.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-headlines.webp\" alt=\"seasonal ppc - headlines and descriptions in google ads\" width=\"355\" height=\"431\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93603 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-headlines.webp 355w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-headlines-247x300.webp 247w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"seasonal-assets\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Don\u2019t sleep on seasonal assets<\/h3>\n<p>Speaking of assets, there are a few <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-assets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ad assets<\/a> you can utilize to highlight your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/seasonal-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">seasonal messaging<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Promotion assets are extremely customizable for just about any seasonal messaging you want to use.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-assets.png\" alt=\"seasonal google ads promotion assets\" width=\"294\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93605 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-assets.png 294w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-assets-147x300.png 147w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To start, you can select what your occasion is from quite a large list of options. From there, you can customize language, currency, the type of promotion you\u2019re running, and then there\u2019s space for info about the item, a final URL, and then you can customize the details of your promotion. It\u2019s pretty obvious how these can be useful for promotional periods.<\/p>\n<p>But while promotion assets were designed for this purpose, they\u2019re not the only ones you can use to infuse seasonality into your accounts.<\/p>\n<p>Callouts are standalone snippets of text, so you can easily add a handful with seasonal tilts in them to get into rotation.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-callouts.webp\" alt=\"seasonal google ads callouts\" width=\"376\" height=\"528\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93601 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-callouts.webp 376w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-callouts-214x300.webp 214w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 376px) 100vw, 376px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Structured snippets are similar. You can easily add a new variant or two with a new set of seasonal messaging that can rotate with your evergreen variants.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-structured-snippets.webp\" alt=\"seasonal ppc - structured snippets\" width=\"341\" height=\"470\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93600 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-structured-snippets.webp 341w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-structured-snippets-218x300.webp 218w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Sitelinks can also be customized to reflect your seasonal messaging, but they\u2019ll take a little more effort than callouts and structured snippets. For sitelinks, you\u2019ll need seasonal messaging, but you also need a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/08\/landing-page-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">unique landing page<\/a> that isn\u2019t used in other sitelinks.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-sitelink.webp\" alt=\"seasonal ppc - sitelinks\" width=\"353\" height=\"419\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93599 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-sitelink.webp 353w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-sitelink-253x300.webp 253w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Lastly, price assets can operate pretty similarly to promotion assets, and you can easily use the header and description fields to help incorporate your seasonal messaging.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-price-assets.webp\" alt=\"seasonal ppc - price asset screenshot\" width=\"354\" height=\"544\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93598 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-price-assets.webp 354w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-price-assets-195x300.webp 195w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong><span data-contrast=\"auto\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" lang=\"EN-US\" class=\"TextRun SCXW232331268 BCX0\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW232331268 BCX0\">\ud83d\udca1 Could your Google Ads account benefit from optimized seasonal ads?<\/span><\/span><\/strong> Find out with our free<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Google Ads Grader<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"landing-pages\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Make sure your landing pages are ready<\/h3>\n<p>With all this ad customization you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s important to make sure those messages are reflected on the landing page. It\u2019s easy to get excited about all the bells and whistles of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/03\/ad-copy-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ad copy<\/a>, but if your landing pages aren&#8217;t delivering on those awesome messages, you\u2019re likely to lose your customers when they feel like you\u2019re not delivering on the promise of your ads.<\/p>\n<p>If your seasonal shift sees an increase in traffic, it\u2019s a good time to make sure your landing pages load quickly and that your site is able to handle the influx of traffic.<\/p>\n<p>A great tool to help troubleshoot any speed deficiencies on your site is Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/pagespeed.web.dev\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Page Speed Insights<\/a>. With this tool, you can find out which pages on your site are slow for mobile or desktop, then address specific problem areas to speed them up.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-page-speed-insights.webp\" alt=\"seasonal ppc - google ads page speed insights\" width=\"699\" height=\"501\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93593 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-page-speed-insights.webp 699w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-page-speed-insights-480x344.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 699px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"budget-alignment\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. Align your budget with your goals<\/h3>\n<p>If the seasonal trend you\u2019re about to experience is one where business slows, you might not need to adjust your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/14\/google-ads-budgeting-strategies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads budget<\/a>. For example, over the holidays, my B2B accounts usually slow down quite a bit, but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/06\/small-marketing-budget\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">we don\u2019t lower the budget<\/a> for a couple of reasons.<\/p>\n<p>First, we\u2019re likely not going to spend the entire budget anyway, so there\u2019s no real risk of leaving it. Second, the people who DO convert during that time are usually pretty motivated. If you\u2019re researching new software for your company in the week between Christmas and New Year&#8217;s, you\u2019re likely up against some sort of annual renewal and need to make a move quickly.<\/p>\n<p>But for other accounts where volume scales up, sometimes by multiple folds, not increasing your budget could mean that you miss out on incremental traffic and maybe not take full advantage of your promotional period.<\/p>\n<p>Google Ads daily budgets do take into account the performance trends and will spend over your daily budget on strong days. But if your promotional period is multiple days, you\u2019re likely going to be spending too hot and since the algorithm is going to try and balance out to a monthly average, you\u2019ll almost certainly miss out.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-spend.webp\" alt=\"seasonal google ads budget report\" width=\"757\" height=\"315\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93596 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-spend.webp 757w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-spend-480x200.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 757px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"seasonal-adjustments\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. Use seasonality adjustments<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-smart-bidding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Smart Bidding<\/a> and your seasonality is a short burst of large performance swings, like a 25% or more increase or decrease in conversion rate, you can use a feature from Google called a Seasonal Adjustment.<\/p>\n<p>You can learn more about <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/9352512?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">seasonality adjustments<\/a> here, but effectively, they let you tell Google to expect performance that will be very different from your \u201cnormal\u201d performance. That way, it doesn\u2019t over- or underreact to performance changes during your short seasonality impact. Overall, these are intended to be used sparingly, but can have a very large impact on your performance.<\/p>\n<div id=\"remarket-strategically\"><\/div>\n<h3>8. Remarket strategically<\/h3>\n<p>Remarketing lists are a solid staple in regular campaigns, but when your seasonal promotions come around, they can be a great way to reach back into a valuable group of users.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few examples of remarketing lists that could be great to leverage during promotional periods:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cart abandoners during recent sales<\/li>\n<li>Users who purchased during last year\u2019s sales<\/li>\n<li>Users who signed up to be notified when a sale occurred<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/11\/call-to-action-examples-for-email-newsletter-signups\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Newsletter signups<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"schedule-ads\"><\/div>\n<h3>9. Schedule your ads ahead of time<\/h3>\n<p>One of the biggest stress factors during promotional periods is making sure the right ads are active in the right places at the right time.<\/p>\n<p>Many platforms will let you schedule your ads ahead of time to turn on when your sale starts and turn off when your sale ends.<\/p>\n<p>My advice to you: trust but verify.<\/p>\n<p>Leverage these tools to turn things on and off for you, but still spot check. You\u2019ll alleviate the stress of needing to be present when ads need to change over, but you will still have peace of mind once you check in.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-schedule.webp\" alt=\"seasonal ppc - ad and campaign scheduling action in google ads\" width=\"672\" height=\"458\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93594 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-schedule.webp 672w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-schedule-480x327.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 672px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"real-time-optimization\"><\/div>\n<h3>10. Maintain and optimize your seasonal PPC ads in real time<\/h3>\n<p>One last point for seasonal campaigns is to always maintain and optimize your ads during these times. Don\u2019t put these as a \u201cset it and forget it\u201d strategy. During peak hours, things move fast. Just like other times of the year, it\u2019s important to keep a close eye on how your campaigns are performing, especially if the window is short, i.e., a weekend-long sale. We might not like working on the weekend, but if you turn your promos on Friday evening, then don\u2019t check again until Monday, you could miss out on important intraday trends that you could have capitalized on.<\/p>\n<p>But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to be tied to your computer the whole time during these periods either. Platforms like Google Ads have tools that can alert you when performance changes by large swings. In the image above, Google will review the ROAS performance of the ads every hour and send an email if the ROAS is below 100%.<\/p>\n<p>Tools like this can give you peace of mind to go about your day but let you know when you need to log in and handle business.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-campaigns-bulk-actions.webp\" alt=\"seasonal ppc - bulk action for reporting and tracking\" width=\"725\" height=\"519\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93597 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-campaigns-bulk-actions.webp 725w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seasonal-ppc-campaigns-bulk-actions-480x344.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 725px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Get results from your seasonal PPC campaigns year-round<\/h2>\n<p>Seasonal trends can have a big impact on your business throughout the year.
