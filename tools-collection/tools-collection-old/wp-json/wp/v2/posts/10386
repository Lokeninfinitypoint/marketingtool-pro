Yes, there\u2019s an opportunity to lower overheads and recruit from anywhere, but is it really worth it at the expense of growing a cohesive brand culture under one (literal, physical) roof?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"align-center\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/remote-startup-management-guide.jpg\" alt=\"how to manage a startup remotely\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"86fba740-0b82-4ce1-8c08-4c582887fe39\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Many businesses have had to find out quickly if remote working works for them (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/13\/covid-19-response\">for obvious 2020 reasons<\/a>), but lots of successful startups recognized the benefits long before a pandemic forced their hand. Companies like <strong>Buffer<\/strong>, <strong>Mozilla<\/strong>, and <strong>Zapier<\/strong> have blazed a trail when it comes to WFH, while tech giants <strong>Twitter<\/strong> and <strong>Google<\/strong> are now offering their staff the opportunity to work remotely forever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">So, <em>how<\/em> do they make it work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As we\u2019ll discover in this post, there are few key elements to getting it right, namely in the <strong>hiring<\/strong>, <strong>growing<\/strong>, and <strong>managing<\/strong> stages. And woven throughout are the three non-negotiable core principles of remote working:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Trust<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Communication<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Collaboration<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Without further ado, here are our best tips to grow your startup remotely and build a culture from wherever your people are.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">1. Hiring remotely: Spot and recruit talent quickly<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The best thing about growing your startup remotely is that you\u2019re not limited to your local talent pool. You can cast your net far and wide to find the best people for your situation, no matter where in the world they\u2019re based.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Yet, while the choice of applicants is undoubtedly larger, the goal of hiring for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/11\/how-to-get-a-remote-job\">remote job<\/a> isn\u2019t all that different from hiring in-person. Ultimately, you\u2019re still being tasked with spotting, vetting, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/08\/marketing-interview-questions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interviewing talent<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> \u2014 you\u2019re just doing it entirely online.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"align-center\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/recruiting-and-hiring-remotely-for-a-startup.jpg\" alt=\"remote hiring tips\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"06c0ccba-a8a0-4a5a-940a-2a673ff2601c\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Let\u2019s take a look at how to do this effectively.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">How to Identify Talent for Your Startup <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The aim of any recruitment drive (short-term or long-term, online or off) is to <strong>find and hire people you can trust<\/strong>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">But doing this remotely for a fast-growing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/23\/ways-startups-can-stand-out-saturated-market\">startup<\/a> introduces an element of time pressure. You can\u2019t always stick an ad up on social media and wait for an influx of applicants. Sometimes you need to go out there and find the right candidate yourself, fast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The good news is, there are a number of digital platforms designed for this. <a href=\"https:\/\/traktion.ai\/blog\/fiverr-alternatives\">Websites like <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/traktion.ai\/blog\/fiverr-alternatives\"><strong>Upwork<\/strong><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/traktion.ai\/blog\/fiverr-alternatives\">, <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/traktion.ai\/blog\/fiverr-alternatives\"><strong>Fiverr<\/strong><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/traktion.ai\/blog\/fiverr-alternatives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> and others<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> are solid options for low-skilled, one-off, or short-term needs. You can usually find a verified freelancer for simple graphic design, data-entry, or copywriting tasks on these sites with very little fuss.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Hiring remotely for high-skilled, core team roles, on the other hand, requires a slightly different approach. There\u2019s more risk involved when building your team, rather than simply delegating smaller tasks to hourly freelancers. You need to ensure that anyone you\u2019re adding to your payroll has the right mix of skills, personality, and culture fit to hit the ground running \u2013 otherwise, you\u2019re back to square one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Beyond the conventional freelance or contractor hiring sites, new platforms are starting up and changing the game by handling the burden of due diligence and filtering out anyone who doesn\u2019t fit your needs and profile. They\u2019re bringing in things like strict vetting, using technical assessments, video interviews, and reference checks. This reduces the amount of time and energy you spend on assessing the suitability \u2013 or credibility \u2013 of a candidate, and means that you can hire smarter, quicker. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Here are a few more resources to help when recruiting and retaining remote employees:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/resources.workable.com\/tutorial\/hiring-remote-employees\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to attract, hire and retain remote employees<\/a> via Workable<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/90568513\/hiring-remotely-is-the-new-reality-heres-how-to-do-it-with-quickly-and-easily\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hiring remotely is the new reality.

Growing remotely: Implement the right tools and processes<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Speaking at a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/pritianka\/status\/1133931455623524352\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Startups panel<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">, Sid Sijbrandij, co-founder and CEO of GitLab said that entropy is lower for remote startups. Why? <strong>Because everything is written down<\/strong>. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">\u201cThere is less shoulder tapping. Days are more predictable,\u201d according to Sid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">So, to grow your startup remotely <em>without<\/em> disruption, you need to nail those processes. Write everything down. And remember, communication is key here.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Repeat: Communication is key<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As we\u2019ve mentioned, along with trust, communication and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/12\/cross-functional-collaboration\">cross-functional collaboration<\/a>\u00a0 are non-negotiables when it comes to effective remote working. You <em>need<\/em> transparent communication processes to enable effective collaboration. You also need buy-in from your team; every single one of them must grasp the importance of regular contact with their co-workers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">It\u2019s, therefore, a good idea to <strong>start each day with a team check-in<\/strong>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Just as you would have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/07\/marketing-meetings\">stand-up meeting or a scrum in the office<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">, jumping onto a video call first thing gives you a chance to address questions and concerns, ensures that everyone knows what they\u2019re doing, and gives your team the chance to see and speak to one another. This also keeps siloes from forming, or individuals becoming lonely or disenfranchised.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Over and above this, you should also run regular, company-wide meetings (monthly or quarterly) to keep everyone in the loop regarding overall progress and provide opportunities for internal feedback. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Choose and use the right remote management tools<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">To get your remote team up-to-speed and communicating like pros, you need to provide them with the right set of tools.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_image_narrow\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"50411bcc-ad2f-42ef-afba-35c53f8b1ac6\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-meetings-graph.jpg\" alt=\"graph indicating the surge of virtual work during COVID-19\" width=\"736\" height=\"381\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">At a minimum, this should include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Company email for formal communication.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Slack<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> or <strong>Teams <\/strong>to power day-to-day internal messaging.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Zoom<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> or <strong>Google Meet <\/strong>for quality, reliable video calls.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Dropbox<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> or <strong>Google Drive <\/strong>for cloud file storage and collaboration.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Trello<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> or <strong>Notion<\/strong> for task allocation and project management.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Once you\u2019ve selected your preferred <a href=\"https:\/\/traktion.ai\/blog\/workfromhome-definitive-list-of-startup-remote-working-tools\">remote tool stack<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">, you need to build it into your onboarding process, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/11\/17\/how-to-train-new-hires\">familiarizing each new hire<\/a> with the ins and outs of each platform.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">3. Managing remotely: You\u2019re learning all the time<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/16\/working-remotely\">Managing a remote team is not without its challenges<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">. And perhaps the most significant of those is the fact that you don\u2019t get as much in-person face-to-face time with your employees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Sure, you can hop on a video call, but it can still be difficult to pick up on subtle emotional cues and changes in body language that you might spot if you were sitting in the same room. This means you could miss out on identifying the employees who need your help the most.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"align-center\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-manage-a-remote-team.jpg\" alt=\"remote management tips for startups\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"13cd25bb-f7a9-448f-9555-6b5701110531\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">To guard against this, you need to ensure that your employees are motivated by meaningful work, that they know that you care about them (professionally and personally), and that they have an avenue through which to express concerns, ask questions, and offer feedback.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Motivation is mission-critical<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Here\u2019s the truth: <a href=\"https:\/\/randsinrepose.com\/archives\/bored-people-quit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bored People Quit<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">It\u2019s up to you to make things non-boring. And the best thing about working in a startup, in general, is that each person has a very specialized, significant role geared towards growth. Everyone can see that what they\u2019re doing is having an impact.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This has to remain true even when you\u2019re growing your startup remotely. Every single employee should have visibility (and be visible) as you pursue your next growth milestone. They cannot be allowed to work in a silo, wondering if what they\u2019re doing really matters.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Publicly celebrate success<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">A continuation of the last point, to keep your startup team motivated, you can\u2019t let an individual or group win slip under the radar without a bit of fanfare \u2014 <em>especially<\/em> when you\u2019re working remotely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Something as simple as a public congratulations (with all your favorite Emojis and Gifs) on your general Slack channel will quickly draw attention to good work and those responsible. You could even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.compt.io\/hr-articles\/why-remote-employees-need-perks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spring for some perks<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> to make things extra special.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"align-center\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/celebrate-recognize-wins.png\" alt=\"remote tips employee recognition\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"6bb6f957-2f65-469a-ab31-6500e570acf1\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>WordStream recognizes and celebrates employees who embody our core values each month at our all-hands meeting<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Plus, publicly celebrating success shows that you\u2019re paying attention (employees feel valued) and that you truly care. Same goes for highlighting important milestones in your employees\u2019 personal lives. Give shout outs for birthdays, charity work, family events; prove that you\u2019re interested in more than their work performance.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Do regular performance reviews<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Regular performance reviews are a staple of every successful business, but they take on extra significance when you\u2019re growing a remote startup.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Once you\u2019ve set expectations and clarified what success looks like, a remote performance review provides a designated, structured touchpoint for each employee to reflect on their role, their performance, and look ahead to their next period\u2019s goals and objectives. What\u2019s more, performance reviews offer a platform for your employee to share concerns or provide you with honest feedback on how <em>you\u2019re<\/em> doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This formal one-to-one is conducive to a healthy remote working environment, but it shouldn\u2019t be the only opportunity for dialogue. Try to schedule regular, informal meetings to check-in frequently over a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jotform.com\/blog\/virtual-coffee-breaks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(virtual) coffee<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> \u2014 this will give you the chance to catch any minor issues early before they mushroom into real problems.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">The bottom line: To succeed remotely, lead by example<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If you\u2019re going to succeed in growing your startup remotely, you can\u2019t just pay lip service to the core principles of remote working. <strong>You need to eat, sleep and breathe communication, collaboration, and trust \u2013 putting them into practice at every opportunity.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Of course, there\u2019s a balance to be struck. You need to trust that your employees can work autonomously, but you can\u2019t be so hands-off that they feel abandoned. And you need to ensure that lines of communication remain open, but you shouldn\u2019t micromanage and insert yourself into every conversation or collaboration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In short, you need to lead by example, showing your employees how it\u2019s done. Remember, trust is earned. \u201cDo as I say, not as I do\u201d simply won\u2019t cut it in the world of remote working.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">About the author<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Jaron Soh is co-founder and COO of <a href=\"https:\/\/traktion.ai\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Traktion<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">, a freelancing platform dedicated to the world\u2019s best marketing talent. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many companies have been forced to embrace the remote lifestyle this year.
