These strategies have always been important throughout the history of SEO, but Google is getting better at evaluating signals and determining what content is actually meeting these standards.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a closer look at what I mean and how you can meet those standards.<\/p>\n<h3>1. First-hand experience on a topic (the new \u201cE\u201d in E-EAT)<\/h3>\n<p>As of December 2022, Google\u2019s popular EAT acronym, (Expertise, Authority, Trust) has gotten an additional E: Experience, making it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/14\/google-e-e-a-t\">E-EAT<\/a>. Google will now consider <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/blog\/2022\/12\/google-raters-guidelines-e-e-a-t\">the experience of the author<\/a> or creator when evaluating the quality of content.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-google-eeat.png\" alt=\"2023 seo trends - google eeat\" width=\"720\" height=\"237\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69421 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-google-eeat.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-google-eeat-480x158.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>So what does \u201cexperience,\u201d actually mean? Google wants to see that a content creator has first-hand, real-world experience with the topic discussed.<\/p>\n<p>For example, as the founder of an <a href=\"https:\/\/linkgraph.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO agency,<\/a> I have real-world experience and can speak authoritatively on SEO trends that will arise in 2023. However, If I were to create a piece of content on a health website about common causes of heart disease, that would undermine the quality of the content, because I am not a medical professional and have no experience in healthcare.<\/p>\n<p>That means more websites need to take a closer look at not just who their content creators are, but what topics they&#8217;re focusing on.<\/p>\n<p>Which leads me to the next two trends.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Audience-targeted, not traffic-targeted content<\/h3>\n<p>One reason for this increased emphasis on experience is because SEO content creation is proliferating. But if a website that sells financial software is producing blog posts with food recipes, Google crawlers are going to get suspicious. Because does that content actually benefit the target audience of financial software customers? Or, does it help that the website rank for certain high-volume keywords?<\/p>\n<p>You already know the answer. The reality is, businesses whose <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/11\/28\/content-strategy\">content strategy<\/a> is to simply go after search traffic with little or no consideration of what users actually want are unlikely to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/06\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google\">see ranking success in 2023<\/a>. Sticking within your general topic and industry areas is essential for creating rank-worthy content.<\/p>\n<p>Not sure what topics to explore in your content? A <a href=\"https:\/\/linkgraph.io\/content-planner-tool\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content planning tool<\/a> can help you discover relevant industry topics that your target audience is searching for. Enter a keyword, and the tool will show you the many semantically related keywords that users are typing into the search bar.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-keyword-research-related-keywords.png\" alt=\"2023 seo trends - keyword research examples\" width=\"720\" height=\"388\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69427 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-keyword-research-related-keywords.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-keyword-research-related-keywords-480x259.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>3. Increased emphasis on author authority<\/h3>\n<p>Another reason for Google\u2019s emphasis on experience is the rise of auto-generated content ranking in the SERPs. Google wants to make sure that the content that ranks in 2023 is produced by <em>real people<\/em> with<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\"> real audiences<\/a> in mind.<\/p>\n<p>So what can you do to elevate both the experience and authority of your creators this year? First and foremost, make sure that the people creating your content are, indeed, experts. Then, elevate their experience in the following ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Include author bios<\/strong> to better and more fully communicate your content creator\u2019s knowledge and areas of expertise<\/li>\n<li><strong>Create author pages<\/strong> where you link out to all of the articles on your website that are written by the author<\/li>\n<li><strong>Link your creators&#8217; social media accounts <\/strong>so Google can more easily understand through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/20\/social-signals-for-seo\">social signals<\/a> that they are real people and real experts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here is an example of a great author bio that helps elevates the experience and authority of the creator as a PPC expert<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-author-authority.png\" alt=\"2023 seo trends - author authority bio\" width=\"720\" height=\"349\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69422 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-author-authority.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-author-authority-480x233.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>4. Satisfying, helpful content<\/h3>\n<p>Google\u2019s August 2022 <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/blog\/2022\/08\/helpful-content-update\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">helpful content update<\/a> is another important algorithm update that will impact how we create content in 2023.<\/p>\n<p>For its entire history, Google has always prioritized serving high-quality content to users. But its new emphasis on \u201chelpful\u201d states that users should feel \u201csatisfied\u201d by the content they click on in the SERPs.<\/p>\n<p>User satisfaction, though, is not easy to measure or quantify. So what does Google mean by helpful? Content that is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Created for humans, not search engines.<\/li>\n<li>Appropriate for the target audience.<\/li>\n<li>Relevant to the primary topic or subject area of the website.<\/li>\n<li>Created by authoritative, experienced creators.<\/li>\n<li>Displays a depth of knowledge about the topic.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>(Noticing a theme yet in this year\u2019s SEO trends?)<\/p>\n<p>Creating helpful content is easier said than done. So how can you make your content more helpful?<\/p>\n<p><strong>First, focus on quality, not quantity. <\/strong>Although there are likely a lot of target keywords on your content calendar in 2023, pumping out a high volume of content that is thin on helpfulness and low on expertise is unlikely to produce <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/09\/google-ranking-factors\">top-ranking<\/a> results in 2023.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Second, expand your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">keyword research<\/a> to include information beyond just search volume. <\/strong>Consider the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What types of content are ranking for specific searches?<\/li>\n<li>How long is the content?<\/li>\n<li>What questions does it answer?<\/li>\n<li>What other subtopics or related questions does it explore?<\/li>\n<li>What links are included on the page?<\/li>\n<li>Who is the creator?<\/li>\n<li>What is their experience?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Keyword research and content research can provide all sorts of insights into these quality indicators, so make sure you don\u2019t get distracted by potential organic traffic alone.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Check your search queries in Search Console<\/strong> to see what people are looking for that leads them to your particular blog posts.

A.I content &amp; content writing software<\/h3>\n<p>Despite all of the 2022 updates focused on combatting auto-generated content, the use of AI content will likely only increase in 2023.<\/p>\n<p>The number of\u00a0marketing applications that now integrate <a href=\"https:\/\/builtin.com\/marketing\/ai-tools-search-future\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO and AI<\/a> is only increasing. And it\u2019s no wonder because these integrations can be incredibly time-saving! Most content marketers have utilized some version of these types of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/25\/ai-content-generators\">AI content generators<\/a>\u00a0over the past year.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/ai-content-generators-simplified.png\" alt=\"ai content generator tool - simplified aida copywriting\" width=\"720\" height=\"335\" class=\"size-full wp-image-57808 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/ai-content-generators-simplified.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/ai-content-generators-simplified-480x223.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But with all of Google\u2019s recent updates, can <a href=\"https:\/\/linkgraph.io\/blog\/content-writing-software\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content-writing software<\/a> be utilized safely?<\/p>\n<p>Absolutely! Pumping out auto-generated drafts is a huge no-no, but marketers can certainly leverage these tools to help speed up their content workflows and still create original, quality content in the process.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the more helpful applications of these tools that do not sacrifice the originality or people-centeredness of content:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Content briefs<\/strong>: Content tools that generate content briefs can help your writers understand the important keywords, topics, and subtopics that should be included in their original content.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Content outlines<\/strong>: Outlines are a great way to give your writers a roadmap for how to create helpful content without relying on AI to do the work for them.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Content ideas<\/strong>: Tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/linkgraph.io\/blog-topics-generator\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog topic generators<\/a> can speed up the brainstorming process. Moving from a keyword to a helpful content idea can be half the battle, and an idea generator can help prevent writer\u2019s block. For example, here is an auto-generated blog idea that has been revised to include the website\u2019s brand voice and be more tailored to the website\u2019s younger target audience:<strong>Auto-generated:<\/strong><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-auto-generated-content.png\" alt=\"2023 seo trends - auto generated content\" width=\"720\" height=\"219\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69425 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-auto-generated-content.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-auto-generated-content-480x146.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nPeople-first:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-people-first-content.png\" alt=\"2023 seo trends - people-first content\" width=\"720\" height=\"277\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69426 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-people-first-content.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-people-first-content-480x185.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is just one of many examples of how to use content writing software to better meet Google\u2019s quality standards, not avoid or bypass them.<\/p>\n<h3>6. SEO automation<\/h3>\n<p>Like content AI, more and more SEO tasks will be automated in 2023 as digital marketers continue to leverage the power of enterprise SEO software platforms and tools.<\/p>\n<p>For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/09\/18\/best-keyword-research-tools\">Keyword research tools<\/a><\/strong> can automate tasks that once required a lot of manual spreadsheet work.<\/li>\n<li><strong> Site auditing and monitoring platforms<\/strong> like <a href=\"https:\/\/searchatlas.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SearchAtlas<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.contentkingapp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Content King<\/a> can automatically detect changes and technical issues on websites.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/31\/website-graders\"><strong>Website graders<\/strong><\/a> can help the less SEO-savvy to identify needed optimizations and prioritize accordingly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/best-free-website-graders-localiq-grader-report.png\" alt=\"best free website graders - localiq website grader report sample\" width=\"608\" height=\"625\" class=\" wp-image-59589 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/best-free-website-graders-localiq-grader-report.png 608w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/best-free-website-graders-localiq-grader-report-480x493.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 608px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/website-grader\/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Try out our Free Website Grader!<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The increase in these <a href=\"https:\/\/linkgraph.io\/blog\/diy-seo-software\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DIY SEO tools<\/a> will also allow businesses and agencies alike to take care of tactics more efficiently and focus more on strategy.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Changes to CTRs by SERP positions<\/h3>\n<p>Get ready to change what you think you know about CTR and ranking positions.<\/p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/05\/google-introduces-continuous-scrolling-on-desktop-for-search\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">endless scrolling<\/a> now available on both mobile and desktop, Google has made it far easier for users to scroll through multiple pages of SERP results to find the content they seek.<\/p>\n<p>Over the years, the relationship between ranking position and CTR has remained fairly consistent, with the majority of clicks going to the first three results.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-ctr-position.png\" alt=\"2023 seo trends - organic ctr vs position\" width=\"600\" height=\"574\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69429 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-ctr-position.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-ctr-position-480x459.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/google-ctr-stats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>But in 2023, click-through rates are likely to be impacted as searchers more easily navigate across multiple pages of search results.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of those dreaded zero-click searches, we\u2019ve been hearing about for years, a <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/zero-click-study-semrush-389067\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recent SEMrush study<\/a> showed that only about 25.8% of searches resulted in zero clicks. As Google continues to add more featured snippets and search features like People Also Ask, CTRs may not suffer from no clicks as much as originally thought.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-zero-click.png\" alt=\"2023 seo trends - search engine land article on zero click searches\" width=\"720\" height=\"271\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69430 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-zero-click.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-zero-click-480x181.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Although getting to the first page is still ideal, being on page two or three will have more benefits than it once did thanks to endless scrolling. So make sure that you are optimizing those page titles and meta descriptions and using features like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/15\/what-is-schema-markup\">schema markup<\/a> to make your content more engaging and clickable in the SERPs.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Product page SEO<\/h3>\n<p>As Google continues to reward long-form, informative content, pages that tend toward thin content, like product pages, can benefit in 2023 from providing more helpful details on the page.<\/p>\n<p>Drop-down menus, FAQs, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">customer reviews<\/a> are all ways to add additional content to a product page. Although adding keywords to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/06\/26\/product-descriptions\">product description<\/a> is helpful, think of other questions that users may want to be answered about the product before they purchase.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you offer free shipping?<\/li>\n<li>What is the return policy?<\/li>\n<li>Are there warranties, upgrades, or add-ons available with the product?<\/li>\n<li>Are there <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/05\/customer-testimonials\">customer testimonials<\/a> or reviews that you can display with the product?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-product-page.png\" alt=\"2023 seo trends - product page example\" width=\"720\" height=\"462\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69428 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-product-page.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-product-page-480x308.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>These are just a few ways to add additional content to a page that is actually helpful and informative for users who are considering a potential purchase.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p>\ud83d\udea8 Want help keeping up with the trends?

Less crawl frequency<\/h3>\n<p>Google has recently set big <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.google\/commitments\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">climate goals<\/a>, including operating on carbon-free energy by 2023. To achieve that goal, Google has been considering reducing the frequency with which it crawls web pages.<\/p>\n<p>Reducing crawling helps conserve computing resources, and is one of the easiest changes Google can make in line with its sustainability initiatives.<\/p>\n<p>But reduced crawl rates are more likely to impact refresh crawls rather than crawls that discover new content. That means that it may take longer for Google to take notice of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/03\/get-more-traffic-from-evergreen-content\">new changes we make on our websites<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why optimizing your content from the get-go, with all of the on-page elements it will require to rank, is the best strategic choice in 2023.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-2023-on-page-seo.png\" alt=\"seo trends 2023 - on page seo checklist\" width=\"720\" height=\"472\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69436 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-2023-on-page-seo.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-2023-on-page-seo-480x315.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>11. Image SEO revitalized<\/h3>\n<p>Images are often neglected on websites, but they have always played a role in better rankings for image searches.<\/p>\n<p>They also can provide opportunities to include additional keywords and semantically-related terms into our content via alt text.<\/p>\n<p>Google likes to see alt text and schema markup that help their crawlers better understand the content of images. Google also likes to see webmasters who make their content more accessible to all users. Alt text also helps make the internet a better place for those who are visually impaired or individuals limited by internet bandwidth or connectivity challenges.<\/p>\n<p>Follow this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/08\/image-seo\">image SEO checklist<\/a> to make sure you are following all of the must-dos with images in 2023.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-2023-image-seo.png\" alt=\"seo trends 2023 - image seo\" width=\"720\" height=\"482\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69437 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-2023-image-seo.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/seo-trends-2023-image-seo-480x321.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>12.
