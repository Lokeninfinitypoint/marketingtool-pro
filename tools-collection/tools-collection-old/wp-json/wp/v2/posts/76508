Don\u2019t make decisions with your gut!<\/h3>\n<p>All humans are biased, and we over-appreciate our own experiences. Don\u2019t let your experiences blind your marketing. You\u2019re likely the most experienced searcher regarding your own business\u2013and your prospective customers certainly have a different background than you.<\/p>\n<p>You might assume that only people in your business\u2019s town or neighborhood would become customers. Still, you might be surprised at how far people are prepared to travel to find a dentist, doctor, or lawyer they trust (or how far they\u2019ll travel to get away from the options in their own backyards!).<\/p>\n<p>Instead of considering just your immediate area, view data within <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/17\/ga4-features-for-advertisers\">Google Analytics<\/a> to see where past visitors came from and how well they converted on your site. You may be surprised to see how intentionally people might search for your business, even several cities or states away.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Don\u2019t target areas based on their demographic profile<\/h3>\n<p>You see your customers every day, and you likely know them the best! <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">Understanding your target audience<\/a> will be key to building your campaigns, but it might lead you astray when setting up your location-targeting settings. Towns and cities might have very different demographic profiles, but none are strictly homogenous. Even if your target audience is more concentrated in one area, they will search for you wherever they are.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of strictly targeting areas based on their demographic profile, consider improving your ads to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/31\/detailed-demographics\">target users based on their demographics<\/a> and other audience signals.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Don\u2019t over-rely on your CRM data for your customers\u2019 locations<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/customer-data\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">collecting data<\/a> from your past customers\u2013you\u2019re setting yourself up to make better decisions in both your business and advertising. But when it comes to their customers&#8217; location data in your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/09\/crm-for-small-business\">CRM<\/a>, take that with a grain of salt.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that their home address isn\u2019t always where they\u2019re searching. Especially since <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oberlo.com\/blog\/google-search-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nearly two-thirds<\/a> of searches in the US are coming from mobile devices, your customers are likely finding you while they\u2019re searching at home, at work, and everywhere else they go.<\/p>\n<p>Your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/12\/first-party-data\">first-party customer data<\/a> is among the most powerful tools to optimize your Google Ads campaigns.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/types-of-customer-data.webp\" alt=\"types of customer data\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76534\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/types-of-customer-data.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/types-of-customer-data-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Use your CRM data to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/21\/calculate-roi-offline-transactions\">measure offline conversions<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/11\/02\/adwords-customer-match-setup\">create customized audiences with Customer Match<\/a>. But when setting up location targeting, use your customer\u2019s location data as a starting point for your analysis, not the end.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Be cautious of radius targeting<\/h3>\n<p>A common approach for many local businesses is to set their campaigns\u2019 location as a few-mile radius around their storefront. It\u2019s a simple approach that can help you ensure that you\u2019re reaching your local audience in all directions.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/google-ads-location-targeting-radius-targeting.webp\" alt=\"google ads location targeting - radius targeting setup screen\" width=\"738\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76513\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/google-ads-location-targeting-radius-targeting.webp 738w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/google-ads-location-targeting-radius-targeting-480x390.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 738px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/1722043?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">radius targeting<\/a> is deceptively simple\u2013setting a radius of \u201ca few miles\u201d can quickly escalate to your ads reaching a much larger audience than you intended. Agreeing to \u201ctarget a 10-mile radius\u201d might quickly sound like it\u2019s twice the area of \u201ctargeting a 5-mile radius\u201d\u2013but it\u2019s actually not. That 10-mile radius area is <strong><em>four times as large<\/em><\/strong> as that 5-mile radius area. Remember\u2013a circle&#8217;s area grows exponentially with its radius&#8217;s size!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/google-ads-location-targeting-area-of-circle.webp\" alt=\"google ads location targeting - radius of circle\" width=\"448\" height=\"314\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76514\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/google-ads-location-targeting-area-of-circle.webp 448w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/google-ads-location-targeting-area-of-circle-300x210.webp 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Be aware of that verbal trick when you set up your radius targeting. Even if unintentional, your agency or marketing team may increase your reach (and necessary budget) significantly more than you first hear.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/google-ads-location-targeting-increase-radius.webp\" alt=\"google ad location targeting - increase radius\" width=\"936\" height=\"266\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76515\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/google-ads-location-targeting-increase-radius.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/google-ads-location-targeting-increase-radius-480x136.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Of course, the opposite is also true. If you\u2019re a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/09\/free-and-low-budget-marketing-ideas\">local business with a limited budget<\/a>, an effective way to reign in your campaigns\u2019 needed budget is simply to reduce the size of your targeting radius. This verbal trick can be a sneaky way to get a proud business owner or stakeholder to agree to a significant cut in their campaign\u2019s ambitious reach without sounding like you\u2019re cutting your targeting too much.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/google-ads-location-targeting-decrease-targeting.webp\" alt=\"google ads location targeting - decrease location targeting\" width=\"936\" height=\"252\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76516\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/google-ads-location-targeting-decrease-targeting.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/google-ads-location-targeting-decrease-targeting-480x129.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>5. Revisit your targeting regularly<\/h3>\n<p>Once your campaigns are up and running, it\u2019s easy not to look back at their settings. After all, campaigns require enough <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/adwords-optimization\">regular review and optimization<\/a> of their keywords, negative keywords, ads, assets, bids, and account structure. But still, too many advertisers never revisit the location settings they launched their campaigns with. Even if perfect at the time\u2013people move, cities change, and how people search evolves.<\/p>\n<p>Make it a point to review and revisit your location targeting in your campaigns at least every six months. A campaign that is performing well may be worth expanding into some new areas. Or a campaign that is struggling may have too ambitious reach as-is.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLWebBlogInContentTextLinkTrickstoClicks.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_TrickstoClicks_Download\">10 Tricks to Get the Click: How to Write Exceptional Ad Copy<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-analyze-google-ads-location-performance\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to analyze your location performance in Google Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Over the years, Google has changed and hidden its reporting for how your ads perform in different geos. Luckily, you can still see exactly where your ads show the most, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/15\/google-ads-benchmarks\">their costs<\/a>, and conversions across different geographic areas.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Using the Google Ads location report<\/h3>\n<p>The most straightforward place to start is the most obvious. The locations report directly within Google Ads is readily accessible from the left-hand menu in a campaign. Sometimes hidden at the bottom of the bar, click \u201cLocations &gt; Locations,\u201d and you\u2019ll see a standard report that includes each targeting region you typed into your campaign settings.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/google-ads-location-targeting-location-report.webp\" alt=\"google ads location report for location targeting\" width=\"936\" height=\"341\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76517\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/google-ads-location-targeting-location-report.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/google-ads-location-targeting-location-report-480x175.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve only created one location target in your campaign, this is a trivial report as-is. Even if you were to include several, many advertisers get limited value from this screen.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Let me tell you the trick.<\/strong> Check off all your targeted locations, and now a new option appears for \u201cNarrow by.\u201d Click Narrow by\u2013and you\u2019ll be amazed at the specificity you can break your Google Ads geo data down. You can break this national data down to the state, county, city, or zip code. Furthermore, you can see data on unique areas like Congressional districts or Nielsen DMAs or areas of interest like Airports and Universities.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/google-ads-location-targeting-narrow-location.webp\" alt=\"narrow location in google ads location report\" width=\"561\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76518\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/google-ads-location-targeting-narrow-location.webp 561w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/google-ads-location-targeting-narrow-location-480x513.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 561px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\ud83e\uddf1 Build a solid foundation for your campaigns with our free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLAccountStructure.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_LastAccountStructureGuide_Download\">The Last Guide to Google Account Structure You&#8217;ll Ever Need<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<h3>2. Using the Google Ads distance report<\/h3>\n<p>The Google Ads distance report is particularly useful to advertisers who use radius targeting. If you\u2019re unsure how large a radius your campaigns should target, the distance report will become your best tool. To access the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/2453994?hl=en#:~:text=Distance%20reports&amp;text=Your%20data%20will%20be%20organized,or%20content%20they'd%20viewed.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads distance report<\/a>, select the \u201cReports\u201d icon in the top right corner of Google Ads. From there, select \u201cPredefined reports (Dimensions)\u201d &gt; \u201cLocations\u201d &gt; \u201cDistance.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/google-ads-location-targeting-distance-report.webp\" alt=\"google ads location targeting - distance report\" width=\"936\" height=\"377\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76519\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/google-ads-location-targeting-distance-report.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/google-ads-location-targeting-distance-report-480x193.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The Google Ads distance report will show how your ads perform at different distances from your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/09\/19\/adwords-location-extensions-guide\">Location Assets (formerly Location Extensions)<\/a>. You can customize the columns to include relevant metrics or further segment the data.<\/p>\n<p>Bear in mind that this report shows cascading radii that grow in size as you get further from your business. Each row\u2019s data includes the one above it\u2013i.e., the data from \u201cWithin 5 miles\u201d is also counted in the row for \u201cWithin 10 miles.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To see how searchers behave within these ranges, you can easily export this data into Looker Studio or Excel for quick manipulation. Once exported, some simple subtraction can help you understand how people search and convert at different distances from your location. To know how your ads are performing between 1 and 5 miles away, subject the data in the \u201cWithin 1 mile\u201d row of the location report from the data \u201cWithin 5 miles.\u201d Repeat that process for further distances, and you\u2019ll begin to see how far is \u201ctoo far\u201d for your local searchers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/google-ads-location-targeting-distance-from-location.webp\" alt=\"google ads location targeting spreadsheet\" width=\"936\" height=\"479\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76521\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/google-ads-location-targeting-distance-from-location.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/google-ads-location-targeting-distance-from-location-480x246.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-optimize-google-ads-location-performance\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to optimize your location performance with bid adjustments in Google Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you have more insight into how your ads perform in different areas, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/07\/google-ads-geotargeting\">optimize your targeting<\/a>.
