Here&#8217;s What Might Replace It"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Whether they saw it coming or not, and whether they believe it or not, everyone in SEO sat up and noticed when Matt Cutts declared that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mattcutts.com\/blog\/guest-blogging\/\">guest blogging is dead<\/a>. We\u2019d all like to believe that we only guest-blog to share our knowledge, but the truth is, most of us have guest-blogged and gladly taken the links that came along with it. And the conversation has really been about links all week: Can guest-blogging survive without links? How do we get links if we don&#8217;t guest-blog anymore?<\/p>\n<p>But aren\u2019t we just treading water here? Guest blogging was just one tactic as part of a larger link-building strategy. Google is slowly chipping away at all our link-building tactics. Rather than replacing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/guest-posting-guidelines\">guest blogging<\/a> with another kind of link building, maybe it\u2019s time to think about a system that isn\u2019t dependent on links.<\/p>\n<p>We think we know what that system could be. Read on to see how we got there.<\/p>\n<h2>A Brief History of the Link for SEO<\/h2>\n<p>Some \u201cduh\u201d level <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/30\/seo-basics\">SEO-basics<\/a> background: Search engines used to run on keywords alone. It didn\u2019t work well because keywords were too easy to manipulate. People stuffed their meta keywords field and hid keywords all over the page in the digital equivalent of invisible ink (white text on a white background).<\/p>\n<p>Then Google came along and changed the game. They recognized the value of the hyperlink \u2013 a link was more than a pathway to another part of the Internet, it was a vote of confidence. Go ahead, a link says, leave my site and visit this other one, it\u2019s worth it. So Google\u2019s ranking algorithm was heavily dependent on incoming links, which were less manipulable.<\/p>\n<p>You can see where this is going. The SEO industry grew right alongside Google\u2019s rise to dominance, and while it\u2019s harder to get links than it is to keyword-stuff your own pages, plenty of SEO\u2019s discovered that you could still game the system and manipulate that \u201cnatural\u201d ranking signal.<\/p>\n<p>And here\u2019s how that progressed:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"48fee23f-474d-4c90-a59a-9b5876a8fe03\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/death-of-link-for-seo-1.png\" alt=\"Linkless SEO\" width=\"582\" height=\"249\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The advice that SEO thought leaders and pundits (including us) typically give to websites and companies trying to get ranked is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create great content that <em>naturally<\/em> earns links<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t do anything with the sole intention of getting links, just add value to the world<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This is all well and good for now. But it won\u2019t work forever; it\u2019s not sustainable. As people continue to find more creative ways to build links, Google will have to work harder to sort \u201cgood links\u201d from \u201cbad links.\u201d And I predict that the next iteration of Google (or whatever search engine replaces it) won\u2019t revolve around links \u2013 at the least, they&#8217;ll have a lot less weight in the algorithm as a ranking signal.<\/p>\n<h2>How Google Is Killing Its Own Value System<\/h2>\n<p>Google\u2019s current logic around links and link building is full of holes and dead ends:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google is founded on the principle that off-page factors are more valuable than on-page factors. <strong>They are slowly learning that off-page factors can be manipulated too.<\/strong> But instead of looking for the Next Big Thing (the thing, like <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/15\/most-links\">most links<\/a> used to be, that is currently too hard to manipulate) they just keep tinkering with their old algorithm and scolding SEO\u2019s. The latest scold was over <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/01\/20\/guest-blogging\">guest blogging<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Matt Cutts said this week that guest posting is OK \u2026 <em>\u201cif you\u2019re not doing it for search engine optimization (SEO) purposes.\u201d<\/em> Let\u2019s just stop and think about how silly this is. <strong>The implication is that it\u2019s your motives that matter, not your actions.<\/strong> You can guest-post but only out of pure altruism. And Google will <em>know<\/em> you\u2019re being altruistic because of the absence of links. But if publishers actually followed this advice, you\u2019d have a bunch of \u201cgreat content\u201d getting created without any outgoing links. And without links, how is Google supposed to know what\u2019s great?<\/li>\n<li>Cutts seems to think that people wants links as an end in themselves. He says you can guest-post for exposure and branding but not for links. <strong>But people want links for the exact same reason they\u2019d want a bylined article in Forbes<\/strong>: Links are a form of exposure, both directly (through referral traffic) and indirectly, through SEO. And people don\u2019t want high rankings as an end in themselves either, they want high rankings because high rankings give you exposure. Cutts concedes that it\u2019s OK for marketers to do stuff for exposure, but for some reason links are no longer a valid form of that? That\u2019s funny, since the whole idea behind Google is that links mean something.<\/li>\n<li>What if Cutts had said \u201cUsing keywords is OK if you\u2019re not doing it for search engine optimization (SEO) purposes.\u201d Or \u201cCreating YouTube videos is OK if you\u2019re not doing it for search engine optimization (SEO) purposes.\u201d It would sound ridiculous. We <em>know<\/em> certain tactics are good for SEO, and Google can\u2019t actually distinguish between a piece of content that just happens to be perfectly optimized versus one that was optimized on purpose. Google isn\u2019t a Turing test and it can\u2019t see into our souls. <strong>The purpose of the algorithm should be to rank the best content, not the content created with the purest of intentions and the least technical knowledge of SEO. <\/strong><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/badams\/status\/425376156464861184\">As Barry Adams said on Twitter recently<\/a>, <strong>Google has basically evolved to consider any off-page optimization as spam<\/strong>. But they\u2019re drawing the line in a pretty arbitrary place. You can barrage people with your non-stop flow of content and hope people link to it, but you can\u2019t outright ask for a link.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6e95ac17-da0a-4cac-9b68-2a3afc3fc5e0\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/off-page-seo-link-building-is-spam-1.png\" alt=\"link building is spam\" width=\"420\" height=\"254\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<ul>\n<li>There are more and more businesses and websites every day, but the first page of Google isn\u2019t getting any bigger. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blindfiveyearold.com\/are-you-winning-the-attention-auction\">Attention is scarce<\/a>. <strong>The answer can\u2019t <em>simply<\/em> be content (and I say this as someone whose job title includes the word \u201ccontent\u201d) because we\u2019re already drowning in content.<\/strong> It should be possible for a business to exist without constantly churning out \u201ccontent.\u201d If the business offers something that people want or need, people should be able to use a well-made search engine to find that business, without having to indirectly happen upon their great content first. I\u2019m dreaming of a simple website that does one thing well and doesn\u2019t grow by one page size every day.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It\u2019s going to get harder and harder for Google to tell the difference between editorial links and manipulated links<\/strong>, in part because of all the noise (<em>so. much. content.<\/em>) and in part because it\u2019s possible to create good, useful content \u201cfor SEO purposes.\u201d A manipulated article and a non-manipulated article might look exactly the same. But Google seems to be flirting with the idea of devaluing both, just to be safe.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We can all keep trying to get links without calling it link building, but it&#8217;s looking more and more like Google&#8217;s breaking up with links.<\/p>\n<h2>So What Will Replace the Link?<\/h2>\n<p>To be honest, I didn\u2019t know. But as often happens in crazy times like these, Larry and I were on the same page. We were both thinking about this question yesterday, and he thinks he\u2019s got it figured out. In fact he said \u201cI\u2019m <em>sure<\/em> of it.\u201d The answer? <strong>Quality Score<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"0e770209-909d-4e75-9a6b-ee29a6dd83da\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/altavista-1999-1.png\" alt=\"Death of SEO Link\" width=\"799\" height=\"565\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Larry pointed out that Google needed links to get started. There were a bunch of different search engines at the time (Yahoo, Altavista, etc.) and less search traffic overall. They needed a way to map out the web and get a rough idea of the good and the bad. Fast-forward 15 years. Now that there are billions of searches a day, Google doesn\u2019t really need links anymore. It can use the wisdom of crowds, an enormous source of data which doesn\u2019t always involve links.<\/p>\n<h2>How Quality Score for Organic Search Might Work<\/h2>\n<p>Google puts tons of resources into its <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/10\/24\/adwords-ad-rank-algorithm\">ad ranking<\/a> algorithm. (Ads, of course, are the real moneymaker, but no one would click the ads if the search engine wasn\u2019t useful on its own.) And how does it rank ads? Not just according to bids, because that would water down relevance. So Google came up with Quality Score, a way of treating ads like content.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/10\/01\/quality-score-case-study\">AdWords Quality Score<\/a> is largely based on click-through rate (CTR). There is a lot of Google fairy dust about how exactly it\u2019s calculated, but our internal research indicates that it\u2019s basically just the CTR of an ad at a given position in comparison to the expected click-through rate at that same position. As for stuff that hasn\u2019t had a chance to get to the first page, Google can \u201caudition\u201d new ads and get a good sense for if they\u2019re any good or not within just 200 impressions.<\/p>\n<p>We think organic search could benefit from the same kind of algorithm \u2013 <strong>an algorithm that counts engagement metrics over links<\/strong>. These engagement metrics would include stuff like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Click-through rate<\/li>\n<li>Bounce rate<\/li>\n<li>Time on page<\/li>\n<li>Social shares<\/li>\n<li>Number of comments<\/li>\n<li>Etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google could capture engagement metrics like bounce rate from Google Analytics, Google Chrome browsers (it\u2019s the most used browser on mobile), and apps like Google+. Cutts just said that <a href=\"http:\/\/searchengineland.com\/googles-matt-cutts-facebook-twitter-pages-are-treated-like-any-other-web-page-on-the-internet-182370\">Google doesn\u2019t use Facebook or Twitter social signals in its ranking algorithm<\/a>, but many suspect part of the long game for Google+ is owning social data for ranking purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, Quality Score can scale. There are only 3 billion searches on Google per day, but it serves <a href=\"http:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2012\/10\/25\/how-google-makes-over-100-million-a-day-and-how-goog-lost-21-billion-last-week-infographic\/\">5.6 billion search ads every day<\/a> (not to mention the 24 billion plus display ads).<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking at it from the perspective of a marketer or a business, there are plenty of reasons why an organic Quality Score system might benefit you. Instead of constantly trying to create random kinds of content that might generate links, you could focus on (for example) <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/07\/11\/landing-page-conversion-rate-guide\">optimizing your landing pages for conversion<\/a>. A landing page designed for lead gen might work perfectly well and satisfy its visitors completely, but not get any links (who links to a landing page)? The overall emphasis is still on quality content, but the goal is different. You&#8217;re simply serving your users, many of whom may not have websites or the time and inclination to link.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut what about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/08\/17\/click-fraud\">click fraud<\/a>!\u201d you say. The fact is Google has already invested a lot into fighting click fraud \u2013 if they couldn\u2019t detect or prevent it, their AdWords engine would be in trouble. So why couldn\u2019t Google apply those same click fraud filters to determine which content is (naturally) getting the most clicks and subsequent engagement? (They have to fight spam on the paid side too; they <a href=\"http:\/\/www.seroundtable.com\/google-block-ads-publishers-17981.html\">removed 350 million bad ads in 2013<\/a> and rejected 3 million publishers.)<\/p>\n<p>Is this a crazy idea? Not really \u2013 one search engine has already decided that links don\u2019t matter. Russian-based <a href=\"http:\/\/searchengineland.com\/yandex-to-stop-counting-links-as-a-ranking-factor-for-commercial-queries-in-moscow-179209\">Yandex uses user behavior and engagement instead of links<\/a>. And Google is in a position to take the same approach and do it better, because they have way more data.<\/p>\n<p>What do you think? Are we right?
