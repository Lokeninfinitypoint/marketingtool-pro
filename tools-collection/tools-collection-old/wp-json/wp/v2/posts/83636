Running a SWOT analysis allows business owners and leaders to take a frank look at their operations and determine the <strong>strengths, weakness, opportunities, and threats<\/strong> that they face in their niche.<\/p>\n<p>Because if you don\u2019t know what you do well, and what you don\u2019t, how is it possible to grow and get better? It\u2019s this question that a SWOT analysis seeks to answer, and it does so by providing a simple framework by which business owners can assess and optimize.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s walk through a quick primer on what exactly a SWOT analysis is, and how to complete one effectively. Then, we\u2019ll give a rundown of three SWOT analysis examples that you can use to see this powerful framework in action.<\/p>\n<h3>Contents<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#what-is-a-swot-analysis\">What is a SWOT analysis?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#good-swot-analysis-examples\">What are some examples of SWOT analyses?<\/a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#disney-swot-analysis-example\">Disney SWOT analysis example<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcdonalds-swot-analysis-example\">McDonald\u2019s SWOT analysis example<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#google-swot-analysis-example\">Google SWOT analysis example<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"what-is-a-swot-analysis\"><\/div>\n<h2>What is a SWOT analysis?<\/h2>\n<p>As mentioned, a SWOT analysis is a strategic planning tool used to evaluate the <strong>strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats<\/strong> facing a business.

Strengths and weaknesses are internal. Opportunities and threats? These are external. Here\u2019s how each of these components are typically defined:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Strengths<\/strong>: Internal attributes and resources that give an organization an <em>advantage<\/em> over others in achieving its objectives. These include things like skilled personnel, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/06\/online-reputation-management\">strong brand reputation<\/a>, powerful technology, and efficient processes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Weaknesses<\/strong>: Internal factors that <em>hinder<\/em> an organization&#8217;s performance or competitiveness. These could include lack of resources, outdated technology, poor management practices, or inefficient processes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Opportunities<\/strong>: External factors or situations that an organization can <em>exploit<\/em> to its advantage. These include things like emerging markets, product innovation, changes in consumer preferences, or favorable regulatory changes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Threats<\/strong>: External factors that could potentially cause trouble for the organization. These include things like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/21\/competitive-analysis-templates\">increased competition<\/a>, economic downturns, changing market trends, or regulatory challenges.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, the goal of the SWOT analysis is to make it easier for business owners and stakeholders to <strong>make informed decisions<\/strong> and <strong>create effective strategies<\/strong> to achieve their goals and win more business.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 Speaking of effective strategies&#8230; Worried your Google Ads strategy needs work?

Businesses increasingly shift their IT infrastructure to cloud platforms, with spending reaching closing in on $100 billion. Google stands poised to capitalize on this expanding market, leveraging its resources to bolster its market share and compete more effectively.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/google-cloud-computing.webp\" alt=\"google cloud computing capabilities\" width=\"875\" height=\"467\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83665\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/google-cloud-computing.webp 875w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/google-cloud-computing-480x256.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 875px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Virtual reality ventures.<\/strong> The artificial reality and virtual reality (AR and VR) market offer immense potential for Google&#8217;s investment.

Competitors like Microsoft have swiftly entered the arena and established dominance. These developments underscore the vast potential in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/15\/ai-marketing\">AI and machine learning<\/a>, offering Google numerous opportunities for success.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Threats<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Market disruption by emerging competitors.<\/strong> The ascent of emerging technologies challenges Google&#8217;s market dominance, making strategic responses crucial.

Furthermore, in online advertising, platforms like Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and Amazon offer targeted use cases for advertisers, intensifying competition.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Persistent legal battles and privacy concerns.<\/strong> Despite its stature, Google faces a barrage of lawsuits, exposing it to financial and reputational risks.
