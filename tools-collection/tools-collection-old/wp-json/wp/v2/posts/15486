There are three ways to fill your Instagram shop&#8217;s catalog: pull from an existing Facebook catalog, connect to your ecommerce website, or create a new catalog. Once you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll be able to share those products with customers in a number of really attractive ways.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/how-to-sell-on-Instagram.jpg\" alt=\"how to sell on Instagram - screenshot of an Instagram shop\" width=\"402\" height=\"595\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75633 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/how-to-sell-on-Instagram.jpg 402w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/how-to-sell-on-Instagram-203x300.jpg 203w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/tools\/shopping-catalog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>If you have a shop and catalog on Facebook already, this part is easy peasy. Just head to the Catalog Manager, click Settings &gt; click Business Assets &gt; click Instagram &gt; click Add Instagram Account.<\/p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can connect your existing ecommerce website to Instagram. Then your existing catalog from your online shop will be readily available on Instagram. Here are the directions to connect a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/646757258759189\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shopify store<\/a> or a <a href=\"https:\/\/support.bigcommerce.com\/s\/article\/Selling-on-Facebook-Shop-Pages?language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BigCommerce store<\/a> to Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, if you\u2019re starting from scratch and not connecting to an ecommerce site, you\u2019ll need to create a catalog through Facebook\u2019s Commerce Manager. This page will <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/1122222851277569?id=725943027795860\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">walk you through that process<\/a>. That&#8217;s also where you&#8217;ll complete the setup and manage your shop moving forward.<\/p>\n<h3>Create shoppable posts<\/h3>\n<p>You may be familiar with <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-tag-someone-on-instagram\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tagging your friends in Instagram posts<\/a>. Well, with your shiny new business account, you can also tag products in your Instagram posts.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/social-shopping-instagram-news-feed-3.jpg.webp\" alt=\"How to sell on Instagram - screenshot of an Instagram post\" width=\"454\" height=\"898\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75634 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/social-shopping-instagram-news-feed-3.jpg.webp 454w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/social-shopping-instagram-news-feed-3.jpg-152x300.webp 152w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Each tag tells viewers the product name and price. Tapping the tag takes shoppers right to either your Instagram shop or your online store (you choose).<\/p>\n<p>Shopping posts flow well in the Instagram feed because they look exactly like any other post except for the small shopping bag icon.<\/p>\n<p>To create your own, upload a photo that includes your product(s) just like you would any other post. Write your caption and add hashtags. Then tap Tag Products in the editor, pick where you want the tag to show on the image, and pick the relevant product from your catalog. Tap Share and your post is out there, ready for people to browse it and buy.<\/p>\n<h3>Add Instagram Checkout<\/h3>\n<p>Even with Shoppable posts, there\u2019s a little bit of conversion friction when someone has to click through to your website and complete the purchase there. Instagram Checkout makes the purchase process smooth as silk by letting shoppers pay for products right in the app.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what the path to purchase looks like from tapping the shoppable ad through Instagram Checkout.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/how-to-sell-on-instagram-example-nike.jpg\" alt=\"How to sell on Instagram - a series of screenshots showing the checkout process on Instagram\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75635 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/how-to-sell-on-instagram-example-nike.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/how-to-sell-on-instagram-example-nike-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Without any website jumping, you could see a nice bump in your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/conversion-rate\">conversion rates<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"tips\"><\/div>\n<h2>6 tips to sell more on Instagram<\/h2>\n<p>Now that we know how to sell on Instagram, let\u2019s explore some ways to get more people to peruse your posts and purchase your products.<\/p>\n<h3>Publish a variety of posts<\/h3>\n<p>Most people don\u2019t want to be sold to 100% of the time. To<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/get-more-instagram-followers#:~:text=The%2023%20ways%20to%20get%20more%20followers%20in,through%20other%20users%20Best%20practices%20for%20increasing%20followers\"> get more followers on Instagram<\/a>, plan to publish a variety of regular, non-promotional posts.<\/p>\n<p>There are hundreds of creative post ideas to get people\u2019s attention and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/27\/how-to-increase-instagram-engagement\">increase engagement<\/a> with your account. Here are just a few:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/11\/16\/inclusive-holiday-marketing-ideas\">Promote awareness<\/a> for a cause<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/04\/instagram-story-ads-polls\">Poll<\/a> your audience<\/li>\n<li>Publish video <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/22\/instagram-reels-ideas-for-businesses\">Reels <\/a>with captions and music<\/li>\n<li>Schedule <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/01\/instagram-story-ideas\">creative Stories<\/a> with graphics, images, and video<\/li>\n<li>Write fun, <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/instagram-captions-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">engaging captions<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There\u2019s no scientific ratio of shoppable to regular posts. But aim for around one to three shoppable posts out of every ten total posts you publish. You can dial that in after seeing how your account performs.<\/p>\n<h3>Work with influencers<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/26\/influencer-marketing\">Influencer marketing<\/a> has been a valuable tactic for businesses looking to generate sales from social media for a while now. Influencers plus shoppable posts are a potent one-two punch for brands looking to sell more on Instagram.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/How-to-sell-on-instagram-example-biore.jpg\" alt=\"How to sell on Instagram - screenshot of an Instagram post featuring an influencer\" width=\"619\" height=\"444\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75636 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/How-to-sell-on-instagram-example-biore.jpg 619w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/How-to-sell-on-instagram-example-biore-480x344.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 619px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Most influencers aren\u2019t highly paid celebrities. And that\u2019s a good thing. A micro-influencer with a few thousand loyal fans is likely more affordable than a big-name personality and they may come off as more relatable, too.<\/p>\n<h3>Use hashtags<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/29\/instagram-hashtags\">Instagram hashtags<\/a> are easy to add to your posts and make your content easier for new fans and followers to discover. Plus, you can add many hashtags to get even more exposure.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/how-to-sell-on-Instagram-example-siggis.jpg\" alt=\"How to sell on Instagram - screenshot of an Instagram post from Siggi's\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75637 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/how-to-sell-on-Instagram-example-siggis.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/how-to-sell-on-Instagram-example-siggis-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The challenge is finding the right hashtags for your business. They should be relevant to your brand so the people that find you are potential customers.<\/p>\n<p>There are a few types of hashtags to consider:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Location: #detroitshoestore<\/li>\n<li>Popular: #dogsofinstagram<\/li>\n<li>Trending: #marchmadness2024<\/li>\n<li>Branded: #siggisyougurt<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To find your perfect mix of hashtags, type some related terms into the query bar on Instagram and see what variations show up.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/how-to-sell-on-Instagram-example-query-300x96.jpg\" alt=\"How to sell on Instagram - screenshot of the Instagram query bar\" width=\"300\" height=\"96\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-75639\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Share UGC<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/28\/user-generated-content\">User generated content<\/a> is what we in the business call a triple threat. It gives you a steady stream of great content to post, it gives you access to the creator\u2019s audience, and it acts as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/10\/social-proof-guide\">social proof<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/how-to-sell-on-Instagram-example-Starbucks-1.jpg\" alt=\"How to sell on Instagram - screenshot of a Starbucks post\" width=\"814\" height=\"600\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-75640 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/how-to-sell-on-Instagram-example-Starbucks-1.jpg 814w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/how-to-sell-on-Instagram-example-Starbucks-1-480x354.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 814px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can find ready-to-share UGC content right on Instagram by searching for relevant hashtags (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.gramfeed.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GramFeed<\/a> is a neat tool for that purpose). Or you can use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/instagram-giveaways\">contests<\/a> and branded hashtags to get people creating new content for you.<\/p>\n<h3>Use shoppable Reels and Stories<\/h3>\n<p>In-feed posts aren\u2019t the only types of content you can make shoppable. Instagram lets you add shopping tags to Reels and Stories, too.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/22\/instagram-reels-ideas-for-businesses\">Reels<\/a> are short-form videos that compete with what you see on TikTok. They\u2019re great for showing your products in real-life situations.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/How-to-sell-on-instagram-example-Hawiian.jpg\" alt=\"How to sell on Instagram - screenshot of a Reels post with shoppable links\" width=\"343\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75641 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/How-to-sell-on-instagram-example-Hawiian.jpg 343w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/How-to-sell-on-instagram-example-Hawiian-172x300.jpg 172w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 343px) 100vw, 343px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Stories are posts that only last for up to 24 hours and can be static images or video.

To <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/26\/instagram-stories-shopping\">make a Story shoppable<\/a>, add a sticker (kind of like a tag) that links to the product.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/How-to-sell-on-instagram-example-madewell.jpg\" alt=\"How to sell on Instagram - screenshot of a Story with shoppable stickers\" width=\"351\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75642 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/How-to-sell-on-instagram-example-madewell.jpg 351w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/How-to-sell-on-instagram-example-madewell-176x300.jpg 176w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Use Instagram ads<\/h3>\n<p>Publishing organic shoppable posts is a great, free way to get more buyers for your products online.
