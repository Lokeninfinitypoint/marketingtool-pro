It\u2019s worked out to somewhere in the neighborhood of 780 hours of staying up to date on the latest case studies, tips, detailed how-to guides, and original research \u2013 we\u2019re talking thousands of articles here!<\/p>\n<p>On the off chance you haven\u2019t been keeping up to this extent every day, I wanted to share my picks for the best, most informative, absolute must-read PPC articles of 2013.<\/p>\n<p>Some I had bookmarked, others were filed away in my mind, and others still were contributed by industry peeps including <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/robert_brady\">Robert Brady<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Mel66\">Melissa Mackey<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DannyNMIGoodwin\">Danny Goodwin<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SamOwenPPC\">Sam Owen<\/a> at PPC Hero, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/michellemsem\">Michelle Morehouse<\/a> at Clix, and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ajkohn\">AJ Kohn<\/a> \u2013 thank you all! (See more awesome contributions in this <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/larrykim\/status\/413685229740896256\">Twitter thread<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>The top PPC posts this year weren\u2019t rants, or interesting factoids lacking actionable takeaways. We saw a lot of impactful news, but the top posts went beyond news coverage and offered additional insight marketers can actually use to evaluate this year\u2019s performance and really kill it in 2014.<\/p>\n<p>Drum roll please\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>Best PPC Case Studies<\/h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, we really didn\u2019t see a lot of case studies in 2013. That was surprising, given how most SEM\/PPC work is very analytical; I had expected to see more articles based on real-world data (as opposed to generic platitudes and speculation). However, these case studies stood out:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sam Owen<\/strong> put together an excellent bit of analysis at PPC Hero when he asked, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ppchero.com\/case-study-do-people-actually-click-sitelinks\/\"><em>Do People Actually Click Sitelinks?<\/em><\/a> Well, do they? Yes and no \u2013 see his post for details!<\/p>\n<p>Melissa Mackey shared a <a href=\"http:\/\/searchenginewatch.com\/article\/2318053\/The-Actual-Impact-of-PPC-on-Sales-Case-Study%20-\">client case study at Search Engine Watch<\/a> to illustrate the true value of PPC visits on sales.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2a6dac73-a4ad-4b70-af81-1fa59353e606\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-case-study-melissa-mackey-1.png\" alt=\"The Impact of PPC on Sales\" width=\"580\" height=\"358\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Though she took some flak for leaving cost out of the equation, kudos to her for putting together a comprehensive, in-depth case study and sharing it with takeaways for others.<\/p>\n<p>Marty Weintraub of AimClear wrote that content marketing can and should always be amplified <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aimclearblog.com\/2013\/05\/20\/why-seo-link-builders-are-dead-without-paid-organic-social-content-distribution\/\">using both paid and organic social content distribution<\/a>, no matter how strong the non-paid distribution, he argues that content is wasted compared to the exposure it could receive for relatively small money.<\/p>\n<p>We also love sharing case studies based on the masses of data we have at our disposal. Two that went over really well were:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data and insight from 18 months of remarketing to achieve specific goals in <a href=\"http:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/remarketing-how-to-make-your-content-marketing-seo-up-to-7x-more-awesome\"><em>Remarketing: How to Make Your Content Marketing and SEO up to 7x More Awesome<\/em><\/a>, at Moz.<\/li>\n<li>An in-depth look into Quality Scores, using a small insurance business account for analysis, in <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/10\/01\/quality-score-case-study\"><em>Case Study: The Anatomy of a Killer Quality Score<\/em><\/a>, here on the WordStream blog.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And the moral of the story, PPC pros and bloggers, is that we need more case studies! Enough with the \u201cdo it this way because I said so\u201d posts. As Google continues to strip away data, it\u2019s more important than ever to share solid, factual advice based on real research.<\/p>\n<h2>Detailed PPC How-To Guides<\/h2>\n<p>I love a detailed how-to guide. Done right, they\u2019re incredibly helpful and a great way to share your knowledge with the community. Here are a few excellent how-to resources your PPC colleagues shared in 2013.<\/p>\n<p>Eric Couch from Hanapin Marketing wrote a fantastic guide to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ppchero.com\/3-easy-adwords-scripts-to-analyze-your-account-part-1\/\">AdWords scripts you can use for account analysis<\/a>, on the PPC Hero blog.<\/p>\n<p>Also at PPC Hero, Amanda West-Bookwalk shared <em>The<\/em> <em>Total Guide to Product Listing Ads<\/em> series, beginning with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ppchero.com\/the-total-guide-to-product-listing-ads-part-1-setting-up-your-data-feed\/\">Step 1: Setting Up Your Data Feed<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1e610bda-3f8c-4a04-91b6-169c843c467d\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/remarketing-lists-for-search-guide-1.jpg\" alt=\"Remarketing Lists for Search Guide\" width=\"430\" height=\"300\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Big Click Co.\u2019s Lisa Raehsler did an amazing job explaining RLSA in her resource, <a href=\"http:\/\/searchenginewatch.com\/article\/2280819\/Google-AdWords-Remarketing-Lists-For-Search-Ads-RLSA-The-Ultimate-Guide\"><em>Google AdWords Remarketing Lists for Search Ads: The Ultimate Guide<\/em><\/a>. She went far beyond explaining how to set them up to include best practices, creative ways to use them, and campaign ideas. Packed with tips and insight, it really earned the phrase \u201cultimate guide.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the spring, Google began rolling out a massive overhaul of the AdWords Keyword Planner, with features and changes that would definitely change the workflow for marketers using it. <a href=\"http:\/\/searchengineland.com\/how-to-use-the-keyword-planner-the-new-keyword-tool-from-google-adwords-157123\">My guide on the new planner<\/a> went on to become the top column on Search Engine Land in 2013!

Here are a few that stood out, including some from Bing, Adobe, and WordStream:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/kohkiyamaguchi\">Kohki Yamaguchi<\/a>, from Adobe\u2019s digital marketing team, wrote a timely and detailed post on his PLA research. He tracked impression results across more than 180 product categories for 6 weeks, then combined his findings with bid and CTR data for further insight into how PLAs behave. See his <a href=\"http:\/\/marketingland.com\/4-must-know-facts-on-product-listing-ad-mechanics-57385\"><em>4 Must-Know Facts on Product Listing Ad Mechanics<\/em><\/a> at Search Engine Land for more.<\/p>\n<p>Bing Ads Evangelist John Gagnon shares quite a bit of original research throughout the year, including Bing\u2019s series of reports on consumer interest in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.clickz.com\/clickz\/column\/2301115\/dont-use-holiday-in-retail-ppc-ad-copy-other-surprising-optimization-tips\">various keywords in ad titles and copy<\/a>, across a number of verticals. A real standout from John this year after Google\u2019s move to \u201cnot provided\u201d keyword info, when he shared comScore data on the audience exclusive to Bing (see below).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3173d7e2-8da8-4cc3-b933-0e86a177900d\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/audience-exclusive-to-bing-1.png\" alt=\"Audience You can Reach Only on the Yahoo!

We compared the two as far as network reach, ad performance, mobile ad performance and ad formats. Who came out on top? <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/11\/05\/twitter-versus-facebook-ad-performance\">Check it out<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Hottest PPC Topics in 2013<\/h2>\n<p>Every year, there are a few stories that seem to dominate industry news. This year, Enhanced Campaigns was definitely \u201cthat guy\u201d; it was a story when it was announced, and it remained a hot topic for the rest of the year. Not to be outdone though, Quality Score stole a bit of the limelight, as well.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Enhanced Campaigns<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if half the PPC articles in 2013 were about Enhanced Campaigns, which was announced in February on the <a href=\"http:\/\/adwords.blogspot.com\/2013\/02\/introducing-enhanced-campaigns.html\">Google Blog<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I also believe that about 99% of the posts published were from SEMs upset about the changes, i.e., \u201cWhy No Tablet Targeting!\u201d [Shakes Fist at Google]. There are literally too many to list out here, but <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/aimclear\">Marty Weintraub<\/a> from AimClear does a great job at rounding up around 100 of them in his article <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aimclearblog.com\/2013\/06\/26\/enhanced-campaigns-love-em-or-loath-em-kiss-your-sweet-goodbye\/\"><em>Enhanced Campaigns? Love Em or Loathe Em, Kiss Your Sweet $$ Goodbye<\/em>.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>I took the news much differently than many; the old system of campaign cloning was one I found unnecessarily complicated and such a hassle to work with. In fact, it was so clunky that very few people were actually using those features. I found the new system a lot more intuitive and realized early on that it could even lead to better performance, as <a href=\"http:\/\/searchengineland.com\/the-real-reason-why-google-is-dropping-the-tablet-vs-desktop-distinction-its-the-user-context-stupid-149738\">I argued at Search Engine Land<\/a> in February.<\/p>\n<p>More recently, we did some research and found that <a href=\"http:\/\/searchengineland.com\/new-data-suggests-adwords-enhanced-campaigns-actually-work-173315\">ECs weren\u2019t nearly as bad<\/a> as people initially thought.<\/p>\n<p>And just in October, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/GeorgeMichie1\">George Michie<\/a> from RKG confirmed that companies using Enhanced Campaigns and mobile modifiers were definitely benefiting from it. In his <a href=\"http:\/\/searchengineland.com\/enhanced-campaigns-the-problem-of-modifier-stacking-173825\">column at Search Engine Land<\/a>, Michie set out to break down a common problem with ECs: modifiers have to be applied on top of one another in a stack, which isn\u2019t optimal if the effects you\u2019re targeting are not completely independent of one another.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Quality Score <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I might have stirred the pot earlier this year by publishing some <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/03\/26\/google-quality-score\">new research and analysis<\/a> showing that Quality Score is worth 200% more than it was 2 years ago. The basic premise was that as average Quality Scores have drifted lower over the last 4 years, the value of an above-average quality score (in terms of reduced CPCs and higher ad positioning) has become worth more.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"8072e40b-03bf-45a3-ba1d-c23f7cd41a01\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-quality-score-1.png\" alt=\"The Impact of Quality Score on CPC in 2013\" width=\"752\" height=\"384\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Michelle Morehouse at Clix Marketing did a great job summarizing the various viewpoints and offering advice in her post, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.clixmarketing.com\/blog\/2013\/09\/16\/adwords-quality-score-hype-changes-and-tracking-tools\/\"><em>AdWords Quality Score: Hype, Changes and Tracking Tools<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>A few of the bloggers in favor of optimizing for Quality Score included <a href=\"http:\/\/qualityscores.com\/why-i-optimize-for-quality-score-and-you-already-do-too\/\">James at QualityScore.com<\/a> and Michael Wiegand at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.portent.com\/blog\/ppc\/better-quality-score-better-results.htm\">Portent Interactive. <\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.portent.com\/blog\/ppc\/better-quality-score-better-results.htm\">On the \u201cNo\u201d side<\/a>, we had a few posts\u2026all written by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/suzyvirtual\">Susan Waldes<\/a> at 3Q Digital. <a href=\"http:\/\/3qdigital.com\/google\/why-i-dont-optimize-for-quality-score\/\">The first<\/a> warns of \u201cfuzzy math\u201d and begins, \u201cAlthough Google says that QS is evaluated in real time, they\u00a0don\u2019t\u00a0say that the UI-displayed QS is evaluated in real time, nor do they give the frequency with which the visible one is updated.\u201d In July, she <a href=\"http:\/\/3qdigital.com\/google\/new-quality-score-same-conclusion-dont-optimize-for-it\/\">reiterated her position<\/a> as \u201can established QS naysayer,\u201d after Google announced a change in the way QS was reported.
