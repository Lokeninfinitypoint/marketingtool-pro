Depending on your industry, audience, and resources, you might choose one or any combination of the following:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Growth stats<\/h3>\n<p><span><span><span>Share stats and facts that show how you&#8217;ve <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/12\/growth-marketing\">grown<\/a>, such as: reached x customers, welcomed x new team members, opened a new location, moved to a bigger office, launched a new partnership.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><span><span><span lang=\"EN\"><span><span><span>Avoid vanity metrics or offputting stats like number of social media followers or upgrades.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>2. Milestones &amp; achievements<\/h3>\n<p><span><span><span>Look back on some of the intangibles, like awards or nominations, successful events, new or improved products, features, or services,\u00a0 anniversaries, or big projects like a rebrand, new site launch, or acquisition.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>3. Account-specific\u00a0reports<\/h3>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>People love when someone\u00a0<em>else<\/em>\u00a0talks about them or celebrates their achievements.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><span><span><span><span><span>Spotify&#8217;s Wrapped\u00a0is a quintessential example of this type of year-end recap, but it&#8217;s great for any device, app, or account with individual stats,<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><span><span><span>This is also popular for SaaS platforms with analytics.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/year-in-review-email-examples-iterable-numbers.png\" alt=\"year-in-review-email-examples-iterable-numbers\" width=\"500\" height=\"643\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52520 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/year-in-review-email-examples-iterable-numbers.png 500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/year-in-review-email-examples-iterable-numbers-480x617.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/reallygoodemails.com\/emails\/your-2018-year-in-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>4. Superlatives<\/h3>\n<p><span><span><span>Sharing stats and data for every account can be resource-heavy and sometimes runs the risk of syncing issues or data not loading. Instead, you might take a look at your behavioral data and identify trends from your<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/17\/customer-insights\">\u00a0customer insights<\/a>, like the top-selling products, most popular blog posts, most shared social media posts, most popular product of <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/april-newsletter-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">each month<\/a>, and more.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>5. Industry stories<\/h3>\n<p><span><span><span>Some businesses will have access to more interesting information than others for the above ideas. If you can&#8217;t quite come up with something compelling, consider recapping some top stories or interesting stats of the year in your industry and for each one, share\u00a0a brief reflection, action you took, or relevant tip.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p>\ud83d\udceb<strong> Free email templates!<\/strong>\u00a0 <strong>&gt;&gt; <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteEmailExampleTemplate.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Email_EmailTemplates_Download\">30 Free Small Business Email Examples &amp; Templates<\/a><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h2>Year-in-review email tips<\/h2>\n<p>In addition to regular <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/01\/email-marketing-tips\">email marketing best practices<\/a>, follow these tips to make your year-end email the best it can be:<\/p>\n<h3><span><span><span>1. Keep it separate from your holiday greeting or promotional emails<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>A year-in-review email should be different from your<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/29\/holiday-customer-appreciation-letter\"> customer holiday greeting email<\/a> and promotional emails. Your greeting email should be 100% customer-centric, focused on appreciation and gratitude. Your promotional emails will of course be conversion-focused. Your YIR email falls in the middle of those two, showing appreciation but in a way that encourages the reader to continue using your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>2. Use numbers<\/h3>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>You&#8217;ll notice in just about all of these examples there are numbers. The people love the numbers and the tangibles.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>3. Visualize it&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p><span><span><span>Don&#8217;t just give your readers a bunch of text. Create a timeline or a journey path, include pictures or graphics, or even create a video.&#8217;<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>4. &#8230;but keep it mobile-friendly<\/h3>\n<p>This is a great visual by Big Cartel, and even though it appears as though it has\u00a0a link to a page with the graphic and perhaps more details, the image in the email requires zooming and shifting, not a natural scroll.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/year-in-review-email-example-cartel.png\" alt=\"year-in-review-email-example-cartel\" width=\"500\" height=\"790\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52521 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/year-in-review-email-example-cartel.png 500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/year-in-review-email-example-cartel-480x758.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wholewhale.com\/tips\/year-review-recap\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>5. Make it customer-centric<\/h3>\n<p><span><span><span>Always make it about them! This is easy if you have customer data or achievements to share, but not necessary. The example above reads:<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>2015 was a huge year for Big Cartel &#8211;\u00a0 not only for our team, but for the army of talented artists who build their businesses with us. Thank you for making our favorite moments from this year possible, and for being a part of this incredible community.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The example by Wix below does this as well, saying, &#8220;Before we jump into 2018, let&#8217;s look back at the most memorable moments of last year and see what we achieved together.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/year-in-review-email-examples-wix.png\" alt=\"year-in-review-email-examples-wix\" width=\"500\" height=\"652\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52522 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/year-in-review-email-examples-wix.png 500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/year-in-review-email-examples-wix-480x626.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span><span><span><a href=\"https:\/\/chamaileon.io\/resources\/7-surprising-practical-new-year-email-ideas-email-subject-lines\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span>Image source<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span><span><span>So frame your accomplishments as achieved because of your customers\u2014through their support, their use of your product, their reviews, feedback, votes, social shares, and more.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>5. Thank your readers<\/h3>\n<p>Do NOT forget this part. The Wix email above nails the &#8220;togetherness&#8221; but fails to thank its customers. I&#8217;m sure the post it links to includes this, but it&#8217;s still important to include it in the email itself.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Thank you for choosing Texture for all your reading needs!<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><span><span><span>It\u2019s all possible because of our incredible community of customers and contributors! THANK YOU!<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><span><span><span>Great work this year and thank you for being such an integral part of our growth in 2021.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>6. Don&#8217;t create a landing page disguised as a thank you<\/h3>\n<p>Remember, frame this email as a celebration of\u00a0growth, achieved with or made possible by your customers.\u00a0The\u00a0email below has an attractive, clean, and readable design, but although it reads &#8220;A year in review,&#8221; and\u00a0&#8220;Thanks for being a part of our creative community,&#8221; the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/25\/email-copywriting-tips\">email copy<\/a> does not support that.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, it closes with &#8220;Haven&#8217;t taken a class yet? Start today and join our growing number of students!&#8221; with a CTA to enroll.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/year-in-review-email-example-bc_classes.png\" alt=\"year-in-review-email-example-bc_classes\" width=\"720\" height=\"447\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52524 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/year-in-review-email-example-bc_classes.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/year-in-review-email-example-bc_classes-480x298.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Great design, not a year-in-review.
