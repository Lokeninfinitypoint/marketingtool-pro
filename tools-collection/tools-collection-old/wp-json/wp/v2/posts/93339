I\u2019ve heard from many advertisers that they\u2019re worried that Google is messing with Search campaigns, but I think those worries are a bit premature.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, I want to talk about what AI Max for Search is (and some of what it isn\u2019t) and talk about when it might make sense to test in your account.<\/p>\n<h3>Contents<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#what-is-ai-max-for-search\">What is AI Max for Search?<\/a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#ai-max-for-search-new-features\">New features<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ai-max-for-search-existing-features\">Not-so-new features<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ai-max-for-search-note\">A note about AI Max options<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#requirements-for-ai-max\">Requirements for AI Max<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#when-not-to-use-ai-max\">When not to use AI Max<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#when-to-try-ai-max-for-search\">When to try AI Max for Search<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#how-to-get-started-with-ai-max\">How to get started with AI Max<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"what-is-ai-max-for-search\"><\/div>\n<h2>What is AI Max for Search?<\/h2>\n<p>First, let\u2019s get something out of the way: AI Max is NOT a replacement for Search campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>So, let\u2019s talk about what AI Max <em>is<\/em> and how it will work.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-marketing-live-2025#:~:text=3.-,AI%20Max%20for%20Search%20campaigns,-AI%20Max%20for\">AI Max<\/a> is a new set of optional features you can enable with your Search campaigns in Google Ads to help with targeting and creative assets.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/ai-max-for-search-campaigns.webp\" alt=\"ai max for search campaigns\" width=\"755\" height=\"565\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-93380\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/ai-max-for-search-campaigns.webp 755w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/ai-max-for-search-campaigns-480x359.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 755px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"ai-max-for-search-new-features\"><\/div>\n<h3>New features for AI Max<\/h3>\n<p>Here\u2019s a quick rundown of the new features available within AI Max:<\/p>\n<h4>Search term matching<\/h4>\n<p>This is a new form of keywordless targeting that combines a few different features. It uses Broad match (i.e., the Broad match campaign setting) plus keywordless matching that uses signals from keywords, assets, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/great-landing-pages\">landing pages<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>From what I can tell, when it comes to keyword prioritization, AI Max will fall in line with the existing hierarchy in one of two ways.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/ai-max-search-term-matching.webp\" alt=\"ai max search term matching\" width=\"684\" height=\"687\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-93381\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/ai-max-search-term-matching.webp 684w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/ai-max-search-term-matching-480x482.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 684px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If your ad is triggered for a search term based on the Broad match setting, that will fall into the level of the list alongside Phrase match and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/11\/search-themes-for-performance-max-campaigns\">Search themes<\/a> for PMax. If your ad is triggered with the keywordless matching option, i.e., the search term was determined by your keywords, assets, or landing pages, then it will fall into the last row where only Ad Rank serves to determine prioritization.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/ai-max-for-search-campaigns-example-e1753987829552.webp\" alt=\"ai max for search keywordless targeting\" width=\"884\" height=\"507\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93386 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/ai-max-for-search-campaigns-example-e1753987829552.webp 884w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/ai-max-for-search-campaigns-example-e1753987829552-480x270.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 884px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 <strong>Worried you&#8217;re wasting spend in Google Ads?<\/strong> Find out with a free, instant audit &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Updates to reporting<\/h4>\n<p>Since AI Max gets to choose search queries, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/2025-google-ads-keywords\">keywords<\/a>, landing pages, and assets for you, each of those reports will now have a portion that shows when AI Max selected them. Within search terms, you will also be able to see if the query was selected based on Broad match expansion or keywordless matching.<\/p>\n<div id=\"ai-max-for-search-existing-features\"><\/div>\n<h3>Not-so-new features in AI Max<\/h3>\n<p>There are some features in the AI Max for Search announcements that are effectively just carryovers from what\u2019s usable in regular Search or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/10\/dynamic-search-ads\">Dynamic Search Ads<\/a> (DSA) campaigns currently.<\/p>\n<h4>Brand settings<\/h4>\n<p>With AI Max for Search, you\u2019ll still be able to utilize Brand Inclusion and Exclusion lists just as you do with regular Search campaigns.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/ai-max-brand-settings.webp\" alt=\"ai max for search brand settings\" width=\"782\" height=\"422\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-93382\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/ai-max-brand-settings.webp 782w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/ai-max-brand-settings-480x259.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 782px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>URL rules<\/h4>\n<p>Just like with Dynamic Search Ads campaigns, you\u2019ll be able to control which URLs your ads are eligible to use with inclusions and exclusions.

This requires Text Customization to be turned on.<\/p>\n<h4>Locations of interest<\/h4>\n<p>These controls will be able to be adjusted at the ad group level to include people based on either their location, Presence or their Presence or Interest in a given location. The key difference here is the control at the ad group level rather than the campaign level as with existing Search campaigns.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/ai-max-locations-or-interest.png\" alt=\"ai max for search locations or interest\" width=\"602\" height=\"93\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-93390\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/ai-max-locations-or-interest.png 602w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/ai-max-locations-or-interest-480x74.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 602px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Many other features, like negative keywords and location exclusions, will still apply to your AI Max campaigns just like they do for regular Search.<\/p>\n<div id=\"ai-max-for-search-note\"><\/div>\n<h3>A note about AI Max options<\/h3>\n<p>One thing I want to stress about AI Max in its current form is its optionality. There are LOTS of features within this new set that you can pick and choose \u00e0 la carte to apply or not apply as you wish. Each of the options listed below are features that can be opted into or out of based on your preferences:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keywordless Targeting<\/li>\n<li>Text Customization<\/li>\n<li>Final URL Expansion (must have Text Customization enabled to use this)<\/li>\n<li>Location of Interest<\/li>\n<li>AI Max: You can toggle this on or off at your discretion<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Key takeaway:<\/strong> You still have lots of control, even when ceding some control to Google.<\/p>\n<div id=\"requirements-for-ai-max\"><\/div>\n<h2>Requirements for AI Max<\/h2>\n<p>There are just a couple of requirements for you to use AI Max.<\/p>\n<p>First, your campaign type must (obviously) be a Search campaign. If you want to use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/04\/google-ads-ai\">Google\u2019s AI features<\/a> with other campaign types, there are plenty of others to choose from.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/google-ads-campaign-type-search.webp\" alt=\"google ads campaign types with search selected\" width=\"830\" height=\"397\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-93384\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/google-ads-campaign-type-search.webp 830w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/google-ads-campaign-type-search-480x230.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 830px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Second, you must be using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-smart-bidding\">Smart Bidding strategies<\/a> focused on conversions. This means Max Conversions or Max Conversion Value are eligible, as well as their augmented styles of tCPA and tROAS, respectively. No other bid strategies are supported at this time.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/google-ads-bidding-strategies-conversion-focused.webp\" alt=\"google ads smart conversion focused bidding strategies\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-93379\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/google-ads-bidding-strategies-conversion-focused.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/google-ads-bidding-strategies-conversion-focused-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udea8 <strong>What results can you expect from Google Ads?<\/strong> Download our latest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/google-ads-industry-benchmarks?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2025GoogleAdsBenchmarks_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\">Google Ads Benchmarks<\/a> to find out!<\/p>\n<div id=\"when-not-to-use-ai-max\"><\/div>\n<h2>When not to use AI Max<\/h2>\n<p>While some of these features are really just a different packaging for options that are already available in Google Ads, there are some scenarios where I wouldn\u2019t recommend using AI Max for Search.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Poor website:<\/strong> Just like with DSA campaigns, if your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/no-website-traffic\">website isn\u2019t a strong representation of your company<\/a>, AI Max for Search might not be a great idea if you leave the Text Customization and Final URL expansion on.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Regulation-heavy industry:<\/strong> Just like with other automated features in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-run-google-ads\">Google Ads<\/a>, if you need to have strict messaging in ads based on regulatory compliance, AI Max might not be a great option.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Low conversion volume:<\/strong> Although Google touts its Smart Bidding as being able to generate results without much history, I\u2019ve personally never found success with that. I\u2019d always suggest following the 30\/30 rule, meaning at least 30 conversions in the last 30 days, with 50 conversions in the last 30 days being an even better threshold to meet.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Lead quality considerations:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/lead-generation-ideas\">Lead generation<\/a> is always a tough route with Google Ads automation. The platform is really good at getting leads, but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/lead-quality\">generating quality leads<\/a> can be a challenge. If you have high thresholds to hit for quality, AI Max could still be an okay option, but will likely need to take a backseat to classic Search. Speaking of\u2026<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"when-to-try-ai-max-for-search\"><\/div>\n<h2>When to try AI Max for Search<\/h2>\n<p>For now, I\u2019m thinking of AI Max for Search as a combination of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/performance-max\">Performance Max<\/a> and Dynamic Search Ads. The biggest common factor in those campaigns: they\u2019re here to drive incremental volume outside of my reach with my existing Search campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>What does all this mean for me? I\u2019m still going to build out a robust, old-school Search strategy that leverages Exact match terms just like I have for the last 15 years and manage it as usual. Given the prioritization schedule above, Exact match still outranks everything else, and since that\u2019s where I\u2019ll have the most control, that\u2019s where I\u2019m going to start.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond that, I\u2019ll leverage AI Max as an expansion tool, just like I would for DSA. If anything, AI Max, in my mind, just translates to a slightly more AI-centered Dynamic Search Ads strategy. It functions relatively the same, but just has a few more bells and whistles.<\/p>\n<p>TL;DR: If you\u2019re a fan of classic Search paired with Dynamic Search Ads for extra reach, then AI Max for Search might be your new favorite tool.<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-get-started-with-ai-max\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to get started with AI Max for Search<\/h2>\n<p>AI Max for Search started its rollout as of early 2025 but is going to take until Q3 of 2025 to be fully available to all accounts. If you want to test this campaign type, you\u2019ll have to wait for it to hit your account.<\/p>\n<p>Once the feature is available for you, there will be an option to use Google Ads Campaign Experiments to test AI Max for Search before jumping in full force. It\u2019s not clear at this time exactly what the logistics of that setup will be, but there will be some functionality around it.<\/p>\n<h2>Is AI Max for Search right for you right now?<\/h2>\n<p>Google is continuing to roll out new features powered by AI to help advertisers find their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/target-audience-examples\">target audience<\/a>. If you\u2019re a classic marketer like me, this might be a nice addition to what you already have running. If you\u2019re new to marketing and Search in general, this might be an easy option for you to get things started and see results.<\/p>\n<p>Just like all other new features, I don\u2019t think AI Max is for everyone, and it certainly can be a slippery slope for advertisers who aren\u2019t sure what they\u2019re doing, but it also could be a great option for folks who have maxed out traditional search and need to see incremental results.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>AI Max for Search is rolling out to accounts now.
