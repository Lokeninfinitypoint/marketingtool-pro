Maybe it\u2019s just me, but I have no problem abandoning a shopping cart if something goes even the slightest bit astray. The other day I was contemplating purchasing a dress from Free People, but my shoulders tensed up at the thought of it not fitting properly. Who wants to pay for shipping just to have to repackage and return the darn thing? The convenience of online shopping can quickly turn into an inconvenient, time-wasting, and frustrating experience, which is probably why most of us have no problem abandoning potential purchases.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"536dd28a-35d1-4724-af44-536def931422\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/product-pages.png\" alt=\"product pages funny meme\" width=\"420\" height=\"294\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Yes, e-commerce can be a joyfully profitable industry to be in. Sales cycles are instant, unlike <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/23\/ppc-for-b2b-software-companies\">B2B industries<\/a> where marketers have to nurture leads down a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/26\/sales-cycle\">long sales funnel<\/a>. On the other hand, shoppers have no problem turning to another brand if their products are positioned in a more convenient, glamorous, or financially friendly manner. Why should I order a vacuum cleaner from you if your competitor offers essentially the same product, but with free shipping and a 30-day money back guarantee?<\/p>\n<p>Moral of the story, product pages can make or break an <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/09\/09\/e-commerce-content-marketing\">e-commerce transaction<\/a>. If the shopper has the slightest doubt in their mind, you\u2019ve lost them.<\/p>\n<p>I recently chatted with HubSpot\u2019s e-commerce marketing consultant and Sales Engineer, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/stevehaase\">Steve Haase<\/a>, who\u2019s consulted with hundreds of e-commerce businesses for the past 3+ years, and has an impressive and diverse background from founding his own <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/12\/startup-marketing\">startup software company<\/a>, being a full-time musician, to serving in the military. Haase enlightened me to some best practices that can really make or break an e-commerce product page and help you <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/03\/increase-sales-online\">increase online sales<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>#1: Put Your Shopper at Ease<\/h2>\n<p>Your product page needs to address any potential concerns or hesitations your potential buyer might have. Will these pants fit? How long is the battery life? Can I return this product? Are sizes accurate? These questions all need to be answered. \u201cFor example, if your product has to do with clothing, how can you put people at ease that it\u2019s going to fit?\u201d says Haase. \u201cIs there a sizing chart or guide? The thing that will make people shop elsewhere is uncertainty.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"100331ee-0712-4922-9170-f987b4627b42\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/product-pages-quote.png\" alt=\"product pages picture of Steve Haase with the quote above.\" width=\"657\" height=\"297\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Brainstorm ways you can put your shopper at ease, by providing <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/08\/persuasive-landing-pages\">clear copy<\/a>, visual guides, and instructions if a product needs assembly. Haase explains the thought process the typical online shopper has: \u201cI need a Large, but do Larges run big? I don\u2019t want a muscle T, but I don\u2019t want it too baggy. Ahh, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ll just go somewhere else.\u201d We\u2019ve all had this internal dialogue when shopping online.<\/p>\n<p>Take a look at the example below from the children\u2019s clothing site, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.toobydoo.com\/shop\/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=2_131&amp;products_id=1313\">Tooby Doo<\/a>. It allows the shopper to select the \u201csize chart\u201d button, which then provides a pop-up sizing guide for those in doubt. The pop-up is nice since is doesn\u2019t direct to a new page, but provides a compact and easy-to-read and understand sizing chart to put the shopper at ease.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"da42c90d-6f89-451d-bcb9-f2d8484d52cc\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/product-pages-example.png\" alt=\"Product page example with a size chart\" width=\"1186\" height=\"617\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>#2: Customer Reviews are ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL<\/h2>\n<p><strong>88% of consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations<\/strong>, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/2014\/07\/01\/local-consumer-review-survey-2014\/\">BrightLocal<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s right, we trust complete strangers as much as we trust our mothers.<\/p>\n<p>Also, <strong>70% of people consult reviews and ratings before purchasing<\/strong>, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.searchenginepeople.com\/blog\/12-statistics-on-consumer-reviews.html\">BusinessWeek<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Alright, we all know <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/05\/customer-testimonials\">customer reviews<\/a> are necessary so why don\u2019t you have them on your product pages? Or perhaps you do, but are they impactful? This tip ties in nicely with the one above because it\u2019s all about putting the consumer at ease. When it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/26\/product-photography\">e-commerce product pages<\/a>, having reviews on each page should be a no-brainer.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.renttherunway.com\/\">Rent The Runway<\/a> kills it when it comes to reviews. Almost all of their dresses have 30+ reviews, with pictures that include a granular level of detail from the shopper\u2019s height, weight, size worn, usual size, overall fit, affair, body type, etc., to ensure the rental is the perfect fit for the occasion before reserving. I\u2019m a loyal customer (yes, I even have a PRO account), largely due to this reason.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"129439e0-0191-4018-af8a-ef97dab24b3a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/product-pages-example-two.png\" alt=\"Product page example of a review from Renttherunway\" width=\"582\" height=\"426\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>What if you\u2019re having trouble getting your customers to review your products?

It&#8217;s not enough simply to include your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/21\/e-commerce-keyword-research\">e-commerce keywords<\/a> on the page. Perhaps, the company is more concerned with imagery then <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/04\/content-strategy-for-the-web\">creative copy<\/a>. Yes, gripping visual content like images and videos are crucial product page elements, but if the copy is crap, this can be a huge detriment to building excitement about a product. \u201cHow are you actually convincing someone to buy the thing?\u201d says Haase. \u201cIf your copy is crap then your page is crap. Not providing insight into why they should be excited, and why they should believe in you, is a huge mistake.\u201d Take a look at this copy for instance:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3684e20a-a01b-4553-9099-7076e694c2e2\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/product-pages-description.png\" alt=\"Product pages bad copywriting example\" width=\"317\" height=\"299\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Slubs? Silhouette? Whipstiching? What does \u201cwhipstitching\u201d even mean? Avoid the over-complicated language, and make your copy more fun and relatable. E-commerce is an industry where it\u2019s easy to be creative, and not take yourself too seriously.<\/p>\n<p>The e-commerce clothing store <a href=\"http:\/\/shop.soworthloving.com\/collections\/view-all\/products\/go-with-the-flow\">So Worth Loving<\/a> provides some creative and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/06\/26\/product-descriptions\">compelling copy<\/a> on every product page. Check out the one below:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"67731efa-f2e5-408f-8c7d-6903d8a8445d\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/product-pages-copy.png\" alt=\"Product pages good copywriting example\" width=\"546\" height=\"364\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<strong>WARNING: this tee is so comfortable you may never want to take it off<\/strong>.\u201d You had me at comfortable, SOLD!<\/p>\n<h2>#4: Create a Strong Sense of Urgency<\/h2>\n<p>The fastest way to get e-commerce conversions? SCARE TACTICS. You want to make every visitor nervous that if they don\u2019t buy now they might miss out! I know, it sounds manipulative, and perhaps it is, but it works. \u201cYou just <a href=\"\/google-adwords\">paid for the click<\/a> so you need to convince them they don\u2019t need to look anywhere else,\u201d says Haase. \u201cInvestigate the elements of urgency and scarcity that you have on your checkout page. Are you running a special sale for a limited amount of time? What about availability?\u201d Haase recommends implementing an inventory management system if you don\u2019t have one already. This will allow you to provide inventory on the page so you can show when stock is low in turn giving the shopper more incentive to buy before it runs out.<\/p>\n<p>Check out the example below from the e-commerce furniture store <a href=\"https:\/\/www.onekingslane.com\/\">One Kings Lane<\/a>, where their product page for a silver wall mirror emphasizes several urgency factors such as the 41% discount, the inventory 2 days left bookmark, and the small clock icon informing the shopper that the sale is about to end. Seriously, this is well done!<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"61e110a3-3a61-4468-bbd5-f247fc11233d\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/product-pages-mirror.png\" alt=\"Product pages example of urgency\" width=\"1169\" height=\"556\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>#5: Provide All Necessary Context<\/h2>\n<p>Find creative ways to provide as much information as possible to properly inform the shopper without overwhelming them with unorganized copy. \u201cAny kind of instructional information needs to be included,\u201d says Haase. \u201cWhat\u2019s the care? Is it dry clean only? I hate that, but you didn\u2019t tell me so I\u2019m going to go somewhere else.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you\u2019re selling a do-it-yourself (DIY) product there needs to be some sort of kit on assembly instructions. Perhaps an engaging time-lapse video. \u201cProvide reinforcement for any of the objections that the person might have as they reach that page,\u201d says Haase. One King\u2019s Lane also does a great job at providing context. Just take a look at the example below. Each one of their product pages allows you to compare the piece of furniture to real-life objects, from anything from a French bulldog, to a wine bottle, to a standard door. This helps shoppers get a true idea of the size and dimensions of the furniture without leading them to doubt that buying online is the right choice.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"425285b3-218a-4a54-8dc7-8dcba4632fa1\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/product-pages-couch.png\" alt=\"Product pages example of context\" width=\"964\" height=\"670\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>#6: Experiment with Exit Intent Popovers<\/h2>\n<p>What are exit intent popovers? They\u2019re those popups that appear before you leave a site, saying something like, \u201cAre you leaving us already?\u201d If you\u2019re rolling your eyes and thinking \u2018those are annoying,\u2019 yes, I actually agree, but we use them at WordStream because we\u2019ve found that <a href=\"http:\/\/unbounce.com\/landing-pages\/exit-overlays-make-your-landing-page-offer-more-persuasive\/\">they actually work<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"13bb99be-3301-433f-939a-7848b0f8a23a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/product-pages-popover.png\" alt=\"Product pages popover example\" width=\"971\" height=\"620\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>\u201cThe worst investment of your dollar (from a paid click) is a 10 second brand impression,\u201d says Haase. \u201cIf they\u2019re not going to get the sale at least get the email. If they\u2019re not ready to buy you can provide a pre-transactional offer, for example \u2018Oh, I see you\u2019re interested in weaving, get our free e-book to learn some new tactics.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>#7: Leverage Social Sharing<\/h2>\n<p>Every product page should leverage the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/19\/social-media-marketing-plan\">power of social media<\/a>. Yes, your website should be promoting your brand\u2019s social channels, but on product pages there should be social buttons allowing the shopper to share the product on platforms like <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/09\/why-did-my-facebook-likes-go-down\">Twitter and Facebook<\/a>. For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re shopping around for a new pair of boots during the holiday season, but you realize that the pair you want isn\u2019t in your price range. An easy fix, tweet the product to a loved one with a subtle hint \u2013 \u201c@mom, add this to the Christmas list J.\u201d This makes it so that even if your shopper doesn\u2019t go through with the transaction, there\u2019s a chance they\u2019ll promote it to their followers and perhaps convince others to buy from you.<\/p>\n<p>Haase recommends using <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/06\/instagram-marketing\">product hashtags<\/a> to get people chatting about your products. \u201cSocial media helps put your products out there, and can drastically expand your reach,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>Check out the example from Bed, Bath, and Beyond below.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f3b15e23-07a0-4db2-84ac-dde35ac2e309\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/product-pages-pinterest.png\" alt=\"Product pages example of social sharing\" width=\"860\" height=\"558\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>#8: Ensure Your Product Pages are Mobile-Friendly<\/h2>\n<p>Yup! We get it. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/16\/mobile-ppc-strategy\">Mobile is important<\/a>, we\u2019ve all been hearing this for years now, but have you ever actually taken the time to search for your product pages on your iPhone? You might be unpleasantly surprised by the shopping experience. Well, mobile isn\u2019t going aware. According to Google, there was a 175% growth in shopping searches on mobile in the first five months of the year. So people are searching for products on their phones, clicking on your ads or organic listing and being delivered to your site while on the way to work or while watching TV at night. This isn\u2019t that surprising, right? You likely do this more then you even realize.<\/p>\n<p>Need I say more? Mobile is big. We all know this. So stop living in denial and get your mobile act together already!<\/p>\n<h2>#9: Turn One-Time Shoppers into Loyal Customers<\/h2>\n<p>Lastly, conversions only go so far in e-commerce. Lots of products are affordable so in order to gain ROI from your marketing efforts there needs to be a large sum of transactions which occur on a regular basis. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/02\/ecommerce-seo\">All e-commerce marketers<\/a> should be thinking of ways to make their customers come back time and time again.<\/p>\n<p>Haase told me about one his largest e-commerce clients, \u201cThe number one thing they spend their time on is tactics to make people come back. This is their job,\u201d says Haase. \u201cHow can I get someone to buy more stuff? You need to answer that question, which comes down to your own creativity and strength of your business.\u201d Haase recommends trying to build a relationship with each and every customer to through new, interesting, and fun experiences.<\/p>\n<p>One company that Haase recommends learning from is BetaBrand: \u201cThey\u2019re always coming up with new campaigns. They also know their persona and know what they\u2019re looking for. Unless that\u2019s happening, none of your marketing is going to do anything.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Even just visiting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.betabrand.com\/referrals\/landing\/about\/\">BetaBrand\u2019s<\/a> site for the first time it\u2019s clear that they do a lot of marketing to not only engage with their current customers, but also gain new customers through creative tactics. See the example below where they\u2019re giving customers a $25 credit for each friend they refer, as well as the new customer $25 off on their first purchase.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"aa3ab56f-247a-4eea-8bbc-c8a0218eca55\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/product-pages-beta.png\" alt=\"Product pages example of discount\" width=\"644\" height=\"772\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Going along with this point, Haase also recommends implementing a <a href=\"\/articles\/top-internet-marketing-software\">marketing automation software<\/a> to re-engage with past shoppers. \u201cIf you\u2019re selling pet food, how long does it take to go through the container? Send an email a week before, follow up the week after.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So there you have it. Implement these strategies to drastically grow your e-commerce transactions through better product pages. \u201cDo the standard things, but in terms of what\u2019s the next thing, ask what will help people? What is it that people are worried about? What do they like to do?\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Struggling to get online conversions?
