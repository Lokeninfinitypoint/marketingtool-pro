At least between two products or product versions. Perhaps you are launching a new product line and you want to see what is more appealing to a group of people. Perhaps you\u2019re considering a redesign of your core offering. This may even give you early insight into what you may see sell better overall at your business.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a great example from Farm Rich that we saw pop up around this year\u2019s Super Bowl. Perfectly timed to run that weekend so that people can see this, engage with it, and perhaps when they go to the store to pick up snacks, these may be top of mind and they\u2019ll make a purchase.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c8c56623-cd33-4189-9eae-3b3d91f8f9f5\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram20story20ad20polls20enews.png\" alt=\"instagram story ad polls enews\" width=\"200\" height=\"434\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Want to know which of two things is more popular in an effort to use that information in your product development or other marketing initiatives?

Then, retarget this group of people that have not yet made a purchase for the pair of shoes using a different ad type and campaign objective to drive them to make that purchase.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, you can take this information and use it in your other marketing and advertising efforts. Let\u2019s take the aforementioned shoe client example and use the winning shoe style in more of our organic social media posts and in our email newsletter blasts about new spring styles.<\/p>\n<h2>Put your Instagram Story ads poll stickers into practice<\/h2>\n<p>While they may seem simple on the surface, Instagram Story ads polling stickers can be a powerful, interactive feature that can engage your audience in a new way\u2014all while helping you understand your audience\u2019s interests, pain points, and preferences when it comes to your products or services. If you haven\u2019t yet, test out polling stickers and use the information you gain from their results in reframing your marketing and advertising campaigns.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Instagram Story polls equip you with valuable audience intel that you can use to drive more engagement.
