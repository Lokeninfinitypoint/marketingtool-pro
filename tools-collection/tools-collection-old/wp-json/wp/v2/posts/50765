Try these three tips, which can ultimately <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/11\/10\/search-advertising-benchmarks\">lower your cost per lead<\/a>:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Choose your keywords wisely, and don\u2019t just jump for the cheapest one!<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/11\/21\/ppc-keyword-research-guide\">Keyword research<\/a> is a given when it comes to Google Search, but we\u2019re not just talking about ruling out the priciest on average keywords. In fact, don\u2019t jump to ignore any one keyword based on price, but choose based on volume and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/12\/10\/three-types-of-search-queries\"> the types of search queries you want to attract<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/03\/most-valuable-keywords-high-ctr\"> your best converting keyword<\/a> is also your most expensive, you don\u2019t want to miss out on all those conversions in the name of frugality. But you may want to downsize your keyword list to save on spend elsewhere while you bid on that one <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/high-converting-keywords#:~:text=As%20the%20name%20suggests%2C%20high,in%20their%20products%20or%20services.\">high-converting keyword<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Or, a pricier keyword may have a higher average search volume which could equate to bringing in more clicks to your website\u2014increasing your expected CTR. This <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/19\/does-quality-score-still-matter\">improves your Quality Score<\/a> which will allow you to pull in more clicks for less in the long run.<\/p>\n<p>In short, you can still choose your keywords based on cost. But be sure to also consider the <strong>volume<\/strong> and <strong>intent<\/strong> behind those keywords. Having a healthy mix of low-cost keywords and high-reward keywords will ensure that you get the lowest CPC possible without sacrificing conversion quality or quantity.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/lower-cost-per-click-google-ads-keyword-planner.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"344\" alt=\"google ads keyword planner\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<h4><\/h4>\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Want more recommendations to save money in Google Ads?

Improve your ads and landing pages to raise your Quality Score<\/h3>\n<p>Remember, bids are only half the battle when it comes time for you to pay for a click in an auction. For example, an advertiser with a low bid but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2010\/06\/14\/quality-score-faq\">a high Quality Score<\/a> could still win the auction and be more likely to pull in a click for cheaper (this is a case where <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/19\/does-quality-score-still-matter\">Quality Score matters<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Google is willing to make that trade-off because it wants to make as much money as possible off of paid Search ads without sacrificing the searcher\u2019s experience. Google will accept a bid that results in a cheaper click if it means the ad will be of more use to the viewer (in other words, a higher Quality Score).<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/lower-cost-per-click-google-ads-auction-explanation.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"365\" alt=\"explanation of google ads auction\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Aside from expected CTR, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/10\/01\/quality-score-case-study\">your keyword Quality Score<\/a> also factors in ad relevancy and landing page experience. For your ads, try to carve out time to regularly refresh them and include any <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/18\/adwords-keywords\">newly added keywords<\/a>. You could also take a look at Google\u2019s suggestions right from within the ads editor section of the platform to see where your current ad strength is at and where you could improve.<\/p>\n<p>As for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/12\/great-landing-pages\">your landing pages<\/a>, ensure your core keywords are on the page just like you would with your ad copy, and follow these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/15\/landing-page-best-practices\">landing page best practices<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Try out the Search Partner Network<\/h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/2616017?hl=en\">Google Search Partner Network<\/a> allows your ads to show on any additional sites with an online search feature that are owned under the Google family. Historically, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/04\/adwords-search-partners\">clicks from Search Partners<\/a> can trend cheaper since they can be less competitive. You can opt your campaign into these and measure the results compared to Google\u2019s SERP whenever you please\u2014making it a great way to test for cheaper clicks.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/lower-cost-per-click-google-include-search-partner-network.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"203\" alt=\"google ads campaign setup with option to include google search partners\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>How to lower Google Display ads cost per click<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/20\/google-adwords-search-versus-display\">Google Display ads behave differently than Google Search ads<\/a>, making cost estimates even more confusing. To help, here\u2019s our most recent data for Google Display:<\/p>\n<h3>What is the average CPC for Google Display ads in 2021?<\/h3>\n<p>Over the past four years, the average CPC for Google Display ads has been decreasing. Based on our historical data, it has dropped from $0.66 to $0.41. If you remove the Occasions and Gifts outlier, you see an even lower CPC of $0.34.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/lower-cost-per-click-average-cpc-google-display-ads.png\" width=\"450\" height=\"318\" alt=\"how to lower cost per click\u2014average cpc for google display ads\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Historical Display CPCs<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/05\/online-advertising-costs\">2017<\/a>: $0.67<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/29\/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks\">2018<\/a> $.63 (ranging from $1.16-$6.75)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLPaidFacebookConsiderationPPCGoogleAdsBenchmarks.html\">2019<\/a>: $0.59\u00a0 (ranging from $0.60-$.81)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/06\/google-ads-benchmarks-during-covid-19\">April 2020<\/a>: $0.41(ranging from $0.28-$1.01)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Lowering CPCs for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/23\/google-display-ads\">Google Display ads<\/a> is not a common goal since they&#8217;re oftentimes pennies per click. Even still, you should still look at your advertising efforts holistically so you can see where you can save to make up for areas worth the extra spend.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few ideas to lower your Display CPCs even further so that you can save that spend for potentially pricier, higher-value keywords back on Search.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Leverage exclusions<\/h3>\n<p>Since Display ads are eligible to show on every corner of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/18\/google-display-network-tips\">the Display Network<\/a> by default, it\u2019s important to use exclusions to save you from spending on pricier clicks that are irrelevant. There are the normal exclusions available to all campaign types that you can also apply to Display, like locations.<\/p>\n<p>On top of those must-have basics, like locations, here are a few Display-specific exclusions you\u2019ll also want to check on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Topics:<\/strong> Are there any types of pages that would contain content relating to topics that wouldn\u2019t fit for your Display ad?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Audiences:<\/strong> Are there any additional audiences that you don\u2019t want to show to? For example, your converters or your remarketing audiences.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Placements:<\/strong> Do you want to show on all types of websites or apps? For example, mobile app games could result in accidental clicks should you feel that placement isn\u2019t the best fit for your business. Excluding mobile app and games placements is a popular strategy for lowering cost per click.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/lower-cost-per-click-google-ads-exclusions.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"269\" alt=\"google ads campaign setup with topic exclusions\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You can easily update and manage Display exclusions with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/14\/google-ads-dynamic-exclusion-lists\">Google\u2019s\u00a0Dynamic Exclusion Lists.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>5. Reevaluate your bidding<\/h3>\n<p>How much you\u2019re willing to pay per click correlates with how much the platform is willing to take. While competition and other factors help you determine how much to bid on your Display ad groups (manual bidding is set only at the ad group level on Display), you may also want to try lowering your Max CPC bid to only pull in clicks that align with your budget.<\/p>\n<p>However, if you\u2019re on an<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/19\/google-ads-automated-bidding\"> automated bidding strategy<\/a>, you can\u2019t always make that specific call (unless you adjust the strategy\u2019s goal, max, or target). Your best bet is to A\/B test any bidding strategies you think work best for you.<\/p>\n<h3>6. A\/B test your audience targeting<\/h3>\n<p>Along with testing out different ways you can bid to get the lowest bid possible, you can also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/10\/google-display-network-targeting\">apply multiple audiences to your Display campaign<\/a> and compare which ones pull in the lowest CPCs. Now, you can approach this similarly to how you would pick\u00a0keywords for a search campaign.<\/p>\n<p>The audience with the highest reward may not have the lowest CPC. However, you don\u2019t want all of your eggs in one basket. It\u2019s best to try multiple audiences to see which one brings in the best bang for your buck, or to have a healthy balance of <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/target-audience\/\">a high-reward audience<\/a> working for you alongside a low-cost audience.<\/p>\n<h2>How to lower Google Shopping ads cost per click<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/04\/google-shopping-campaigns-tips-tricks\">Google Shopping campaigns<\/a> can be tricky to get a handle on since it has a different infrastructure than what you might be used to on Search or Display.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the average CPC for Google Shopping ads in 2021?<\/h3>\n<p>Based on our most recent data, the average CPC for Google Shopping ads is $0.58, ranging from $0.17 &#8211; $1.55.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/lower-cost-per-click-average-cpc-google-shopping.png\" width=\"450\" height=\"294\" alt=\"how to lower cost per click\u2014average cpc for google shopping ads\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Historical Google Shopping CPCs<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/01\/shopping-ads-benchmarks\">2019<\/a> $0.66 (ranging from $0.34-$1.09)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/06\/google-ads-benchmarks-during-covid-19\">April 2020<\/a>: $0.66 (ranging from $0.29-$1.07)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/02\/new-data-google-ads-benchmarks-during-covid-19\">June 2020<\/a>: $0.58 (ranging from $0.17-$1.55)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Lowering your Google Shopping CPC is similar to anything in <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/local-marketing-lab\/ppc\/\">PPC<\/a>\u2014it\u2019s going to take time and patience! Here are a few ways you can get a head start now to see lower CPC results in the long run:<\/p>\n<h3>7. Build negative keyword lists that include a few competitors<\/h3>\n<p>Since you can\u2019t pick out your keywords on Google Shopping campaigns, at the core of any strong Shopping campaign is\u00a0 a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/06\/negative-keyword-guide\">healthy negative keyword list<\/a>. But how can you optimize that list for CPC?<\/p>\n<p>We know<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/why-is-it-important-companies-have-competitors\/\"> heavier competition on the SERP<\/a> can jack up CPC prices. It may be a good idea to negate big brand competitor names that you don\u2019t feel fit well with your SMB products on the SERP. This way, you\u2019re on a level playing field and not paying for pricier clicks because you\u2019re showing next to big brand products.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Try the \u201cpriority\u201d structure for bidding<\/h3>\n<p>When you prioritize <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/12\/google-shopping-campaign-structure\">your shopping campaign structure<\/a> by what type of traffic the subdivided products will attract, you\u2019ll be able to split out your bidding to save on your overall CPC.<\/p>\n<p>For example, the competition for more generic searches is higher, plus that audience is more top-of-funnel. Therefore, you don\u2019t want to waste your high bids on searches that have a lower likelihood of converting. But it would be great if you could capture them.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/gooogle-shopping-priority-bidding-structure.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"493\" alt=\"google shopping priority bidding structure to help lower cost per click\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>By following the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/25\/google-shopping-ads-priority-bidding-structure\">priority bidding campaign structure<\/a>, you\u2019re being risk averse with CPC while still helping to scale your campaigns.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Optimize your product feed attributes<\/h3>\n<p>Google matches your products up to searches based on your product feed. If your attributes are out of whack, you have a higher chance of wasting your CPC away on irrelevant clicks.<\/p>\n<p>If you feel<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/01\/shopping-ads-benchmarks\"> your Shopping CPC<\/a> has been high, take a step back and look at your product feed. Are all attributes accurate for each product? Is there any way you can tweak how you assign your products\u2019 attributes to better match your ideal searcher\u2019s intent?<\/p>\n<p>Answering these questions and manually <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/18\/google-shopping-feed\">optimizing your Shopping feed<\/a> will help guide Google to match your product listings with the best searches possible to maximize the value of each click you pull in.<\/p>\n<h2>How to lower Facebook ads cost per click<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/20\/facebook-ad-guidelines\">Facebook ads<\/a> are a whole different beast from Google because you can\u2019t show on a searcher\u2019s command. So, you have to optimize to not only be able to show up while someone is scrolling through Facebook apps (this includes Facebook, Messenger, and Whatsapp), but to also pull in the cheapest click possible.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the average Facebook ads CPC in 2021?<\/h3>\n<p>For all campaign objectives, the average is Facebook ads CPC is $0.97, with a range of $0.25 (catalog sales) &#8211; $3.30 (brand awareness).<\/p>\n<p>Learn more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/12\/facebook-ads-cost\">Facebook ads costs here.<\/a><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/facebook-ads-cost-2021-average-cpc-by-objective.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"323\" alt=\"facebook ads average cost per click in 2021 by campaign objective\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/revealbot.com\/facebook-advertising-costs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>While it\u2019s not as cookie-cutter as choosing the cheapest keyword, Facebook\u2019s ad platform does allow for interesting tweaks you can do to lower CPC:<\/p>\n<h3>10. A\/B test your ad copy<\/h3>\n<p>One of the easiest ways to optimize for cheaper clicks in Facebook is to try tweaking <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/29\/best-facebook-ads\">your Facebook ad copy<\/a>. You\u2019d be surprised how two different ads within the same ad set can pull in two completely different average CPCs.<\/p>\n<p>This is due to<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/facebook-news-feed\/\"> Facebook\u2019s machine learning ranking your ad<\/a> before it decides when, where, and how often to show it. If Facebook determines that your ad copy and images won\u2019t drive actions, then you\u2019ll end up paying more for that ad\u2019s click.<\/p>\n<p>To <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/11\/facebook-ab-testing\">A\/B test your Facebook ads<\/a>, try swapping out images, switching out the CTA buttons, or changing the text to boost your Facebook ad\u2019s CPC health.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/facebook-ab-testing-headline.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"377\" alt=\"facebook a\/b testing example with headlines\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sharethis.com\/best-practices\/2017\/02\/how-to-write-great-facebook-headlines\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>11.

Similar to Google\u2019s automated bidding strategies, certain objectives may result in a higher CPC as they prioritize other actions.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a campaign objective optimized for conversions may choose to show at times when the CPC is higher because you\u2019re more likely to convert. Your best bet is to try a campaign objective out that best aligns with your end goal, and if you\u2019re unsure, then split your campaigns out to test two objectives simultaneously!<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/lower-cost-per-click-facebook-campaign-objectives.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"435\" alt=\"facebook campaign objectives\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>12.

You can work towards a lower CPC with the following optimizations:<\/p>\n<h3>13. Customize placements<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re running Instagram-only ads from Facebook\u2019s platform, then you already know you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/12\/10\/facebook-ad-placements\">customize your placements<\/a>. However, even within the Instagram placements there are multiple ways you can show: on stories, News Feeds, and more. Be sure to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/01\/08\/facebook-ad-placement-optimization\">select your Instagram placements<\/a> that best fit with your ad type. You don\u2019t want to waste your clicks from News Feed if you only want your Instagram video ad to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/22\/instagram-reels-ideas-for-businesses\">show on Instagram Reels<\/a>, and so on.<\/p>\n<h3>14. Be selective with your targeting<\/h3>\n<p>With such a saturated platform, it\u2019s vital to be picky about who your ad shows to on Instagram. To save yourself from a high CPC, you may not want to cast a wide net. With so many audience options to choose from, don\u2019t be afraid to dial it down by age, location, and interest when setting up your ad set.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/lower-cost-per-click-instagram-audience-options.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"590\" alt=\"instagram advertising audience options\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>15. Focus on engagement<\/h3>\n<p>After you set up your ad set for specific targeting and placements, focus on ad content that will drive engagement. When your ads drive actions like comments, likes, and shares, Instagram\u2019s algorithm will rank you higher.<\/p>\n<p>Not only that, but your ads will be more likely to drive conversions and growth because they\u2019re capturing your audience\u2019s attention.
