Pretend I didn\u2019t say that last bit; creating ads from anywhere other than Ads Manager is a fool\u2019s errand.<\/p>\n<p>Offer ads are made from modular components that can be stripped or added as you see fit. The title (which should probably, you know, tell prospects exactly how sweet a deal you\u2019re offering) can be up to 50 characters in length; the details\u2014the textual meat of the thing\u2014cap out at 250.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/create-facebook-offer-ad.png\" alt=\"creating facebook offer ads\" width=\"382\" height=\"317\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also important to note that you need to set an end date for your offer ads. Per Facebook, the ideal length for your promotion is 7 days; this is enough time for it to been seen, shared, and, most importantly, served up again as a reminder.<\/p>\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, offers can be redeemed online (using an offer URL), in store, or both; you also have the option to add catch-all or unique promo codes to allow for more effective tracking.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-offer-ads-promo-code.png\" alt=\"facebook offer promo code creation\" width=\"379\" height=\"338\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The last two need-to-know kernels regarding offer ads are that you can control the total number of available offers\u00a0<em>and<\/em>\u00a0the ability to share promo codes directly from an offer ad; while you may feel inclined to err on the side of exclusivity, I\u2019d suggest setting the bar prettyyyyyyyy high.

They can only be used when you choose the Traffic, Conversion, or Store Visits objectives (fail to do so and the slider that enables offer ads won\u2019t appear in the Ad Set interface).<\/p>\n<p>Finally, before you go ahead and activate an offer ad, make sure you\u2019ve double and tripled checked\u00a0<em>everything<\/em>: once pushed live, they can\u2019t be edited or deleted.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Free guide<\/strong> &gt;&gt; <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLFBFundamentals.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FacebookFundamentals_Download\">7 Fundamental Facebook Advertising Tips<\/a><\/strong> every advertiser should know.<\/p>\n<h2>Underutilized Facebook Ad Type #2: Video Ads<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/m\/facebook-video-ads#advertise-with-videos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">According to<\/a>\u00a0Facebook, people spend five times longer looking at video than at static content on both Facebook and Instagram.
