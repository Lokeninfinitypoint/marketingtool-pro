Provide a solid customer experience<\/h3>\n<p>It all starts with a good customer experience.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn today&#8217;s competitive market, exceeding expectations, exceeding customer needs and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-demonstrate-value-to-your-customers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">establishing your worth<\/a> are critical components of success,\u201d said Matt Weidle, business development manager of product comparison site\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/buyersguide.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buyer&#8217;s Guide<\/a>. \u201cIt is critical your organization maintains customer satisfaction across all channels, including in-person and online encounters.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/customer-retention-strategies-example-chewy.png\" alt=\"customer retention strategies - example of chewy\" width=\"400\" height=\"659\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58532\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/customer-retention-strategies-example-chewy.png 400w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/customer-retention-strategies-example-chewy-182x300.png 182w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Take the case of Jeff Neal, founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thecritterdepot.com\/products\/dubia-roaches-critter-depot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Critter Depot<\/a>, who ships live insects to pet stores, zoos, and reptile owners. Retaining customers is very important because of the inherent constraints of its audience size. That\u2019s why Critter Depot ships orders quickly, for example.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe biggest factor is providing good service,\u201d he added. \u201cSometimes the crickets or roaches will perish in route. It is imperative\u00a0that we reship a new order at no cost.\u00a0That one transaction may be a losing proposition for us. However, the long-term potential of retaining that customer greatly salvages the loss on that one order.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;That one transaction may be a losing proposition for us.

Under-promise &amp; overdeliver<\/h3>\n<p>On a related note, it\u2019s wise to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/15\/ppc-agency-pricing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">set customer expectations<\/a> early\u2014and to always exceed them.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBe conservative with your estimates in terms of what you&#8217;ll be able to deliver to your customers. Then, overdeliver on that promise,\u201d Zhou said. \u201cAlways offer more value than your customer expects. That way, your services\/products, no matter what your price point is, become a no-brainer for your customers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ray\u00a0Blakney, CEO of online language school, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.livelingua.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Live Lingua<\/a>, agreed even in a highly competitive market, customers are much more likely to return if they have an exceptional experience.<\/p>\n<h3>3.
