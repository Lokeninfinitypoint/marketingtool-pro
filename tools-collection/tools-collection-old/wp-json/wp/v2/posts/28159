This may vary from niche to niche, but it\u2019s likely that Google is the dominant player in the search results that your business or website would want to show up in, and the best practices outlined in this guide will help position your site and its content to rank in other search engines, as well.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/seo-basics-search-engine-market-share.png\" alt=\"seo basics - search engine market share\" width=\"600\" height=\"506\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-56021\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/seo-basics-search-engine-market-share.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/seo-basics-search-engine-market-share-480x405.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<article><\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Regardless of what search engine you use, search results are constantly changing. Google particularly has updated <a href=\"http:\/\/searchengineland.com\/library\/google\/google-penguin-update\">lots of things<\/a> surrounding <a href=\"http:\/\/searchengineland.com\/library\/google\/google-panda-update\">how they rank websites<\/a> by way of <a href=\"http:\/\/searchengineland.com\/google-hummingbird-172816\">lots of different animal names<\/a> recently, and a lot of the easiest and cheapest ways to get your pages to rank in search results have become extremely risky in recent years.<\/p>\n<p>So what works? How does Google determine which pages to return in response to what people search for? How do you get all of this valuable traffic to your site?<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s algorithm is extremely complex, and I\u2019ll share some links for anyone looking to dive deeper into how Google ranks sites at the end of this section, but at an extremely high level:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google is looking for pages that contain<strong> high-quality, relevant information<\/strong> about the searcher\u2019s query.<\/li>\n<li>They determine relevance by \u201ccrawling\u201d (or reading) your website\u2019s content and evaluating (algorithmically) whether that content is relevant to what the searcher is looking for, mostly based on the keywords it contains.<\/li>\n<li>They determine \u201cquality\u201d by a number of means, but prominent among those is still the number and quality of other websites that link to your page and your site as a whole. To put it extremely simply: If the only sites that link to your blue widget site are blogs that no one else on the Web has linked to, and my blue widget site gets links from trusted places that are linked to frequently, like CNN.com, my site will be more trusted (and assumed to be higher quality) than yours.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Increasingly, additional elements are being weighed by Google\u2019s algorithm to determine where your site will rank, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How people engage with your site (Do they find the information they need and stay on your site, or bounce back to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/09\/google-search-page\">the search page<\/a> and click on another link? Or do they just ignore your listing in search results altogether and never click-through?)<\/li>\n<li>Your site\u2019s <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2011\/08\/23\/page-speed-conversion-rate-optimization\">loading speed<\/a> and \u201cmobile friendliness\u201d<\/li>\n<li>How much unique content you have (versus very \u201cthin\u201d low-value content or <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/06\/duplicate-content\">duplicate content<\/a>)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are hundreds of ranking factors Google\u2019s algorithm considers in response to searches, and they are constantly updating and refining their process.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/moz-ranking-factors-seo-basics.gif\" alt=\"google ranking factors seo\" width=\"1163\" height=\"1038\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The good news is, you don\u2019t have to be a search engine scholar to rank for valuable terms in search results.

This means <strong>identifying the terms people are searching for (also known as \u201ckeywords\u201d)<\/strong> that you want your website to rank for in search engines like Google.<\/p>\n<p>Sounds simple enough, right? I want my widget company to show up when people look for \u201cwidgets,\u201d and maybe when they type in things like \u201cbuy widgets.\u201d Onto step three!<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/seo-basics-search-volume-trends.png\" alt=\"search volume for seo keywords\" width=\"1137\" height=\"262\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Unfortunately it\u2019s not quite that simple. There are a few key factors to take into account when determining the keywords you want to target on your site:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Search Volume<\/strong> \u2013 The first factor to consider is how many people (if any) are actually searching for a given keyword. The more people there are searching for a keyword, the bigger the audience you stand to reach. Conversely, if no one is searching for a keyword, there is no audience available to find your content through search.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Relevance<\/strong> \u2013 If a term is frequently searched for that\u2019s great: but what if it\u2019s not completely relevant <em>to your prospects<\/em>? Relevance seems straightforward at first: if you\u2019re selling enterprise email marketing automation software you don\u2019t want to show up for searches that don\u2019t have anything to do with your business, like \u201cpet supplies.\u201d But what about terms like \u201cemail marketing software\u201d? This might intuitively seem like a great description of what you do, but if you\u2019re selling to Fortune 100 companies, most of the traffic for this very competitive term will be searchers who don\u2019t have any interest in buying your software (and the folks you do want to reach might never buy your expensive, complex solution based on a simple Google search). Conversely, you might think a tangential keyword like \u201cbest enterprise PPC marketing solutions\u201d is totally irrelevant to your business since you don\u2019t sell PPC marketing software. But if your prospect is a CMO or marketing director, getting in front of them with a helpful resource on evaluating pay-per-click tools could be a great \u201cfirst touch\u201d and an excellent way to start a relationship with a prospective buyer.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Competition<\/strong> \u2013 As with any business opportunity, in SEO you want to consider the potential costs and likelihood of success. For SEO, this means understanding the relative competition (and likelihood to rank) for specific terms.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>First you need to understand who your prospective customers are and what they\u2019re likely to search for. If you don\u2019t already understand who your prospects are, thinking about that <a href=\"http:\/\/offers.hubspot.com\/free-template-creating-buyer-personas\">is a good place to start<\/a>, for your business in general but also for SEO.<\/p>\n<p>From there you want to understand:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What types of things are they interested in?<\/li>\n<li>What problems do they have?<\/li>\n<li>What type of language do they use to describe the things that they do, the tools that they use, etc.?<\/li>\n<li>Who else are they buying things from (this means your competitors, but also could mean tangential, related tools \u2013 for the email marketing company, think other enterprise marketing tools)?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve answered these questions, you\u2019ll have an initial \u201cseed list\u201d of possible keywords and domains to help you get additional keyword ideas and to put some search volume and competition metrics around.<\/p>\n<p>Take the list of core ways that your prospects and customers describe what you do, and start to input those into keyword tools like <a href=\"\/keyword-tool-google\">Google\u2019s<\/a> own keyword tool or tools like <a href=\"http:\/\/ubersuggest.org\/\">Uber Suggest<\/a> or <a href=\"\/keywords\">WordStream\u2019s keyword tool<\/a>:<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/best-free-keyword-research-tools-wordstream-free-keyword-tool.png\" alt=\"best keyword research tools: wordstream free keyword tool\" width=\"720\" height=\"406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-49521\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/best-free-keyword-research-tools-wordstream-free-keyword-tool.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/best-free-keyword-research-tools-wordstream-free-keyword-tool-480x271.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nYou can find a more comprehensive list of keyword tools below, but the main idea is that in this initial step, you\u2019ll want to run a number of searches with a variety of different keyword tools. You can also use competitive keyword tools like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.semrush.com\/\">SEM Rush<\/a> to see what terms your competitors are ranking for. These tools look at thousands of different search results, and will show you each search term they\u2019ve seen your competitor ranking in Google for lately. Here\u2019s what SEM Rush shows for marketing automation provider Marketo:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sem-rush-data-seo-basics.png\" alt=\"SEMRush Keyword Data\" width=\"783\" height=\"726\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Again: this doesn\u2019t just have to be something you look at for competitors. You could look at related tools that are selling to the same market for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/12\/blog-topic-generators\">content ideas<\/a>, and even look at the major niche publishers who talk about your topic (and that your prospects are reading) and see what kinds of keywords those sites are driving traffic for.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, if you have an existing site, you\u2019re likely getting some traffic from search engines already. If that\u2019s the case, you can use some of your own keyword data to help you understand which terms are driving traffic (and which you might be able to rank a bit better for).<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Google has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.notprovidedcount.com\/what-is-not-provided\/\">stopped delivering a lot of the information about what people are searching for to analytics providers<\/a>, but you can use SEM Rush (or similar tools, such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spyfu.com\/\">SpyFu<\/a>) <strong>on your own site<\/strong> to get a sense of the terms you\u2019re ranking for and their estimated search volume. Google also makes a bit more of this data available in their free Google Search Console interface (if you haven\u2019t set up an account, this is a very valuable <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/17\/amazon-seo\">SEO<\/a> tool both for unearthing search query data and for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/20\/seo-audit\">diagnosing various technical SEO issues<\/a> \u2013 more on <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/6001104?hl=en\">Google Search Console here<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Once Google Search Console is set up, you can navigate to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/webmasters\/tools\/top-search-queries\">this link<\/a> when logged in and see the search queries that are driving traffic to your site:<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/seo-basics-google-search-console-query-report.png\" alt=\"seo basics: google search console top queries report\" width=\"800\" height=\"547\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-56022\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/seo-basics-google-search-console-query-report.png 800w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/seo-basics-google-search-console-query-report-480x328.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nThese could be good terms to focus additional content promotion and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/04\/internal-linking\">internal linking<\/a> around (more on each of those topics later), and could also be great \u201cseed keywords\u201d to help you get more great ideas about what to target.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve taken the time to understand how your prospects talk and what they search for, have looked at the keywords driving traffic to your competitors and related sites, and have looked at the terms driving traffic to your own site, you need to work to understand <strong>which terms you can conceivably rank for<\/strong> and <strong>where the best opportunities actually lie<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Determining the relative competition of a keyword can be a fairly complex task.

The title tag is what you can see at the very top of your browser, and is populated by your page\u2019s source code in a <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/79812?hl=en\">meta tag<\/a>:<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/seo-basics-title-tag.png\" alt=\"seo basics - title tag vs page title example\" width=\"800\" height=\"475\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-56023\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/seo-basics-title-tag.png 800w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/seo-basics-title-tag-480x285.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nThe length of a title tag that Google will show will vary (it\u2019s based on pixels, not character counts) but <a href=\"http:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/new-title-tag-guidelines-preview-tool\">in general 55-60 characters is a good rule of thumb here<\/a>. If possible you want to work in your core keyword, and if you can do it in a natural and compelling way, add some related modifiers around that term as well. Keep in mind though: the title tag will frequently be what a searcher sees in search results for your page. It\u2019s the \u201cheadline\u201d in organic search results, so you also want to take <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/17\/headline-writing\">how clickable your title tag is<\/a> into account.<\/p>\n<h3>Meta descriptions<\/h3>\n<p>While the title tag is effectively your search listing\u2019s headline, the meta description (another meta HTML element that can be updated in your site\u2019s code, but isn\u2019t seen on your actual page) is effectively your site\u2019s additional ad copy. Google takes some liberties with what they display in search results, so your meta description may not always show, but if you have a compelling description of your page that would make folks searching likely to click, you can greatly increase traffic. (Remember: showing up in search results is just the first step! You still need to get searchers to come to your site, and then actually take the action you want.)<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example of a real world meta description showing in search results:<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/seo-basics-optimized-meta-description-example.png\" alt=\"seo basics - meta description example\" width=\"800\" height=\"121\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-56026\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/seo-basics-optimized-meta-description-example.png 800w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/seo-basics-optimized-meta-description-example-480x73.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw\" \/><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The meta description for our Google Ads Grader is a concise description of the tool, with clear benefits and a call to action \u2014 like good ad copy!<\/em><\/div>\n<h3>Body content<\/h3>\n<p>The actual content of your page itself is, of course, very important. Different types of pages will have different \u201cjobs\u201d \u2013 your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/23\/cornerstone-content-guide\">cornerstone content<\/a> asset that you want lots of folks to link to needs to be very different than your support content that you want to make sure your users find and get an answer from quickly. That said, Google has been increasingly favoring certain types of content, and as you build out any of the pages on your site, there are a few things to keep in mind:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Thick and Unique Content<\/strong> \u2013 There is no magic number in terms of word count, and if you have a few pages of content on your site with a handful to a couple hundred words you won\u2019t be falling out of Google\u2019s good graces, but in general recent <a href=\"http:\/\/searchengineland.com\/library\/google\/google-panda-update\">Panda updates<\/a> in particular favor longer, unique content. If you have a large number (think thousands) of extremely short (50-200 words of content) pages or lots of <a href=\"http:\/\/googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com\/2015\/03\/an-update-on-doorway-pages.html\">duplicated content where nothing changes but the page\u2019s title tag<\/a> and say a line of text, that could get you in trouble. Look at the entirety of your site: are a large percentage of your pages thin, duplicated and low value? If so, try to identify a way to \u201cthicken\u201d those pages, or check your analytics to see how much traffic they\u2019re getting, and simply exclude them (<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/93710?hl=en\">using a noindex meta tag<\/a>) from search results to keep from having it appear to Google that you\u2019re trying to flood their index with lots of low value pages in an attempt to have them rank.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Engagement<\/strong> \u2013 Google is increasingly weighting engagement and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/22\/content-marketing-metrics\">user experience metrics<\/a> more heavily. You can impact this by making sure your content answers the questions searchers are asking so that they\u2019re likely to stay on your page and engage with your content. Make sure your pages load quickly and don\u2019t have design elements (such as overly aggressive ads above the content) that would be likely to turn searchers off and send them away.<\/li>\n<li><strong>\u201cSharability\u201d<\/strong> \u2013 Not every single piece of content on your site will be linked to and shared hundreds of times. But in the same way you want to be careful of not rolling out large quantities of pages that have thin content, you want to consider who would be likely to share and link to new pages you\u2019re creating on your site <em>before you roll them out<\/em>. Having large quantities of pages that aren\u2019t <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/19\/social-sharing\">likely to be shared<\/a> or linked to doesn\u2019t position those pages to rank well in search results, and doesn\u2019t help to create a good picture of your site as a whole for search engines, either.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Alt attributes<\/h3>\n<p>How you mark up your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/08\/image-seo\">images<\/a> can impact not only the way that search engines perceive your page, but also how much search traffic from image search your site generates. An alt attribute is an HTML element that allows you to provide alternative information for an image if a user can\u2019t view it. Your images may break over time (files get deleted, users have difficulty connecting to your site, etc.) so having a useful description of the image can be helpful from an overall usability perspective. This also gives you another opportunity \u2013 outside of your content \u2013 to help search engines understand what your page is about.<\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t want to \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/66358?hl=en\">keyword stuff<\/a>\u201d and cram your core keyword and every possible variation of it into your alt attribute. In fact, if it doesn\u2019t fit naturally into the description, don\u2019t include your target keyword here at all. Just be sure not to skip the alt attribute, and try to give a thorough, accurate description of the image (imagine you\u2019re describing it to someone who can\u2019t see it \u2013 that\u2019s what it\u2019s there for!).<\/p>\n<p>By writing naturally about your topic, you\u2019re avoiding \u201cover-optimization\u201d filters (in other words: it doesn\u2019t make it look like you\u2019re trying to trick Google into ranking your page for your target keyword) and you give yourself a better chance to rank for valuable <a href=\"\/long-tail-keywords\">modified \u201clong tail\u201d variations<\/a> of your core topic.<\/p>\n<h3>URL structure<\/h3>\n<p>Your site\u2019s URL structure can be important both from a tracking perspective (you can more easily segment data in reports using a segmented, logical URL structure), and a shareability standpoint (shorter, descriptive URLs are easier to copy and paste and tend to get mistakenly cut off less frequently). Again: don\u2019t work to cram in as many keywords as possible; create a short, descriptive URL.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover: if you don\u2019t have to, don\u2019t change your URLs. Even if your URLs aren\u2019t \u201cpretty,\u201d if you don\u2019t feel as though they\u2019re negatively impacting users and your business in general, don\u2019t change them to be more keyword focused for \u201cbetter SEO.\u201d If you do have to change your URL structure, make sure to use the proper (301 permanent) type of redirect.

The way that you organize your website and interlink between your pages can impact how various content on your site ranks in response to searches.<\/p>\n<p>The reason for this is that search engines largely perceive links as \u201cvotes of confidence\u201d and a means to help understand both what a page is about, and how important it is (and how trusted it should be).<\/p>\n<p>Search engines also look at the actual text you use to link to pages, called <a href=\"\/anchor-text\">anchor text<\/a> \u2013 using descriptive text to link to a page on your site helps Google understand what that page is about (but in a <a href=\"http:\/\/searchengineland.com\/library\/google\/google-penguin-update\">post-Penguin world<\/a> especially, be sure not to be overly aggressive in cramming your keywords into linking text).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/seo-basics-anchor-text.png\" alt=\"seo basics - anchor text example\" width=\"720\" height=\"163\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-56216\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/seo-basics-anchor-text.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/seo-basics-anchor-text-480x109.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In the same way that a link from CNN is an indication that your site could be important, if you are linking to a specific page aggressively from various areas on your site, that\u2019s an indication to search engines that that specific page is very important to your site. Additionally: the pages on your site that have <strong>the most external votes<\/strong> (links from other, trusted sites) have the most power to help the other pages on your site rank in search results.<\/p>\n<p>This relates back to a concept called \u201cPageRank.\u201d PageRank is no longer used in the same way it was when initially implemented, but if you\u2019re looking to understand the topic more deeply here are some good resources:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.portent.com\/blog\/seo\/pagerank-without-math.htm\">A good math-free explanation of PageRank<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/how-pagerank-works-why-the-original-pr-formula-may-be-flawed\">A detailed breakdown of how PageRank works (from several years ago) with a number of helpful visuals<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/infolab.stanford.edu\/~backrub\/google.html\">The original academic paper published by Google\u2019s founders<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Let\u2019s walk through a quick example to help you understand the concept of how link equity (or the number and quality of links pointed to a page) impacts site architecture and how you link internally. Let\u2019s imagine we have a snow removal site:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>We publish an amazing study on the impact of snow on construction in the winter in cold weather climates. It gets linked to from all over the web.<\/li>\n<li>The study is published on our main snow removal site. All of the other pages are simple sales-oriented pages explaining various aspects of our company\u2019s snow removal offerings. No external site has linked to any of these pages.<\/li>\n<li>The study itself may be well-positioned to rank well in search results for various phrases. The sales-oriented pages much less so. By linking <strong>from<\/strong> our study <strong>to<\/strong> our most important sales-oriented pages, however, we can pass some of the trust and authority of our guide onto those pages. They won\u2019t be as well positioned to rank in search results as our study, but they\u2019ll be much better positioned than when they had no authoritative documents (on our site or on other sites) pointing to them. An important additional note here: in this example our most-linked to page is our fictitious study. In many cases, your most linked to page will be your home page (the page that people link to when they talk about you, when you get press, etc.) so <strong>being sure to link strategically to the most important pages on your site from your home page is very important<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Information architecture can be an extremely complex topic \u2013 particularly for larger sites \u2013 and there are a number of great additional resources below with more specific answers listed at the end of this section, but at a high level the most important things to keep in mind are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You want to understand<\/strong> <strong>your most linked-to pages<\/strong> (use tools like Ahrefs, Majestic SEO, or Moz and look at \u201ctop pages\u201d reports to determine these).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Keep your most important search pages (the pages you are using to target your most valuable keywords) \u201chigh up\u201d in your information architecture<\/strong>: this means linking to them often in navigation elements and linking to them whenever possible from your most linked-to pages (e.g., make sure your home page and your site\u2019s version of our hit snow study are linking to the most valuable pages on your site from a search perspective \u2013 your \u201cmoney pages\u201d).<\/li>\n<li><strong>In general you want to have a \u201cflat information architecture\u201d for your site<\/strong> \u2013 meaning that you keep any pages that you want to have rank in search engines as few clicks as possible from your home page and most linked-to pages.

Identify and understand your linking and sharing audience<\/h3>\n<p>The first thing you need to do in working to get traction for your content, is understand <strong>who<\/strong> is likely to link to and share your content. There are several tools to help you identify influencers within your niche who might share your content, but probably the most powerful is BuzzSumo:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/buzzsumo-seo-basics.png\" alt=\"buzzsumo for seo\" width=\"666\" height=\"510\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Similar tools include\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/followerwonk.com\/\">FollowerWonk<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.getlittlebird.com\/\">Little Bird<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\">Ahrefs<\/a>. More detailed tutorials on using these tools to better understand your niche are included below.<\/p>\n<p>The idea in leveraging these tools is to first identify the thought leaders and potential linkers in your space, and then <strong>understand what they share and link to<\/strong>. Find out what their problems are, what types of content they typically share, and start to think about how you can create something they would find valuable and want to share with their audience (who would also find it valuable).<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/influencer-marketing-advocates-vs-influencers-infographic.jpg\" alt=\"Influencer marketing influencers versus advocates infographic\" width=\"400\" height=\"476\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As you work through this process, start to think about what you can do for these influencers. How could you help them with their own projects? What can you do (unsolicited) that would help them achieve their own goals or what could you create or offer that would be of value to the audience <em>they<\/em> are creating content for and trying to help? Do you have access to unique data or knowledge that would help them do their jobs better? <strong>If you can consistently be of use to smart content creators in your niche, you\u2019ll start to build powerful relationships that will pay dividends as you\u2019re creating content<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Before you create a major piece of content, you should have already thought about how that content will get shared: who will share it, and why would they?<\/p>\n<h3>2. Determine what content you can create and how you can promote it<\/h3>\n<p>Next you have to try to understand what your own capabilities are, and what kind of content you can create that will be likely to be shared and promoted by others.

Map your assets to specific keywords<\/h3>\n<p>Finally, don\u2019t forget about your keywords! This doesn\u2019t mean that every time you create a great resource you need to cram in a keyword that doesn\u2019t fit: it means that <strong>you can use keyword research as a means for discovering pain points <\/strong>(if people are turning to search engines to look for things, they want content that provides a great answer to their question!), and that as you create new assets you want to look for the different ways you can incorporate the language your prospects and customers are using into your assets: particularly those that will actually get linked to and shared (as you will increasingly need to get some sort of distribution for pages where you want them to rank for valuable keywords).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Additional Resources:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/05\/blog-post-templates\">9 Free SEO Blog Post Templates Guaranteed to Drive Traffic<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/09\/how-to-write-a-blog-post\">How to Write an Awesome Blog Post in 5 Steps<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">How to Find Your Target Audience<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a id=\"technical_seo\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>SEO Basics Part 6: Common technical SEO issues and best practices<\/h2>\n<p>While <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/10\/goal-talk-episode-5\">basics<\/a> of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/23\/seo-for-startups\">SEO<\/a> like the most efficient ways to build links to drive search engine rankings have changed in recent years (and <a href=\"\/blog?field_taxonomy_tid=183\">content marketing<\/a> has become increasingly important) what many people would think of as more \u201ctraditional SEO\u201d is still incredibly valuable in generating traffic from search engines.

Google has actually <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/speed\/pagespeed\/insights\/\">created a useful tool<\/a> here to give you some specific suggestions on what to change on your site to address page speed issues.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/increase-traffic-to-your-website-pagespeed-insights.png\" alt=\"increase traffic to your website - pagespeed insights score example\" width=\"600\" height=\"419\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-54394\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/increase-traffic-to-your-website-pagespeed-insights.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/increase-traffic-to-your-website-pagespeed-insights-480x335.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Mobile friendliness<\/h3>\n<p>If your site is driving (or could be driving) significant search engine traffic from mobile searches, how \u201cmobile friendly\u201d your site is will impact your rankings on mobile devices, which is a fast-growing segment. In some niches, mobile traffic already outweighs desktop traffic.<\/p>\n<p>Google recently announced an algorithm update focused on this specifically. You can find out more about how to see what kind of mobile search engine traffic is coming to your site along with some specific recommendations for things to update <a href=\"http:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/small-business-owners-guide-googles-april-21-mobile-friendly-algorithm-update\/129535\/\">in my recent post<\/a>, and here again Google offers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/webmasters\/tools\/mobile-friendly\/\">a very helpful free tool to get recommendations on how to make your site more mobile-friendly<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Header response<\/h3>\n<p>Header response codes are an important technical SEO issue. If you\u2019re not particularly technical, this can be a complex topic (and again more thorough resources are listed below) but you want to make sure that working pages are returning the correct code to search engines (200), and that pages that are not found are also returning a code to represent that they are no longer present (a 404).<\/p>\n<p>Getting these codes wrong can indicate to Google and other search engines that a \u201cPage Not Found\u201d page is in fact a functioning page, which makes it look like a thin or duplicated page, or even worse: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hmtweb.com\/marketing-blog\/hidden-seo-danger-wrong-header-response-code\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">you can indicate to Google that all of your site\u2019s content is actually 404s<\/a> (so that none of your pages are indexed and eligible to rank). You can use a <a href=\"http:\/\/tools.seobook.com\/server-header-checker\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">server header checker<\/a> to see the status codes that your pages are returning when search engines crawl them.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/server-header-checker-seo-basics-guide.png\" alt=\"seo basics header check\" width=\"493\" height=\"461\" \/><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<h3>Redirects<\/h3>\n<p>Improperly implementing redirects on your site can have a serious impact on search results. Whenever you can avoid it, you want to keep from moving your site\u2019s content from one URL to another; in other words: if your content is on example.com\/page, and that page is getting search engine traffic, you want to avoid moving all of the content to example.com\/different-url\/newpage.html, unless there is an <em>extremely strong business reason<\/em> that would outweigh a possible short-term or even long-term loss in search engine traffic.<\/p>\n<p>If you do need to move content, you want to make sure that you implement permanent (or 301) redirects for content that is moving permanently, as temporary (or 302) redirects (which are frequently used by developers) indicate to Google that the move may not be permanent, and that they shouldn\u2019t move all of the link equity and ranking power to the new URL. (Further, changing your URL structure could create <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2010\/06\/02\/how-to-find-and-fix-broken-links\">broken links<\/a>, hurting your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/23\/referral-traffic-links\">referral traffic<\/a> streams and making it difficult for visitors to navigate your site.)<\/p>\n<h3>Duplicate content<\/h3>\n<p>Thin and duplicated content is another area of emphasis with Google\u2019s recent Panda updates. By duplicating content (putting the same or near-identical content on multiple pages), you\u2019re diluting link equity between two pages instead of concentrating it on one page, giving you less of a chance of ranking for competitive phrases with sites that are consolidating their link equity into a single document. Having large quantities of duplicated content makes your site look like it is cluttered with lower-quality (and possibly manipulative) content in the eyes of search engines.<\/p>\n<p>There are a number of things that can cause duplicate or thin content. These problems can be difficult to diagnose, but you can look at Webmaster Tools under Search Appearance &gt; HTML Improvements to get a quick diagnosis.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/seo-basics-guide-duplicate-content.png\" alt=\"duplicate content issues seo\" width=\"710\" height=\"493\" \/><\/div>\n<p>And check out Google\u2019s own <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/66359?hl=en\">breakdown on duplicate content<\/a>. Many paid SEO tools also offer a means for discovering duplicate content, such as <a href=\"http:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/how-to-defeat-duplicate-content-next-level\">Moz analytics<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/searchenginewatch.com\/sew\/how-to\/2207433\/how-to-quickly-identify-duplicate-content-with-a-site-crawl\">Screaming Frog SEO Spider<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>XML sitemap<\/h3>\n<p>XML sitemaps can help Google and Bing understand your site and find all of its content. Just be sure not to include pages that aren\u2019t useful, and know that submitting a page to a search engine in a sitemap doesn\u2019t insure that the page will actually rank for anything. There are <a href=\"https:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/sitemap-generators\/wiki\/SitemapGenerators\">a number<\/a> of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.xml-sitemaps.com\/\">free tools<\/a> to generate XML sitemaps.<\/p>\n<h3>Robots.txt, meta noindex, and meta nofollow<\/h3>\n<p>Finally, you can indicate to search engines how you want them to handle certain content on your site (for instance if you\u2019d like them not to crawl a specific section of your site) in a <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/6062608?hl=en\">robots.txt file<\/a>. This file likely already exists for your site at yoursite.com\/robots.txt.<\/p>\n<p>You want to make sure this file isn\u2019t currently blocking anything you\u2019d want a search engine to find from being added to their index, and you also can use the robots file to keep things like staging servers or swaths of thin or duplicate content that are valuable for internal use or customers from being indexed by search engines. You can use the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/93710?hl=en\">meta noindex<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/searchengineland.com\/google-explains-the-noindex-nofollow-noarchive-nosnippet-meta-tags-10595\">meta nofollow<\/a> tags for similar purposes, though each functions differently from one another.<\/p>\n<h3>Security<\/h3>\n<p>Site security is key for technical SEO. In addition to keeping your site maintained in terms of plugins and comment spam, you&#8217;ll also want to make sure your site is served over https, rather than just http. To do this, you need an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/09\/what-is-an-ssl-certificate\">SSL certificate<\/a>.

Some would <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marketingprofs.com\/articles\/2015\/27359\/these-six-stupid-marketing-metrics-need-to-die\">even go so far as to declare them dead<\/a>. But getting a rough idea of where your site ranks for core terms can be a useful leading indicator of your site\u2019s health. High rankings across a range of keywords is a strong indicator of organic search visibility.<\/p>\n<p><strong>This doesn\u2019t mean you should get overly obsessed with rankings for any one term<\/strong>. Remember: your ultimate goal is to drive more relevant traffic that drives more <strong>business<\/strong> \u2013 if you sell blue widgets, is it more important that you rank for \u201cblue widgets\u201d or that you outline and execute an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/10\/seo-service-and-help\">SEO strategy that helps<\/a> you sell more blue widgets in the most cost-efficient way possible? Use rankings as a general health check, not a course-charting KPI.<\/p>\n<p>A number of tools can help you check your rankings. Most offer fairly similar functionality but features like local or mobile rankings are sometimes unique in some of the tools. If you\u2019re a small business or just getting started with SEO, I\u2019d recommend picking a free and easy-to-use tool and just keeping an eye on a handful of the core terms you want to track to help you gauge progress.<\/p>\n<h3>Organic traffic<\/h3>\n<p>Organic traffic is a much better leading indicator of the health of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/05\/seo-strategy\">SEO efforts<\/a>. By looking at the organic traffic to your site, you can get a gauge for the actual volume of visitors coming to your site, and where they\u2019re going.<\/p>\n<p>You can measure your organic traffic easily with most analytics tools \u2013 since it\u2019s free and the most-used, we\u2019ll look at how to get this information in <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/15\/google-analytics-tips\">Google Analytics<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For a quick check, you can simply look at your site\u2019s main reporting page and click on \u201cAll Sessions\u201d to filter for organic traffic (traffic from search engines that excludes paid search traffic):<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/seo-basics-organic-traffic-google-analytics.png\" alt=\"seo basics - tracking organic seo traffic\" width=\"900\" height=\"636\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-56028\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/seo-basics-organic-traffic-google-analytics.png 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/seo-basics-organic-traffic-google-analytics-480x339.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nYou can also drill down to look at the specific pages driving traffic and goals by creating a custom report and designating users and goal completions as your metrics, and landing pages as your dimension:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/seo-basics-custom-report.png\" alt=\"basic seo reporting\" width=\"550\" height=\"642\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Note: Make sure once you view this report that you\u2019re selecting the organic traffic segment again, or you\u2019ll be looking at all of your traffic by page rather than just unpaid traffic driven by search engines.<\/p>\n<p>This can be powerful for sites just getting started with SEO, because frequently most of your site\u2019s traffic will be driven by what\u2019s known as \u201cbranded queries,\u201d or searches that contain your company\u2019s brand name (for instance a branded search for WordStream might be \u201cWordStream PPC\u201d versus a non-branded search term, which might be \u201cpay-per-click software\u201d). You clearly want to have people searching for your brand, and of course you want them to find you when they do, but unless your site has been penalized by Google, you will almost certainly rank for your brand and have that branded traffic come to your site\u2019s home page. What most of your ongoing SEO efforts should be centered around is driving incremental traffic to the site (people who might not have found and engaged with you otherwise).<\/p>\n<p>As I mentioned in the keyword section of the guide, unfortunately Google has made it difficult to get data around the actual keywords people are searching for, but by looking at page-level traffic (outside of your site\u2019s home page) you can start to glean insight into your overall SEO progress. Looking at rank data and using the tactics mentioned in the keyword section of this guide will also help you to get more insight into the actual terms that are driving traffic (and whether your SEO growth is being driven by optimization efforts rather than off-line marketing).<\/p>\n<p><strong>RELATED:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/24\/website-audit-checklist\">The Complete Website Audit Checklist (in One Epic Google Sheet)<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Organic leads and sales<\/h3>\n<p>Obviously the primary way to measure your search engine optimization results should be actual leads, sales, revenue and profit. Like with any business activity you need to answer: how does the activity help to move your bottom line?<\/p>\n<p>The simplest path here is to set up goals or e-commerce tracking in a tool like Google Analytics. You can use the above report to look at organic traffic and goals (or different e-commerce metrics) by landing page, which means that you are specifically looking at who converts among the people who are landing on your site from an organic search (versus people who may have come to your site from PPC or another channel within the window that your analytics tracking can track, then searched for you, then converted).<\/p>\n<p>This seems pretty straightforward, and generally for most businesses is a good initial way to measure the success of your SEO efforts, but again there are a few caveats and things to keep in mind with this data:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Web-based analytics is always imperfect<\/strong>. If you\u2019re transitioning from billboards or newspaper ads to online marketing, you\u2019ll likely be impressed by the volume and precision of the data available, but there can frequently be a variety of different tracking issues that can make the data you\u2019re seeing anywhere from slightly to wildly off \u2013 always have a degree of skepticism about data that doesn\u2019t seem to add up, and do what you can to have some checks in place to make sure that your analytics information is synced to your actual revenue and spend data.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your system might create gaps in tracking<\/strong>. If you have a back-end system that you can\u2019t quite tie to analytics for some reason, you might have some gaps between what you can track as goals and actual sales.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Attribution and life-time value metrics can be tricky.<\/strong> This is more of a business and web metrics problem than something specific to SEO, but figuring out how you attribute sales to different channels and factoring in life-time value to your site\u2019s traffic can be tricky.

While getting links and shares, doing keyword research, and ensuring your site doesn\u2019t have technical issues helps with localized rankings, there is a <a href=\"http:\/\/moz.com\/local-search-ranking-factors\">separate set of ranking factors<\/a> local businesses should be aware of. <a href=\"http:\/\/searchengineland.com\/local-seo-rank-local-business-218906\">Matthew Barby has an excellent guide on the topic<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>App Store Search Engines<\/strong> \u2013 If you have an app \u2013 either as the core product offering for your company, or as a means for enabling mobile users to be able to interact with your business \u2013 having your app show up in searches on various app stores can be extremely valuable.

business and site.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re great at creating and promoting content, determine which keywords to go after and focus your efforts there.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a large and complex site, focus on getting the technical SEO right (or hire someone who can).<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a small business that would benefit from ranking for very specific geo-focused terms but not much else,

content.\u00a0 Look for ways that search engine traffic can help your business and site: don\u2019t just chase after the latest SEO buzzwords or jump every time Google makes a recommendation that
