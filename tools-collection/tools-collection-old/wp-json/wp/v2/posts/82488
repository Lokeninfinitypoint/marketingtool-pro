This is likely where they\u2019ll learn the most about you, your team, your abilities, and how you can help them, so make sure it hits all the highlights.<\/p>\n<p>Think of your website as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/12\/04\/adwords-remarketing-best-practices-guide\">remarketing<\/a> portion of the buyer funnel. We\u2019ll attract them in the next section, but you should build remarketing lists ahead of time to capture all potential customers.<\/p>\n<p>Although all agencies are unique and want to highlight themselves differently, here are a few things to include on your site:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Easy conversion options: <\/strong>This should be a no-brainer, but if you\u2019re going to send people to a website, make sure <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/website-conversion\">they can convert<\/a>. This could be a form fill, a phone call, a service purchase, or scheduling a meeting. It\u2019s the dealer\u2019s choice, really. We don\u2019t let our clients get away without strong <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/09\/call-to-action#:~:text=Here%20are%20a%20few%20ideas,or%20%E2%80%9Cbook%20your%20appointment.%E2%80%9D\">calls to action<\/a>, so why should you?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Overview of services:<\/strong> Every marketing agency is different. Some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/16\/grow-your-digital-marketing-agency\">specialize in one area<\/a>, and others are jacks of all trades. Which are you? Highlight all of your services on your site so your potential customers know how you can help them grow their business.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Case studies:<\/strong> Personally, I don\u2019t love <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/03\/how-to-write-a-case-study\">case studies<\/a>, but that\u2019s a personal rant. Many agencies use case studies to attract potential clients, and many prospects like to see proof of success in their work. Including these can be an easy way to convince someone of your expertise and warm the lead a little before they even reach out.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Digestible language:<\/strong> This one is a personal pet peeve of mine. So often, when I visit an agency\u2019s website (or almost any tech solution anymore), I find that the entire thing is filled with industry jargon. Do you use proprietary software and machine learning to 10x your ROAS and send your results to the moon? Cool. So does everyone else. But also, your customers likely don\u2019t know what most of that means. That\u2019s why they\u2019re not in advertising and need your services. Keep it simple. Explain how you\u2019ll impact their business and keep the jargon out of it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Show off your accolades:<\/strong> If you\u2019ve been successful, show it off. Did you recently win an industry award? That goes on the site. Do you have killer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">customer reviews<\/a>? That also goes on the site. Your website is the one and only place where you control what is said about you. Put your best foot forward and show off why you\u2019re so awesome.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Now that you have a strong website that people can engage with after learning about you, it\u2019s time to start attracting new users\u2014the prospecting portion, if you will. Here, I have two main categories to focus on.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 Download <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteGrowYourMarketingAgency.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Agency_StrategiestoGrowYourAgency_Download\">The 6 Absolute Best Strategies to Grow Your Digital Marketing Agency<\/a> and get even more ways to find and retain great clients.<\/p>\n<div id=\"grow-your-thought-leadership\"><\/div>\n<h3>Grow your thought leadership<\/h3>\n<p>First, no one will know if you\u2019re an expert at something unless you prove it by sharing your thoughts, experiments, and findings. Even if public speaking isn\u2019t your thing, there are tons of ways to start showing off a little and making a name for yourself as an expert in any field.<\/p>\n<p>I know it might sound counterintuitive, but the more knowledge you give away, the more people want to work with you. Don\u2019t worry; it surprised me too.<\/p>\n<p>I used to think, \u201cBut if I give away all my secrets, then won\u2019t people just do it themselves?\u201d Some prospects will. And while that stings a little, there\u2019s a good lesson to be learned here: if someone will take your ideas and do it themselves, they likely won\u2019t be a great client anyway.<\/p>\n<p>Great clients trust in your expertise and work with you to see good results. They don\u2019t try to minimize your impact on their business by doing it themselves. Additionally, if someone\u2019s business is going really well, they likely don\u2019t have time to do it themselves. You\u2019re now an integral extension of their team that helps them stay busy in their business while you work on it.<\/p>\n<p>So, with all of that out of the way, here are some ideas to get you started sharing your thought leadership.<\/p>\n<h4>Write engaging content in various forms<\/h4>\n<p>The easiest way to get started with thought leadership is just to write. Everyone can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/09\/how-to-write-a-blog-post#:~:text=Keep%20Sentences%20Short%20and%20Paragraphs%20Shorter&amp;text=It%27s%20a%20common%20mistake%20for,making%20your%20audience%27s%20job%20easier.\">write a blog post<\/a>, whether it\u2019s on a personal site, your agency site, or as a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/06\/21\/guest-posting-dos-donts\">guest blogger<\/a>. The same is true for ebooks or longer-form content like an industry <a href=\"https:\/\/www.link-assistant.com\/news\/top-search-engines.html\">report<\/a> or guide.<\/p>\n<p>Write about best practices, wins you\u2019ve had, frustrations, or your strategies. Find a niche that works for you and stick to it. There are tons of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-copywriting-tools\">tools<\/a> out there to help you get started with ideas, so do some quick Google searches and see what you can come up with.<\/p>\n<h4>Speak at industry events<\/h4>\n<p>Whether you focus on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/19\/agencies-sell-more-ppc\">PPC<\/a>, SEO, CRO, or some other alphabet soup, look up the shows in your industry and start pitching to them. In my experience, they\u2019re always looking for fresh faces with new ideas, so don\u2019t be shy about throwing all your ideas at them.<\/p>\n<h4>Start a podcast<\/h4>\n<p>Who doesn\u2019t have a podcast nowadays? It seems like there are tons out there, and you might think, \u201cI\u2019m too late to the game.\u201d Well, surprise again: you\u2019re not. You don\u2019t have to have a huge audience to see success and expand your customer base.<\/p>\n<p>How can you differentiate yourself? Do you want to focus on Google Ads or highlight landing page tests that worked or didn\u2019t work? Great! What about advertising in your specific industry or location? Also great. Find what works best for you and make it happen.<\/p>\n<h4>Post on social media<\/h4>\n<p>Many moons ago, I got my first job in PPC right out of college. After an upstart period, I wanted to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/12\/free-training-resources-for-agencies\">level up my skills<\/a>. At that time, the best place to go was Twitter (now X, but I\u2019m too old to call it that). Within a pretty short period of time, Matt Umbro started the first #ppcchat, and that really had a world of impact on my career.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/How-to-promote-my-digital-marketing-agency-wordstream-Twitter.webp\" alt=\"How to promote you digital marketing agency - PPC chat post on X (formerly twitter)\" width=\"524\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82497 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/How-to-promote-my-digital-marketing-agency-wordstream-Twitter.webp 524w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/How-to-promote-my-digital-marketing-agency-wordstream-Twitter-480x550.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 524px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Use #PPCchat on X to connect with other agency professionals.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I met so many people and learned new tactics, but I also started building out an entire timeline of posts that showed off my expertise at that time. More than once, potential clients reached out because they were trying to find an answer to a problem, and my X feed was the solution.<\/p>\n<p>We all know that social media <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/15\/youtube-algorithm\">algorithms<\/a> pay attention to our behaviors on other sites. So, if a business owner is looking for marketing services and they hit up the Instagram Explore page, it might not be a bad idea to have an Instagram feed full of helpful marketing nuggets for them to find.<\/p>\n<h4>Submit for industry awards<\/h4>\n<p>Remember those accolades I told you to show off on your website? Well, you have to submit to industry award shows to win an industry award. They don\u2019t just hand them out. Do some quick searching and see if there are awards for your specific industry or niche of services and apply to them. Then, if you happen to be good enough (and lucky enough) to win one, shout it out on your site!<\/p>\n<h4>Choose the right thought leadership topics<\/h4>\n<p>One last tip for this section before we jump into the next focal area. Make sure your thought leadership focuses on things you actually like doing.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t like Facebook Ads, you probably shouldn\u2019t write blogs or make a podcast about Facebook Ads, even if there\u2019s tons of potential traffic and interest around those terms. Remember, you\u2019re trying to articulate your expertise in an effort to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/01\/how-to-get-clients\">generate new business<\/a>. If you\u2019re shouting from the rooftops how good you are at Facebook, then you\u2019re going to generate new Facebook clients. Don\u2019t promote the aspects of your services that you don\u2019t enjoy doing!<\/p>\n<div id=\"build-and-leverage-your-networks\"><\/div>\n<h3>Build and leverage your networks<\/h3>\n<p>The previous section focused on promoting \u201cwhat you know,\u201d but this section is about growing and leveraging \u201cwho you know.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I mentioned getting started in #ppcchat early on. While that was helpful for client acquisition, it was 100 times as powerful for building out my network. I met folks there that have had immeasurable impacts on my life. Through this network, I found new jobs and a new business partner, made inroads to speaking at industry events, wrote for multiple industry publications, made friends all over the world, and so much more. How can you leverage your network to help market your agency?<\/p>\n<h4>Partner with non-competing agencies<\/h4>\n<p>Even if you fit into the jack-of-all-trades category, there\u2019s likely a company out there that works with the same types of clients you want to work with and that you could partner with.<\/p>\n<p>An easy example is a PPC firm partnering with an SEO shop. You two likely have a similar book of business, but your disciplines are complementary, not competitive. Finding a partner agency is a great way to build both of your shops. You can trade client referrals and work together on projects. Not only will you generate new business, but you\u2019ll also deliver well-rounded results for your clients.<\/p>\n<h4>Consider referral fees<\/h4>\n<p>I say \u201cconsider\u201d on this one because some folks really love referral fees while others do not. In my mind, both make sense.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/how-to-promote-your-digital-marketing-agency-wordstream-referrals-1.webp\" alt=\"How to promote you digital marketing agency - graph of top sources of clients.\" width=\"878\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82504 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/how-to-promote-your-digital-marketing-agency-wordstream-referrals-1.webp 878w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/how-to-promote-your-digital-marketing-agency-wordstream-referrals-1-480x328.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 878px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Referrals are by far the <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite2023AgencyIndustryReport.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_StateoftheAgency2023_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=2023SOTA&amp;utm_content=compare_pricing&amp;utm_term=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_StateoftheAgency2023_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incontent_links&amp;utm_content=2023SOTA\"><em>largest source<\/em><\/a><em> of new clients.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Referral fees are an amount of money (or a benefit) you give to someone who refers you to new clients. The added incentive to share your name can get you into conversations you might not otherwise have. I find these work well for people who may or may not have worked with you directly before, and they can be great to offer your employees as well.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, many people think referral fees create an inauthentic recommendation. If they\u2019re getting paid for suggesting that brand, or if the agency has to offer referral fees for new accounts, they might not be that great. These folks want the business to deliver great results to get the recommendation, not pay them.<\/p>\n<p>The thing is, there\u2019s no right or wrong answer on this one. Some people have very strong beliefs one way or the other, but neither is inherently better than the other, and each approach can work.<\/p>\n<h4>Collect customer reviews<\/h4>\n<p>Similar to the industry awards on your site, you can\u2019t <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/24\/customer-feedback\">share customer reviews<\/a> until you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/16\/get-more-google-reviews\">get customer reviews<\/a>. There are lots of software tools out there that can help you do this, but I\u2019ve also found a quick email can do the trick. Don\u2019t overcomplicate it.<\/p>\n<p>This first-hand account of working with you is great for your site and also helps to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/04\/client-retention-tips\">strengthen the relationship<\/a> with the client giving the review. Similar to the folks who want to refer out based on great work, customer reviews can give prospective clients an insider\u2019s opinion on your agency and help them decide if they should choose you or another shop.<\/p>\n<div id=\"deliver-great-results\"><\/div>\n<h3>Deliver amazing results<\/h3>\n<p>The last piece is a bit of a cheat, but I think it deserves its own section because it fuels all the others. If you deliver great results, you\u2019ll drive more business in one way or another.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re seeing great client results:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Share it on your website: <\/strong>Show off the awesome case studies you\u2019re seeing and build a compelling case for how you can help other businesses do the same.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Write, present, or talk about it:<\/strong> Write a guest blog for an industry publication that reaches a lot of folks. Submit a speaking proposal around your work and highlight your strategies at industry events. Start a podcast that discusses your approaches to the work and how you\u2019re hitting client KPIs.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ask for referrals:<\/strong> Your clients will be so pleased that they\u2019ll be happy to write you customer reviews and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/06\/referral-marketing\">refer you<\/a> to anyone looking for marketing help, whether you\u2019ve paid a referral fee or not.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Use these tactics to promote your digital marketing agency<\/h2>\n<p>Delivering great results for clients is hugely important, as evidenced by my last point. But if you\u2019re only thinking about the health of your client\u2019s businesses, who is thinking about the health of yours?<\/p>\n<p>Spend some time developing plans to expand your business. First, ensure you have a solid website for people to land on. Then, share your expertise and leverage your network to attract users to that site and eventually onto your client list.<\/p>\n<p>Here are several more resources you can use to get new clients and
