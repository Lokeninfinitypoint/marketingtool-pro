Maven &#8211; Use color psychology<\/h3>\n<p>Even though this might seem low-stakes, the colors that you choose for your website are important. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/12\/color-psychology-marketing\">Color psychology is a thing<\/a>. Take <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mavenclinic.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Maven&#8217;s<\/a> all-green website, for instance.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.apa.org\/monitor\/apr01\/greengood\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Research<\/a> suggests that the color green can have a psychological impact, improving pain and anxiety. Maven\u2019s monochromatic color palette seems intentional\u2014and like an excellent choice.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s good reason to put some thought into your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/03\/website-color-scheme\">website color scheme<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-maven.png\" alt=\"healthcare website design examples - maven\" width=\"720\" height=\"374\" class=\"size-full wp-image-68819 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-maven.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-maven-480x249.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>2. One Medical &#8211; Appeal to your audience&#8217;s values<\/h3>\n<p>In healthcare, knowing your patient is key. In <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/industries\/healthcare\/\">healthcare marketing<\/a>, it\u2019s knowing your audience.<\/p>\n<p>Take the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.onemedical.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">One Medical<\/a> homepage. The tagline promises a new experience, the young human faces in the photos suggest a pleasant experience and a sleek office, the copy emphasizes the all-hours access to medical advice, and the log in option in the nav bar underscores this. Plus, peep the soft green. The appeal to busy, connected Millennials is clear and consistent.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-one-medical.png\" alt=\"healthcare website design examples - one medical\" width=\"720\" height=\"386\" class=\"size-full wp-image-68818 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-one-medical.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-one-medical-480x257.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And One Medical knows that there\u2019s opportunity in doubling down: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.solutionreach.com\/rethinking-the-patient-provider-relationship\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">43%<\/a> of Millennials are likely to switch practices in the next few years.<\/p>\n<p>If you know your audience well enough to identify what they value, understand what their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/28\/pain-points\">pain points<\/a> are, and articulate how your offering is ideal for them, you\u2019ll be able to ensure your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/16\/website-design-trends\">website design<\/a> appeals to them directly. And keeps them returning to your site for more information and your practice for more appointments.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Mayo Clinic &#8211; Answer the why<\/h3>\n<p>There are so many searches for health-related questions because there are so many concerns. Whether it\u2019s a gut check about mixing meds when you have a cold or a search for more information about recent symptoms. But as a healthcare provider, your prospective patients have one pressing question: why choose you?<\/p>\n<p>So in addition to frequently asked questions and informational pages about your practice\u2019s specialty, make it loud and clear right off the bat why you&#8217;re the right choice for your patients.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mayo Clinic<\/a> does this really well right beneath its hero image.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-mayo-clinic.png\" alt=\"healthcare website design examples - mayo clinic\" width=\"700\" height=\"745\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69244 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-mayo-clinic.png 700w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-mayo-clinic-480x511.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This highlights more information on the clinic\u2014its research, its approach, its expertise, and its impact.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Synergy Private Health &#8211; Use faces<\/h3>\n<p>People like seeing other people, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/221513968_Are_people_drawn_to_faces_on_webpages\">research<\/a> supports this. When users are viewing a page with human faces, their eyes are naturally drawn to the people in the images.<\/p>\n<p>If you do it right, using photos humanizes the experience and encourages trust. The most important thing is to avoid stiff stock photos and instead feature personal images. If you can include the health care providers, that\u2019s even better.<\/p>\n<p>Take a look. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.synergyprivatehealth.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Synergy Private Health&#8217;s<\/a> hero section contains a rotating gallery of images. The sleek office space, patients at home cooking, a calming exam room, and the practice\u2019s two doctors.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-synergy.png\" alt=\"healthcare website design examples - synergy private practice\" width=\"720\" height=\"370\" class=\"size-full wp-image-68820 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-synergy.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-synergy-480x247.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>These two doctors look welcoming and professional, especially at the front desk of the practice. Plus, the copy\u2019s first-person plural emphasizes the effect, as though the doctors are speaking directly to the prospective patients. That&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/05\/conversational-tone\">conversational copywriting<\/a> done right! Well done.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Brightside Health &#8211; Stay consistent with your CTAs<\/h3>\n<p>When you\u2019re working on your healthcare website design, you need to prioritize functionality, too. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zippia.com\/advice\/appointment-scheduling-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">67%<\/a> of patients prefer online booking. This isn\u2019t a surprise\u2014when it\u2019s a routine appointment or something awkward to get into over the phone, online booking makes the process painless.<\/p>\n<p>So you need to make sure you can offer that simple, painless experience to your patients or prospective patients.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightside.com\/homepage-therapy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brightside Health<\/a> makes this easy with design. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/13\/call-to-action-examples\">call to action<\/a> is \u201cStart With A Free Assessment,\u201d and this appears in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/27\/website-header-examples\">website header<\/a> as well as the hero section with a contrasting, but not overwhelming peachy color.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-brightside.png\" alt=\"healthcare website design examples - brightside health\" width=\"720\" height=\"377\" class=\"size-full wp-image-68829 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-brightside.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-brightside-480x251.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Keep the design for your online booking CTA\u2014including color, placement, and process\u2014consistent.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p>\ud83d\udce3 Speaking of CTAs&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Free guide: <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The 36 Best Call to Action Phrases Ever<\/a><\/strong><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h3>6. Simple Practice &#8211; Include reviews &amp; stars<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re a marketer, you probably know how valuable positive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">online reviews<\/a> are for any business, and how detrimental bad reviews can be.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s because so many of us turn to online reviews of a product or service before committing. The same is true for healthcare. In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.softwareadvice.com\/resources\/how-patients-use-online-reviews\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">94%<\/a> of healthcare patients use online reviews to evaluate providers.<\/p>\n<p>Now, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.simplepractice.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Simple Practice<\/a> is a little different. This isn\u2019t a healthcare provider, but a service provider for healthcare. Still, the website design is awesome, and it\u2019s the best way to make the reviews visually appealing and easily accessible that I\u2019ve seen.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-simplepractice.png\" alt=\"healthcare website design examples - simplepractice\" width=\"720\" height=\"364\" class=\"size-full wp-image-68823 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-simplepractice.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-simplepractice-480x243.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The stars and the number for the 2,000+ great reviews are subtle underneath the form, and they are provided in line with HIPAA and HITRUST compliance badges. Even better, they\u2019re clickable, and take you to a page with dozens of personalized text and video reviews.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Northwestern Medicine &#8211; Include your pandemic guidelines<\/h3>\n<p>Even though we thankfully have vaccines and a much better understanding of how to prevent and treat the illness, we\u2019re still living with the Covid-19 pandemic. Your office still has pandemic-specific guidelines, and many of your patients want to know about them.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-northwestern.png\" alt=\"healthcare website design examples - northwestern\" width=\"720\" height=\"356\" class=\"size-full wp-image-68827 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-northwestern.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-northwestern-480x237.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Including a tab or a prominent banner, like in the example from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nm.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Northwestern Medicine<\/a> below, gives your patients and potential patients easy access to this information. And providing your approach and policies gives peace of mind that it\u2019s a priority.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Virtua Health &#8211; Cater to prospective\u00a0<em>and<\/em> current patients<\/h3>\n<p>When you\u2019re thinking of website design, it\u2019s natural to consider the needs of prospective patients first. But don\u2019t forget that your existing and returning patients will use the website frequently, too. It should be clear that it serves them, as well.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.virtua.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Virtua Health<\/a> provides its patients with a few quick ways to access all the information they need with the MyChart and Telehealth links in the top nav, as well as the drop-down \u201cPatient Tools\u201d option.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-virtua.png\" alt=\"healthcare website design examples - virtua\" width=\"720\" height=\"355\" class=\"size-full wp-image-68826 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-virtua.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-virtua-480x237.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Plus, the intro copy for the chatbot is purposely vague. The offer to schedule appointments or answer questions works for both existing and new patients.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Dr. Rachel Paul &#8211; Celebrate your celebrity<\/h3>\n<p>Reviews, photos of people, and explanations of your expertise and approach are all great for encouraging your website visitors to be assured that the care your practice provides is top-notch. But it\u2019s not the only <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/27\/trust-signals\">trust signal <\/a>you have at your disposal for healthcare website design.<\/p>\n<p>Take <a href=\"https:\/\/www.collegenutritionist.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Rachel Paul&#8217;s website<\/a>. The nutritionist has a sizable following on <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/healthcare-social-media-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media<\/a>, so linking these Instagram and Tik Tok accounts prominently in the nav presents a cohesive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/01\/brand-strategy\">brand identity<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-rachel-paul.png\" alt=\"healthcare website design examples - dr. rachel paul\" width=\"720\" height=\"414\" class=\"size-full wp-image-68822 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-rachel-paul.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-rachel-paul-480x276.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Farther down the page, the website features logos from all of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/04\/how-to-write-a-press-release\">press<\/a> the nutritionist has received.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-social-signals.png\" alt=\"healthcare website design examples - social signals\" width=\"720\" height=\"217\" class=\"size-full wp-image-68828 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-social-signals.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-social-signals-480x145.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>These logos are recognizable, which means they\u2019re a great way to build trust. If you have the opportunity to point to similar press or achievements, use this on your website.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Mass General Bringham &#8211; Let the numbers speak<\/h3>\n<p>Another great trust signal that takes longer, but is much simpler: Numbers.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.massgeneralbrigham.org\/en\">Mass General Bringham<\/a> celebrates its extensive network of providers, significant funding, innovative research, and vast number of annual patients on its homepage to show patients just how experienced the organization is.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-brigham.png\" alt=\"healthcare website design examples - brigham\" width=\"720\" height=\"355\" class=\"size-full wp-image-68825 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-brigham.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-brigham-480x237.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Even if your practice is much smaller, you might have some impressive numbers to use on your website.<\/p>\n<h3>11. Hartford Healthcare &#8211; Animate your homepage with a video<\/h3>\n<p>Featuring real people in your photographs is an excellent way to humanize your brand. If it\u2019s possible, video can be similarly effective for capturing the experience at your practice, allowing your healthcare providers to speak directly to your potential patients, or showcasing the results of working with your practice.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s this last method that <a href=\"https:\/\/hartfordhealthcare.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hartford Healthcare<\/a> uses in the video on its homepage.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-hartford.png\" alt=\"healthcare website design examples - hartford healthcare\" width=\"720\" height=\"391\" class=\"size-full wp-image-68831 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-hartford.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/healthcare-website-design-examples-hartford-480x261.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The video showcases four healthy adults riding bikes on a picture-perfect trail in the woods.

The Lasik Vision Institute &#8211; Make it easy to find you<\/h3>\n<p>Not every visit to your website will lead to a new patient. But you need to make it as easy as possible for any visitor to become a patient.<\/p>\n<p>The best way to do this is to ensure that it is easy and practical to find and contact your office, or office(s).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lasikvisioninstitute.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Lasik Vision Institute <\/a>is a great example of this, since it\u2019s a national chain of providers.
