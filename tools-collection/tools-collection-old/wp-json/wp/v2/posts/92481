Use a full(er) funnel approach to conversion tracking<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019re going to start at the most foundational part of a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/are-google-ads-worth-it\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">campaign in Google Ads<\/a>: the campaign objectives and goals.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest challenge I\u2019ve seen with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-audit-pmax-display-video\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PMax campaigns for lead gen<\/a> is that they can definitely generate leads. The problem is that some of the leads are straight up crap.<\/p>\n<p>While it\u2019s true that you\u2019ll need to technically generate leads with PMax to build a funnel, it\u2019s a simple but important distinction to make the goal of the campaign something other than those form fills that correlate with leads.<\/p>\n<p>The better approach is to set your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-performance-max\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PMax campaigns<\/a> to optimize for a qualified lead, or some other action that\u2019s further down the funnel than the initial lead itself.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/google-ads-pmax-lead-generation-conversion-funnel.webp\" alt=\"pmax lead generation - conversion funnel\" width=\"823\" height=\"410\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92487 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/google-ads-pmax-lead-generation-conversion-funnel.webp 823w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/google-ads-pmax-lead-generation-conversion-funnel-480x239.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 823px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To do this, you\u2019ll need to use some combination of enhanced conversions and offline conversion imports from your CRM.<\/p>\n<p>This process can be a bit finicky to set up, but it will really pay off in the end. The outcome will be a Performance Max campaign that uses Google Ads\u2019 machine learning to generate qualified leads for your business.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-conversion-funnel.webp\" alt=\"pmax lead generation - enhanced conversions\" width=\"773\" height=\"477\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92483 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-conversion-funnel.webp 773w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-conversion-funnel-480x296.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 773px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"audience-signals-buyer-funnel\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Use audience signals that match the buyer funnel<\/h3>\n<p>Similar to choosing a performance goal that\u2019s further down the funnel, we can also leverage audience signals that are further down the funnel.<\/p>\n<p>With Performance Max campaigns, Google will start by targeting the audiences you provide it, then extend beyond those lists once it feels like it has a good understanding of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">target audience<\/a> and can find similar users who are likely to complete your given campaign goal.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-audience-data.webp\" alt=\"google ads pmax -lead generation audience targets\" width=\"806\" height=\"447\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92490 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-audience-data.webp 806w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-audience-data-480x266.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 806px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To help them find higher-quality users who are more likely to convert on your down funnel actions, you should give it as qualified an audience as possible. Website visitors and lead form submissions aren\u2019t enough.<\/p>\n<p>Use your customer lists, qualified form fills, opportunities, and lost contracts. Yes, even lost contracts are qualified. They got all the way to the final stages of your sales cycle, so my guess is you wouldn\u2019t mind having more of them.<\/p>\n<p>Although there are lots of options you can choose from in the preset Google audiences like In-Market, Life Events, and Detailed Demographics, for the most part, I find these to be too broad for lead gen companies trying to drive high-quality leads. Like most things Google develops, they can be excellent for ecommerce, but lead gen is just a different beast. I\u2019d recommend sticking to your own audiences with PMax.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-audience-options.webp\" alt=\"google ads performance max - lead generation\" width=\"863\" height=\"354\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92489 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-audience-options.webp 863w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-audience-options-480x197.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 863px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"search-themes-buyer-behavior\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Leverage search themes based on buyer behavior<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/11\/search-themes-for-performance-max-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Search themes<\/a> operate similarly to keywords in search, but not exactly the same. They help guide Google to certain themes your audience may search. They have the same prioritization as phrase and broad match terms in Search campaigns, but will be outranked by your exact match keywords.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-search-themes-1024x221.webp\" alt=\"google ads performance max - search themes\" width=\"1024\" height=\"221\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92488 size-large\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-search-themes-1024x221.webp 1024w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-search-themes-980x211.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/google-ads-performance-max-search-themes-480x103.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For this reason, have a robust <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/offset-lower-website-traffic\">search account set up<\/a> with exact match terms in place. Not just phrase and broad, even though Google prefers them. Let your Search campaigns tackle the exact match versions of your keywords, even if it will be to the detriment of PMax performance.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, use PMax to find incremental conversions (remember, those high-quality, bottom-funnel conversions).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/google-ads-pmax-bidding-priority.webp\" alt=\"google ads pmax - bidding priority\" width=\"793\" height=\"451\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92493 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/google-ads-pmax-bidding-priority.webp 793w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/google-ads-pmax-bidding-priority-480x273.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 793px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To do this with search themes, create tightly themed asset groups, just like you would with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keywords in search<\/a>. Too often, advertisers will throw all their high-volume keywords into a single asset group, no themes included, and hope for the best.<\/p>\n<p>With tightly themed groups, you\u2019ll have a narrower focus for Google to go off of and have a better chance of finding the right type of users when they&#8217;re in the right state of mind.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span data-contrast=\"auto\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" lang=\"EN-US\" class=\"TextRun SCXW72712104 BCX0\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW72712104 BCX0\">\u26a1<span class=\"EOP SCXW72712104 BCX0\" data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> Could you be getting more out of your Google Ads PMax campaigns?<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/strong> Find out with an instant account report from our free <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads Grader<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"negative-keywords-low-quality\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Use negative keywords to exclude low-quality users<\/h3>\n<p>Google didn\u2019t have negative keywords in the initial version of PMax. Since then, they\u2019ve slowly rolled out increasing options for negative keywords. As of early 2025, advertisers now have the ability to add up to 1,000 negative keywords at the campaign level to a PMax campaign, giving quite a bit of control over which search terms you show for.<\/p>\n<p>To generate high-quality leads with PMax, there\u2019s a simple rule: take full advantage of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/06\/negative-keyword-guide\">negative keywords<\/a>. This includes all of the regular, foundational negatives you likely have in your existing Search campaigns (read: the ones that are irrelevant to your business), but it also should include relevant, but lower quality queries. Make sure you\u2019re focusing on the users with high intent and excluding those who are just window shoppers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/google-ads-negative-keywords-.webp\" alt=\"google ads performance max lead generation - negative keywords\" width=\"707\" height=\"623\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92491 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/google-ads-negative-keywords-.webp 707w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/google-ads-negative-keywords--480x423.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 707px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"asset-groups-personas\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Treat asset groups like personas on LinkedIn or Meta<\/h3>\n<p>PMax campaigns operate similarly to a social media campaign in that they have a broad network reach, and each asset group houses a different set of audiences and contextual targets. Put that structure to work, similar to how you would in LinkedIn or Meta Ads.<\/p>\n<p>Use each asset group as a different persona: have the proper audience signals that align with those users, layer in any specific demographics or interests that match, include the proper <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/11\/search-themes-for-performance-max-campaigns\">search themes<\/a> they would be looking for (make a couple asset groups to target drastically different search themes if you need to), and tailor the creative assets to the messaging that would resonate best with this specific persona.<\/p>\n<p>If need be, you can use Google\u2019s AI tools to help you develop creative assets based on your website. There have been some great advancements in how this works, and it can help you better tailor your asset groups to each persona without taxing your design department too heavily. There\u2019s even a portion for brand guidelines below where you can control your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/small-business-logo\">logos<\/a>, color schemes, and more.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/google-ads-pmax-asset-generation.jpg\" alt=\"google ads pmax asset generation\" width=\"835\" height=\"357\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92486 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/google-ads-pmax-asset-generation.jpg 835w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/google-ads-pmax-asset-generation-480x205.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 835px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Turn your Performance Max campaign into a lead-generating powerhouse<\/h2>\n<p>While high-quality lead generation can be tough with Performance Max right out of the box, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s impossible.
