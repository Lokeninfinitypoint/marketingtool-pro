Unlike other platforms like Facebook, there\u2019s no option for reserve buying or target points.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/14\/how-does-google-ads-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads<\/a>, LinkedIn comes up with an ad rank each time there\u2019s an auction, and the advertiser with the highest ad rank ends up in the space.<\/p>\n<p>The<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/25\/optimize-linkedin-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> LinkedIn ads ad rank<\/a> is made up of two metrics: your bid value and relevancy score. The bid value is pretty straightforward. The more you\u2019re willing to bid on your LinkedIn ads, the higher you\u2019ll be able to push your ad rank.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linked-ads-cost-auction-formula.webp\" alt=\"linkedin ads cost - linkedin ads auction formula\" width=\"635\" height=\"157\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85864 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linked-ads-cost-auction-formula.webp 635w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linked-ads-cost-auction-formula-480x119.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 635px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ll talk more about bidding in a future section, so for now, let&#8217;s focus on the relevancy score portion. The relevancy score for your ads is made up of a few different factors including your audience targeting, your bidding and budget settings, and your predicted response rate, which is a machine-learning estimate of how likely it is that a given user will engage with your ad. Basically, it&#8217;s a &#8220;predicted click-through rate.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>If you end up being the advertiser with the winning combination of these factors, your ad will be the one shown to the user.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-cost-auction-graphic.webp\" alt=\"linkedin ads cost - auction graphic\" width=\"596\" height=\"325\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85861 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-cost-auction-graphic.webp 596w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-cost-auction-graphic-480x262.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 596px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83c\udf31 Make a plan to grow your business on LinkedIn<\/strong> using our free, easy-to-use <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite7StepstoGrowthStrategy.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_GrowthStrategy_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">growth strategy template<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"linkedin-ads-cost-controls\"><\/div>\n<h2>Advertiser controls for LinkedIn ads costs<\/h2>\n<p>Now that we have those fundamentals out of the way, let\u2019s focus on the controls you have when it comes to your LinkedIn ads cost.<\/p>\n<div id=\"linkedin-ads-budget\"><\/div>\n<h3>How to control your LinkedIn ads cost with your budget<\/h3>\n<p>The first option you have to influence your spending on LinkedIn is to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-budget\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">control your budget<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ad-costs-budget.webp\" alt=\"linkedin ads - budget controls\" width=\"535\" height=\"201\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85863 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ad-costs-budget.webp 535w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ad-costs-budget-480x180.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 535px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Each time you create a campaign, you\u2019ll have three options for budgeting:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set both a daily and lifetime budget<\/li>\n<li>Set a daily budget<\/li>\n<li>Set a lifetime budget<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As you can see in the image above, the default is a daily budget, which is a fairly common option.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-cost-campaign-scheduling.webp\" alt=\"linked ads - campaign budget schedules\" width=\"715\" height=\"569\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85865 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-cost-campaign-scheduling.webp 715w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-cost-campaign-scheduling-480x382.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 715px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>With a daily budget, you provide an amount you want to spend per day, and LinkedIn will pace you out to spend that amount, on average, through a given time frame depending on your schedule.<\/p>\n<p>For a continuous schedule, meaning a campaign with no end date, this is a virtual week that runs from Monday through Sunday. Since you\u2019re averaging out to a daily amount, LinkedIn also specifies that you\u2019re able to spend up to 50% over your daily budget on any given day, but you\u2019ll land at the average daily amount for that week.<\/p>\n<p>For a campaign with a set schedule, meaning you have an end date included, the campaign can still sometimes spend more than 50% of your daily budget, but you\u2019ll average the daily cost at your set budget for the entire schedule.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-costs-budget-scheduling.webp\" alt=\"how much do linkedin ads cost - busget schedules\" width=\"771\" height=\"445\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85860 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-costs-budget-scheduling.webp 771w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-costs-budget-scheduling-480x277.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 771px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Lifetime budgets are a little more straightforward. You provide the date range for your campaign to run and the total amount you want to spend and LinkedIn will take care of the rest. Again, the daily costs will fluctuate based on performance opportunities, but the total will never exceed your set budget.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-costs-budget-schedule-option.webp\" alt=\"linkedin ads cost - campaign budget schedule types\" width=\"779\" height=\"491\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85858 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-costs-budget-schedule-option.webp 779w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-costs-budget-schedule-option-480x303.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 779px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The last option is actually the first in the dropdown: set both a daily and lifetime budget. This option combines the two above and lets you set the total amount of money spent on the campaign and direct your daily costs. LinkedIn is still able to spend upwards of 50% over your daily caps but won\u2019t exceed the total budget. Using this option also doesn\u2019t allow for an ad schedule, meaning you can\u2019t set an end date. Your campaign will simply turn off once it\u2019s out of budget.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on what your goals are for your campaigns and how your budget is allocated to you, there\u2019s likely an option for these settings that works best for you.<\/p>\n<div id=\"linkedin-ads-bidding\"><\/div>\n<h3>How to control your LinkedIn ads cost with your bidding strategy<\/h3>\n<p>The second option for controlling LinkedIn ads costs will be with your bid strategy. There are going to be three options you can choose from for your campaigns\u2014which are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maximum Delivery<\/li>\n<li>Cost Cap<\/li>\n<li>Manual Bidding<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-bidding-strategies-linkedin-chart.jpg\" alt=\"linkedin ads bidding - chart of all linkedin bidding strategies\" width=\"842\" height=\"515\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85482 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-bidding-strategies-linkedin-chart.jpg 842w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-bidding-strategies-linkedin-chart-480x294.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 842px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Depending on the campaign objective you choose, you may or may not have the option for cost cap or manual bidding, but maximum delivery will always be an option.<\/p>\n<p>As a quick overview, here\u2019s roughly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/linkedin-ads-bidding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how each LinkedIn ads bidding strategy works<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Maximum delivery<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>This is a fully automated bid strategy (meaning you have no input) where LinkedIn will set your bids for you and use machine learning to try to deliver as many results as possible while also trying to spend your full budget every day. Using the full budget here means it will follow the settings you have in place from the previous section, but again, can go up to 50% over a daily budget on a given calendar day.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-bidding-strategies.webp\" alt=\"linkedin ads bidding - maximum delivery\" width=\"875\" height=\"217\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85477 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-bidding-strategies.webp 875w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/linkedin-ads-bidding-strategies-480x119.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 875px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This strategy is always selected for you by default. My biggest issue here is the \u201cspend your full budget every day\u201d part. Unfortunately, LinkedIn\u2019s machine learning isn\u2019t quite as strong as Google&#8217;s or Meta\u2019s, so while it might be doing its best, I\u2019ve found that campaigns using Maximum Delivery for certain accounts can struggle to hit what we need the campaign performance to be profitable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Maximum delivery&#8217;s impact on LinkedIn ads cost: <\/strong>Your campaigns will pretty much always spend your full daily or lifetime budget, so whatever you\u2019ve set for those settings, that\u2019s how much you\u2019ll spend. This is the easiest bid strategy to estimate costs for.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Cost cap<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Cost Cap is also an automated bid strategy, but you provide a target cost per result you want the campaigns to hit and LinkedIn will try to deliver results to you at that rate. There\u2019s no guarantee it can hit the numbers you provide and each conversion may vary in CPA.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cost cap&#8217;s impact on LinkedIn ads cost: <\/strong>If your campaigns are hitting the Cost Cap you have set, meaning you have your Cost Cap set to $75 and your cost per result is $75 or lower, you\u2019ll likely spend your entire daily and\/or lifetime budget. If you\u2019re not hitting that Cost Cap number, you\u2019ll likely be below your full budget and if this low performance drags on too long, LinkedIn will likely throttle your campaigns down all the way to where they stop serving altogether, clearly not spending your budget.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Manual bidding<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>With manual bidding, you have full control. You set the bid level for your campaigns and that\u2019s the maximum amount you\u2019ll pay for the specific action you\u2019re bidding for. In some campaigns, this will be by click, in others, the CPM.<\/p>\n<p>From a very high level, I\u2019ve always favored the manual bidding option for my campaigns, but that doesn\u2019t mean that a different strategy won\u2019t work for you. At this point, it\u2019s better for me to direct you to an outside resource that walks through the intricacies of all the bid strategies rather than espouse one over the other. Each account (and campaign) is different, so <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8tZPZD3pl_A\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this video<\/a> will help you decide which bidding strategy could work best for you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Manual bidding&#8217;s impact on LinkedIn ads costs: <\/strong>With Manual Bidding, you set how competitive you want to be. Like Cost Cap, this is a tough one to figure out how much you\u2019ll spend, but LinkedIn does give us a little help here.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/how-much-do-linkedin-ads-cost.webp\" alt=\"how much do linkedin ads cost - cost estimate in campaign settings\" width=\"999\" height=\"427\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85859 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/how-much-do-linkedin-ads-cost.webp 999w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/how-much-do-linkedin-ads-cost-980x419.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/how-much-do-linkedin-ads-cost-480x205.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 999px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Each time you set a manual bid, LinkedIn provides you with a suggested range for that bid, as well as estimated performance based on the bid you have set.<\/p>\n<p>In the image above, the suggested bid range is just below the bid I set on the left and the estimated performance is on the right. These are by no means promised metrics, but you can get an estimate of your LinkedIn Ads costs (and other stats) from this table. The higher your bid, the more you\u2019ll spend (within your budget settings) and the lower your bid, the less you\u2019ll spend.<\/p>\n<h2>How much your LinkedIn ads cost is up to you<\/h2>\n<p>You can control how much you spend on LinkedIn (and how fast you spend) using the right budget and bid strategy mix, but it\u2019s impossible to know exactly how much you\u2019ll spend without just doing it.<\/p>\n<p>The one thing I\u2019ll caution about, though, is that we don\u2019t have clear benchmarks for this platform like we do for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/2024-google-ads-benchmarks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/facebook-ads-benchmarks-2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook<\/a>. However, we did explain the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-vs-linkedin-ads\">differences between Google Ads and LinkedIn ads<\/a> here. On average, you can expect LinkedIn ads costs per click to be much higher than the other networks. It\u2019s the name of the game for the specificity in targeting, but now you know how the platform works and how you can use the settings at your disposal to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/linkedin-ads-audit\">control those costs<\/a> and see good results.<\/p>\n<p>For more help with LinkedIn ads, see how <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/marketing-services?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Demo_Blog_Demo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our solutions<\/a> can maximize your budget and ensure campaign success for the lowest cost on LinkedIn and beyond!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Find out how much LinkedIn ads cost, and get insights on how to control your LinkedIn ads costs using the right budget and bidding mix. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":114,"featured_media":85868,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[7],"tags":[],"dipi_cpt_category":[],"class_list":["post-85826","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-social-media"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v25.8 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>How Much Do LinkedIn Ads Cost?
