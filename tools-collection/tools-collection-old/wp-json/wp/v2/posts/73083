Here are some reasons why and how you can fix them.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>1. Your landing page isn\u2019t optimized for conversions<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The first place to look when your Facebook ads are not converting is your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/social-media-landing-page\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">landing page<\/a>. You could have the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/local-marketing-lab\/facebook-ads\/best-facebook-ads-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">best-performing Facebook ads<\/a> in the world, but if your website isn\u2019t optimized for conversions, you\u2019ll struggle to see results from your campaigns. When you see your Facebook ads are generating clicks but no conversions, you can assume something went wrong in that transition through your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-the-buyers-journey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">buyer\u2019s journey<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Try to put yourself in the shoes of your ideal customer. Compare your ad and your landing page side by side to ensure you\u2019re maintaining consistency in your messaging. You could also use a page speed test, mobile site test, or a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/localiq-grader?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">website grader tool<\/a> to ensure your site is loading fast and providing an optimal <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/29\/ux-conversion-rates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">user experience<\/a> across devices.<\/p>\n<p>Most importantly, check to see that the conversion actions you\u2019re looking for users to complete are clearly communicated on the page. Plus, all actions should be quick and easy to complete. Even if you\u2019re leveraging <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/local-marketing-lab\/facebook-ads\/facebook-lead-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook lead ads<\/a>, where a viewer doesn\u2019t have to click to a landing page to convert, you\u2019ll want a simple, short form to make conversions as easy as possible to achieve.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/SouthshoreDental\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This Facebook ad<\/a> and its coinciding landing page both promote the same offering:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/facebook-ads-not-converting-facebook-ad-to-LP.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"348\" height=\"650\" class=\"wp-image-73102 size-full aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/facebook-ads-not-converting-facebook-ad-to-LP.jpg 348w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/facebook-ads-not-converting-facebook-ad-to-LP-161x300.jpg 161w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/facebook-ads-not-converting-landing-page.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"742\" height=\"511\" class=\"wp-image-73103 size-full aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/facebook-ads-not-converting-landing-page.jpg 742w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/facebook-ads-not-converting-landing-page-480x331.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 742px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p><strong>Free guide<\/strong>&gt;&gt; Find more <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLFBFundamentals.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FacebookFundamentals_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fundamental Facebook advertising tips<\/a> every business should know here.<\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h3><strong>2.

Your ad copy is unclear <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>For every <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-run-facebook-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook ad you run<\/a>, it\u2019s important to have a clear action for your target audience to take.

You\u2019re targeting the wrong audience<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The people who you <em>think<\/em> would likely convert off your Facebook ads might be different from the people who will actually become customers of your business. It\u2019s important to understand your audience, what resonates with them, and the best way to reach them in order to drive more conversions from your Facebook ads.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While you may have done some initial research on your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/target-market-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">target market<\/a>, try to dig deeper and use a more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/29\/facebook-ad-targeting-strategies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">creative Facebook ads audience targeting strategy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/30\/higher-education-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing your higher education program<\/a> through Facebook ads, you may want to target people whose interests include entertainment like live events. Even though this interest doesn\u2019t directly connect with higher education, young adults looking to continue their education likely also enjoy going out to sports games or concerts.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>5. Ad fatigue <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I think we can all probably understand why <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/30\/ad-fatigue\">ad fatigue<\/a> might cause your Facebook ads to not convert. Have you ever seen the same ad over and over again to the point where you\u2019re sick of seeing it? The last thing you want is to oversaturate your target audience with the same Facebook ad.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You can check to see if this might be the case in your Facebook ads campaign or ad set report view. Select the delivery column option to see your frequency metric. Frequency is the estimated number of times your average audience member has seen your ad. The higher your Facebook ads frequency, the more often your audience members have seen your ads on more than one occasion.<\/p>\n<p>When your ad frequency creeps up to about 5 to 10, it&#8217;s usually time for an ad refresh. However, in situations where your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/facebook-ad-targeting\">targeting<\/a> is a bit more restricted, like if you were <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-remarketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">targeting a remarketing list<\/a>, a higher number for your ad frequency is more common.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/facebook-ads-not-converting-frequency.jpg\" alt=\"facebook ads not converting - ad frequency in facebook ads screenshot\" width=\"701\" height=\"398\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73094 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/facebook-ads-not-converting-frequency.jpg 701w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/facebook-ads-not-converting-frequency-480x273.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 701px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To avoid this Facebook ad conversion killer, try switching up your ad copy regularly once you see your frequency start to creep up. You could make small changes, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/11\/facebook-ab-testing\">A\/B testing<\/a> ad copy, creative, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/20\/call-to-action-buttons\">CTA buttons<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Another option to avoid a high ad frequency is to, of course, switch up your targeting so your ads appear to new users. It\u2019s best to have a variety of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/13\/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-world\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook ads targeting strategies<\/a> in your account. For example, you could serve one set of ads to a custom audience and another set to a behavior or interest-based audience. That way, you can trade off different types of ads to different people.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>6. Your campaign objective doesn\u2019t align with your goals<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Believe it or not, the Facebook ads algorithm can help you get your campaigns to convert. You just have to tell it what to do. Your campaign objective indicates to Facebook\u2019s machine learning how to best serve your ad.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If it helps, think of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/26\/facebook-objectives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook ads campaign objectives<\/a> like you would a Google Ads campaign goal or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/19\/google-ads-automated-bidding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads bidding strategy<\/a>. When you select your Facebook ads campaign objective, you\u2019re telling it what you want to optimize for. Facebook ads manager even states that \u201cyour campaign objective should align with your overall <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/15\/marketing-objectives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">business goals.<\/a>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There are tons of different campaign objectives to choose from, so there is no right or wrong answer as to which you end up with. However, it may take some trial and error with a few campaigns to see which objective brings you the most Facebook ads conversions.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/facebook-ads-not-converting-campaign-objective.jpg\" alt=\"facebook ads not converting - campaign objective options screenshot\" width=\"494\" height=\"670\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73095 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/facebook-ads-not-converting-campaign-objective.jpg 494w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/facebook-ads-not-converting-campaign-objective-480x651.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 494px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>7. Your budget or spending limit is set too low<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The common saying \u201cyou have to spend money to make money\u201d definitely applies to Facebook ads. While you want to keep your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/12\/facebook-ads-cost\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook ad costs<\/a> in check, you also don\u2019t want to limit your campaigns with tight budgets or strict spending limits that could cause your ads to not show.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re using Facebook ads daily budgets with a campaign spending limit, for example, you could run out of budget too quickly each day\u2014limiting your chances for conversions.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Facebook ads lifetime budgets can cause your campaign to run through its allotted budget before you\u2019ve maximized your conversion opportunities within a certain timeframe.<\/p>\n<p>You can usually tell this is the cause for a drop in conversions when your budgets and spend limits don\u2019t align with your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/local-marketing-lab\/facebook-ads\/facebook-ads-cost\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook ads average cost per click.<\/a> For example, if you have a $10 daily budget, and your average cost per click on Facebook ads is $2, you\u2019re only allowing yourself a few chances for someone to click and convert each day.<\/p>\n<p>I know having huge <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-budget\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing budgets<\/a> allocated to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/facebook-ads-cost\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook ads<\/a> isn\u2019t always feasible, and that\u2019s okay! However, it\u2019s best to have flexibility with your Facebook ads campaign budgets.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/facebook-ads-not-converting-spending-limit.jpg\" alt=\"facebook ads not converting - spending limit\" width=\"808\" height=\"477\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73096 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/facebook-ads-not-converting-spending-limit.jpg 808w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/facebook-ads-not-converting-spending-limit-480x283.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 808px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>8. You haven\u2019t given your ads enough time to convert<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I always joke that the hardest part of PPC is patience! Every Facebook ads campaign goes through a \u201clearning period\u201d as it begins to perform. During the learning period, the Facebook ads algorithm is testing how to serve your ad in different ways for maximized results. This can lead to a fluctuation in your results at first.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The length of your learning period can vary depending on what you\u2019re trying to achieve with your campaign. That said, the typical learning period is known to take up to two weeks. Ideally, I try to give campaigns up to 30 days to collect as much data as possible before I make a decision on what may or may not be working.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/facebook-ads-not-converting-learning-phase.png\" alt=\"facebook ads not converting - learning phase explanation in facebook ads\" width=\"742\" height=\"634\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73091 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/facebook-ads-not-converting-learning-phase.png 742w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/facebook-ads-not-converting-learning-phase-480x410.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 742px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.socialmediaexaminer.com\/how-to-exit-the-facebook-ads-learning-phase-quicker\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Aside from the learning period, you may find that you have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/26\/sales-cycle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">longer sales cycle<\/a>. This can, of course, cause your conversion rates to go down as your audience members may need to see an ad multiple times before they take the leap to become a lead. On top of this, we know that people need to see something from your business at least <a href=\"https:\/\/factorialhr.com\/blog\/the-rule-of-7\/#:~:text=marketing%20principle%20applies-,What%20is%20the%20rule%20of%207%3F,studios%20first%20coined%20the%20approach.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">seven times<\/a> before they commit to a purchasing decision.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>9. Your Facebook ads <em>are <\/em>converting&#8230;indirectly<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This last reason why your Facebook ads are not converting can be tricky to resolve, but it\u2019s helpful to be aware of.
