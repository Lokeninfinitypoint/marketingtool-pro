They&#8217;re the most diverse generation in American history<\/h3>\n<p>As you might know, Gen Zers are individuals born between 1996 and 2012. What might not be as well known is that they\u2019re the <strong>most diverse generation in American history<\/strong> in terms of ethnicity and race, predicted to become <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/social-trends\/2020\/05\/14\/on-the-cusp-of-adulthood-and-facing-an-uncertain-future-what-we-know-about-gen-z-so-far-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">majority nonwhite<\/a> by 2026.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/how-to-market-to-gen-z-characteristics-diversity.png\" alt=\"how to market to gen z - diversity characteristics of generation z\" width=\"720\" height=\"469\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63469\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/how-to-market-to-gen-z-characteristics-diversity.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/how-to-market-to-gen-z-characteristics-diversity-480x313.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>2. They aren&#8217;t lazy<\/h3>\n<p>Although the media often portrays them as not enthusiastic about work, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.census.gov\/topics\/employment\/labor-force.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics<\/a> reveals that around 7.3 million Gen Z individuals <strong>work full time i<\/strong>n the U.S. annually, plus 6.3 million are part-time employees.<\/p>\n<h3>3. They make up 40% of the global consumer population<\/h3>\n<p>No wonder Gen Z\u2019s spending power has <a href=\"https:\/\/genzplanet.com\/blog\/gen-z-spending-power-reached-360-billion-just-imagine-the-opportunities\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reached $360 billion<\/a>. They already account for<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/industries\/retail\/our-insights\/the-influence-of-woke-consumers-on-fashion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> 40% of global consumers<\/a> and are expected to make up <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insiderintelligence.com\/insights\/generation-z-facts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">over 41 million<\/a> of U.S. digital buyers by the end of 2022.<br \/>\n<a id=\"shopping\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Gen Z shopping habits<\/h2>\n<p>With Gen Z having such enormous spending power, one might ask how exactly this generation shops. Do they have a tendency to spend more or less than millennials? What makes them <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/23\/influence-buyers-marketing-psychology\">want to purchase something<\/a>? Here are some answers.<\/p>\n<h3>4. They have stable sources of income<\/h3>\n<p>When asked whether they have a stable source of income, <strong>over 70% of respondents answered yes<\/strong>. This is not to say the rest have no income at all. Just think about it: many Gen Zers are still students, so they rely on side hustles (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/12\/06\/small-business-ideas\">small business ideas here<\/a>) like reselling items, influencer work, or walking dogs to earn money. A lot of that income also goes into savings, whether investing in crypto or wiring the money into retirement accounts.<\/p>\n<h3>5. They\u2019re not impulsive buyers<\/h3>\n<p>So, how does Gen Z spend their dollars? Well, it might come as a surprise, but they are not impulsive buyers. Even though around 50% shop online monthly, the same percentage <strong>make a purchase when they need something<\/strong>, and 33% look for good deals and buy when there are sales.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/how-to-market-to-gen-z-statistics-buying-behavior.png\" alt=\"gen z characteristics - 80% not impulsive buyers\" width=\"629\" height=\"408\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-63476\" \/><\/p>\n<p>One explanation for this could be the 2008 financial crisis, during which Gen Zers witnessed their parents and families facing economic uncertainty, which eventually shaped their perception of money and protecting their income as they grew up. It goes to show that just because Gen Z found many smart ways to earn money, that doesn\u2019t mean they are quick to spend it on temporary joy.<\/p>\n<h3>6. They care about social responsibility<\/h3>\n<p>So, Gen Z is a diverse crowd with strong opinions on various social issues. Naturally, they want to purchase from brands that get involved in improving society. Whether that means encouraging recycling, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/28\/green-marketing\">protecting the environment<\/a>, or taking a stand on equality and racial justice, it\u2019s up to each brand. The important thing is to be genuine about it and commit to it wholeheartedly because if there\u2019s one thing that Gen Z can easily spot, it\u2019s fake activism and virtue signaling.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/how-to-market-to-gen-z-statistics-social-issues.png\" alt=\"gen z characterstics - 68% prefer brands with social change values\" width=\"705\" height=\"457\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-63475\" \/><br \/>\n<a id=\"social\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Gen Z social media usage &amp; preferences<\/h2>\n<p>This tech-savvy generation of consumers is used to being connected to the internet from an early age. It\u2019s obvious when looking at how they relate to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/social-media-marketing\">social media<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>7. They spend between 1-5 hours on social media per day<\/h3>\n<p>Most of the survey respondents spend 1- 5 hours per day on their feeds. Only around 11% of them spend less than one hour on social media.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/how-to-market-to-gen-z-social-media-usage.png\" alt=\"how to market to gen z - gen z social media usage stats - 76% spend 1-5 hours on social media\" width=\"720\" height=\"467\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63479\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/how-to-market-to-gen-z-social-media-usage.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/how-to-market-to-gen-z-social-media-usage-480x311.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>8. They use social media to research and buy<\/h3>\n<p>But keep in mind they don\u2019t just use social media to communicate and stay up to date with the latest news; they also use it to do research on products or brands and make purchase decisions. Countless studies have shown this, like this one depicted by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketingcharts.com\/brand-related\/brand-loyalty-117438\">Marketing Charts<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/gen-z-characteristics-use-of-social-media-for-brand-research.png\" alt=\"how to market to gen z - graph showing gen z purchase decisions are influenced by social media\" width=\"720\" height=\"437\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63482\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/gen-z-characteristics-use-of-social-media-for-brand-research.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/gen-z-characteristics-use-of-social-media-for-brand-research-480x291.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The downside of this is that their attention span is also shorter, meaning that your brand has a mere few seconds to make a lasting impression. You have to find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/01\/instagram-story-ideas\">extra creative ways<\/a> to use that very small window of time.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p>Side note, these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/26\/instagram-story-templates\">free and creative Instagram Story templates<\/a> might help you out with that.<\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h3>9. They favor YouTube, TikTok &amp; IG<\/h3>\n<p>YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram are the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/11\/most-popular-social-media-platforms\">most popular social media platforms<\/a> among Gen Z. It might be because they dabble in content creating themselves or because they consume twice as much video content as Millennials, and this is where they find it.<\/p>\n<p>That said, your business may want to look into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/03\/how-to-advertise-on-youtube\">YouTube ads<\/a> or organic YouTube content (<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/youtube-video-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lots of YouTube video ideas here<\/a>).<\/p>\n<h3>10. Facebook &amp; Snapchat are less popular<\/h3>\n<p>Snapchat and Facebook are less popular with Generation Z\u2014they still get used, but not as much as the frontrunners. These figures alone prove that, especially when it comes to Gen Z, investing time, money, and effort into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/18\/social-media-advertising\">social media advertising<\/a> should be a top priority for brands. After all, the first step to reaching <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">your target audience<\/a> is to be at the same place they are at.<br \/>\n<a id=\"marketing\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Marketing to Gen Z: What works &amp; what flops<\/h2>\n<p>Being online all the time, Gen Z is easily accessible, but that doesn\u2019t mean any type of advertisement easily sways them. Your business needs to put genuine effort into understanding their preferences.<\/p>\n<h3>11. Wokevertising flops \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffe<\/h3>\n<p>Stiff branded content and \u201cwokevertising\u201d have zero chances of winning over Gen Z. They want brands to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/05\/conversational-tone\">speak their language<\/a> and will reject any performative action. Being the first digital native generation of consumers, they&#8217;ve learned how to spot inauthenticity and will not hesitate to dismiss whatever comes across as fake, irrelevant, misleading, or disingenuous.<\/p>\n<h3>12. UGC works \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe<\/h3>\n<p>Instead, what does work, and what your business should have a go at, is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/13\/ugc-instagram\">user-generated content<\/a>, including that of influencers, as Gen Zers are more likely to form authentic connections with them.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/how-to-market-to-gen-z-user-generated-content-example.png\" alt=\"how to market to gen z - example of user generated content\" width=\"400\" height=\"704\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63483\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/how-to-market-to-gen-z-user-generated-content-example.png 400w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/how-to-market-to-gen-z-user-generated-content-example-170x300.png 170w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>An <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/02\/how-to-repost-on-instagram\">Instagram repost<\/a> of a repost of a repost&#8230;the ultimate UGC.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>13. Visually captivating ads work \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s all about trust with Gen Z, so they appreciate ads that are true to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/09\/company-core-values\">brand&#8217;s core values<\/a>. However, creative and visually captivating ads will also spark their interest.<\/p>\n<h3>14. Clickbaity ads flop \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb<\/h3>\n<p>On the flip side, Gen Zers dislike clickbaity ads or ads that are too long because they lack the patience to watch them. Disruptive ads are just as bad an idea and should be replaced by ads with a native feel.<\/p>\n<h3>15. Video AND static ads work \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd<\/h3>\n<p>When asked to choose between static and video ads, the responses were almost equally divided, which goes to show that both of these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/29\/ad-channels\">advertising channels<\/a> can work wonders if used right. Gen Z might consume more video content on social media, but they don\u2019t necessarily prefer video ads to static ones.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/how-to-market-to-gen-z-social-media-statistics-ads.png\" alt=\"how to market to gen z - gen z social media stats - video and static images preferred pretty equally\" width=\"671\" height=\"435\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-63478\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>16. TV &amp; print work too \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd<\/h3>\n<p>Still, the biggest surprise came when they revealed they still trust traditional advertising above other forms. TV and print are alive and kicking.<\/p>\n<h3>17. Personal data flops \ud83d\udc4e<\/h3>\n<p>Gen Z does not appreciate ads that rely on personal data. Let\u2019s be real, most of us don\u2019t, but the digital native consumers care more about their privacy than other generations. 60% of respondents would not give <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/customer-data\">personal data<\/a> for a more personalized experience, and 75% believe ads that rely on personal data are invasive.<\/p>\n<h3>18. Transparency works \ud83d\udc4d<\/h3>\n<p>This goes back to the importance of trust. If brands want Gen Z to trust them, they have to ease up on the use of personal data, or at the very least, commit to being completely transparent about it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/how-to-market-to-gen-z-statistics-personal-data.png\" alt=\"how to market to gen z - buying behavior stats - 60% not willing to give up personal data for personalized experience\" width=\"713\" height=\"462\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-63477\" \/><br \/>\n<a id=\"how\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>How to market to Gen Z: Key takeaways<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trust, trust, trust. <\/strong>Gen Z can recognize inauthenticity when they see it.
