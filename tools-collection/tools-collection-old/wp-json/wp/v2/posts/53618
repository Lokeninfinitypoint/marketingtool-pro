Here are the most important things to understand about this site authority metric.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span>1. Domain Authority is not a ranking factor<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>Although DA can help quantify ranking potential, it has no part in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/30\/google-algorithm-updates-2021\">Google\u2019s ranking algorithm<\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>This is why newer or smaller websites with lower Domain Authority scores\u2019 can still outrank competitors if they create <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/15\/quality-content-defined\">high-quality<\/a>, informative, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/29\/fresh-content-google-ranking-factor\">fresh<\/a>, and relevant content for users.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>However, some of the factors that Moz uses to calculate Domain Authority are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/09\/google-ranking-factors\">Google ranking factors<\/a>, like the number of linking root domains and number of linking pages. As a result, there is often a positive relationship between DA scores and other SEO performance indicators like keyword rankings, average position, and organic traffic.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span>2. Domain Authority is not the only site authority metric<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>Moz\u2019s Domain Authority is not the only site authority <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/27\/seo-metrics\">metric available to SEOs<\/a>. Other big SEO brands and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/09\/18\/best-keyword-research-tools\"> keyword research tools<\/a> with large link indexes have developed their own authority metrics.

The upward trend shows that the site authority metrics have a positive relationship with each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span> <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-to-increase-domain-authority-vs-domain-rating.jpg\" alt=\"how to increase domain authority - domain authority vs domain rating\" width=\"720\" height=\"455\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-53623\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-to-increase-domain-authority-vs-domain-rating.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-to-increase-domain-authority-vs-domain-rating-480x303.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>However, the data also shows that there are times when DA and DR scores can widely differ for the same domain. The group of domains where DA scores are significantly lower than DR scores may be because Ahrefs\u2019 considers both the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/link-building\">quality of links<\/a> and the authoritativeness of referring domains in its <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/domain-rating\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DR calculations<\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>So although DA is arguably the most widely used authority metric in the SEO industry, it is by no means the absolute truth of ranking potential. it\u2019s important to note that there are other ways to understand the health and ranking potential of your website beyond DA.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/localiq-grader?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Use LOCALiQ&#8217;s Free Website Grader to see if your site is optimized to rank.<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h3><span>3. Google&#8217;s PageRank is the original authority metric<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>Long before Domain Authority was on the SEO scene, Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/PageRank\">PageRank<\/a> was the original authority metric.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Google used to publicly display the PageRank of web pages in its toolbar, but because black-hat SEOs exploited that information to help their rankings, Google now keeps PageRank scores under lock and key. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Essentially, every time a page links to another, it passes along a portion of its PageRank (or link equity). That means that pages with lots of backlinks will pass along more PageRank than others. It looks something like this:<\/span><span>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-pagerank-works.gif\" alt=\"how google pagerank works\" width=\"595\" height=\"417\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-53630\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>Unlike Domain Authority, PageRank is actually a ranking factor that Google relies on when promoting web pages. So although Google no longer gives us direct insight into PageRank, site owners need to realize that every hyperlink is still passing along PageRank (or<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2010\/07\/15\/how-to-find-and-drain-link-juice\"> link juice<\/a>) throughout the internet. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span>4. Improving Domain Authority &amp; off-page SEO go hand-in-hand<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>Because the Domain Authority calculation primarily relies on backlinks, off-page SEO strategies like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/10\/link-building-secrets\">link building<\/a> and digital PR are really the only way to elevate site authority metrics like DA. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Although improving <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.co.uk\/blog\/what-is-on-page-seo-and-why-is-it-important-for-business\/\">on-page SEO<\/a> will always be a worthwhile endeavor for improving your relevance and quality in the eyes of Google, on-page optimizations won\u2019t directly influence your DA like backlinks will.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>However, with higher-quality content on your website, earning backlinks through<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/13\/off-page-seo\"> off-site strategies<\/a> will likely become far easier. In general with SEO, a multidisciplinary approach is likely to be more effective than relying on a single strategy on its own. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span>How to increase Domain Authority (safely)<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span>Because DA is calculated primarily through backlinks, off-site strategies like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/link-building\">link building<\/a> are the best way to try to improve your score. <\/span><span>But this is not as easy as it sounds, as we have no control over whether or not another website chooses to link to ours. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Also,<strong> some link-building strategies are considered \u201cblack-hat,\u201d<\/strong> meaning your website can be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/30\/google-penalty\">penalized by Google<\/a> if it appears to be paying for backlinks or engaging in spammy link practices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>But there are plenty of ways to safely increase the overall authority of your domain, and as a result, your DA scores. Below are some of my favorite <a href=\"https:\/\/linkgraph.io\/link-building-for-seo-guide-for-beginners-2021\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">link building strategies<\/a> because they are both effective and Google-compliant.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span>1.

Write great content<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>First and foremost, focus on making your content so good that other sites will discover and link to it naturally (think <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/12\/google-e-a-t\">E-A-T<\/a>). Write a great keyword-targeted post that ranks, and a blogger or business looking to write about that topic will discover your post in their research and <em>hopefully <\/em>link back to your site in their post. I say hopefully because if the information you&#8217;ve provided is common knowledge and there&#8217;s no way to prove that the writer got this information from your page, the less likely you are to get a citation.<\/p>\n<p>But if you share original research or a thought leadership piece on the topic\u2014something that is hard to replicate\u2014 the more likely you are to get that backlink. You can take this approach for high-volume keywords or super-niche topics. Just be sure to promote on social media to get more eyes on it.<\/p>\n<h3><span>3. Contribute guest posts<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>Contributing blog content, original research, or thought leadership to other relevant, high DA websites in your industry is also a great way to earn more backlinks to your website, and thus elevate your DA. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Publishers are always looking for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/07\/29\/great-content\">great content<\/a>, and if you provide that content for them, you not only elevate your brand expertise but will often earn a backlink to your website in the byline\u2014or even in the body of the post.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>To elevate your Domain Authority faster, seek out guest blogging opportunities in industry-specific publications that have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/topical-authority\">topical relevance<\/a> to your own.\u00a0<\/span><span>For example, the below chart shows the topical relevance of my own brand\u2019s website in comparison to one of our top competitors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span> <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-to-increase-domain-authority-category-vs-total-depth.png\" alt=\"how to increase domain authority - industry vs depth\" width=\"720\" height=\"309\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-53621\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-to-increase-domain-authority-category-vs-total-depth.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-to-increase-domain-authority-category-vs-total-depth-480x206.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span>Topical Relevance of Backlink Profiles as seen in <\/span><\/em><span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchatlas.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>SearchAtlas <\/em><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The majority of our competitor\u2019s backlinks come from websites related to Business and Technology. Because we want to elevate our Domain Authority to be higher than theirs, we focus on earning guest blogging opportunities from websites with the same topical relevance.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span>4. Invest in public relations<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>Having a public relations team can benefit any-sized business, but for enterprise-level brands, earning links in well-known publications is key to competing against other websites with really high Domain Authority scores.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>In terms of your overall brand awareness, press coverage that doesn\u2019t include a link can still have some positive SEO return because Google looks to off-site signals like brand mentions to understand your website\u2019s authority. But for raising DA specifically, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/07\/24\/follow-nofollow-links\">dofollow<\/a> links from top-tier publications will be what ultimately has an impact.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If you\u2019re a small or mid-sized business that doesn\u2019t have the resources for a PR team, consider signing up for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.helpareporter.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Help A Reporter Out (HARO)<\/a>. This service connects reporters to industry experts and can be a great way to earn high-quality linking opportunities.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span>5. Try broken link building<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>Although a more advanced strategy that will require the use of backlink tools, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/link-building-guide\/broken-link-building\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">broken link building<\/a> can help you find link opportunities to elevate your DA scores. The process is as follows:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span>Use a backlink analyzer tool to find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2010\/06\/02\/how-to-find-and-fix-broken-links\">broken links<\/a> on other websites.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span>Create content that can serve as a replacement for the missing resource (or identify that existing content on your website).<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span>Reach out to the editor and offer your content as a replacement.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><span>Other ways to use Domain Authority in your SEO strategy<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span>Beyond an authority flex, you can also use Domain Authority scores to develop a highly-targeted SEO campaign. The comparative nature of DA can help you set realistic goals and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/20\/seo-audit\">benchmark your own SEO performance<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span>1. Choose keywords according to DA<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>When it comes to choosing the right keyword targets, DA can be a useful metric for knowing whether or not your website can realistically compete with those pages already ranking on page one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>I recommend optimizing your web pages for keywords with a Keyword Difficulty score less than or equal to your Domain Authority.<\/strong> For example, if you want to rank for the keyword \u201ccoffee subscription boxes,\u201d it will likely take at least a DA of 60 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/19\/get-on-first-page-google\">to rank on the first page. <\/a><\/span><span>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/domain-authority-example-moz-serp-analysis.png\" alt=\"domain authority - moz serp analysis example\" width=\"600\" height=\"441\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-55534\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/domain-authority-example-moz-serp-analysis.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/domain-authority-example-moz-serp-analysis-480x353.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>This is not an absolute barometer, but it can be very helpful for identifying lower-competition keywords that will bring your website organic traffic in the short term while you build up your Domain Authority over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span>2. Identify your SEO priorities<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>Because DA is a comparative metric, one of the best ways to use the score is in thinking about your competition. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>For example, if your DA is already higher than your competitors, high-quality content alone will likely get you to page one. That means it would be better for your team to invest your resources in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/seo#_On-Page_Optimization\">on-page optimizations<\/a>, which are more affordable and can often be done in-house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The reality is, off-site SEO is usually more time, resource, and cost-intensive. If there is still a significant gap between your Domain Authority and your competitors, then being aggressive with your off-site strategy will be a must-do if you want to compete and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/17\/website-visibility\">make your website more visible on Google<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>3. Pay attention to Google&#8217;s guidelines<\/h3>\n<p>While Domain Authority isn&#8217;t an official ranking factor (again, it&#8217;s a Moz metric), it is a representation of two things that are: E-A-T and backlinks. In Backlinko&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/seo-this-year\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">guide to SEO in 2022<\/a>, Brian Dean points out that Google&#8217;s Quality Rater Guidelines says the creator of the main content plays a role in your ranking. This means making sure your blog authors are experts in the topic being covered and have bylines that say so, and that Google can learn as much about your website&#8217;s expertise and authority as possible through your about page, contact page, privacy policy, and terms of service.<\/p>\n<h2><span>Increase Domain Authority, improve your ranking<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span>In some ways, Domain Authority can feel like a bit of a status symbol in the world of SEO.
