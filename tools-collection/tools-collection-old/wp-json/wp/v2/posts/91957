It\u2019s simply your legal business name, and it must match either the name of the business as you have registered it with Google or your website domain. The challenge for some businesses is that you only have 25 characters, so depending on which source you\u2019re using and how long your business name is, you may need to use one or the other.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-business-name.webp\" alt=\"google ads assets - business name\" width=\"422\" height=\"379\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91976 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-business-name.webp 422w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-business-name-300x269.webp 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Business name assets can be applied to either the account or campaign level, so depending on how your account is set up and what you\u2019re advertising, you may need to use one versus the other.

Typically, this is an account-level setting, and it applies across all campaigns, resulting in a one-on-one process.<\/p>\n<div id=\"business-logo\"><\/div>\n<h3>Business logo<\/h3>\n<p>A<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/small-business-logo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> business logo<\/a> Google Ads asset is a small image that accompanies your ad, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/small-business-logo\">highlighting your logo<\/a>. This image needs to be square and should not contain any text. Just like the business name asset, logo assets can be added at the campaign or account level, but you can only have one at the account level.<\/p>\n<p>In the image below, the logo would be in the place of the green circle on both desktop and mobile.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-business-logo.webp\" alt=\"google ads asset - business logo\" width=\"852\" height=\"333\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91975 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-business-logo.webp 852w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-business-logo-480x188.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 852px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>While you can only have one asset at the account level, it may make sense to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/website-color-scheme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">change out the color scheme<\/a> every once in a while and see what performs best. Most companies have a dark version and a light version of their logo icon. That would be a great test to see if one or the other has an impact on performance.<\/p>\n<div id=\"sitelinks\"><\/div>\n<h3>Sitelinks<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/09\/06\/sitelink-extensions-dos-and-donts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sitelinks<\/a> are one of the most customizable assets you can have run with your ads, and, in my opinion, they&#8217;re non-negotiable for search campaigns. They\u2019re additional snippets of text you can use to enhance your ad, but they are also clickable and can send users to a different landing page on your site, depending on the content of the sitelink itself.<\/p>\n<p>Specifically, each time sitelinks are shown, you can only have one instance of a single landing page.<\/p>\n<p>So in the image below for Kohl\u2019s, each line starting at \u201cSave More With Clearance\u201d is a different sitelink, and each of them takes you to a different landing page. As you can see, these can gain you quite a bit of real estate on the SERPs.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-sitelinks.webp\" alt=\"google ads assets - sitelinks\" width=\"728\" height=\"624\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91974 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-sitelinks.webp 728w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-sitelinks-480x411.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 728px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When creating a new sitelink, Google gives you a headline of 25 characters, then two optional description lines of 35 characters each.

In the following image (even though they\u2019re blue and I\u2019ve never seen a callout be blue before\u2026this is from Google\u2019s help article, so\u2026I\u2019m running with it), the callouts are \u201cFree Shipping,\u201d \u201c24-7 Customer Service,\u201d and \u201cPrice Matching.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-callouts-1.webp\" alt=\"google ads assets - callouts\" width=\"850\" height=\"283\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91989 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-callouts-1.webp 850w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-callouts-1-480x160.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 850px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Pretty simple and straightforward.

Clearly, these have a little more guidance on them than callouts since there does have to be a header, but more often than not, I\u2019ll just choose the one that\u2019s most closely related to my client\u2019s business and run with it.<\/p>\n<div id=\"images\"><\/div>\n<h3>Image assets<\/h3>\n<p>Image assets are a relatively new type of asset to Google Ads and one that I think most folks overlook.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-image.webp\" alt=\"google ads assets - images \" width=\"389\" height=\"479\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91980 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-image.webp 389w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-image-244x300.webp 244w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>With image assets, you can provide Google with a handful of images that can accompany your search ads to make you stand out on the SERPs.<\/p>\n<p>The image specs are pretty straightforward, and you\u2019re able to add both square and landscape images to your account, campaign, or ad groups.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-image-specs.webp\" alt=\"google ads assets - images assets specifications\" width=\"705\" height=\"500\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91979 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-image-specs.webp 705w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-image-specs-480x340.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 705px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There are some limitations with image assets, namely the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>No text or graphic overlay<\/li>\n<li>The image cannot have too much blank space<\/li>\n<li>You cannot use a collage of images<\/li>\n<li>The image can\u2019t be blurry<\/li>\n<li>The image can\u2019t be visually skewed or warped<\/li>\n<li>Your crop cannot be messy<\/li>\n<li>No nudity or sexually suggestive images<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here are some ideas of images I like to use for different types of businesses:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Product shots<\/li>\n<li>People using a product or service<\/li>\n<li>People executing a service<\/li>\n<li>Photos of the company location<\/li>\n<li>Stock imagery from the company website<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"headlines-descriptions\"><\/div>\n<h3>Headlines and descriptions<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019ve grouped these together because they function the same way; they are just for different aspects of an ad.<\/p>\n<p>Headlines and description assets let you extend the options within your Responsive Search Ads in a campaign. Notice these cannot be added to the account or ad group level.<\/p>\n<p>With these assets, you provide Google with a headline or description that fits the normal character count (30 or 90 characters), you assign a pin location or leave that space blank, then Google will rotate that new asset in with all ads in the campaign.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-headlines-1.webp\" alt=\"google ads assets - headlines\" width=\"498\" height=\"411\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91990 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-headlines-1.webp 498w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-headlines-1-480x396.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 498px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you have a sale coming up and you want to use some promotional copy in your RSAs, but you don\u2019t want to adjust the search ad itself.

You can write your promotional copy as an asset, turn it live, and then see the performance for that individual asset after it&#8217;s run for a while.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest thing to watch out for here is your pinning strategy. If you\u2019ve pinned all your headlines in your Responsive Search Ads, and you don\u2019t pin this campaign-level headline extension, then it won\u2019t show at all. These assets honor the same pinning strategy as all other assets in your RSA, so make sure you\u2019re consistent with those controls.<\/p>\n<p>One last feature I find really great is that you can schedule headlines and descriptions, so if you want to include seasonal messaging or promotional text (which we\u2019ll talk about some other cool assets later), then you can schedule these assets to run during the needed time then turn off once they\u2019re finished.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-scheduling.png\" alt=\"google ads assets - asset scheduling\" width=\"621\" height=\"343\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92027 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-scheduling.png 621w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-scheduling-480x265.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 621px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here are some scenarios where headlines and descriptions might make sense:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Short-term promotional messaging<\/li>\n<li>Changing out seasonal messaging<\/li>\n<li>Testing different feature\/benefit statements<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"call\"><\/div>\n<h3>Call assets<\/h3>\n<p>Call assets are great for advertisers who want to get more phone calls to their business.

It probably makes sense to leave what they\u2019ve made.<\/p>\n<p>But if you\u2019re reading this blog post and you\u2019ve made it through all the asset types, my guess is you\u2019ll do a better job than Google will on your behalf.<\/p>\n<p>So to turn off automatically created assets, you\u2019ll need to jump through a couple hoops.<\/p>\n<p>First, click the three dots in the upper right portion of the data table, then click <strong>account-level automated assets<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-automatically-created-assets-settings.png\" alt=\"google ads automatically created assets - menu\" width=\"821\" height=\"367\" class=\"wp-image-92028 size-full aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-automatically-created-assets-settings.png 821w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-automatically-created-assets-settings-480x215.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 821px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Next, click the three dots in the same portion of the next screen and click<strong> advanced settings<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-advanced-settings.png\" alt=\"google ads automatically created assets - advanced settings\" width=\"955\" height=\"350\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92029 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-advanced-settings.png 955w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-advanced-settings-480x176.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 955px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In the image below, you can see all of the automated asset types Google can run for you.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-settings-automated.png\" alt=\"google ads automatically created assets menu\" width=\"795\" height=\"432\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92030 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-settings-automated.png 795w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-settings-automated-480x261.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 795px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Some of these I wouldn\u2019t recommend turning off because they aren\u2019t going to hurt anything.

As long as you have good ratings and reviews, this is a good one to keep on.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-seller-ratings.webp\" alt=\"google ads assets - seller ratings\" width=\"744\" height=\"321\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91996 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-seller-ratings.webp 744w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-assets-seller-ratings-480x207.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 744px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Longer headlines let your ads have longer variations of your headlines that could get more visibility in the SERPs.

Switch the toggle to Off, then click Save.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll notice there\u2019s a big ole warning message that pops up telling you this could hurt your performance. But that\u2019s OK. We both know you\u2019re going to do a great job.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on the user flow you get, after you click save, you\u2019ll have to give feedback to Google as to why you want to turn off this asset, and then you\u2019re in the clear.<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-assets-review-performance\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to review asset performance in Google Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Once your assets have been running for a while, it\u2019s time to review them and see how they\u2019re performing. Just like with ads, we should be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-audit\">regularly reviewing the performance of our assets<\/a>, pausing underperformers, iterating new variants, and testing them against our top performers.<\/p>\n<p>On the assets tab within Google Ads, you\u2019ll be able to see the performance for each of your assets, but it\u2019s important to know how to interpret the data in this report, as it\u2019s different from that in other reports.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-asset-performance.webp\" alt=\"google ads asset performance report\" width=\"900\" height=\"168\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91985 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-asset-performance.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-asset-performance-480x90.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Each stat will show the performance for your entire ad unit when that asset was shown. So in the image above, the sitelink we\u2019re seeing was associated with the account level and was shown in the ad unit for 3,122 impressions. Something in the ad unit was clicked 135 times for a 4.32% CTR, and three conversions were tracked.<\/p>\n<p>This report is NOT saying that this sitelink was clicked 135 times for a 4.32% CTR and generated three conversions directly. It is merely reporting that a component of the ad unit generated that performance.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to see the performance for the asset itself, you need to go to the <strong>segment<\/strong> option, then <strong>click type<\/strong>, and then you can see the data for this asset broken down more specifically.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-asset-proposal-request-1024x300.webp\" alt=\"google ads asset performance click type\" width=\"1024\" height=\"300\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92001 size-large\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-asset-proposal-request-1024x300.webp 1024w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-asset-proposal-request-980x287.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-asset-proposal-request-480x141.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here, the sitelink itself generated one click and zeo conversions, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not useful.<\/p>\n<p>Oftentimes, the impact of an ad asset is to lift the performance of the ad as a whole, not necessarily to generate the performance directly. So, as you\u2019re reviewing performance for your assets, it\u2019s best to compare how each asset is doing at a high level and not expect that each will drive the same performance as an ad unit will.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, it\u2019s important to only compare assets within a specific type. In the image below, you can see I have sitelinks, a callout, and a call extension all showing. The performance for each is quite different, but just based on some quick reviews, you may determine that the call extension is the best performer since it has the most conversions for the lowest cost.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-asset-report.webp\" alt=\"google ads asset report\" width=\"858\" height=\"227\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92000 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-asset-report.webp 858w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-asset-report-480x127.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 858px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But again, if we segment by click type, you can see the conversions didn\u2019t actually come from the call extension itself. Rather, just a headline click on the entire ad unit itself.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-asset-reporting.webp\" alt=\"google ads assets - measuring asset performance\" width=\"1013\" height=\"359\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91999 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-asset-reporting.webp 1013w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-asset-reporting-980x347.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-asset-reporting-480x170.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1013px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Additionally, what really compounds the problem is that these sitelinks, callouts, and call assets could have all been shown on multiple ads together.
