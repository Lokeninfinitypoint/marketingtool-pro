And how does it impact your website\u2019s ability to drive traffic?<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s dive in and see what E-E-A-T is all about.<\/p>\n<h2>Why should I care about E-E-A-T?<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to content quality, and how pages are ranked in the SERP (search engine results page), Google has been harping on Expertise, Authority, and Trust (or E-A-T) for quite some time. In fact, we can trace the origins of E-A-T all the way back to 2014, when Google added it to their <a href=\"http:\/\/static.googleusercontent.com\/media\/www.google.de\/de\/de\/insidesearch\/howsearchworks\/assets\/searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Search Quality Guidelines<\/a> under a section titled \u201cCharacteristics of High Quality Pages.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what Google said at the time about how SEOs and content creators should think about E-A-T:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cHigh E-A-T news articles should be produced with journalistic professionalism \u2013 they should contain factually accurate content presented in a way that helps users achieve a better understanding of events. High E-A-T news sources typically have published established editorial policies and robust review processes.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>While Google would later clarify that E-A-T was not, in fact, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/09\/google-ranking-factors\">ranking factor<\/a>, and while Google reps would even state that the concept seemed to carry more weight in the public domain than within the company itself, the August 2018 algorithm update, called the <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/googles-august-1st-core-update-week-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Medic Update, <\/a>specifically targeted sites that demonstrated low levels of E-A-T.<\/p>\n<p>And not only targeted them but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mariehaynes.com\/the-august-1-2018-google-update-strongly-affected-ymyl-sites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">really hammered them<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/EEAT-graph-traffic.jpg\" alt=\"Google eeat - graph of traffic loss\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73646 size-full\" width=\"935\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/EEAT-graph-traffic.jpg 935w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/EEAT-graph-traffic-480x206.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 935px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Ketodash.com had low levels of E-A-T at the time of the medic update, and as a result, got dinged pretty hard.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>When the Medic update hit, many in the SEO sphere realized that the sites that got hit hardest were those in the realm YMYL (Your Money or Your Life). In fact, Google had just recently updated their Search Quality Guidelines to define YMYL as:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/EEAT-standards-three.jpg\" alt=\"Google eeat - screenshot of Google's statement on YMYL topics\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73647 size-full\" width=\"936\" height=\"217\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/EEAT-standards-three.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/EEAT-standards-three-480x111.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In a nutshell, Google was making it clear that content covering topics with real-life stakes (evacuation routes for a tsunami, news about ongoing violence, information about purchasing prescription drugs, etc.) should display considerable levels of E-A-T, or risk losing rankings and traffic.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/EEAT-graphic.jpg\" alt=\"Google eeat - graphic showing EAT definitions\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73648 size-full\" width=\"681\" height=\"595\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/EEAT-graphic.jpg 681w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/EEAT-graphic-480x419.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 681px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>E-A-T = Expertise, Authority, and Trust<\/em><\/p>\n<p>And that\u2019s exactly what happened. This was an important distinction from Google\u2019s continuous assertion that it looks at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/09\/how-to-write-a-blog-post\"><em>content quality<\/em><\/a><em> above all<\/em> when ranking content. Not that <em>expertise<\/em> was now suddenly more important than quality. But that, when YMYL content was concerned, expertise, authority, and trust would act as second layers of defense against content that appeared qualitative but came from shoddy sources.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a snapshot of the top 30 traffic losers from the Medic Update:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/image6.png\" alt=\"Google eeat - biggest URL losers after EEAT\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73649 size-full\" width=\"1402\" height=\"1032\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/image6.png 1402w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/image6-1280x942.png 1280w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/image6-980x721.png 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/image6-480x353.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1402px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As you may have guessed, there are <strong>a ton<\/strong> of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/popular-keywords\/health-care-keywords\">health and medical<\/a> sites on this list. But it quickly became clear that while Google was singling YMYL content in its guidelines, E-A-T was something that <strong>all websites should be concerned about<\/strong>. Google says as much in its guidelines, explaining that there are \u201cexpert websites of all types.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/EEAT-standards-two.jpg\" alt=\"Google eeat - definition of high quality pages\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73651 size-full\" width=\"936\" height=\"217\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/EEAT-standards-two.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/EEAT-standards-two-480x111.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Aside from the guidelines, you can look no further than Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/intl\/en_uk\/search\/howsearchworks\/algorithms\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">own explanation of how search engines work<\/a> to see that it takes expertise deeply into account when ranking content. That means <em>all <\/em>content. Not just YMYL.<\/p>\n<p>What did websites do in the wake of all this to make sure they had appropriate levels of E-A-T? It\u2019s an important question because it sets a solid foundation for how business owners should go about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/24\/website-audit-checklist\">auditing their websites<\/a> for E-E-A-T. Let\u2019s take a look.<\/p>\n<h2>How websites have traditionally approached E-A-T<\/h2>\n<p>As you might imagine, most, if not all of expertise, trust, and authority comes down to the person that is writing the content (meaning: the author). And in many ways, the days and months following the Medic Update saw webmasters auditing not just content quality, but author quality.<\/p>\n<h3>Doubling down on author expertise<\/h3>\n<p>How do you know if an author has credibility? Well, it\u2019s like that old saying: <em>you know it when you see it.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It helps if the author is an author for whom Google has created <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mariehaynes.com\/qa-with-gary-illyes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an actual entity<\/a> due to their online reputation. But that doesn\u2019t mean every person that contributes to your blog has to be Gary Vaynerchuk. It just means that they should have a <strong>demonstrable level of expertise<\/strong> in their subject.<\/p>\n<p>So if an author has credits on other credible websites in your niche, if their names appear often in the search results, and if their posts have generated links from authoritative websites in the past: all of these things can only help your search rankings.<\/p>\n<h3>Doubling down on content expertise<\/h3>\n<p>In addition to author credibility, E-A-T also re-emphasized the importance of content quality.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/EEAT-standards.jpg\" alt=\"Google eeat - statement on original content\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73650 size-full\" width=\"925\" height=\"236\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/EEAT-standards.jpg 925w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/EEAT-standards-480x122.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 925px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And not just content quality, but <em>content credibility<\/em>. How do you know if your content itself is credible? You should:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sell products and services with strong reviews from real customers.<\/li>\n<li>Seek to provide content, products, and services that actually help people, not just sell them things.<\/li>\n<li>Demonstrate your expertise and credibility whenever possible. Badges, awards, reputable press\u2013these are all things that should be openly shown and linked to on your website as much as possible.<\/li>\n<li>Make sure all content is appropriately linked and cited, and make sure those citations come from reputable sources.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So now that we\u2019ve given you the necessary primer on how business owners have traditionally approached E-A-T, let\u2019s talk about how E-E-A-T raises the bar (read: makes expertise even more important for more people).<\/p>\n<h2>How E-E-A-T raises the bar<\/h2>\n<p>The extra \u201cE\u201d in E-E-A-T stands for Experience. And this is the key way that the modern definition of E-E-A-T, which <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/blog\/2022\/12\/google-raters-guidelines-e-e-a-t\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google released in December of 2022<\/a>, differs from E-A-T as we knew it.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cExperience\u201d means that <em>anybody <\/em>can be an expert, regardless of whether or not they have a Ph.D. in their author bio. It also means that Google plans on holding content creators <strong><em>of all kinds <\/em>to the standards they set forth in their E-A-T framework.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In a nutshell, \u201cExperience\u201d makes E-E-A-T a more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/27\/diversity-inclusion-marketing-statistics\">inclusive<\/a> concept in today\u2019s creator economy. If you have bona fide first-hand experience of a subject, you too can and will be considered an expert. Here\u2019s a succinct definition from<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search\/howsearchworks\/how-search-works\/rigorous-testing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Google\u2019s search quality rater guidelines<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cConsider the extent to which the content creator has the necessary first-hand or life experience for the topic. Many types of pages are trustworthy and achieve their purpose well when created by people with a wealth of personal experience. For example, which would you trust: a product review from someone who has personally used the product or a &#8216;review\u2019 by someone who has not?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This is a really empowering concept for a lot of content creators. It shows Google\u2019s awareness that in today\u2019s digital ecosystem, great (and popular) content can be found in a variety of mediums, on a multitude of platforms, and from experts of all shapes and sizes.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also a really empowering concept for brands and businesses. Does the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/08\/ppc-influencers\">influencer<\/a> that wrote the blog for your cosmetics brand have a vast following, strong social signals, and popular content across the web? You can reap all the same benefits of E-E-A-T from that content creator that you could from the traditional \u201cexpert\u201d with a fancy title.<\/p>\n<p>The flip side of that coin is that by broadening the definition of what qualifies as expertise, Google is holding <strong>more content<\/strong> <strong>to<\/strong> <strong>higher standards of expertise. <\/strong>Not just YMYL. So take that to heart, and make sure whoever is creating your content, has demonstrable levels of experience, expertise, authority, and trust.<\/p>\n<h2>E-E-A-T doubles down on trust<\/h2>\n<p>Speaking of trust: that\u2019s the other change worth noting in Google\u2019s new E-E-A-T framework. The \u201cT\u201d still comes last; but, for all intents and purposes, you should consider it the most important factor in defining credible and authoritative content.<\/p>\n<p>Check out this new Venn diagram Google provided:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/EEAT-graph-Venn-diagram.jpg\" alt=\"Google eeat: Venn diagram of four EEAT factors\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73652 size-full\" width=\"924\" height=\"560\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/EEAT-graph-Venn-diagram.jpg 924w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/EEAT-graph-Venn-diagram-480x291.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 924px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>\u00a0<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/static.googleusercontent.com\/media\/guidelines.raterhub.com\/en\/searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Trust, Google says, is now the \u201cmost important member of the E-E-A-T family\u2026because untrustworthy pages have low E-E-A-T no matter how Experienced, Expert, or Authoritative they may seem.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>They go on to elucidate what they consider the \u201chighest E-E-A-T content, and fittingly, trust is the make-or-break component:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cPages with High E-E-A-T are trustworthy or very trustworthy.

One, we live in a world of copious misinformation. Platforms, brands, and sources have been doubling down on trustworthiness for some time.
