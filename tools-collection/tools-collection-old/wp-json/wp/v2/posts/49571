Let\u2019s take a deeper dive into each one:<\/p>\n<h3>Linear attribution<\/h3>\n<p>A linear attribution model distributes the credit for a conversion evenly across all interactions along a conversion path.<\/p>\n<div data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"97668dda-713f-472a-a4d2-df3e9f656e00\" data-langcode=\"en\" class=\"embedded-entity align-center\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/multi-touch-attribution-linear-model.png\" width=\"472\" height=\"306\" alt=\"multi-touch attribution models: linear attribution model\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>Pros: <\/strong>Linear attribution is straightforward\u2014each asset holds the same amount of weight. So it\u2019s a great way to start analyzing your marketing and advertising efforts using multi-touch attribution to optimize for the entire customer journey (not just one single activity).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cons:<\/strong> Remember the group project dilemma I mentioned at the beginning of this post? Linear attribution models can allow that same phenomenon to happen as all assets show they are contributing equally to your end goal (even if some really aren\u2019t). In short, it can be hard to pinpoint what is or isn\u2019t working.<\/p>\n<h3>Time decay attribution<\/h3>\n<p>A time decay attribution model gives more credit to any interactions that happened closer to the time of the conversion, based on a seven-day half-life. For example, an ad interaction eight days before a conversion gets half as much credit as an interaction that happened just one day prior to the conversion.<\/p>\n<div data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"14241251-b2ab-4c4c-8592-113b5650ba2e\" data-langcode=\"en\" class=\"embedded-entity align-center\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/multi-touch-attribution-time-decay.png\" width=\"466\" height=\"307\" alt=\"multi-touch attribution: time decay model\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>Pros: <\/strong>Time decay attribution models can be helpful if you have a short sales cycle, since you\u2019ll have an idea of what pushed a customer to ultimately convert at the very end of their journey.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cons: <\/strong>If you have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/26\/sales-cycle\">long or complex sales cycle<\/a>, certain assets that may have impacted a customer early on won\u2019t receive the credit they might deserve.<\/p>\n<h3>Position-based attribution<\/h3>\n<p>Position-based attribution uses a 40-40-20 rule to credit interactions towards a conversion. This means it gives 40% of the credit to both the first and last interactions, and 20% to the rest of the interactions in between. Position-based attribution is often also referred to as a U-shaped model.<\/p>\n<div data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"0e2a5d03-bdb8-40c9-985d-1d155494200a\" data-langcode=\"en\" class=\"embedded-entity align-center\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/multi-touch-attribution-position-based.png\" width=\"470\" height=\"305\" alt=\"multi-touch attribution: position based model\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>Pros: <\/strong>With position-based attribution, every touchpoint gets a piece of the pie while still optimizing for the (sometimes more important) first and last interactions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cons: <\/strong>Low-value interactions could mistakenly receive too much credit depending on your customers\u2019 journey.
