Maintain brand consistency throughout your franchise marketing<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s no secret that one of the biggest challenges franchise marketers face is location managers or franchisees that go rogue\u2014especially when it comes to branding and brand consistency. But until a teleportation or cloning device gets invented, you\u2019re unfortunately unable to be at all your locations to guide them through their marketing (despite how much you wish you could). This makes <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/brand-consistency\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">maintaining brand consistency<\/a> across all locations a difficult task.<\/p>\n<p>But brand consistency is extremely important for the success of your franchise marketing. We know that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.globalbankingandfinance.com\/71-of-consumers-more-likely-to-buy-a-product-or-service-from-a-name-they-recognise\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">71%<\/a> of consumers say they\u2019re more likely to buy a product or service from a brand they recognize. Plus, we can\u2019t forget about the age-old marketing \u201crule of seven\u201d which states that people need to see information about a business at least <a href=\"https:\/\/www.b2bmarketing.net\/en\/resources\/blog\/marketing-rule-7-and-why-its-still-relevant-b2b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">seven times<\/a> before they become a customer.<\/p>\n<p>So brand consistency isn\u2019t just a \u201cnice-to-have&#8221; element in your franchise marketing plan, it\u2019s a need-to-have!<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to approach it: <\/strong>The first thing you should do is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/10\/content-style-guide\" rel=\"noopener\">create a brand style guide<\/a>. Once you have your style guide in place, you can use it across all locations. If you already have one in place, now is the time to revisit!

So identifying your target audience across locations <em>now <\/em>to deliver a personalized experience at each location <em>later<\/em> is a marketing tactic you won\u2019t want to miss out on.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to approach it:\u00a0 <\/strong>Taking time to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\" rel=\"noopener\">identify your target audience<\/a> across all locations when your plate is already full is easier said than done. A more efficient way to execute this is to look at your target audience from a bird\u2019s eye view and zoom in from there.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/identifying-your-target-audience.webp\" alt=\"questions to ask to find your target audience\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-77202\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/identifying-your-target-audience.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/identifying-your-target-audience-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Once you identify what makes up your target audience at a high level you can take it down to the regional level. From there, you can use free online tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/trends.google.com\/trends\/?geo=US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Trends<\/a> to understand the interest of topics by location to see how your messaging may slightly differ between regions.<\/p>\n<p>Another workaround would be to create marketing collateral that\u2019s diverse enough to speak to all customers regardless of lifestyle. A healthy mix of both, however, will give your customers that localized experience while saving you as much time and resources as possible.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Know your solution options (+ which ones your brand needs)<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s an infinite amount of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\" rel=\"noopener\">value your franchise has to offer<\/a> its customers. Add that on top of your many convenient locations, a diverse range of employees, and audience segments, you\u2019ll find it can be challenging to know how to deliver all this information to your potential customers in the best way.<\/p>\n<p>With so many potential <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/06\/18\/marketing-channels\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing channels<\/a> to choose from, how do you know which strategies will be most effective? And how can you communicate your chosen strategies\u2019 effectiveness to your franchise managers?<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to approach it:<\/strong> We\u2019ve broken down the top marketing channels for franchise businesses into a few core pillars. Introduce your franchisees to the following and encourage them to try it for their own benefit:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Search engine optimization<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>SEO is at the core of any strong marketing plan for good reason\u2014it\u2019s free!

Even though you may be juggling various locations and customer bases, you can segment your video marketing in hyper-specific ways to ensure each location gets a piece of the pie.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, video marketing can grow revenue nearly <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/video-marketing-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">50%<\/a> faster and pull in 66% more qualified leads per year than businesses that don\u2019t use video.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Display<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-display-advertising\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Display ads<\/a> give you a way to target your audience on sites across the web\u2014when they\u2019re not even actively searching for your business. This increases awareness for your brand. If your branch managers notice a dip in sales, <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/benefits-of-display-advertising\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">display ads<\/a> could be the solution since consumers who are retargeted via display ads are <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/horrifying-display-advertising-stats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">70%<\/a> more likely to convert.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Social<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smallbizgenius.net\/by-the-numbers\/social-media-marketing-statistics\/#gref\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">3.5<\/a> billion active social media users worldwide, it\u2019s no secret that social media marketing is a must if you want to heighten your chances of reaching all the potential customers around each of your locations.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/best-social-media-marketing-strategies-for-smb\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The beauty of social media marketing<\/a> is that you can get results regardless of whether you decide to go the free or paid route. So if you\u2019re struggling to get all your franchisees on board with one marketing strategy, social media marketing is an accommodating solution with endless options that can fit any locations\u2019 budget (or lack thereof).<\/p>\n<p>Of course, there are additional marketing channels you should consider as part of your strategy. Take a look at all the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/local-marketing-lab\/local-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">basics of local marketing<\/a> to find out what would work for you.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Get all locations on board with the right strategy<\/h3>\n<p>Speaking of budgets, with multiple franchises, it can be tough to get them on the same page with the marketing spend and strategy that you encourage. Each location has its own needs and budget which you want to accommodate within your recommended <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-create-a-small-business-marketing-plan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing plan<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It gets trickier when you want to save yourself time by creating an easily transferrable franchise marketing strategy that can apply store to store but also is flexible enough to not have one set budget applied.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to approach it: <\/strong>The first thing you\u2019ll want to look at is all the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-increase-sales-for-your-business-on-a-budget\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free and low-cost marketing options<\/a> available. Small businesses have been doing this for years, but for a larger enterprise, this feels counterintuitive. However, the kicker of franchise marketing is it\u2019s the same concept as local marketing\u2014just multiplied.<\/p>\n<p>When you present your location owners with low-cost or free options, they\u2019ll have no reason to not want to implement them. Some examples could be setting them up with a social media account for regular posts or facilitating online workshops to foster their SEO expertise.<\/p>\n<p>With that said, we know that a mix of marketing channels maximizes your chances of results. Ideally, you\u2019ll want your location managers to get on board with allocating some of their revenue toward<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/local-marketing-lab\/local-marketing\/#section5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> a marketing budget<\/a>. The best way to encourage this is to research statistics to display the ROI if they were to go for it and to provide co-op funds from corporate if possible. For example, paid advertising returns $2 for every $1 spent\u2013a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smallbizgenius.net\/by-the-numbers\/ppc-stats\/#gref\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">200%<\/a> ROI.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s helpful to keep in mind that marketing budgets don\u2019t have to be huge. It doesn\u2019t always take a lot of money to make a big impact, but a little can go a long way!<\/p>\n<h3>5. Evaluate your options for franchise marketing execution<\/h3>\n<p>While some franchises are fine with individual locations running their <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-strategies-for-small-businesses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing strategies<\/a> themselves, others opt to streamline marketing from one central team or group for all locations.<\/p>\n<p>Both options present their own sets of challenges. If you\u2019re managing the marketing strategies for all locations, you have a big job\u2014you must not only execute <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-multichannel-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a successful multi-channel marketing<\/a> strategy that includes optimizing campaigns, writing ad copy, and deploying offers, but you have to do that for different areas and audiences.<\/p>\n<p>If you allow franchisees to run their marketing themselves, you have to worry about brand consistency, optimized spend, and a lack of control around results.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to approach it:<\/strong> It doesn\u2019t have to feel like a lose-lose situation when you choose which route out of the two you want to take. As mentioned above, both managing marketing for your locations versus letting them manage it comes with pros and cons.<\/p>\n<p>To identify what\u2019s best for your brand, we recommend doing a self-evaluation with the following questions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How much extra time do I have to oversee my locations\u2019 marketing strategies?<\/li>\n<li>How much time do my location owners have to put into marketing?<\/li>\n<li>Would implementing marketing at the location level require any training?<\/li>\n<li>What types of marketing channels do I need to have running at each franchise location? Can each location handle those themselves?<\/li>\n<li>Has my company struggled with brand consistency in the past?<\/li>\n<li>How would I measure the success if I ran the marketing for all franchise locations? How would those locations measure and report on their own success?<\/li>\n<li>How frequently would I expect to change up the marketing strategy?<\/li>\n<li>Is it easy for me to consistently communicate with all of my locations?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Depending on your answers, you\u2019ll end up leaning towards one over the other. However, if you\u2019re still unsure then that\u2019s totally fine! Another option would be to involve a marketing partner to help oversee your franchise marketing strategies along with you. That way you won\u2019t have all the locations\u2019 marketing on your shoulders, and you can leverage a resource that has every marketing tool needed at its fingertips.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever you decide, finding the right tool to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-track-leads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">track your marketing<\/a> across locations and channels will be crucial for measuring success. (We&#8217;ll talk more about this in a minute!)<em><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>6. Create a strong local SEO strategy<\/h3>\n<p>You need to focus on SEO that is both national and local. National often comes naturally to many franchise businesses at this point, but without a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/local-marketing-lab\/seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">strong local SEO approach<\/a>, you won\u2019t be able to show up for searches when and where it counts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to approach it: <\/strong>The easiest way to complement your national SEO with a local SEO strategy is to include keywords related to your locations within your content\u2014this can be easily done through location pages on your website. The next quick fix for <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/multi-location-seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">multi-location SEO<\/a> is to invest in listings management so local listings are accurate for each location to help drive leads. It may seem minor, but <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/google-my-business-benefits\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">64%<\/a> of consumers have used <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/google-my-business-benefits\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Business<\/a> Profiles to find contact details for a local business.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, try to position your brand as a partner to each of your locations by creating local-friendly blog content. Brainstorm a blog topic that\u2019s specific to each one of your locations, and you\u2019ll save time on your editorial calendar planning while also staying consistent with local content!<\/p>\n<p>You can also quickly research other local businesses to link to for resources within your content to build trust with your local audiences. That said, maintain a friendly presence in your local communities by encouraging location managers to participate in local events to trigger brand awareness for searches later.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/franchise-marketing-google-business-profile.webp\" alt=\"example of franchise google local business profiles\" width=\"591\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-82330\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/franchise-marketing-google-business-profile.webp 591w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/franchise-marketing-google-business-profile-480x487.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 591px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>This multi-location business has Google Business Profile listings for each store location to fit local SEO needs.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd0e <strong>Need help finding the right keywords for your local SEO strategy?<\/strong> Try our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h3>7. Be sure to stand out from the competition (including your own franchisees!)<\/h3>\n<p>Franchises have a unique competitor set in that while you compete with other local businesses and large brands, you might also compete with your own locations. For example, you might have two locations down the block from each other that own two completely different territories but could be competing for the same customers. One major hurdle every franchise must jump over is how to run marketing at each location without stepping on one another\u2019s toes\u2014all while stepping on the competition\u2019s toes!<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to approach it: <\/strong>We can\u2019t stress enough how important geo-targeting is to your multi-location or franchise marketing. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/07\/google-ads-geotargeting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Geo-targeting<\/a> is a way to ensure that one location\u2019s marketing collateral doesn\u2019t slip onto the screens of consumers in another location\u2019s territory. When you run ad campaigns with geotargeting you&#8217;re maximizing the overall growth of your business by handing out a fair, even slice of the cake (or in this case, audience) to each store.<\/p>\n<p>As for <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-make-your-business-stand-out\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">standing out from the competition<\/a>, geotargeting can also help here if you want to identify and target their locations too.

Take advantage of <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/reporting-analytics\/client-center\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">digital tools that aggregate reporting<\/a> across platforms, locations, and more to report on what matters. A few things you should ask yourself while scouting a reporting solution include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you want your location managers to have access?<\/li>\n<li>What performance metrics matter most to your multi-location business?<\/li>\n<li>What does a positive performance look like for you at the national level? At the local level?<\/li>\n<li>What channels need to be tracked? How will they be tracked consistently across locations?<\/li>\n<li>What timeframes will you be looking to run reports on?<\/li>\n<li>What types of downloadable or shareable files, if any, will you want for your reports?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>9. Educate your franchisees on franchise marketing<\/h3>\n<p>You and your franchisees are busy running a national brand at the local level\u2014you all don\u2019t have time for in-person pieces of training on all your marketing technology and best practices!

You can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/12\/free-training-resources-for-agencies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hold training online<\/a> after hours to make it easy for all your branch managers to attend.<\/p>\n<p>Another way to make marketing education more accessible across locations is to create various training materials. For example, you can shoot or share quick \u201chow-to\u201d YouTube<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/26\/how-to-do-a-webinar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> videos for visual learners<\/a>. For busy location owners short on time, you can write and email training articles that they can read in bits throughout the day.<\/p>\n<p>The more training material, the better. If your schedule is so jam-packed you can\u2019t even begin to think about running training or creating training materials, leveraging a marketing partner to facilitate training for you is another great option.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Communicate with your marketing partners<\/h3>\n<p>You may have one agency helping with social that has a totally different approach than your in-house team managing paid search. Or each location might be working with their own team or consultant. How do you keep multiple teams and marketing partners aligned?<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to approach it: <\/strong>If you\u2019re struggling to keep track of all your marketing solutions, then it may be worth it to find a marketing partner that can bundle all your needs into one.

Be sure to hold regular meetings with your in-house team, your location managers, and your agencies to maintain consistent cohesion across channels.<\/p>\n<p>This is also another opportunity to distribute your style guide to all marketing partners so that there\u2019s no confusion across agencies, marketing associates, or consultants on what your brand\u2019s voice is.<\/p>\n<h2>Solve these franchise marketing puzzles today to decode a brighter tomorrow<\/h2>\n<p>If there\u2019s one thing we can take away from all 10 of these franchise marketing tips is that the more you can plan ahead and communicate with your locations, the easier your job will be later.
