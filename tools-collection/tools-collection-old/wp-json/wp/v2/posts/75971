The algorithm\u2019s job is to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/09\/google-ranking-factors\">rank content<\/a> based on the likelihood that a viewer will watch it using signals like relevance, quality, and user behavior.<\/p>\n<h3>It\u2019s the gatekeeper to video views<\/h3>\n<p>Want more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/how-to-get-more-views-on-youtube\">video views<\/a>? The recommendation algorithm holds the key. A recent experiment showed the algorithm directly drives <a href=\"https:\/\/www.technologyreview.com\/2022\/09\/20\/1059709\/youtube-algorithm-recommendations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">70%<\/a> of the views on YouTube.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, YouTube\u2019s computer code seems to override even user controls. Meaning, if you hit the <em>Dislike<\/em> or <em>Not interested<\/em> button on a video, the algorithm may still suggest similar content. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to understand how it works.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udc4b YouTube videos also show up in Google search results.<\/strong> Learn how to <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite10WaysFirstPageGoogle.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_10WaysFirstPageGoogle_Download\">get on the front page of Google<\/a> with this insightful guide full of SEO tips.<\/p>\n<h3>The algorithm is constantly evolving<\/h3>\n<p>The YouTube algorithm is an ever-moving target.

It gets a bit clearer when you see the three eras of the algorithm\u2019s evolution.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/youtube-algorithm-evolution.webp\" alt=\"YouTube algorithm - Timeline of the algorithms evolution\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76007\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/youtube-algorithm-evolution.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/youtube-algorithm-evolution-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2005 to 2011,<\/strong> <strong>cheap clicks do the trick:<\/strong> The algorithm recommends whichever videos get the most clicks. Creators game the system with clickbait titles and misleading thumbnails.<\/li>\n<li><strong>2012, it\u2019s all about timing:<\/strong> To surface videos people actually watch instead of the old click-and-run, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.youtube\/news-and-events\/youtube-now-why-we-focus-on-watch-time\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube retooled the algorithm<\/a> to prioritize watchtime and percent-of-video completion.

Instead of using overall popularity, the algorithm takes personal preferences (based on direct feedback and previous behavior) into account when it recommends videos.<\/li>\n<li><strong>2016, protecting the platform:<\/strong> Content moderation takes center stage as YouTube moves to moderate harmful misinformation. Creators now have to be aware of <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/youtube\/answer\/9288567?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">community guidelines<\/a> or risk being relegated to the no-show list.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The history of YouTube\u2019s algorithm is a forward march toward hosting quality content that keeps people on the platform. Let&#8217;s look at how YouTube\u2019s algorithm does that today.<\/p>\n<div id=\"how\"><\/div>\n<h2>How does the YouTube algorithm work in 2025?<\/h2>\n<p>If you only take one thing away from this article, it should be that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=67TkpHKv9tE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube wants<\/a> you to <strong>focus on your audience, not the algorithm<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur algorithm doesn&#8217;t pay attention to videos, it pays attention to viewers. So, rather than trying to make videos that&#8217;ll make an algorithm happy, focus on making videos that make your viewers happy,\u201d says <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/intl\/en_ca\/creators\/how-things-work\/content-creation-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube\u2019s own explanation<\/a> of how to reach your audience.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s an important distinction if you read our little history lesson. The algorithm isn\u2019t simply recommending based on popularity. It\u2019s more about the likelihood that an<em> individual user<\/em> will watch the next video, and the next.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why two viewers can end up with different results when conducting the same search.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-cricket.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube algorithm - two results for the word Cricket in Youtube\" width=\"591\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75975 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-cricket.jpg 591w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-cricket-480x487.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 591px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/intl\/ALL_ca\/howyoutubeworks\/product-features\/search\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>There are three factors that affect how the algorithm matches viewers to the videos they can\u2019t resist watching:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Content characteristics<\/li>\n<li>The recommendation location<\/li>\n<li>External factors<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Get these figured out and you\u2019ll know how to play the algorithm like a well-tuned instrument.<\/p>\n<h3>Content characteristics<\/h3>\n<p>First off, forget the notion that YouTube watches videos and picks its favorites. The algorithm can\u2019t do that. Instead, it looks for signals that tell it the content is a match for the viewer.<\/p>\n<h4>Relevance signals<\/h4>\n<p>Say you search for a tutorial on <em>how to bake a coconut cake<\/em>. YouTube quickly finds content that matches your query.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-search-coconutcake.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube algorithm - screenshot of Youtube results\" width=\"774\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75976 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-search-coconutcake.jpg 774w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-search-coconutcake-480x372.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 774px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If the algorithm isn\u2019t grabbing a bowl of virtual popcorn and watching millions of videos, how does it know what to show? It relies on metadata in the titles, tags, and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/youtube-channel-description-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">descriptions<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Performance signals<\/h4>\n<p>The algorithm isn\u2019t a critic, but it does get clues on what good content is from video metrics. The metrics YouTube uses to assess good content include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How long do people watch?<\/strong> How long is the average video view and what percent of the video does the average viewer watch?<\/li>\n<li><strong>How often is a video watched?<\/strong> How many times is a video viewed when it\u2019s recommended?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did people like the video?<\/strong> What\u2019s the engagement rate, number of likes vs. dislikes, and average survey rating of a video?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Personal preference signals<\/h4>\n<p>Since YouTube\u2019s algorithm is geared to show each viewer their ideal mix of content, it partly relies on each user\u2019s behavior to surface videos.<\/p>\n<p>To curate your mix, YouTube considers which videos you\u2019ve watched and liked (or disliked) and which topics or channels you keep coming back to.<\/p>\n<p>It also links videos people tend to watch together. If people click on \u201chow to make macaroons\u201d after viewing coconut cake content, you\u2019ll probably see that in your recommendation list.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-recommended-1.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube algorithm - screenshot of a youtube video with recommendations\" width=\"936\" height=\"479\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76009 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-recommended-1.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-recommended-1-480x246.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Creator signals<\/h4>\n<p>YouTube\u2019s algorithm wants to make sure it\u2019s not recommending dangerous or untrustworthy content. One way it does that is by reviewing the channel it came from. If the channel shows signs of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/12\/domain-authority\">topical authority<\/a> and trustworthiness, then YouTube is more likely to recommend its content.<\/p>\n<h3>Recommendation location<\/h3>\n<p>We usually refer to the YouTube algorithm, singular. In reality, there are three places recommendations happen, and each has a slightly different set of criteria for surfacing content.<\/p>\n<h4>The homepage<\/h4>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/01\/homepage-design\">homepage<\/a> is what you see when you first get to the YouTube website or app. Here, the algorithm is trying to get you to start watching something without knowing your current mood.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-home.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube algorithm - the youtube homepage\" width=\"936\" height=\"498\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75978 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-home.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-home-480x255.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The recommendations on the home screen are based on performance factors along with your previous watch and search history.<\/p>\n<h4>Suggested videos<\/h4>\n<p>Suggested videos show up next to the video you\u2019re watching.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-tiktok-2.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube algorithm - video of a golfer\" width=\"927\" height=\"517\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75979 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-tiktok-2.jpg 927w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-tiktok-2-480x268.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 927px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now the algorithm has a little more context for what you\u2019re in the mood for. It\u2019ll use the topic of the current video along with your watch history to make its suggestions. It\u2019ll also reference videos that were commonly watched after this one.<\/p>\n<h4>YouTube search results<\/h4>\n<p>It seems straightforward that in a search, you\u2019re telling YouTube what you want to watch. But as we\u2019ve seen, everyone\u2019s results are a little different.<\/p>\n<p>Search for \u201cbat\u201d and see what happens.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-bat.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube algorithm - YouTube search results for word bats\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75980 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-bat.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-bat-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You might get baseball videos. Don\u2019t like sports? Expect some flying mammal content.<\/p>\n<p>In this case, YouTube\u2019s algorithm is balancing your behavior with relevancy signals in the titles and descriptions of the videos.<\/p>\n<h3>External factors<\/h3>\n<p>While you have a lot of control over how YouTube ranks your content (and we\u2019ll show you how), there are some factors you just can\u2019t control.<\/p>\n<p>For example, YouTube suffers from seasonal dips in engagement like every social media platform. If your views drop in December, don\u2019t take it personally. Or maybe consider creating some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/11\/28\/christmas-holiday-greetings-wishes\">seasonally specific content<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>You also can\u2019t control the competition. Your best pasta recipe content will struggle to compete if Gordon Ramsay, Jamie Oliver, and Laura Vitale all dedicate a series to pasta.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-pesto.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube algorithm - YouTube results for word pesto\" width=\"704\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75981 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-pesto.jpg 704w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-pesto-480x409.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 704px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>One last factor you can\u2019t control is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/04\/unique-blog-ideas\">topic<\/a> interest.

Stay tuned to learn how.<\/p>\n<h3>Not factors<\/h3>\n<p>There are two things that don\u2019t affect your content\u2019s discoverability, even though they\u2019re often suspected of doing so.<\/p>\n<p>First, the algorithm doesn\u2019t know how or if you\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/youtube\/answer\/72857?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">monetizing your videos<\/a>. You won\u2019t get a boost or a penalty if you\u2019re getting <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/youtube-advertising-cost\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ad revenue<\/a> or are a part of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=k3NlQiF_yOY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shopping affiliate program<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Second, your publication frequency doesn\u2019t directly affect your individual video views. <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/youtube\/answer\/11914225?visit_id=638303149772262248-1900141170&amp;p=video_discovery_tips&amp;rd=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube states<\/a> that in their tests, there\u2019s no correlation between the time between uploads and an increase in views.<\/p>\n<div id=\"ways\"><\/div>\n<h2>14 ways to <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">hack<\/span> work with the YouTube algorithm<\/h2>\n<p>We would never recommend trying to game the YouTube algorithm (please don\u2019t <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-a-shadow-ban\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shadow ban<\/a> us). After all, Google is really good at sniffing out cheat codes and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/black-hat-seo\">blackhat tactics<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>That said, there are ways you can make it easier for the algorithm to surface your content and share it with more people (and use them for other <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/facebook-algorithm\">social media algorithms<\/a>). Think of it as a partnership instead of a competition.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Use SEO keywords<\/h3>\n<p>In some ways, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/10\/youtube-seo-tips\">YouTube SEO<\/a> operates like its cousin, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/19\/google-search-generative-experience\">Google Search<\/a> (YouTube is owned by Google, ya know). People type words into the search bar and the algorithm looks for content related to those words.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-chair.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube algorithm - Youtube results for word chair\" width=\"796\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75982 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-chair.jpg 796w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-chair-480x362.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 796px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To grab the top spot on results pages, do your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/14\/youtube-keyword-research\">YouTube keyword research<\/a>. Then place keywords in the filename, title, description, and subtitle script.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd0e <strong>Want more help finding the right keywords?<\/strong> Try our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">free keyword research tool<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h3>2. Add subtitles and closed captions to your video<\/h3>\n<p>Subtitles and closed captions help people understand your videos when they can\u2019t, or choose not to, hear the audio.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-outdoor.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube algorithm - screenshot of video with subtitles\" width=\"936\" height=\"537\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75983 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-outdoor.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-outdoor-480x275.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The files that contain your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/12\/video-scripts\">video scripts<\/a> also help search engines understand your content. That\u2019s because the text in those files looks sort of like a blog post to search engines, so it tells them what a video is about.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Use Google Trends to find popular topics<\/h3>\n<p>Remember when we said you can\u2019t control what topics are popular? It\u2019s true. But you can know what\u2019s popular and plan content around it.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-trends\">Google Trends<\/a> is an easy and free way to learn what people look for and when they look for it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-metrics-1.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube algorithm - Graph of popularity of search term mulch\" width=\"936\" height=\"531\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75984 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-metrics-1.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-metrics-1-480x272.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>With a little work on Google Trends, you\u2019ll know that April is the best time to post and promote mulch videos to your audience of lawn care enthusiasts.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Make irresistible thumbnails<\/h3>\n<p>You need video clicks to impress the YouTube algorithm. But there\u2019s over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/27\/youtube-statistics\">500 hours<\/a> of content uploaded to YouTube every day! That\u2019s a crowded space to stand out in.<\/p>\n<p>Your best tool in the fight for attention on YouTube is the thumbnail. Check out YouTube superstar Mr. Beast\u2019s thumbnail collection.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-mrbeast-1.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube algorithm - Mr Beast's home page on youtube\" width=\"936\" height=\"511\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75985 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-mrbeast-1.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-mrbeast-1-480x262.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Notice how he keeps the text to a minimum, includes a vibrant and relevant image, and always includes his smiling face.

Hook viewers with great intros<\/h3>\n<p>If people immediately click away from your videos, YouTube will take it as a signal that your content isn\u2019t worth sharing. To keep viewers around, make sure you have an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/08\/how-to-write-an-introduction\">introduction<\/a> that hooks people immediately.<\/p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean making your intro big and flashy. What\u2019s really important is that the first few seconds tell the viewer that the video will live up to the title and thumbnail.<\/p>\n<p>Crash Course is an educational video channel that does this well.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-bat-2.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube algorithm - screenshot of science video\" width=\"909\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75986 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-bat-2.jpg 909w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-bat-2-480x316.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 909px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Click on one of their videos, and you\u2019ll know right away that the content is high-quality and that they\u2019ll answer the question posed in the title.<\/p>\n<p>You can use the same tactics in your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/28\/youtube-channel-trailer\">YouTube channel trailer<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Add cards and end screens<\/h3>\n<p>To keep people binging your content, and upping your cred with the algorithm, include both a card and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/13\/call-to-action-examples\">CTA<\/a> in each video.<\/p>\n<p>A card is a clickable image that leads to other videos in your library.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-cards.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube algorithm - screenshot showing card on video\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75987 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-cards.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-cards-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Think of them like internal links on a webpage. Place a card whenever you mention something that\u2019s related to another video you\u2019ve posted.<\/p>\n<p>An end screen, AKA end card or outro, is usually a static image shown for the final seconds of a video.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-snl.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube algorithm - end screen from SNL\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75988 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-snl.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-snl-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>End screens are a great place to add a call to action (CTA) and video links.<\/p>\n<p>\u270d\ufe0f <strong>Write better CTAs!<\/strong> CTAs punch well above their weight in driving new traffic and revenue. Get <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download\">36 power CTA examples<\/a> you can use today.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Add subscription watermarks<\/h3>\n<p>We know the algorithm likes to suggest content from trustworthy channels. One way to show that your channel fits the bill is to get more subscribers.<\/p>\n<p>The best time to ask someone to become a subscriber is to ask them while they\u2019re enjoying your content. Do it by adding a subscription watermark to your videos.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-ford-e1694798382329.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube algorithm - screenshot of a video with a subscriber button\" width=\"927\" height=\"519\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75989 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-ford-e1694798382329.jpg 927w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-ford-e1694798382329-480x270.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 927px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>These little clickable buttons are easy to miss, so point them out during the video and let people know what they get as a subscriber.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Create series and playlists<\/h3>\n<p>We all have a need to know what comes next. Tap into it by publishing several videos on the same topic. Then organize them into playlists.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-playlist.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube algorithm - playlist of videos\" width=\"572\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75990 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-playlist.jpg 572w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-playlist-480x503.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 572px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The entire playlist of videos shows up on the side screen, pushing out other suggestions from the algorithm (nice!). Plus, playlist videos play one after the other without a pause, so the viewer doesn\u2019t have to lift a finger to keep watching.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Cross-promote your content<\/h3>\n<p>You don\u2019t have to wait for the algorithm\u2019s suggestion to get new viewers. You can find people outside of YouTube who would love your content by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/22\/cross-channel-marketing\">cross-promoting<\/a> it on other platforms.<\/p>\n<p>For example, try posting a preview of your long-form video on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/23\/tiktok-marketing\">TikTok<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-tiktok.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube algorithm - TikTok video screenshot\" width=\"324\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75991 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-tiktok.jpg 324w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-tiktok-162x300.jpg 162w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/23\/tiktok-ads-targeting\">TikTok\u2019s becoming a marketer\u2019s dream<\/a> channel. And since it\u2019s all about video, it\u2019s a natural place to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-promote-your-youtube-channel\">promote your YouTube content<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t forget to also share it on Instagram and embed it in your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/13\/content-creation\">blog posts<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Creep on your competitors<\/h3>\n<p>You can learn loads about the algorithm by watching what works for other creators in your space.<\/p>\n<p>The simplest way to conduct <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/01\/competitor-keyword-analysis\">competitor research<\/a> is by typing your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/youtube-seo\">SEO keywords<\/a> into the search bar. Then snoop on their:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Thumbnails<\/li>\n<li>Keywords<\/li>\n<li>Subtopics<\/li>\n<li>Video length<\/li>\n<li>Titles and descriptions<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Once you see the trends, you can adjust your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/20\/youtube-marketing\">YouTube strategy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>11. Add timestamps<\/h3>\n<p>Timestamps help people navigate your videos. They let viewers skip ahead or return to the content that\u2019s most important to them.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-timestamps-1.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube algorithm - screenshot of a video with timestamps\" width=\"774\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75992 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-timestamps-1.jpg 774w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-timestamps-1-480x372.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 774px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Since user experience is the driving motivator for YouTube\u2019s algorithm, helping people get the most out of your videos with time stamps should be a priority.<\/p>\n<h3>12. Nix the clickbait<\/h3>\n<p>Tricking people into clicking on your YouTube content is so 2005. If you try it, you\u2019ll not only annoy potential subscribers, but your videos will have a harder chance of ranking. Plus, being fake can put you at risk of losing your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-get-verified-on-youtube\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube verification<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It can be a little confusing. You want to get people to click. What\u2019s the difference between content that stands out and underhanded tactics?<\/p>\n<p>The line between attention-grabbing and click-baiting is defined by honesty. Be honest in your titles and thumbnails so that when people click, they get what they expected.<\/p>\n<h3>13. Post at the best time<\/h3>\n<p>We know the algorithm doesn\u2019t care if you hit publish at 9 a.m. on Tuesday or 2 p.m. on Saturday. But if you post when your audience is online, you could get a little early boost in engagement. If the algorithm sees it, it could expand the reach of your video.<\/p>\n<p>So when\u2019s the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/08\/best-time-to-post-on-youtube\">best time to post on YouTube<\/a>? It\u2019s complicated.<\/p>\n<p>First, there is some research that says weekday afternoons and weekend mornings are best.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-time-e1694798495824.png\" alt=\"YouTube algorithm - chart showing best times to post on youtube\" width=\"936\" height=\"290\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75993 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-time-e1694798495824.png 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-time-e1694798495824-480x270.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But it really comes down to your audience and goals. You\u2019ll need to test and track different times and see which works best for you.<\/p>\n<h3>14. Get analytical<\/h3>\n<p>YouTube wants you to win. So much so that they give you a bunch of data to help you be a better <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/08\/content-creator\">content creator<\/a>\u2014conveniently located in your creator\u2019s dashboard.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-graph.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube algorithm - YouTube analytics graph\" width=\"936\" height=\"359\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75994 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-graph.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/YouTube-algorithm-example-graph-480x184.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a lot of data to parse through. Here are a few of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/03\/underrated-youtube-metrics\">YouTube metrics<\/a> that\u2019ll help you get noticed and shared by the YouTube algorithm:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Videos growing your audience:<\/strong> Tells you which of your videos are attracting the most new viewers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Channels your audience watches:<\/strong> Tells you which channels, besides your own, people that watch your videos also watch.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Key moments for audience attention:<\/strong> Tells you which parts of your videos had the lowest drop-off rate and which were rewatched.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"FAQs\"><\/div>\n<h2>YouTube algorithm FAQs<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve covered a lot, but there are still a few questions to answer about the YouTube algorithm.<\/p>\n<h3>Is the YouTube Shorts algorithm different?<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-make-youtube-shorts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube Shorts<\/a> are YouTube\u2019s short-form video answer to TikTik and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/22\/instagram-reels-ideas-for-businesses\">Instagram Reels<\/a>. The suggestion algorithm for YouTube Shorts works exactly the same way as it does for other YouTube content. So make sure those 15-second vertical videos are relevant and high-quality.<\/p>\n<h3>How does YouTube count views in 2025?<\/h3>\n<p>YouTube keeps its video count formula under wraps. But the two conditions that likely constitute a video view are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A video play is initiated by a viewer from a verified IP address<\/li>\n<li>The video is played for 30 seconds or more<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>How often should you post on YouTube?<\/h3>\n<p>YouTube says that video recommendations aren\u2019t affected by the time between your uploads. But posting new content consistently will keep viewers coming back for more and give you extra swings at sharing a viral video. Ideally, you should post at least once per week. Balance that with your interests; if you get burnt out, your content will suffer and the algorithm won\u2019t suggest it anyway.<\/p>\n<h2>Know the YouTube algorithm for more video views<\/h2>\n<p>Does trying to keep up with the YouTube algorithm take the joy out of content creation? Try to remember that it wants the same thing you do, more people watching more videos. Then the algorithm becomes a partner, not a barrier, to your success.<\/p>\n<p>With that in mind, remember these 14 ways to get your videos recommended more often on YouTube:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use SEO keywords<\/li>\n<li>Add subtitles and closed captions<\/li>\n<li>Use Google trends<\/li>\n<li>Make irresistible thumbnails<\/li>\n<li>Hook viewers with great intros<\/li>\n<li>Add cards and end screens<\/li>\n<li>Add subscription watermarks<\/li>\n<li>Create series and playlists<\/li>\n<li>Cross-promote your content<\/li>\n<li>Creep on your competitors<\/li>\n<li>Add timestamps<\/li>\n<li>Nix the clickbait<\/li>\n<li>Post at the best time<\/li>\n<li>Get analytical<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learn how the YouTube algorithm works
