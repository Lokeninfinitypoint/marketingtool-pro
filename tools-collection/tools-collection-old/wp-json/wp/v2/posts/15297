Messaging a business is much easier than contacting via telephone or email, as it can be done easily while on the move.<\/p>\n<p>There are a huge range of benefits for using Facebook messenger bots for business, too. One of the most important is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/14\/chatbot-marketing\">chatbot<\/a>\u2019s ability to increase conversion rates, as long as the pre-designed messages are written and planned effectively. Here are five ways that you can use Facebook Messenger bots to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/11\/get-more-conversions\">increase your conversions<\/a>, as well as our top tips for writing high-quality messages.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a016f0b6-3dcf-4a11-9379-3e216499956d\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-messenger-bots-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook messenger logo\" width=\"883\" height=\"497\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>1. Improve customer service<\/h2>\n<p>The first way to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/28\/facebook-messenger-marketing\">use Messenger chatbots<\/a> to increase conversions is obvious: Through the use of automated messaging, you are guaranteed to provide potential customers with an immediate response to any questions they may have.<\/p>\n<p>Providing excellent customer services is crucial to upping your conversion rates <em>and<\/em> sets you apart from the competition. When building your chatbot, make sure you take into consideration FAQs sent to your business and provide a means through which people can quickly find answers to them. The easiest way to do this is to offer multiple choice responses that gradually narrow down to a specific question.<\/p>\n<p>By ensuring that you are providing high-quality answers, potential customers can quickly and easily decide if they wish to purchase your products or services. Not only does the relaying of accurate and precise information play to your favor, but by providing an immediate response you are reducing the chances of these people sourcing an alternative supplier or buying from someone with a quicker response rate.<\/p>\n<p>And a bonus perk: By getting a bot to request information from customers you are also pre-qualifying them before spending human hours on getting the details.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"86591b0e-452d-4a6f-9c81-2673ca543128\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-messenger-bots-response-rate.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook messenger bots response rate\" width=\"450\" height=\"801\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">You can view your response rate on your Facebook homepage.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>2. Build brand awareness<\/h2>\n<p>Use your bot to let people know what it is your company does, particularly when communicating with people who have recently entered your brand\u2019s sphere of influence. This is a great way to capture interest. By conveying your brand in a way that appeals to your target audience, you are qualifying people from a cold audience to a warm audience and moving them down your sales funnel. There are a few ways to do this, and there\u2019s no reason that you can\u2019t do them all. It\u2019s all about what works best for your brand.<\/p>\n<p>First up, provide people who decide to message you with a greeting message. This allows them to learn a little more about your business before they engage in conversation.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"22ad0f71-ded4-417c-a706-fba00b68fc28\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-messenger-bots-mission.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook messenger bots UNICEF mission\" width=\"450\" height=\"801\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">UNICEF\u2019s greeting message provides information about what the organization does. <\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Your second option is to provide a menu at the bottom of your Messenger window. This enables people to ask questions to learn more about who you are, what you do, and other useful information.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d26bab47-9ba5-40e7-ad7c-e247f07a516e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-messenger-bots-learn-more-chat.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook messenger bots &quot;Learn More&quot;\" width=\"450\" height=\"801\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">This bot menu allows users to learn more about the agency. <\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p>You can also engage in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/05\/brand-awareness-campaigns\">brand awareness<\/a> directly as part of your bot conversation. By letting people know about a recent event your business has been a part of or an interesting project you\u2019ve been working on, you are likely to capture your audience\u2019s attention.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Encourage people to visit your product page<\/h2>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve used one or both of the above features to warm your audience up, you can start directing them to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/07\/ecommerce-sales-product-pages\">product pages<\/a>. However, it is important that you make it feel natural and conversational and NOT like a sales pitch. This is a big no. If you don\u2019t want to direct people to your product pages this way, you can always add a shop button to the menu, but well-organized conversation does tend to work well.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"76094eaf-1106-4991-b360-be12bf0a92fb\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-messenger-bots-browse-collection.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook messenger bots &quot;Browse Collection&quot; option\" width=\"450\" height=\"801\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">Burberry provides you with the option to browse its products in both the menu and the conversation. <\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>4. Send broadcasts to subscribers to increase your customer lifetime value<\/h2>\n<p>As well as your standard bot conversation, you can send out ad hoc broadcasts to your subscribers. There are many useful ways to use these to draw attention back to your brand and increase customer lifetime value and the likelihood of future conversions. Once again, make sure that these aren\u2019t too sales orientated and send them out sparingly \u2013 no more than once per week.<\/p>\n<p>You can use broadcasts to let customers know about important business news you think they will find interesting, to offer them content that they may find useful such as a blog which will draw them back to your website, or to ask them if they want to be made aware of future product launches and information.<\/p>\n<p>With broadcasts, it\u2019s important not to bombard people with information but to engage them in a conversation. Try asking questions to see if they are interested and wish to continue. You should also offer multiple opportunities to end the conversation if they aren\u2019t interested.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Include augmented reality<\/h2>\n<p>Victoria Beckham is one of the few people to embrace augmented reality as part of her chatbot, and the results are seriously impressive. She&#8217;s owner of one of the best Facebook Messenger bots we&#8217;ve seen.\u00a0She uses it to allow users to use their camera try on her collection of sunglasses to see whether or not they would suit them. This is a great way to encourage conversions, which we are hoping to see more of in the future.

But how do you craft effective messages? We\u2019ve included some tips below for you to bear in mind when building your facebook chatbot.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Don\u2019t overdo it with the text<\/h3>\n<p>Your bot should never have more than three messages in a row without asking a question or providing options for a person to respond with. Messenger bots should be conversational, so make sure you only provide a couple of sentences per message. Remember it\u2019s a conversation, not an email.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Use emojis<\/h3>\n<p>Chatbots are meant to be much less formal than other methods of communication. Adding emojis can make the experience more fun and friendlier, while reducing the need for so many words.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"909ca0c3-6854-4c05-8a8b-4c8ce1bc9ba5\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-messenger-bots-emoji.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook messenger bots emojis\" width=\"896\" height=\"468\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>3. Use breaks between messages<\/h3>\n<p>Avoid using large blocks of text or swamping users with multiple messages immediately after one another by introducing text breaks into your conversation. We recommend two-three seconds between messages, much like a normal conversation.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Include images or GIFs<\/h3>\n<p>Make conversation feel more authentic with the inclusion of images and GIFs. It\u2019s okay to add humor to your bot, too, but do so with caution as people find different things funny.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Provide people with the option to unsubscribe<\/h3>\n<p>Make sure people have the option to unsubscribe if they want to. Although you want to build up your bot following, there is no point in having subscribers that aren\u2019t interested in your brand. You also don\u2019t want people to start resenting your brand for receiving unwanted messages they are unsure how to get rid of. The easiest way to allow people to unsubscribe is to add it into a \u201cBot settings\u201d option in the menu.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"16bd586f-e744-41ba-8b40-af76fe100f2c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-messenger-bots-settings.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook messenger bots settings\" width=\"750\" height=\"373\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"473305ac-a342-4652-9588-265137faade9\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-messenger-bots-unsubscribe.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook messenger bots unsubscribe\" width=\"745\" height=\"284\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">By clicking on \u201cSettings\u201d on this bot you are given the option to unsubscribe.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>6. Collect data from your subscribers for future targeting<\/h3>\n<p>Make use of the answers and information people give to your bot by tagging them and creating subgroups. This enables you to send broadcasts to certain caveats of people that have opted in and for you to retarget people that have shown an interest in a certain topic. This is another way of increasing customer lifetime value and keeping people in your sphere of influence by serving them content they want to see, thus heightening the chances of conversions.<\/p>\n<h2>Include Facebook Messenger in your marketing strategy<\/h2>\n<p>Before you go and set up a chatbot for Facebook Messenger to start increasing your conversions, we want to let you know that bots should be used in conjunction with other advertising formats. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/26\/how-to-use-chatbots-for-lead-generation\">Chatbots<\/a> are there to complement them and should not be used as a replacement.<\/p>\n<h3>About the author<\/h3>\n<p>Jordan Bucknell is\u00a0the CEO and founder of Upbeat Agency, a Facebook and Instagram ads agency based in London.
