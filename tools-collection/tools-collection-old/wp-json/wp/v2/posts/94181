It\u2019s the top-of-funnel, low-intent visitors; the ones looking for definitions, generic comparisons, and quick fixes.<\/p>\n<p>The clicks that drive revenue (the ones from people ready to buy, book, or sign up) are still there. The challenge now is to defend that ground, squeeze more value from every visit, and open new channels that AI can\u2019t take away.<\/p>\n<p>What follows is not a list of band-aid tips. It\u2019s a <strong>strategic, field-tested playbook<\/strong> for replacing the low-intent traffic AI has taken, maximizing what remains, and building a pipeline that\u2019s resilient no matter how search changes next.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd0e <strong>Need help understanding the modern rules for SEO?<\/strong> Download our free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/how-to-do-seo-right?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_SEOstrategies_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\/\">How to Do SEO Right\u2014Right Now!<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-get-more-out-of-the-traffic-you-still-have\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to get more out of the traffic you still have to hit your goals<\/h2>\n<p>When acquisition gets harder, efficiency becomes the growth lever.<\/p>\n<p>Every visitor now carries more weight because there are fewer of them\u2014and the proportion arriving with genuine purchase intent is higher than it was in the \u201cbig top-of-funnel\u201d days. If they click and you can\u2019t convert them, you\u2019ve wasted the most expensive part of the funnel.<\/p>\n<p>The first step isn\u2019t to replace lost visitors. It\u2019s to <strong>audit the revenue path for the visitors you still have<\/strong> and extract every bit of value before you spend a dollar or an hour chasing new clicks.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Run a conversion rate optimization (CRO) audit<\/h3>\n<p>If traffic is harder to win, every visit has to work harder for you. That\u2019s where CRO comes in. Doubling your conversion rate doesn\u2019t just give you more leads; it means you can hit the same revenue with half the traffic. Yet too many businesses treat <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/conversion-rate-optimization-marketing\">CRO<\/a> as a one-off project instead of an ongoing discipline.<\/p>\n<p>The stakes are higher now. As AI eats into low-intent clicks, the visitors who do make it to your site are more likely to be ready to buy. If your page loads slowly, your layout confuses them, or your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/09\/call-to-action\">CTAs<\/a> aren\u2019t clear, you\u2019re wasting the most valuable traffic you have\u2014and replacing those lost conversions costs far more than fixing them.<\/p>\n<h4>Real-world example<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/convertica.org\/ecommerce-case-study-36-increase-in-revenue-per-visitor-on-mobile\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Convertica<\/a> published a case study on a supplement ecommerce brand that redesigned its mobile product table into a slider to reduce endless scrolling.

Turn blog posts into lead magnets<\/h3>\n<p>AI can summarize your posts, but it can\u2019t give readers your unique resources. That\u2019s where <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/15\/lead-magnet-ideas\">blog-specific lead magnets<\/a> shine. When the download or template is directly tied to the article\u2019s topic, you\u2019re meeting the reader at their exact moment of intent and pulling them deeper into your funnel.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/blog-lead-magnet-example.webp\" alt=\"blog lead magnet example from lawn care company\" width=\"900\" height=\"703\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-94238\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/blog-lead-magnet-example.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/blog-lead-magnet-example-480x375.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getsunday.com\/shed\/lawn\/how-to-start-caring-for-your-lawn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This blog post<\/a> about caring for your lawn and finding a custom plan is accompanied by a form to get a custom plan.<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>Real-world example<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/tamara-omerovic-058775200\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tamara Omerovic<\/a>, Marketing Consultant at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/get-marketing-advice\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Marketing Advice<\/a> agency, has seen this play out firsthand: <em>\u201cAt Databox, we published articles teaching users how to build complex dashboards. After explaining the process, we offered a free, pre-built template. Because it solved the exact problem readers had, it converted exceptionally well.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>Mistake to avoid<\/h4>\n<p>Offering the same generic lead magnet site-wide. A vague \u201cjoin our newsletter\u201d box doesn\u2019t feel like a logical next step\u2014it feels like a distraction. A better approach is to treat every high-traffic article as its own conversion opportunity and match the offer precisely to what the reader needs next.<\/p>\n<h4>Action steps<\/h4>\n<p>Start with your top 20 posts. Ask yourself: <strong>what tool, template, or shortcut would help readers take action on the advice they just read? <\/strong>Build that resource, place it right in the article, and test different placements and headlines to see what drives the most signups.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Install exit-intent offers and popups<\/h3>\n<p>As overall traffic drops, capturing email or interest from departing visitors becomes essential for maintaining the pipeline. An <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/22\/popup-examples\">exit-intent popup<\/a> is your final chance to engage visitors who are about to leave. It can turn a loss into a lead or even a sale.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/exit-intent-pop-up-example-madewell.webp\" alt=\"exit intent popup example from madewell\" width=\"900\" height=\"542\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-94239\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/exit-intent-pop-up-example-madewell.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/exit-intent-pop-up-example-madewell-480x289.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.madewell.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Real-world example<\/h4>\n<p>Wisepops reports that the top-performing exit-intent popups (the top 10%) achieve conversion rates as high as <a href=\"https:\/\/wisepops.com\/blog\/exit-popup-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">19.6%<\/a>, while the average exit-intent popup still converts about 2.9% of abandoning visitors into customers or subscribers.<\/p>\n<p>But numbers only tell half the story. As <a href=\"https:\/\/oskarduberg.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Oskar Duberg<\/a>, a freelance content specialist, points out, \u201cExit popups don\u2019t have to be digital guilt trips. I\u2019ve always treated them like a friendly concierge: \u2018Before you go, here\u2019s something that might help.\u2019 Done well, they catch fence-sitters in a helpful way and lift conversions without leaving a sour taste.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The takeaway: The framing of the offer matters as much as the trigger itself. Treat the pop-up as helpful guidance, not a desperate grab for attention.<\/p>\n<h4>Action steps<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Test exit offers with real value (discount, resource, free trial).<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/personalized-marketing\">Personalize<\/a> based on user behavior (e.g., cart abandoners vs. blog readers).<\/li>\n<li>Exclude logged-in users or recent customers to avoid friction.<\/li>\n<li>Keep copy conversational and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/21\/features-vs-benefits\">benefit-driven<\/a> instead of pushy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>4. Use dynamic CTAs based on user intent<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019ve lost some top-of-funnel visitors, the traffic you still get is more varied\u2014and more precious. Serving each segment the next most logical step increases the odds they\u2019ll take it.<\/p>\n<p>A single static CTA assumes every visitor wants the same thing. They don\u2019t. Dynamic CTAs adapt to who\u2019s on your site and why they\u2019re there, increasing relevance and clicks.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/personalized-cta-examples-dentist.webp\" alt=\"personalized cta examples dentist\" width=\"835\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-94240\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/personalized-cta-examples-dentist.webp 835w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/personalized-cta-examples-dentist-480x460.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 835px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.turtlecreekdental.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This dentist<\/a> uses different CTAs depending on the intent of the section or page of their website.<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>Real-world example<\/h4>\n<p>HubSpot changes CTAs based on user history.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Returning visitors who\u2019ve downloaded a guide get invited to a webinar or trial.<\/li>\n<li>First-time blog readers get offered free templates.<\/li>\n<li>Product page visitors get a \u201cTalk to Sales\u201d option.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This progression ensures the CTA is contextually relevant, reducing friction.<\/p>\n<h4>Mistake to avoid<\/h4>\n<p>Over-personalizing without enough data. If your segments are too narrow or based on incomplete signals, you risk showing mismatched offers that confuse visitors.<\/p>\n<h4>Action steps<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Use tools like RightMessage, ConvertFlow, or HubSpot Smart CTAs.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/04\/customer-segmentation-models\">Segment<\/a> by traffic source, page type, or previous activity.<\/li>\n<li>Test different offers for each segment and measure CTR and conversion rate lift.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You cannot win the low\u2011intent game against AI. Instead, focus your resources where humans still click: specific, nuanced, commercial searches. These keywords reflect real purchase signals and give you an opening that AI cannot easily replicate.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Target long-tail, specific, purchase-ready keywords<\/h3>\n<p>AI summaries dominate at broad levels. But when queries get specific, AI cannot easily generalize, and users often click through to compare nuanced options.<\/p>\n<p>Think of \u201cbest CRM\u201d as a wide net, and \u201cbest CRM for freelance designers with client portals\u201d as a precision spear. Volume might be lower, but the value of each click is much higher because the searcher has a clear intent to convert.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s chasing head terms. I\u2019m hunting for bottom-of-the-funnel searches with verbs like \u2018compare,\u2019 \u2018best for X,\u2019 or \u2018vs.\u2019 That\u2019s where the wallet opens,\u201d said Tom. \u201cAI might answer the \u2018what,\u2019 but it struggles with the \u2018which one should I buy?\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/long-tail-keywords-example-mattress-comparison.webp\" alt=\"example of long tail high intent keyword targeting for mattress brands comparison\" width=\"900\" height=\"670\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-94246\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/long-tail-keywords-example-mattress-comparison.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/long-tail-keywords-example-mattress-comparison-480x357.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cTo find high-intent keywords AI hasn\u2019t saturated, I go straight to the voice of the customer on sales calls.

Update content to emphasize commercial intent<\/h3>\n<p>AI can summarize basic information. However, when content provides clear pathways toward decision-making\u2014features broken down, outcome-oriented comparisons, tangible tools\u2014readers are more likely to click and convert.<\/p>\n<p>If a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/09\/how-to-write-a-blog-post\">blog post<\/a> ranks but attracts the wrong type of reader, reframe it with mid- or bottom-of-funnel intent.

In two weeks, <strong>traffic rose <a href=\"https:\/\/outgrow.co\/blog\/interactive-case-study-venturepact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">15%<\/a>, conversion rates jumped 28%, and the campaign generated more than 11,500 qualified leads.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The same principle works on more traditional blog posts. Oskar shared that one of his clients had a DIY guide pulling heavy traffic but producing zero leads. By reframing the piece into \u201cDIY strategies (and when to get expert help),\u201d adding common pitfalls, and naturally positioning the service as the solution, the article began generating conversions. \u201cTraffic dipped slightly, but leads doubled,\u201d he explained.<\/p>\n<p>Together, these cases show that content isn\u2019t just about volume. It\u2019s about intent. Even small structural shifts\u2014like adding an interactive tool or reframing advice to highlight next steps\u2014can transform high-traffic dead ends into steady lead sources.<\/p>\n<h4>Mistake to avoid<\/h4>\n<p>Dropping product-focused CTAs into content that doesn\u2019t address the reader\u2019s next step. If the offer feels out of sync with the context, you lose trust instead of gaining leads.<\/p>\n<h4>Action steps<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/10\/content-audit\">Audit blog posts<\/a> that get high traffic but low conversions.<\/li>\n<li>Identify activation opportunities: places where a calculator, comparison, or widget fits naturally.<\/li>\n<li>Use tools like Outgrow to build simple, relevant interactive assets (estimators, checklists, ROI calculators).<\/li>\n<li>Reframe advice-driven content to highlight when your product\/service is the natural solution.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>7.

Launch a free tool or calculator<\/h3>\n<p>Tools don\u2019t just drive traffic. They generate engagement, leads, and backlinks over time.

Paid search only works when campaigns zero in on bottom-funnel intent. Tamara explains it bluntly: \u201cDon\u2019t waste budget trying to replace lost informational traffic.

Distribute content in non-Google channels<\/h3>\n<p>Audiences are discovering content outside of Google in places like LinkedIn, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/reddit-marketing\">Reddit<\/a>, Quora, and niche communities. When people search for expertise instead of keywords, they often start on these platforms.

By the time prospects book a call, they\u2019ve already seen our content, and half the selling is done.\u201d His perspective shows the difference between blasting content everywhere and placing it where trust naturally builds.<\/p>\n<h4>Mistake to avoid<\/h4>\n<p>Treating distribution as copy-paste. Dropping blog links into communities without adapting to each platform\u2019s norms makes you look out of touch and gets ignored.<\/p>\n<h4>Action steps<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Select 2-3 channels where your audience is already active (LinkedIn for B2B, Reddit for niche verticals, Quora for problem-driven searches).<\/li>\n<li>Rewrite content natively so it matches the platform\u2019s style and expectations.<\/li>\n<li>Use light-touch CTAs (profiles, signatures) rather than pushing links into every post.<\/li>\n<li>Track engagement across channels to refine where credibility compounds fastest.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>15.

By prioritizing bespoke insights instead of clickbait or generic pieces, they created material that is distinct and much harder for AI aggregators to replicate.<\/p>\n<p>The principle applies to any business. If you create content that originates from your own data, your customers\u2019 experiences, or your team\u2019s perspectives, AI cannot replicate it. That uniqueness becomes the foundation for authority and long-term visibility.<\/p>\n<h4>Action steps<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Conduct surveys, run experiments, or compile <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/2025-google-ads-benchmarks\">industry benchmarks<\/a> that no one else has.<\/li>\n<li>Integrate expert quotes and contrarian opinions to create perspective-driven content.<\/li>\n<li>Publish unique definitions or frameworks that others in your field will cite.<\/li>\n<li>Package findings in ways that can be referenced by both humans and search engines.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>17.

Optimize for rich snippets and structured data<\/h3>\n<p>Structured data helps both Google and AI parse your content more effectively, increasing the chances of visibility in rich snippets.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/featured-snippet-example-dog-brushing-png.webp\" alt=\"featured snippet example for how often to brush dogs teeth query\" width=\"1758\" height=\"728\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-90176\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/featured-snippet-example-dog-brushing-png.webp 1758w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/featured-snippet-example-dog-brushing-1280x530.webp 1280w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/featured-snippet-example-dog-brushing-980x406.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/featured-snippet-example-dog-brushing-480x199.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1758px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Real-world example<\/h4>\n<p>Vidio, one of Indonesia\u2019s largest OTT streaming platforms, implemented VideoObject structured data at scale and fixed unstable media URLs so Google could consistently fetch and parse their videos. Within a year, they saw about <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/case-studies\/vidio-case-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">3x more<\/a> video impressions and nearly 2x more video clicks from Google Search.<\/p>\n<h4>Action steps<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add schema markup (FAQ, HowTo, Review) to key pages.<\/li>\n<li>Use descriptive headers, bullet points, and numbered lists.<\/li>\n<li>Answer related sub-questions directly within your content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>19. Focus on topics that AI can\u2019t answer fully<\/h3>\n<p>AI often delivers surface-level responses. It struggles with nuance, brand voice, and niche complexity, especially in areas where local insights, cultural context, or brand differentiation matter most. That gap is an opportunity for content that goes deeper and answers what AI cannot.<\/p>\n<h4>Real-world example<\/h4>\n<p>DreamGen, a creative AI storytelling platform, had to compete with giants like Character.AI and AI Dungeon in late 2024. With little organic traffic or domain reputation, they carved out visibility by focusing on niche but intent-rich queries such as \u201cBest AI Character Apps\u201d and \u201cHow to Jailbreak ChatGPT.\u201d These <a href=\"https:\/\/www.embarque.io\/case-studies\/dreamgen-case-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">targeted angles aligned with their brand strengths and produced meaningful search traction even against larger players<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This strategy is echoed by Oskar, who says, \u201cI look for queries where AI answers are all surface and zero depth. If the response is just \u2018step 1: collect data, step 2: analyze it,\u2019 that\u2019s my cue to create a detailed, step-by-step guide with screenshots and real advice. AI leaves people hungry; our job is to feed them.\u201d His insight underlines why specificity wins. Where AI stops at the outline, your content can become the full meal.<\/p>\n<h4>Mistake to avoid<\/h4>\n<p>Targeting broad, AI-saturated keywords like \u201cAI writing tools\u201d or \u201cAI storytelling.\u201d These spaces are already flooded with generic content and rarely produce returns.<\/p>\n<h4>Action steps<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Audit AI-generated answers in tools like Google SGE or Perplexity to spot where responses are shallow.<\/li>\n<li>Identify gaps where expert insights, local examples, or brand-driven nuance can elevate the content.<\/li>\n<li>Produce detailed, practical content in those niches even if the search volume looks modest.<\/li>\n<li>Track performance for early signs of traction from long-tail and referral traffic.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>20. Contribute to high-authority sources<\/h3>\n<p>Even if AI tools extract answers from your site, they prioritize quoting or summarizing content from trusted domains\u2014citation equity matters.<\/p>\n<h4>Real-world example<\/h4>\n<p>Writesonic discusses how strategic PR placements (getting branded insights featured in respected media) can <a href=\"https:\/\/writesonic.com\/blog\/pr-for-ai_search-visibility\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">directly influence visibility in AI-generated search results<\/a>. These authoritative citations improve the likelihood that AI summaries will include your name, even if not clicking through to your site.<\/p>\n<h4>Mistake to avoid<\/h4>\n<p>Only publishing on your own site and hoping AI will discover it naturally. Instead, leverage placement on trusted external platforms.<\/p>\n<h4>Action steps<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Pitch guest articles or expert commentary to top industry blogs and media outlets.<\/li>\n<li>Respond to journalist requests via HARO, Qwoted, or similar platforms.<\/li>\n<li>Ensure your author bio includes links and references back to your owned properties.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Less traffic? No problem with these tips<\/h2>\n<p>The loss of low-intent traffic is a signal, not a sentence. AI is filtering out the fluff, and that forces us to sharpen our strategies\u2014focusing on conversions, owned channels, high-intent acquisition, and content AI can\u2019t replicate.<\/p>\n<p>Audit your current content this week. Flag what\u2019s losing traffic. Then decide: rework it, redirect it, or retire it. Fill the gaps with assets and campaigns that win in the AI-shaped search landscape.<\/p>\n<p>The marketers who make this shift now won\u2019t just recover lost ground\u2014they\u2019ll build a more resilient, more profitable engine for years to come.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many businesses are seeing traffic slashed due to search engine changes and AI impacts.
