Here are some basic February hashtags to play around with.<\/p>\n<h3>#Febsale<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re just getting started with your Instagram marketing, start basic with something as simple as a #Febsale. In the below example, the small business Mexicali took a snapshot of their ready-to-ship orders to promote their February sale and encourage people to buy.<\/p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t use a photo shoot or fancy Photoshop graphics; just a simple behind-the-scenes sneak peek and a caption that closes with a question.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/february20marketing20ideas20febsale.png\" alt=\"february marketing ideas febsale\" width=\"733\" height=\"468\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>#FebruaryFeels for mood<\/h3>\n<p>You don\u2019t need to have a sale for a February-friendly Instagram post. How about just appealing to your audience\u2019s mood during this time of year?<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/february20marketing20ideas20febuary20feels.png\" alt=\"february marketing ideas febuary feels\" width=\"745\" height=\"476\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Just make sure you\u2019re appealing to the mood of your specific audience in February as it relates to your business.

Can you repurpose any of them for a #FebruaryFeels-inspired <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/05\/customer-testimonials\">testimonial<\/a>, as the Australian Girls Choir does below?<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/february20marketing20ideas20febuary20feels20testimonial.png\" alt=\"february marketing ideas febuary feels testimonial\" width=\"745\" height=\"355\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>#FebruaryFavorites to promote other content<\/h3>\n<p>This is a good way to surface seasonal content or products or even to bring to light some of the forgotten ones.

These types of feature posts can get your employees, customers, and fans excited about your business. Plus, they\u2019ll want to share their \u201ccelebrity\u201d post with their network, which can help increase your reach.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/february20marketing20ideas20february20feature20employee.png\" alt=\"february marketing ideas february feature employee\" width=\"600\" height=\"424\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>#Februarychallenge<\/h3>\n<p>Many people are coming down off their New Year&#8217;s resolutions (or maybe they purposefully avoided making them). That makes this hashtag a great option for February. Use it to encourage your audience to take on a new task or reach a goal they&#8217;ve been eyeing.
