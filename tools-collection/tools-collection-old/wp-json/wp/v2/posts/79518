That may not be a secret, but it\u2019s certainly an uncomfortable reality for most. In a <a href=\"https:\/\/about.ads.microsoft.com\/en-us\/insights\/g\/in-brands-we-trust-the-intersection-of-privacy-and-trust-in-the-age-of-the-empowered-consumer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2020 study<\/a>, 91% of respondents were concerned about the amount of data companies can collect about them. Today, we\u2019re seeing legislation slowly catch up to these concerns, and Big Tech companies are rolling out new privacy solutions to minimize abuse and anonymize the data they collect from users. But consumers are still skeptical and frequently opting to find their own way to explore the web, privately.<\/p>\n<p>This growing audience of privacy-minded searchers is increasingly abandoning Google for a search engine with this goal in mind, DuckDuckGo. So, is DuckDuckGo legit? If so, what do you need to know about it? We&#8217;re sharing all the answers.<\/p>\n<h3>Table of contents<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#what-is-duckduckgo\">What is DuckDuckGo?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#duckduckgo-statistics\">DuckDuckGo statistics and facts you need to know<\/a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#how-many-people-use-duckduckgo\">How many people use DuckDuckGo?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#who-uses-duckduckgo\">Who uses DuckDuckGo?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#how-do-people-search-on-duckduckgo\">How do people search on DuckDuckGo?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#where-do-people-use-duckduckgo\">Where do they use DuckDuckGo?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#are-people-using-only-duckduckgo\">Are people using <em>only<\/em> DuckDuckGo?<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#how-to-advertise-on-duckduckgo\">How can you advertise on DuckDuckGo?<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"what-is-duckduckgo\"><\/div>\n<h2>What is DuckDuckGo?<\/h2>\n<p>DuckDuckGo is an emerging search engine that should look and feel similar to what users should expect from Google or Microsoft (although they&#8217;ve been around since 2008!). From DuckDuckGo.com, searchers can find answers to their queries collected from <a href=\"https:\/\/duckduckgo.com\/duckduckgo-help-pages\/results\/sources\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">countless sources<\/a>, oftentimes indexed from their own crawler (DuckDuckBot.) More than just links\u2014the DuckDuckGo SERP includes common features like maps, weather, local business information, images, videos, shopping\u2014and even ads.<\/p>\n<p>And just like Google and Microsoft, DuckDuckGo also offers its own <a href=\"https:\/\/duckduckgo.com\/app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">web browsers<\/a> for desktop and mobile devices and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.spreadprivacy.com\/protect-your-inbox-with-duckduckgo-email-protection\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free personal email<\/a> services. The suite of products from DuckDuckGo is very comparable to what most would expect from other major search networks.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/what-is-duckduckgo.webp\" alt=\"screenshot of duckduckgo on mobile and desktop\" width=\"936\" height=\"578\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-79523\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/what-is-duckduckgo.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/what-is-duckduckgo-480x296.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The key differentiator that DuckDuckGo highlights in its suite is its high focus on its user\u2019s privacy. Unlike Google and Microsoft\u2019s search engines, browsers, and other products\u2014DuckDuckGo does not create unique cookies, store your IP addresses, search and browsing history, or any other unique identifiers. DuckDuckGo has none of your personal information and therefore has never sold any personal information. DuckDuckGo is always encrypted, and privacy is its core value.<\/p>\n<p>Most tech companies\u2019 privacy policies are tombs of legalese. <a href=\"https:\/\/duckduckgo.com\/privacy?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DuckDuckGo\u2019s privacy policy<\/a> opens simply and shortly: \u201cWe don\u2019t track you. That\u2019s our privacy policy in a nutshell.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>DuckDuckGo\u2019s unique respect for its users&#8217; privacy has earned it more praise and attention over the past few years and it\u2019s quickly emerging as more than just a niche tertiary search engine into a more prominent alternative to Google. As DuckDuckGo\u2019s user base grows, so does its opportunity for savvy marketers to reach a very unique audience that are ditching Google.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 Want to learn more about search engine marketing? <strong>Get the free guide &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLPPC101.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_PPC101_Download\">PPC 101<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"duckduckgo-statistics\"><\/div>\n<h2>5 DuckDuckGo statistics you need to know<\/h2>\n<p>To learn more about this new audience, I\u2019ve collected several fascinating statistics from DuckDuckGo.<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-many-people-use-duckduckgo\"><\/div>\n<h3>1. How many people use DuckDuckGo?<\/h3>\n<p>When looking into DuckDuckGo, your first question is probably how many people use it? How often are they searching?<\/p>\n<p>Today, 3.1 billion searches occur on DuckDuckGo every month. DuckDuckGo has grown its audience to over 46 million users around the world. And although that may be just a small fraction when compared to Google\u2019s impressive reach\u2014many people who search on DuckDuckGo do so because they no longer trust Google with their data. 6.4 million users on DuckDuckGo can\u2019t be reached on Google Search.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/duckduckgo-statistics.webp\" alt=\"three duckduckgo statistics\" width=\"936\" height=\"272\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-79524\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/duckduckgo-statistics.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/duckduckgo-statistics-480x139.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"who-uses-duckduckgo\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Who uses DuckDuckGo?<\/h3>\n<p>Both Google and Bing see roughly a 50\/50 split between male and female audiences. Interestingly\u2014DuckDuckGo has a slight skew along gender lines, with nearly 60% of their traffic from males.<\/p>\n<p>The age demographics of DuckDuckGo users are similar to that of Google and Bing\u2019s, with a small promising growth in the younger 18-24 age range.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/duckduckgo-demographics.webp\" alt=\"chart showing duckduckgo user demographics by gender\" width=\"936\" height=\"514\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-79526\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/duckduckgo-demographics.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/duckduckgo-demographics-480x264.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The income distribution of DuckDuckGo\u2019s audience is really where it shines to most marketers. DuckDuckGo attracts a small but very affluent audience. The median income in the US is about $44,000, but more than 85% of DuckDuckGo\u2019s users make above that average income\u2014with over 60% of them making at least $100,000!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/duckduckgo-user-income.webp\" alt=\"chart showing duckduckgo users by income\" width=\"936\" height=\"535\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-79527\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/duckduckgo-user-income.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/duckduckgo-user-income-480x274.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"how-do-people-search-on-duckduckgo\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. How do people search on DuckDuckGo?<\/h3>\n<p>Google prides itself on its \u201cmobile-first\u201d mantra\u2014and for the better half of the last decade, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/13\/google-ads-mobile-benchmarks\">mobile has made up most Google\u2019s reach<\/a>. Microsoft\u2014and it\u2019s personal computing dominance\u2014has strongly cemented its own <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/11\/19\/who-uses-bing-anyway\">Bing search engine as a major player in the desktop search market<\/a>. Privacy-focused DuckDuckGo users actively take their preferences across both devices. In the US, over 15 million searchers use DuckDuckGo on both desktop and mobile\u2014with less than 5 million using the privacy-focused search engine on just one device.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/duckduckgo-unique-users.webp\" alt=\"chart showing duckduckgo unique users by device\" width=\"936\" height=\"491\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-79525\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/duckduckgo-unique-users.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/duckduckgo-unique-users-480x252.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Interestingly, these over 20 million mobile searchers help catapult <a href=\"https:\/\/radar.cloudflare.com\/reports\/searchengines-2023-q2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DuckDuckGo to the #2 search engine on mobile in the USA.<\/a> Still considerably behind Google\u2019s massive mobile dominance, these 20 million users still make up a sizable population of the US market.<\/p>\n<div id=\"where-do-people-use-duckduckgo\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Where do people use DuckDuckGo?<\/h3>\n<p>DuckDuckGo is headquartered in Pennsylvania and for most of its history has been an emerging competitor in the US Search Market. But as Google has struggled to calm privacy concerns across the globe, it has been successful in taking market share from the search giant in several major international markets. Today, DuckDuckGo makes up about 1% of all mobile searches in the United Kingdom and Germany and 2% of mobile searches in the United States. Similarly, DuckDuckGo makes up about 2% of all desktop searches within the United Kingdom and Germany and about 3% within the US.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/duckduckgo-market-share.webp\" alt=\"chart showing duckduckgo market share across us, germany and uk\" width=\"936\" height=\"513\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-79528\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/duckduckgo-market-share.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/duckduckgo-market-share-480x263.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Roughly 58% of all of DuckDuckGo\u2019s searches come from the United States. DuckDuckGo\u2019s major international markets are in Europe, Canada, and Australia\u2014where it receives 22%, 3%, and 2% of its remaining traffic, respectively.<\/p>\n<div id=\"are-people-using-only-duckduckgo\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Are people using only DuckDuckGo to search?<\/h3>\n<p>The primary reason people start using DuckDuckGo is because they want the privacy that they can\u2019t get from other search engines, browsers, and email services. DuckDuckGo isn\u2019t the default search engine or browser on any device\u2014searchers generally have to manually update their preferences to make the switch to DuckDuckGo. Given that active decision\u2014most users don\u2019t readily switch between the privacy-focused search engine and its traditional competitors. Three-quarters of DuckDuckGo searchers don\u2019t use Google search at all and 69% don\u2019t use Bing either.<\/p>\n<p>This means that these searches on DuckDuckGo are a unique audience that you simply cannot reach if you\u2019re simply just advertising on Google Ads.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/duckduckgo-reach.webp\" alt=\"chart showing duckduckgo reach\" width=\"936\" height=\"480\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-79529\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/duckduckgo-reach.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/duckduckgo-reach-480x246.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 Worried you&#8217;re wasting spend in Google Ads?

DuckDuckGo prominently displays paid search ads atop their SERP like other search engines, but it doesn\u2019t have its own ad platform like Google or Bing. Instead, DuckDuckGo partners directly with Microsoft Advertising as an exclusive premium search partner.<\/p>\n<p>To advertise on the DuckDuckGo SERP, first create a <a href=\"https:\/\/ads.microsoft.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft Advertising<\/a> account.
