That\u2019s alarming, to say the least.

Here\u2019s seven of \u2019em.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Your payment didn\u2019t go through<\/h3>\n<p>If, like a lot of advertisers, you\u2019re paying for your Google Ads account via automatic payments, Google will charge you when (1) you reach your pre-set payment threshold or (2) you reach the end of your current billing period. It depends on which happens first.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, in order for these transactions to go smoothly, the payment information linked to your account needs to be valid and up-to-date. If Google can\u2019t charge you, your ads won\u2019t show up in the search results.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Your bids are either too high or too low<\/h3>\n<p>As you may know, you have to set a daily budget for each of your Google Ads campaigns. If the maximum cost per click (CPC) bid you set for a particular keyword exceeds the budget of the campaign it lives within, your ads won\u2019t show for queries that match to that keyword. Make sure your account is free of these conflicts between campaign budgets and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/11\/easy-adwords-bidding-strategies\">keyword bids<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>At the other end of the spectrum, your Google ads may not be showing because your bids are too <em>low<\/em>. Your ad rank for a given <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/articles\/what-is-google-adwords\">auction<\/a> depends on your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/articles\/ultimate-quality-score-guide\">quality score<\/a> for the keyword you\u2019re bidding on as well as the bid itself. If you navigate to the <strong>Keywords<\/strong> section of your Google Ads account, you can use <strong>bid simulators<\/strong> to estimate the impact of increasing your bids by different amounts.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-not-showing-bid-simulators.png\" alt=\"Google Ads Not Showing Bid Simulator\" width=\"764\" height=\"191\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>You can add any of these columns to your Keywords report.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>3. Keyword search volume is too low<\/h3>\n<p>If a keyword you\u2019re targeting drives little to no search traffic on a monthly basis, the ads you have tied to that keyword may be ineligible to show. Once Google notices that you\u2019re targeting an extremely <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/07\/low-search-volume-keywords\">low-volume keyword<\/a>, it\u2019ll make it temporarily inactive within your account. If search volume picks up to a reasonable level, Google will automatically reactive the keyword.<\/p>\n<p>Tactically, however, simply waiting around for volume to increase isn\u2019t exactly a good idea. Using Google\u2019s Keyword Planner (which comes with your Google Ads account) or our very own <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a>, you should try your best to find a similar keyword with substantial volume.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Your ad has been paused, removed, or disapproved<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s possible that your Google ads aren\u2019t showing simply because they\u2019ve been paused\u2014or because the ad groups or campaigns that house them have been paused. If this is the case, all you need to do is switch them from <strong>Paused<\/strong> to <strong>Enabled<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Alternatively, your ads may not be showing because they\u2014or their corresponding ad groups or campaigns\u2014have been removed from your account for one reason or another. Unfortunately, if this is indeed the case, you\u2019ll have to start from scratch.<\/p>\n<p>To see if you\u2019ve accidentally paused or removed anything within your account, simply navigate to <strong>Change History<\/strong>. Here, you can see the changes that have been made to your account and filter by <strong>Status<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-not-showing-change-history.jpg\" alt=\"google-ads-not-showing-change-history-filters\" width=\"224\" height=\"255\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve made sure nothing\u2019s been paused or removed and you\u2019re <em>still<\/em> not seeing your Google ads show up in the search results, it\u2019s possible that they\u2019ve been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/23\/google-ads-disapprovals\">disapproved<\/a>. Obviously, any ad that\u2019s been disapproved is ineligible to show to users. To learn how you can fix your disapproved ads and get them back on the SERPs, <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adspolicy\/answer\/6008942?visit_id=636990569515206849-3096691310&amp;rd=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">check out Google\u2019s ad policies<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">5. There\u2019s a scheduling or targeting mistake<\/h3>\n<p>Just as you set a budget for each of your Google Ads campaigns, you also set an advertising schedule for each campaign\u2014thus allowing you to tell Google which days of the week and hours of the day you\u2019d like your ads to show. Navigate to the <strong>Ad Schedule<\/strong> tab of the campaign you\u2019re concerned about and make sure your ads aren\u2019t scheduled too narrowly.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-not-showing-ad-schedule.png\" alt=\"google-ads-not-showing-ad-schedule-tab\" width=\"785\" height=\"304\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Next to that Ad Schedule tab you\u2019ll also find the location targeting parameters for your campaign. It\u2019s possible that your Google ads aren\u2019t showing simply because there\u2019s not enough keyword search traffic coming from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/geo-targeting\">the geographic region you\u2019re targeting<\/a>. Once again, you\u2019ll want to make sure this campaign setting isn\u2019t too narrow.<br \/>\n<strong>Pro tip:<\/strong> If you want to see how a particular segment of your prospects respond to your ads without <em>exclusively<\/em> advertising to that segment, you can use the <strong>Observation<\/strong> setting rather than the <strong>Targeting<\/strong> setting. Whereas targeting limits you to reaching <em>only<\/em> a specific audience, observing enables you to reach a wide audience while tracking the performance of your ads among a specific audience. That way, you\u2019re gleaning valuable insights without going too narrow.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">6. Negative keywords are negating active keywords<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/06\/negative-keyword-guide\">Negative keywords<\/a>\u2014which enable you to keep your ads from matching to irrelevant queries\u2014can be set at the ad group level and the campaign level. If some of your Google ads aren\u2019t showing, it may be because you have negative keywords canceling out active keywords.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-not-showing-negative-keywords.png\" alt=\"google-ads-not-showing-tweak-negative-keywords\" width=\"670\" height=\"152\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><br \/>\nAs an example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re bidding on the phrase match keyword \u201cCRM free trial\u201d and you\u2019ve set <strong>free CRM<\/strong> as a campaign-level <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/31\/negative-match-types\">broad match negative<\/a>. In this case, the negative keyword would override the active keyword. To fix this, you\u2019d simply need to switch from the broad match negative <strong>free CRM<\/strong> to the exact match negative [free CRM]. Doing so would allow you to advertise to users looking for a free trial of a CRM while simultaneously withholding your ads from users looking for a CRM that doesn\u2019t cost anything.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">7. Your negative bid adjustments are too large<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before we move onto <strong>performance-related<\/strong> issues that can keep your Google ads from showing, we\u2019ve got one last scenario to cover: The negative <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/04\/09\/combined-bid-adjustments\">bid adjustments<\/a> you\u2019ve set are so large that they\u2019re tanking your ad rank.<\/p>\n<p>Negative bid adjustments\u2014which allow you to automatically decrease your bids within a particular campaign under specific circumstances\u2014can be set on a number of different parameters: device type, time of day, location, and so on. As effective as this capability can be, if the negative bid adjustments you\u2019re setting are too extreme, it\u2019s entirely possible that you\u2019re knocking yourself out of the ad competition.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-not-showing-negative-bid-adjustments.png\" alt=\"google-ads-not-showing-negative-bid-adjustments-too-big\" width=\"355\" height=\"279\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Negative bid adjustments set on certain times of day (which I can\u2019t reveal!).<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Once again, using the simulated bid columns within your Keywords report will prove helpful.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Google ads not showing: Performance issues<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sometimes, you\u2019ll find that your Google ads aren\u2019t showing because you\u2019re not quite meeting Google\u2019s standards when it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/24\/ppc-performance\">PPC best practices<\/a>. In other words: There are times when getting your Google ads to show is a matter of <strong>optimization<\/strong>. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll be talking about for the remainder of this guide.<\/p>\n<p>(Because optimization is trickier than adjusting a negative keyword match type or correcting your credit card information, these sections will be a bit longer than the previous ones.)<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; align-content: space-evenly; border-top: 1px solid #000; border-bottom: 1px solid #000; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly; padding-top: 50px; padding-bottom: 50px;\">\n<div style=\"margin: auto; display: flex; flex-direction: row; flex-wrap: wrap; align-items: flex-start;\">\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px !important; padding-right: 10px;\">Brought to you by<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/WS-Logo-2023.webp\" alt=\"wordstream logo\" width=\"130\" height=\"auto\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 30px !important; text-align: center; margin-top: 5px;\">Ready to grow your business?<\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin: auto; width: 70%; padding-bottom: 25px;\">\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px; text-align: center;\">Unlock the results you\u2019re looking for with technology-backed solutions designed for small businesses and agencies.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"margin: auto;\"><a style=\"padding: 10px 50px; border-radius: 24px; background-color: #0047ff; color: #f9f5ea; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;\" onmouseover=\"this.style.background='#0097ff'\" onmouseout=\"this.style.background='#0047ff'\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/marketing-services?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Demo_Blog_Demo&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links&amp;itm_content=incontent_links_htmldesign\">Get your free demo<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">8. Your ad group isn\u2019t focused<\/h3>\n<p>Each of the ad groups within your Google Ads account consists of two components: keywords and ads. There\u2019s a reason Google houses them under the same roof: The keywords and ads living within the same ad group are <strong>tied together<\/strong>. When one of your keywords is triggered by a user\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/05\/25\/keywords-vs-search-queries\">search query<\/a> and you\u2019re entered into the ad auction, Google knows to select one of the ads that you\u2019ve tied to that keyword.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-not-showing-ad-group.png\" alt=\"google-ads-not-showing-ad-group-structure\" width=\"421\" height=\"511\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Your performance in the ad auction depends on how relevant your ad is to the user\u2019s query; the more relevant your ad, the higher you\u2019ll rank in the paid search results. This brings me to the key question: <em>How do you make sure your ad is relevant to the query?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Short answer: by building ad groups that are comprised of <strong>closely related keywords<\/strong>. If the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords\">keywords<\/a> within your ad group are closely related to one another, it\u2019s practically guaranteed that your ad will be relevant to the user\u2019s query\u2014no matter which keyword is triggered, no matter which ad is selected.<\/p>\n<p>The fact that your Google ads aren\u2019t showing may be due to the structure of your ad groups. If you find that you\u2019ve built\u00a0your ad groups with keywords that aren\u2019t closely related to one another, that\u2019s likely the reason you\u2019re not performing as well as you\u2019d like to in the ad auction.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p><strong>\u2734\ufe0f Free guide:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLAccountStructure.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_LastAccountStructureGuide_Download\">The Last Guide to Google Ads Account Structure You&#8217;ll Ever Need<\/a><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h3>9. Your ad copy isn\u2019t optimized<\/h3>\n<p>Making sure your ads are relevant to your prospects\u2019 search queries doesn\u2019t start and end with building focused ad groups; it\u2019s equally important that you <strong>optimize your ad copy<\/strong>. Fortunately, this is a bit more straightforward than optimizing your ad group structure.<br \/>\nIn a nutshell, optimizing an ad to rank highly in the paid search results means <strong>incorporating your target keyword into your copy<\/strong>. By writing copy that includes your target keyword, you\u2019re effectively signaling to Google that your ad is relevant to the user\u2019s search query.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-not-showing-optimized-ad-copy.png\" alt=\"Google Ads Not Showing Ad Copy\" width=\"661\" height=\"382\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">(Are you sensing a theme here? Good! When your Google ads aren\u2019t showing and you need to optimize, relevance is the name of the game.)<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully, this sheds some additional light on my previous recommendations regarding ad group structure. Within a given ad group, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/28\/how-to-advertise-online\">you should have more keywords than ads<\/a>. If you\u2019ve ensured that these keywords are closely related to one another, it\u2019ll be infinitely easier to incorporate them into your copy.<\/p>\n<p>Think of it this way: If you housed the keywords \u201cdog food\u201d and \u201c10 foot dog leash\u201d within the same ad group, it would be pretty tough to write copy that incorporates both of those, right? By contrast, if you housed the keywords \u201cdog food\u201d and \u201cdog snacks\u201d within the same ad group, you\u2019d be in great shape.<\/p>\n<p>The bottom line: Your Google ads may not be showing simply because your copy isn\u2019t keyword-focused enough.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">10. Your landing page isn\u2019t relevant<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When judging whether you deserve to rank highly in the paid search results, Google doesn\u2019t simply look at the relevance of your ad copy\u2014it also looks at the relevance of your <strong>landing page<\/strong>. Essentially, if your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/21\/landing-page-designs\">landing page<\/a> fails to help users do what they need to do\u2014as signified by the intent behind their search queries\u2014you\u2019ll do poorly in the ad auction.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what that means for you: You need to look closely at each of the keywords you\u2019re targeting with your Google ads. Think about the users whose queries are triggering these keywords. What are they struggling with? What are they trying to accomplish? What can you do to help them out?<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-not-showing-landing-page-relevance.png\" alt=\"Google Ads Not Showing Landing Page\" width=\"706\" height=\"415\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Landing page for an ad triggered by the query \u201ccollaboration software.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Your answers to these questions should inform the content on your landing pages<\/strong>. The better you are at solving users\u2019 problems with your landing pages, the better you\u2019ll perform in the Google Ads auction. For good measure, you should also make sure to incorporate your target keywords in your landing page copy. That can only help you out.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">11. Your click-through rate is too low<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One last explanation as to why your Google ads aren\u2019t showing is <strong>click-through rate<\/strong>\u2014the rate at which your ads turn impressions into clicks. From a practical standpoint, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/11\/average-click-through-rate\">CTR<\/a> of your ad indicates how appealing it is to your prospects. If your ad\u2019s CTR is high, that means your messaging is resonating with users really well; if your ad\u2019s CTR is low, the opposite is true.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Google rewards advertisers who write ads that resonate with users<\/strong>. So, the lower your CTR for a given ad (or keyword), the worse you can expect to perform in the ad auction. If you want to give your ad a better chance of consistently showing to your prospects, you need to write copy that grabs their attention and compels them to click.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-not-showing-improve-click-through-rate.png\" alt=\"google-ads-not-showing-write-better-ad-copy\" width=\"659\" height=\"260\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Believe it or not, our advice for writing ad copy that compels users to click is basically the same as our advice for creating hyper-relevant landing pages: You need to look at the keyword your ad is targeting, think about the users who are triggering that keyword, and identify the specific problem or pain point you need to address. In other words, writing an ad that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/08\/12\/ad-ctr\">drives a high CTR<\/a> is all about meeting the unique needs of your prospects <strong>according to their position along the customer journey<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Prospects at the beginning of their customer journeys (near the top of your marketing funnel) typically appreciate ads that provide relevant information and answer their questions. Prospects at the end of their customer journeys (near the bottom of your marketing funnel) typically appreciate ads that enable them to convert or make a purchase.<\/p>\n<p>If your Google ads aren\u2019t showing and you can attribute it to low CTRs, take a close look at your ad copy and judge whether you\u2019re doing a good enough job of mapping keywords to the customer journey and addressing users\u2019 needs.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Google ads not showing: The big picture<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Realizing that your Google ads aren\u2019t showing can be a scary and confusing moment for a digital marketer or a business owner. It\u2019s all too easy to start panicking and let your mind go in a million different directions.<\/p>\n<p>As much as we can relate to that, it\u2019s important to recognize that there\u2019s <strong>a perfectly reasonable explanation<\/strong> as to why your Google ads aren\u2019t showing. Whether the issue is performance-based or not, there\u2019s always something you can do to right the ship and get your ads in front of your prospects once again.<\/p>\n<p>And as we mentioned above, you can detect performance issues using our <strong><a href=\"\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">free Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If your Google ads aren&#8217;t showing, don&#8217;t panic: There&#8217;s a perfectly reasonable (and fixable) explanation.
