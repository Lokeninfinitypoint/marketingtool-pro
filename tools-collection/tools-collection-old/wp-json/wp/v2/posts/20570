According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.invespcro.com\/blog\/effectiveness-online-advertising\/\">Invesp<\/a>, the average person is served 1,700 banner ads per month, yet only half of those ads will ever be viewed. In a saturated environment such as the food and restaurant industry, new names often get lost in the sea of competition. If you fail to impress, your hard work in creating your restaurant ad will go to waste.<\/p>\n<p>Laid the groundwork for your next food ad campaign yet? Whether you are launching a new menu item, creating awareness for your newly minted restaurant or working to grow your online audience, you will need to stay laser-focused on that objective. It may sound simple, but you\u2019ll be surprised to know that many brands have lost their way in the name of differentiating themselves from the masses.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s dive into 10 tips that will make your food advertisements way more effective.<\/p>\n<p>PS: For tips on Facebook advertising during COVID-19, check out this post:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/11\/facebook-for-restaurants-during-covid-19\">5 Ways Restaurants Can Use Facebook Ads During COVID-19<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Food ad tip #1: Strike a chord with your diners<\/h2>\n<p>Your restaurant ad has the power to communicate a compelling message to your diners. Brands are like people, each one with a unique personality and values. If your restaurant was a person, what would he or she sound like? And what kind of message would you like to communicate? No one is going to pay attention to noise. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.neurosciencemarketing.com\/blog\/articles\/emotional-ads-work-best.htm\">NeuroMarketing<\/a>, campaigns with purely emotional content perform nearly twice as well as those with purely rational content!<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/84OT0NLlqfM?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>We loved how Coca-Cola stood for eliminating social prejudice in its <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/84OT0NLlqfM\">Remove Labels This Ramadan<\/a> campaign. Many viewers connected with Coca-Cola\u2019s universal message. It\u2019s no surprise that the campaign resulted in a whopping 51% increase in consumption of their products.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/11\/09\/emotional-ads\">emotional content<\/a>, consider this: What message do you, as a restaurant, want to send to your diners? Perhaps your restaurant is combatting food waste. Or maybe the importance of using organic ingredients? They say birds of the same feather flock together. So don\u2019t be afraid to show the world what your restaurant genuinely cares for!<\/p>\n<h2>Food ad tip #2: Keep it interesting with visual storytelling<\/h2>\n<p>Nothing will annoy your audiences more than to see the same old ideas rehashed by so many brands! Switching your ad up with novel images can be refreshing in the eyes of your diners. They say a picture speaks a thousand words, and perhaps it\u2019s true! 55% of audiences actually recall content more when images are included.<\/p>\n<p>Today, the attention of consumers lasts for only about 8 seconds. So it will be smart for you to tell your restaurant\u2019s story by exploring with images.<\/p>\n<p>Visual storytelling involves showing, rather than telling. But there\u2019s just one small problem \u2013 not all of us are as creative as we wish we were. And not all of us are born master storytellers either. But that\u2019s okay! There are many <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/visual-stories\/10-simple-rules-of-visual-storytelling-4ee868498447#.xfo8kfi1v\">tried and tested principles<\/a> to storytelling that can guide you along. Whenever you watch a movie, you\u2019re being exposed to storytelling too. Whether your food ad runs on Facebook, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/06\/instagram-marketing-for-restaurants\">Instagram<\/a>, Pinterest or YouTube, they can all tell a story. Ultimately, it\u2019s all about nailing the imagery and representation of your restaurant.<\/p>\n<h2>Food ad tip #3:\u00a0 Play around with color<\/h2>\n<p>Colors aren\u2019t just fun \u2013 when used effectively, they can affect consumer behavior too. A quick look at different <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/20\/facebook-ads-for-restaurants\">restaurant ads<\/a> around you will reveal a trend. You\u2019ll notice that ads for fast food chains tend to use brighter colors that reflect energy while <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/15\/luxury-marketing-strategies\">luxury ads<\/a> often use darker colors to represent authority and sleekness.<\/p>\n<p>This infographic on the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kissmetrics.com\/color-psychology\/\">psychology of colors and consumer behavior<\/a> by Kissmetrics sums it up pretty well!<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/color-psychology-in-food-ads1.png\" alt=\"Color psychology in food ads\" width=\"800\" height=\"622\" \/><\/div>\n<p>While you play around with color, don\u2019t forget about creating contrast as well. Using red text against a cyan background, for instance, is only setting your diners up for a terrible eyesore. Your diners want to know more about what you have to offer, but if they can\u2019t look beyond the jarring colors, your ad has miserably failed. Contrast is key. If your dish features light colors, it\u2019s probably a good idea to stay away from a white background.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-websites-design-examples-mida.png\" alt=\"restaurant website design examples - mida\" width=\"720\" height=\"463\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-69654\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-websites-design-examples-mida.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-websites-design-examples-mida-480x309.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/18\/restaurant-website-designs\"><em>Check out more restaurant website examples here.<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Food ad tip #4:\u00a0 Don\u2019t claim to be something you\u2019re not<\/h2>\n<p><em>\u201cWe are vegan-friendly! We use fresh ingredients only!\u201d <\/em><\/p>\n<p>These claims are often used today to entice consumers, who are more discerning than ever in making their food choices. Facts build credibility, which is extremely crucial. In fact, 54% of users don\u2019t click on banner ads purely because they don\u2019t trust them. In the hopes of attracting your customers to your restaurant, be sure not to fall into the trap of deceptive advertising.<\/p>\n<p>In 2010, Kellogg\u2019s was accused of misleading consumers through their claims of Rice Krispies\u2019 \u201cimmunity-boosting\u201d properties. The ads were then put to a halt by the Federal Trade Commission.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/food-restaurant-advertising-rice-krispies-immunity-claim.png\" alt=\"Food and restaurant advertising tips Rice Krispies misleading immunity claim\" width=\"602\" height=\"802\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Draw the line between making an enticing offer and claiming to be something that you\u2019re not. Be sure to verify your sources before launching anything that can potentially cause more harm to your restaurant than good.<\/p>\n<h2>Food ad tip #5: Stay on top of trends in the food industry<\/h2>\n<p>You may not be a social media fanatic or active on half a dozen communication channels. And that\u2019s okay. But knowing what\u2019s trending among your diners can provide you with that small window of opportunity to skyrocket your sales.<\/p>\n<p>Remember when Pokemon Go took the Internet by storm? Try creating your food ads around a trending restaurant topic or even have dine-in deals associated with a trending event. Don\u2019t be afraid to jump on the bandwagon! You\u2019d be surprised at how it can help to boost your business.<\/p>\n<p>Google Trends is a free tool that <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/14\/restaurant-marketing\">restaurant owners and marketers<\/a> can leverage when it comes to monitoring <a href=\"\/search-trends\">search trends<\/a> based on keywords worldwide, or specific to regions. For example if you type \u201ccookies\u201d into Google Trends, you will see that the searches have spiked every December for the past 5 years, which is around the holiday season.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-trends-food-advertising.png\" alt=\"Google Trends food advertising\" width=\"1170\" height=\"583\" \/><\/div>\n<p>There are many examples of brands hijacking trends, but this one has got to be one of our favorites. The Internet got so excited over solar eclipses that when it happened in March 2015, Oreo converted the hype over the natural phenomenon into their biggest sales month ever. We\u2019re talking about a 35% increase in sales that month alone. Curious to know how they achieved such advertising success?

With so many platforms to choose from, where do you get started? From social media (which is great for getting personal with your diners, by the way) to websites, blogs and even offline platforms, every platform is an opportunity to put your restaurant out there. Are your diners requesting for take-away orders or wish they could order food online from your platforms? Making your mark in the right place is essential.<\/p>\n<p>We can all learn from Domino\u2019s brilliant marketing campaign. Just by enabling users to order their pizza directly via Twitter, Domino\u2019s gained media coverage from media companies such as USA Today and Forbes. More importantly, more than 50% of Domino\u2019s orders come from digital channels today.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/food-restaurant-advertising-dominos-pizza-easy-order.png\" alt=\"Food and restaurant advertising tips Domino's Pizza easy order process\" width=\"1100\" height=\"1304\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Domino\u2019s step-by-step instructions on how to order via the Twitter hashtag #EasyOrder<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Food ad tip #7: Be effective when asking for an action from your audience<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019ve created a great restaurant advertisement.
