Seeing ads that are relevant to your interests isn\u2019t as creepy anymore, but almost expected<strong>. <\/strong>In fact, <a href=\"http:\/\/janrain.com\/about\/newsroom\/press-releases\/online-consumers-fed-up-with-irrelevant-content-on-favorite-websites-according-to-janrain-study\/\"><strong>74% percent<\/strong><\/a><strong> of online consumers get frustrated with companies when content has nothing to do with their interests<\/strong>, and one-third of marketers see personalization as the most important capability to the future of marketing, according to an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cmo.com\/articles\/2015\/2\/18\/mind-blowing-stats-personalization.html\">Adobe study<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Personalization has become essential for businesses to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/24\/brand-marketing\">compete with other brands online<\/a>. We live in a world where we can order our go-to Starbucks latte through the app and have our red holiday cup marked with our name on it before we even arrive at the store \u2013 and people expect exactly the same kind of experience online.<\/p>\n<p>With <a href=\"\/google-adwords\">paid ads<\/a>, personalization can seem challenging. How can you ensure your ads are reaching the right people with appealing messages aligned with their interests? How can you scale to personalize each shopper in a pool of thousands of online consumers? How do you even know if you\u2019re reaching the right audience, at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/19\/best-time-to-run-facebook-ads\">right time<\/a>, with the right message?<\/p>\n<p>These <strong>7 tips will take the mystery out of paid ad personalization<\/strong>, in turn making your life as a marketer a whole lot easier!<\/p>\n<h2>#1: Utilize Customer Match, Custom Audiences, and Targeted Audiences<\/h2>\n<p>What better place to start than with a list of contacts you already have? <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/10\/05\/adwords-customer-match\">Custom Audiences on Facebook<\/a> and Targeted Audiences on Twitter have been around for quite a few months now. They both allow you to upload a list of emails or phone numbers to the ad platform to show your ads to that targeted group of people. Now marketers can do the same thing through <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/28\/adwords-customer-match\">Google\u2019s Customer Match<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Whether it be via YouTube ads, Gmail Sponsored Promotions, or through the good old search network, you can upload your list of leads that recently downloaded an e-book or subscribed to your blog, and deliver personalized ads to these specific people. This is insanely powerful because it shows how search and display are becoming more like email marketing by targeting individuals rather than keywords or websites. Just image you had a list of webinar attendees. Instead of showing these people regular old ads, you can show them ads relevant to the content consumed via the webinar and keep your ad copy and imagery in-line with their interests and needs.<\/p>\n<h2>#2: Implement Geo Customizers in Your Ad Copy<\/h2>\n<p>These babies are pretty brand-spanking new and we\u2019ve already found them to be quite successful at WordStream. They work similar to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/08\/18\/ad-customizers\">ad customizers<\/a> where your ads are automatically updated, but geo-customizers update your ads based on a searcher\u2019s physical location or a location of interest. Naturally, these are most useful for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/06\/local-business-marketing\">local advertisers<\/a>, but all advertisers shouldn\u2019t ignore the opportunity to find creative ways to appeal to a searcher\u2019s location.<\/p>\n<p>WordStream\u2019s Senior Paid Search Strategist Nic D\u2019Amato recently tested out this new feature with his client POP Yachts, and during a typically slow point in the season his client saw a <strong>30% increase in click-through rate (CTR), a 13% increase in click conversion rate, and a 50% decrease in CPA<\/strong> (cost per acquisition) over a 2 week period. Pretty impressive!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"\/images\/marketing-personalization-ad\" alt=\"Marketing personalization geo customizer example \" width=\"617\" height=\"247\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Nic clearly proved that the benefits of these babies are well-worth it.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI recommend geo ad customizers for any advertiser with local products or special offers in any city,\u201d says Nic. \u201cIt will give you an edge on making your ads localized and more pertinent to a user, save time from updating ads so often, drastically improve ad performance, and help capture customers further down the funnel.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/10\/05\/adwords-geo-customizers\">Nic\u2019s post to get all the details<\/a> on setting these up.<\/p>\n<h2>#3: Remarket to Non-Converters on Search Through Social<\/h2>\n<p>Oftentimes people start <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/26\/sales-cycle\">their buying journey<\/a> using Google. Whether it be through high-intent searches like \u201cBuy pair of women\u2019s Warby Parker prescription sunglasses\u201d or just actual questions to problems that require help like \u201cHow do I manage my PPC bids?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Although even with high-intent searches where people are in the purchasing mindset, it can be easy to lose focus, with everything from new Snapchat notifications to work emails buzzing into our iPhones competing for our attention. What marketers need to do is create a full-circle, personalized experience where they\u2019re <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/11\/16\/facebook-remarketing\">remarketing to site visitors through social<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, let\u2019s say someone visits the product page for a specific style of Warby Parker sunglasses. The advertiser then should follow that user around Facebook reminding them of their interest in that style.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"0cdbf8da-690e-4375-abc0-3bff3b8ab1b4\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-personalization-funny.jpg\" alt=\"Marketing personalization Adele gif\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This strategy works wonders because rather than remarketing to every person on your site, you\u2019re focusing on a smaller percentage that\u2019s much more likely to buy. There\u2019s also the benefit of being able to get much more granular with your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/28\/facebook-ad-targeting\">targeting capabilities on Facebook<\/a> or Twitter. For instance, you can remarket to people who came to your site through search, are within a certain age range, and have specific job titles, but I\u2019ll get into that more in my next point\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>#4: Make Use of Facebook and Twitter\u2019s Targeting Capabilities<\/h2>\n<p>Did you know that you can target \u201cfit moms,\u201d interested in musical theatre, who have college degrees from Harvard University, and live in NYC condos over 2,999 square feet? The level of granularity you can get with targeting via demographics, interests, and behaviors within both Facebook and Twitter is astounding.<\/p>\n<p>Through self-provided information and third-party data providers, both platforms have a solid understanding of who their users are. It\u2019s actually quite creepy from a user standpoint, but for you \u2013 the advertiser \u2013 it opens up ample opportunities to appeal to your target audience.<\/p>\n<p>When creating demographic audiences in each social platform make sure to do the following things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a thorough understanding of your target audience.<\/li>\n<li>Layer targeting options upon each other until you land a reasonably sized audience to target based on your allotted budget.<\/li>\n<li>Create ads that speak to that specific audience.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>#5: Use Targeting Tools Through the Google Display Network<\/h2>\n<p>The Google Display Network (GDN) allows your ads to be displayed to users when they\u2019re browsing around on various websites. The thing is, the GDN is <em>huge; <\/em>it reaches over 90% of global internet users and expands across 2 million sites, so you can image how it might be difficult to personalize your strategy.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use your budget wisely, the GDN has a few categories to ensure your speaking the right people on the right websites including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Contextual targeting:<\/strong> This allows you to only show ads on sites related to your keywords<\/li>\n<li><strong>Placement targeting:<\/strong> Choose the specific websites where you want your ads to be shown to ensure they\u2019re reaching relevant people (or exclude irrelevant websites).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"fc9b5e1c-7d2b-4ca8-903b-72194139459b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-personalization-display.png\" alt=\"Marketing personalization screenshot of placements\" width=\"664\" height=\"459\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Remarketing:<\/strong> Show ads to people who have already visited (or purchased from) your site!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Interest Categories:<\/strong> Show ads based on what your users are interested in. No, the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/16\/ad-targeting\">targeting capabilities<\/a> are not quite up to par with those on Facebook, but you can use features like TV-like affinity audiences to get more granular.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Topic Targeting:<\/strong> Choose from Google\u2019s list of topics, for example \u201cAutos and Vehicles,\u201d to target those interested in those products.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Demographic Targeting:<\/strong> Lastly, aside from languages and locations, Google allows you to target by gender, parental status, and age range.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Yes, these options are limited compared to our social networking offerings, but remember that you can layer these categories to further define your target audience. For instance, you can use placements with remarketing to only remarket to people who visit specific websites.<\/p>\n<h2>#6: Speak to the User Throughout the Entire Search Experience<\/h2>\n<p>This one might seem mind-numbingly obvious, but you\u2019d be surprised at how many marketers fail to put themselves in the shoes of the searcher and rather chose to focus on bragging about their business. Guess what? The searcher doesn\u2019t care that your law services are the \u201cbest in town.\u201d Anyone can say that. They care about fixing their problem with a trustworthy and reliable solution.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/20\/ppc-ad-copy\">By nature we are inherently selfish<\/a>, which creates a problem; if the advertiser and the consumer are both selfish, then each of their goals are not likely to be achieved, right? Wrong \u2013 the advertiser just needs to be able to recognize this by putting their ego aside and speaking directly to the user\u2019s needs throughout the entire buying journey. Your creative should be gracefully written in the second person, and be focused on addressing your consumers\u2019 problems and how you can fix them.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1fea4b0a-f3c5-4a69-9455-d4cbace57342\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-personalization-clueless.jpg\" alt=\"Marketing personalization clueless gif\" width=\"736\" height=\"415\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Take a look at the two ads below, each of which received roughly the same number of ad impressions with an average positon between one and two.

While both CTR\u2019s are good, ad A went above and beyond by speaking directly to the searcher, addressing them as \u201cyou\u201d and immediately reassuring them that customer service is their top priority.<\/p>\n<p>David Ogilvy, widely regarded as the \u201cFather of Advertising,\u201d said it best: \u201cIf you can\u2019t turn yourself into a consumer, you probably shouldn\u2019t be in the advertising business at all.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>#7: Use RLSA\u2019s with a Broader Set of Keywords to Re-Engage Past Searchers<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/12\/remarketing-lists-for-search-ads\">RLSA\u2019s, or remarketing lists for search ads,<\/a> might sound intimidating, but they\u2019re really quite simple! They work similarly to standard remarketing, but rather than following website visitors around the web with banner and sidebar ads, they show your ads to prior site visitors when they\u2019re searching on Google. This allows the advertiser to create a personalized search experience based on their remarketing lists.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, let\u2019s say you have a remarketing audience for people who visited your product page for long women\u2019s grey trench coats; rather than targeting longer-tailed keywords like \u201cgrey winter trench coat for women\u201d you can instead bid on broad terms like \u201ccoat\u201d and \u201cwinter coat\u201d to show your ads to these searchers since you already know they\u2019re interested in your product. This allows you to create a more personalized search experience on Google based on what you know your audience is already interested in.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One-third of marketers see personalization as the most important capability to the future of marketing!
