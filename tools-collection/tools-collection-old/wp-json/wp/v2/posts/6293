Yelp founders saw that word-of-mouth was a powerful purveyor of new customers, but with the classic local community structure breaking apart in an online era, how could individuals know which businesses to trust? Yelp was the answer \u2013 an online review site in which customers shared their experiences, helping others make informed decisions about restaurants, auto-repair shops, and more.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/love-us-on-yelp-1.jpg\" alt=\"Yelp Reviews\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Many review sites have come and gone, but Yelp has continued to be a highly trusted source for local business reviews and ratings. Why? Yelp noticed that other review sites are far too cluttered with spam and ads, so they\u2019ve kept theirs to a minimum.\u00a0Yelp also focuses on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/05\/longform-content\">long-form<\/a> reviews rather than short one-liners, providing the kind of in-depth, thorough review wary customers crave.

Fill it with colorful pics and useful information to put your best foot forward for potential customers checking you out.<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"How to Get Yelp Reviews\"><\/a>How to Get Yelp Reviews<\/h2>\n<p>I know, I know, you want <em>good<\/em> Yelp reviews, right? Not just Yelp reviews. Well the bad news is that Yelp (understandably) doesn\u2019t allow businesses to ask for specifically positive reviews \u2013 you can only encourage customers to review you honestly in all your blunder or glory. The good news is that if you\u2019re a good business and doing things right, you\u2019re likely to get good reviews! Hip hip hoorah!<\/p>\n<p>There are a few strategies for getting customers to review you on Yelp.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DO:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Activate Your Yelp Page:<\/strong> Take the initiative by activating your Yelp page. Go all out \u2013 add photos, descriptions, menus, phone numbers, hours of operation, etc.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Post a \u201cFind us on Yelp\u201d Sign:<\/strong> Yelp out your restaurant or local biz with Yelp posters, stickers, badges, and other paraphernalia. In this plugged-in age, visitors might see those signs and head to Yelp to review you even while in your restaurant!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/posting-yelp-signs-1.png\" alt=\"Yelp Signs and Stickers\" width=\"373\" height=\"319\" \/><\/div>\n<p><em>Borrowed from <\/em><em><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.rewardme.com\/social-media-2\/how-to-get-more-yelp-reviews-for-your-business\/\">Reward Me Blog<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Host a Yelp Event: <\/strong>Hosting a Yelp event will encourage Yelpers to visit your business while establishing yourself as an active community member \u2013 it\u2019s pretty much a no-brainer for getting chummy with local Yelp users<\/p>\n<p>How do you host an event? It\u2019s pretty easy. Head over to yelp.com\/events, pick your city, and hit the \u201cAdd an Event\u201d button. Then fill out your event details.<\/p>\n<p>Next it\u2019s time to promote your awesome event! Send out the invite to Yelpers who have already visited your business, or those who have reviewed a business similar to your own. Also consider contacting a local Yelp Elite (these are mega-Yelpers with a lot of influence) and ask if they\u2019re interested in helping you out with your event.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a great idea to have some sweet swag giveaways during your Yelp event \u2013 maybe all event attendees get 10% off their meal with another 10% coupon for later. Try a raffle to win dinner with a friend, a free reusable water bottle, whatever! Make it fun and exciting for attendees!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Post a Yelp Deal:<\/strong> Yelp Deals are a great way to get customers in the door. Unlike with Groupon or Living Social, customers who take advantage of a Yelp Deal are pretty much guaranteed to be active Yelp users, increasingly the likelihood of them writing you a review.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/yelp-deal-1.png\" alt=\"yelp deals\" width=\"661\" height=\"346\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Add Happy Staff Photos:<\/strong> Friendly, smiling, waving staff members being featured on your Yelp page will create a positive first impression for your Yelp page visitors, and might even discourage disgruntled customers from posting something nasty.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Offer Foursquare Check-in Rewards:<\/strong> Foursquare has long passed its heyday as an ultra-popular location check-in tool, but a lot of awesome folks (such as your truly) still use it to broadcast micromanaged location updates for our undying fans.<\/p>\n<p>Even a small Foursquare award, like free drinks for the mayor, can get users excited. It\u2019s also reasonable to assume that many Foursquare users are also Yelp users. After all, who is using Foursquare except for the media-obsessed foodie-photographing weirdos? Appealing to the Foursquare\/Yelp user with a check-in reward might be just the push they need to write you a shining review.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Respond to Existing Yelp Reviews: <\/strong>It\u2019s always a smart idea to respond to the existing Yelp reviews you do have, especially if they\u2019re asking a specific question or voicing a concern. People like to be acknowledged, and responding to Yelp reviews creates a favorable impression for your business, and shows readers that you care about your customers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Print Out &amp; Display Positive Yelp Reviews:<\/strong> One expert technique for getting Yelp reviews is to print out and hang your existing positive Yelp review on the wall in your restaurant or business. Enlarge the reviews so that they\u2019re easy to read, frame them, and hang them where they can easily be read by patrons waiting in line. When new customers see existing positive reviews, they\u2019ll feel inclined to think positively of you as well and write a similarly upbeat review on Yelp.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Add a Yelp QR Code:<\/strong> Yelp QR codes are a simple way to make it easier for your smartphone-carrying patrons to check out your Yelp page and review you in-store!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/get-yelp-reviews-1.png\" alt=\"Yelp Business\" width=\"300\" height=\"422\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Promote On Other Networks:<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\"> Ask for Yelp reviews<\/a>\u00a0on Twitter, Facebook, and other social media networks. It\u2019s best to not sound too needy though (\u201cPleaaazzeee say we\u2019re super-awesome!\u201d). Opt for something discreet like, \u201cWe\u2019re now on Yelp and would love to hear what you think of us!\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/faq\">Yelp itself suggests<\/a>: <em>\u201c<\/em><em>Instead of blatantly saying \u201cReview us on Yelp,\u201d say \u201cCheck us out on Yelp\u201d.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Add a Yelp Link to Your Newsletter:<\/strong> Chances are your newsletter subscribers already think you\u2019re pretty cool. Reminding them to write about you on Yelp is a surefire way to get some positive reviews.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Add a Yelp Website Badge:<\/strong> A Yelp website badge lets visitors know you are on Yelp, and all they have to do is click the badge to be taken straight to your Yelp page. It doesn\u2019t get much easier than that<\/p>\n<p><strong>Be Awesome:<\/strong> If you provide excellent food, excellent service, and an excellent experience, you <em>will <\/em>get great Yelp reviews, no question about it. Be the best you can be and the glowing reviews will follow!<\/p>\n<p><strong>DO NOT:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Offer Bribes for Reviews: <\/strong>Yelp is very strict in regards to their reviews policy. You <strong>absolutely cannot<\/strong> and should not offer a reward in exchange for a review. Even something as innocent as \u201chalf off your next meal when you review us on Yelp\u201d is a big no-no and can get you in serious trouble with Yelp\u2019s powers that be.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ask for Positive Reviews:<\/strong> As discussed earlier, don\u2019t ask specifically for positive reviews, just reviews in general.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Buy Yelp Reviews:<\/strong> We\u2019ll be talking more about this later. Just know for now that buying Yelp reviews is not worth the trouble by a long shot.<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"Handling Negative Reviews\"><\/a>How to Handle Negative Reviews on Yelp<\/h2>\n<p>The truth is that you can\u2019t please everyone in life. Even great businesses get some negative reviews on Yelp from time to time. It sucks. Sometimes businesses mess up and deserve to be called out. Other times a bad review can feel completely undeserved.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What to do When You Get a Negative Yelp Review<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>1.\u00a0\u00a0<\/strong>\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Don\u2019t Respond Immediately:<\/strong> Having a Yelper really bash your business can be painful, and your initial response may involve hair-pulling, obscenities, and some ALL CAPS action. Responding to one rant with another won\u2019t do you any good \u2013 in fact, it will only multiply the damage. Instead of responding in a flurry of keystrokes, take a deep breath, brew a cup of tea, and get your mind off the review. Don\u2019t even think about responding for at least a half a day \u2013 taking two or three days to cool down is even better.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2.\u00a0<\/strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Analyze the Reviewer\u2019s Mindset:<\/strong> After a few days, the scathing review won\u2019t seem quite as searing. Try to read the negative Yelp review objectively \u2013 is there any sense to what the Yelper is saying? Does the review seem worked up and emotional?<\/p>\n<p><strong>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/strong><strong>Public or Private Response? <\/strong>While public responses are good for correcting discrepancies, consider whether or not a discreet private message could remedy the situation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/strong><strong>Address the Review\u2019s Issues in a Calm and Reasonable Manner<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yelp has a feature that allows business owners to respond to negative reviews. The key is to remain calm and take the high road. Above all, remain polite and respectful. Those who bypass step one end up responding to negative reviews in an angry, emotional state which can lead to name-calling, insults, and emotional language that makes you look as terrible and unstable as the reviewer, or more so.<\/p>\n<p>Your goal in responding to the reviewer is to discredit their assessment. It might not take much to do this \u2013 Yelp readers weren\u2019t born yesterday, and most can spot an unreasonable and baseless rant when they see one. If the negative Yelp review makes claims you can argue against, do so objectively, using facts or other customers\u2019 experiences as a talking point. For example:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cGretchen, we were very disappointed to hear you didn\u2019t enjoy our cheesecake. Other customers have told us it\u2019s their favorite of our desserts, but maybe you caught us on an off day.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If you think the reviewer is just in their admonishment, simply apologize. Readers will appreciate your honesty and think better of you for it.<\/p>\n<p>Responding in a cool and collected manner to a senseless rant makes you seem much more reasonable than the emotionally-fueled reviewer, and casts the unfavorable light on them rather than you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/strong><strong>A Touch of Humor<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The make-em-laugh technique doesn\u2019t work in every situation, but it can be great at diffusing an overtly flaming review. For example, check out this REAL review of Pigalle (this review was posted on Facebook, but same rules apply!).<\/p>\n<p><em>Wow. I don&#8217;t have a clue as to why you would think that throwing pumpkin chunks into a cold pre baked pie shell and then covering it with a cream sauce that <strong>literally tasted like vomit.<\/strong>\u00a0{ I am very serious!} and topping it off with whipped cream that was runny would in any way be something that can be called pumpkin pie?&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Not something any business owner wants to see. Unfortunately, the owner answered back with an even more venomous reply, demonstrating a perfect example of <a href=\"http:\/\/boston.eater.com\/archives\/2012\/11\/28\/pigalle-to-customer-you-must-enjoy-vomit-you-btch.php\">how NOT to respond to a bad review<\/a>. Instead, he should have tried something like:<\/p>\n<p><em>Hi Sandy. Wow! That bad huh? I haven\u2019t had the chance to sample too many varieties of vomit, so I can\u2019t say I can really relate to your experience, but that doesn\u2019t sound too fun. We tend to be very busy during Thanksgiving so it\u2019s possible that one of our chefs made a mistake with that Pumpkin Pie \u2013 we\u2019re sorry you found it so truly gag-inducing. Come by again and we\u2019ll see if we can make it up to you with something more to your liking <\/em><em>J<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/strong> <strong>Offer an Olive Branch:<\/strong> If you think there\u2019s any saving the situation, try to offer a symbol of peace \u2013 send a private message inviting the displeased reviewer back for a tour of the bakery or a free desert. Yelp has an update function that reviewers can use to change their initial review. Everyone likes to feel important \u2013 feeding a disgruntled user\u2019s ego can sometimes quell the fury, and may lead them to reconsider their opinion of you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>7.\u00a0\u00a0<\/strong>\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Make Use of Constructive Criticism<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Remember \u2013 bad reviews aren\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. Negative reviews that are deserved and just serve as real feedback on how you can improve your business. If reviewers bring up legitimate concerns, work to address them and then let the Yelp community know you\u2019ve made efforts to improve. Customers will appreciate this \u2013 it shows you care and are listening to their input.<\/p>\n<p><strong>8.\u00a0\u00a0<\/strong>\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Keep Things in Perspective: <\/strong>Don\u2019t hang up your hat and cry yourself to sleep every time you find a bad review. Even great businesses get a bad review from time to time. As Yelp says:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0\u201c<\/em><em>Negative reviews are an unfortunate \u2014 but entirely normal \u2014 part of doing business\u2026 While it&#8217;s important to look for patterns in your reviews (the bread is stale, the same employee is repeatedly described as rude), you should take any individual perspective with a grain of salt.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t stress over every review. People can be particularly nasty online, so be prepared to thicken up your skin a bit and ignore the mindless ranters.<\/p>\n<p>For more information on tricks, techniques, and examples of how to deal with a bad Yelp review, check out this article about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.inc.com\/john-greathouse\/protecting-your-online-reputation-from-trolls-eight-tips.html\">Protecting Your Online Reputation from Trolls<\/a> by John Greathouse.

For some, there is an appeal at being the outcast.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/yelp-bad-reviews-1.jpg\" alt=\"Bad Yelp Reviews\" width=\"764\" height=\"746\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The \u201cif you can\u2019t beat them, join them\u201d approach really only works with restaurants and businesses that embrace a counter-culture lifestyle and have patrons who might revel in the disapproval of others.<\/p>\n<p>The Craft &amp; Commerce Gastropub is one such establishment, offering very unusual, even bizarre spins on classic drinks. After receiving some vehement one-star reviews, Craft &amp; Commerce decided that, rather than brood over the poor reviews, they\u2019d have some fun with them. The owner had friends read aloud the restaurant\u2019s worst Yelp reviews while recording them. The recordings were then played in the Craft &amp; Commerce Gastropub\u2019s bathroom, amusing visitors and sticking it to the Yelp man.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the unique and clever approach, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2012\/12\/05\/craft-commerce-san-diego-yelp_n_2244469.html\">the bathroom recordings backfired<\/a> when Craft &amp; Commerce Gastropub got blasted with a slew of more one-star review from patrons who aspired to have their reviews featured in the bathroom.<\/p>\n<p>Mocking absurd Yelp reviews has become a bit of a fad in fact \u2013 there\u2019s even a whole YouTube channel dedicated to showing video clips of Yelp reviews read by actors.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/QEdXhH97Z7E?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>There is some logic in going gung-ho with the one-star reviews. <strong>Some would even say one star is better than two<\/strong>; a one-star establishment drives curiosity and gets people wondering <em>why<\/em> are they so incredibly terrible? What\u2019s the story there? There\u2019s a kind of car crash rubbernecking morbid fascination involved with one-star restaurants.

There\u2019s no denying a need for such a filter system though \u2013 the Stanford-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/blog\/224703#ixzz2YxgncXwn\">research firm Gartner predicts<\/a> that as many as 15% of reviews on social media sites could be paid-for fakes by 2014.<\/p>\n<p>Filtered reviews can be found at the bottom of a Yelp business page, and can be viewed by any users who care to click.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/yelp-filtered-reviews-1.png\" alt=\"Filtered Yelp Reviews\" width=\"655\" height=\"148\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Some filtered reviews below:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/yelp-reviews-filtered-1.png\" alt=\"Yelp Business\" width=\"1019\" height=\"603\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Above, you\u2019ll see that most of the filtered reviews are from profiles with no image, no friends, little engagement, and very short, uninformative text.<\/p>\n<p>Yelp takes their job as the honest review gatekeeper very seriously. Yelp conducts sting operations to find businesses paying for reviews, and in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessweek.com\/magazine\/a-lie-detector-test-for-online-reviewers-09292011.html\">Business Week\u2019s test<\/a>, <strong>Yelp was the only review site out of seven others to successfully detect and filter each and every fake consumer review presented<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Yelp\u2019s automated review filter system <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/luther-lowe\/how-yelp-protects-consume_b_3275848.html\">filters around 20%<\/a> of the more than 39 million reviews. That\u2019s a hefty chunk of reviews, and when every star counts, it\u2019s no wonder businesses are left feeling apprehensive.<\/p>\n<p>It may not be entirely fair, but that\u2019s the cost of protecting consumers. As we\u2019ve seen from Google\u2019s Panda algorithm, even filters with the best of intentions can end up hurting the innocent. Dolphins get trapped in tuna traps, and birds get hit by windmills; such is life.<\/p>\n<p>Of course more legitimate, real reviews make it past the Yelp filter than those that do not. Trustworthy and useful content <em>should<\/em> come out ahead.<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"How to Avoid Yelp Filter\"><\/a>How to Avoid the Yelp Review Filter<\/h2>\n<p>There are a few steps you can take to better your chances of having a review get through the dreaded Yelp filter. Business can make efforts to engage the review and reviewer by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding the reviewer as a friend<\/li>\n<li>Upvoting the review as funny, useful, cool, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Sending the reviewer a compliment (Yelp\u2019s tool for letting other Yelpers call a user out for an awesome review)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you\u2019re a user who wants to avoid having your reviews hit the Yelp filter, make efforts to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Write Lots of Yelp Reviews:<\/strong> If someone\u2019s account has obviously been made with the purpose of just reviewing one restaurant or business, that brings up some serious red flags for Yelp. The more reviews you write, the more authentic you seem. at least 10 reviews will make you much less likely to sound the Yelp review alarm. Make sure your reviews are legitimate though \u2013 you should us the range of 1-5 stars. Writing all fantastic or all terrible reviews look suspicious.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fill Out Your Profile:<\/strong> Add profile pics, a personal description, etc.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Connect to Your Other Social Media Accounts:<\/strong> Connect your account to Facebook and Twitter for an added dose of authenticity.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Add Yelp Friends:<\/strong> Add friends to Yelp and interact with them by complimenting, voting their reviews as funny, etc. Your engagement with other users shows that you\u2019re a real user who is part of the Yelp community.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Leave Tips (in Addition to Reviews):<\/strong> Tips are for users to add a quick pithy statement when they check in somewhere using the Yelp mobile app. Tips show your full range of motion as an online user.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Steady &amp; Consistent:<\/strong> Don\u2019t just blast a hundred reviews in the span of a few days. Take the time to strengthen your reputation by reviewing various local businesses over the course of several weeks or months.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><a id=\"Don't Fear Yelp\"><\/a>Don\u2019t Fear the Yelp \u2013 Embrace it!<\/h2>\n<p>I know we\u2019ve talked a lot today about some of the scarier aspects of Yelp with its raging customers rants and threatening filters, but Yelp really is a pretty neat community that\u2019s just trying to help consumers make smart decisions in regards to local biz.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/yelp-reviews-disappear-1.jpg\" alt=\"Yelp Business Page \" width=\"820\" height=\"665\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Don\u2019t be afraid \u2013 most Yelp reviews are great!
