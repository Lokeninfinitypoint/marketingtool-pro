So in this post, we&#8217;re providing an in-depth look at what responsive search ads are and how to create them, along with all the FAQs, tips, and best practices you need to get the most out of them.<\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/02\/responsive-search-ad-tips\"><\/a>Table of contents<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#what\">What are responsive search ads?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#work\">How do RSAs work?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#character\">Responsive search ad character counts<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#how\">How to create a responsive search ad in Google<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#tips\">Tips and best practices for Google responsive search ads<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a id=\"what\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>What are responsive search ads?<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/22\/maximize-ROI-with-responsive-search-ads\">Responsive search ads<\/a> are Google&#8217;s largest and most flexible search ad format. Unlike traditional (now legacy) search ads, where you write your headlines and descriptions together to create 1 static text ad, when writing a responsive search ad you can write up to<strong> 15 different headlines <\/strong>and up to <strong>4 different descriptions<\/strong>. Collectively, those headlines and descriptions can be arranged in 43,680 different permutations, which means the ad testing possibilities are nearly endless!<br \/>\n<a id=\"work\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>How do responsive search ads work?<\/h2>\n<p>Google will then automatically test different combinations of headlines and descriptions and learn which combinations perform best. Over time, your responsive search ads will serve the best message to different searchers depending on the keyword they search for, their device, their past browsing behavior, and other signals.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/how-responsive-search-ads-work.png\" alt=\"how responsive search ads work\" width=\"720\" height=\"481\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-59791\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/how-responsive-search-ads-work.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/how-responsive-search-ads-work-480x321.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a id=\"character\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>What are the character counts for responsive search ads?<\/h2>\n<p>Responsive search ads will show up to three 30-character headlines, a display URL with two 15-character display paths, and up to two 90-character descriptions.

Smaller screens (like mobile) or busy SERPs may show fewer components of a responsive search ad, so don\u2019t expect to always see your 3rd headline or 2nd description.<\/p>\n<p>However, your responsive search ad will always at least show 2 headlines and a description, so it will never be smaller than an expanded search ad!<\/p>\n<p><a id=\"how\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>How do I create responsive search ads in Google Ads?<\/h2>\n<p>To create an RSA, click on the plus sign to create a new campaign, and choose &#8220;responsive search ad&#8221;:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/how-to-create-responsive-search-ad.png\" alt=\"how to create a responsive search ad - ad creation view\" width=\"642\" height=\"636\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-65271\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/how-to-create-responsive-search-ad.png 642w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/how-to-create-responsive-search-ad-480x475.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 642px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll then have to select an ad group to add the ad to.

Here is a handy cheat sheet to refer back to:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/how-to-run-google-ads-responsive-search-ad-cheat-sheet.png\" alt=\"how to run google ads - responsive search ad tip cheat sheet\" width=\"619\" height=\"724\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-58908\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/responsive-search-ad-cheat-sheet-wordstream.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click to enlarge<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>1. Use multiple headlines &amp; descriptions<\/h3>\n<p>Every responsive search ad needs to have at least 3 headlines and 2 descriptions to show. However, the bare minimum is seldom best. The strength of responsive search ads is that they allow for more variants and testing than traditional search ads. You can test up to 15 headlines and up to 4 descriptions at once \u2013 so use them! Aim to get at least 10 different headlines and 3 descriptions in your responsive search ads.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Highlight something different in each headline &amp; description<\/h3>\n<p>Avoid repetitive and boring variants of the same headline. Google actually won\u2019t even show your responsive search ad if your headlines or descriptions are too similar.<\/p>\n<p>A good responsive search ad has a lot of unique messages that can be combined.\u00a0 Use your creativity and highlight different value props, offers, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/07\/call-to-action-marketing\">calls to action<\/a> with each element of your responsive search ad.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/responsive-search-ad-rsa-template.png\" alt=\"responsive search ad headlines - template\" width=\"720\" height=\"283\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-59788\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/responsive-search-ad-rsa-template.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/responsive-search-ad-rsa-template-480x189.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\n<em>You&#8217;ll find our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/05\/responsive-search-ad-copy\">responsive search ad template<\/a> to be super helpful here.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>3. Don&#8217;t include keywords in all headlines<\/h3>\n<p>Be sure to include a top keyword in at least two of your headlines. You can always use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/dynamic-keyword-insertion\">Dynamic Keyword Insertion<\/a> to insert your keywords into your responsive search ads.<\/p>\n<p>But make sure at least three headlines do NOT include your keywords. This will prevent your ads from becoming overly repetitive and allow you to highlight more value to searchers.<\/p>\n<h3>4.\u00a0 Vary up headline &amp; description lengths<\/h3>\n<p>This will increase the likelihood of your ad serving a third headline or second description. Don\u2019t try to maximize the character count in each element every time.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p><strong>Are you making any mistakes in Google Ads?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Find out instantly with the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Free Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h3>5. Pin headlines &amp; descriptions to specific positions<\/h3>\n<p>Google\u2019s responsive search ads will automatically test different <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/02\/ppc-ad-headlines\">headlines<\/a> in different positions to see how they perform in headlines 1, 2, and 3. And every headline won\u2019t show every time. The same is true for your descriptions. This allows Google to find the very best message for each different user, keyword, and device they search on.<\/p>\n<p>However, if you have a specific message that you always want to include in your ad (a brand message or a disclaimer, for instance) you can make sure it always shows in your ad by \u201cpinning\u201d that headline or description.<\/p>\n<p>When writing the important headline that you always want shown, hover over to the right of that headline and a pin icon will appear. Clicking the icon will give you several different options to make sure your headline always shows. This also works with important description text.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/responsive-search-ads-101-pinning.png\" alt=\"responsive search ad pinning\" width=\"720\" height=\"545\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-65272\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/responsive-search-ads-101-pinning.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/responsive-search-ads-101-pinning-480x363.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cShowing this headline in any unpinned position\u201d will make sure that message always shows, but it may appear in headline 1, 2 or 3. If you want a message always appear in a particular headline or <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/18\/create-winner-text-ad-description\">description<\/a> spot you can specify that as well. Keep in mind though that headlines 3 and description 2 won\u2019t always show, so pinned messages in those positions won\u2019t always be part of the responsive search ad.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Pin very sparingly!<\/h3>\n<p>Pinning headlines or descriptions will make sure the essential parts of your ad always show. However, they also restrict the messages and automatic variant testing that Google performs for these responsive search ads, which may negatively impact your ad\u2019s performance. Pinning just one headline reduces the amount of testing Google can perform on these responsive search ads by over 75%! Pinning 2 headlines reduces the opportunities for testing down 99.5%!<\/p>\n<h3>7. Use the combinations report<\/h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/11894820\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">combinations report<\/a> shows you how many impressions each asset combination in your responsive search ad is getting. Now even though there are 43k+ permutations possible with RSAs, Google isn&#8217;t going to use all of them. This report will show you which ones it does use.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/responsive-search-ads-combinations-report.png\" alt=\"responsive search ads combinations report\" width=\"720\" height=\"395\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65275 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/responsive-search-ads-combinations-report.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/responsive-search-ads-combinations-report-480x263.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/ads-commerce\/create-engaging-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>But remember: just because one combination is getting more impressions than another doesn&#8217;t mean you should pin your assets to only serve that combination.\u00a0RSAs serve combinations that work best for the real-time signals such as the query, searcher, and more, so it could just be that that combination works well for a particular query that occurs more so than another.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Use your top-performing static ads to come up with RSA assets<\/h3>\n<p>Review your current ads and use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">the Google Ads Grader<\/a> to quickly find your top-performing ads, and then use those elements as seeds for alternative headlines and descriptions for your responsive search ads.
