Accounts I follow are writing more long-winded Threads about books, news outlets are threading (is \u201cthreading\u201d a word?) breaking stories more frequently, and\u2014most relevant for me\u2014a bunch of brands are distributing product information on Threads.

It was launched by Meta (the makers of Facebook and Instagram) in July of 2023.<\/p>\n<p>While Instagram focuses on video and image-based content, Threads offers users a text-based forum to stay connected with followers. The platform allows users to post up to 500 characters, including links, photos,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/23\/instagram-carousel-ads\"> carousels<\/a>, and videos up to<a href=\"https:\/\/about.instagram.com\/threads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> five minutes long<\/a>. It also enables users to connect these posts in Threads, similar to\u00a0 X (formerly Twitter).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/instagram-threads-wordstream-zuck.webp\" alt=\"Instagram Threads - Thread from Mark Zuckerberg.\" width=\"743\" height=\"205\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89334 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/instagram-threads-wordstream-zuck.webp 743w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/instagram-threads-wordstream-zuck-480x132.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 743px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Founder Mark Zuckerberg posted the inaugural Thread on 7\/3\/23 to get the conversation started.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This similarity to X is intentional, which is something to keep in mind when <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/instagram-marketing\">marketing on Instagram<\/a>.

The large and quickly growing audience indicates that your business should establish a presence on Threads.<\/p>\n<p>There are some clear benefits of using Instagram Threads for your business:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Grow beyond Instagram: <\/strong>With 200 million active users, Threads offers an opportunity to grow your reach, particularly beyond your regular Instagram audience.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Establish your brand identity: <\/strong>There are already brands active on Threads, but they haven\u2019t overwhelmed Thread\u2019s feed. Setting up your Threads profile and posting content regularly now establishes your brand identity on the platform, which will be important as it continues to grow.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Take advantage of the text-based platform: <\/strong>Whether or not your brand was previously active on X, you can take advantage of the text-based content that Threads allows. This gives you more space for explanations, conversations, and quips that don\u2019t rely on visuals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It\u2019s also good to note that Threads has <a href=\"https:\/\/martech.org\/marketing-on-threads-what-you-need-to-know\/#h-threads-begins-a-limited-early-test-of-advertising\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">begun testing ads<\/a> for a limited number of brands. It\u2019s likely that the program will roll out for more businesses soon.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/instagram-threads-wordstream-ads.webp\" alt=\"Instagram Threads - Example of an ad on Threads.\" width=\"301\" height=\"536\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89336 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/instagram-threads-wordstream-ads.webp 301w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/instagram-threads-wordstream-ads-168x300.webp 168w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Here is an example of what a <a href=\"https:\/\/martech.org\/marketing-on-threads-what-you-need-to-know\/#h-threads-begins-a-limited-early-test-of-advertising\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Threads ad<\/a> may look like.<\/em><\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-use-instagram-threads\"><\/div>\n<h2>7 steps to use Instagram Threads for growth<\/h2>\n<p>Instagram Threads is an excellent platform to show off your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/31\/brand-personality-messaging\">brand personality<\/a>, develop your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/10\/brand-awareness\">brand\u2019s presence<\/a> on the platform, and engage with your audience directly. Here\u2019s how to do it.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Set up your account<\/h3>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t already, it\u2019s time to set up your account. Luckily, this is straightforward, especially because it\u2019s already connected to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/09\/instagram-bios\">Instagram account<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To get started, you can navigate to <a href=\"http:\/\/threads.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">threads.net<\/a> and log in with your Instagram username and password.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/instagram-threads-wordstream-login.webp\" alt=\"Instagram Threads - Threads login screen.\" width=\"543\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89337 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/instagram-threads-wordstream-login.webp 543w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/instagram-threads-wordstream-login-480x530.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 543px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Your profile will automatically populate with your Instagram <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/social-media-image-sizes\">profile picture<\/a>, bio, and links, as well as your Instagram followers. It\u2019s worth noting that if you have a verified account, you can\u2019t edit your profile picture in Threads, only on Instagram. Otherwise, you can edit your bio directly on Threads.<\/p>\n<p>Be sure to determine whether your profile is private (which will limit your visibility) or public (better for brand accounts).<\/p>\n<p>With your profile set up, you\u2019re ready to get started.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\ude80 Free guide!<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite30BestWaysToPromote.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Marketing_The30BestWaysToPromoteYourBusiness_Download\">The 30 Best Ways to Promote Your Business<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>2. Create compelling content<\/h3>\n<p>The Threads <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/instagram-algorithm\">algorithm<\/a> prioritizes content with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/27\/how-to-increase-instagram-engagement\">high engagement<\/a>, which is no surprise considering the conversational design of the platform. So, your primary goal should be to create entertaining, thought-provoking content that your audience can respond to.<\/p>\n<p>This could take the form of a multi-post thread summarizing a recent article, responding to a trend in your industry, or breaking down how to use your product or service. It could also be a single post update with all the details for upcoming sales, releases, or events. The latter is what Netflix primarily posts on its Threads account.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/instagram-threads-wordstream-netflix.webp\" alt=\"Instagram Threads - Thread from Netflix.\" width=\"404\" height=\"593\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89338 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/instagram-threads-wordstream-netflix.webp 404w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/instagram-threads-wordstream-netflix-204x300.webp 204w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And remember, not every post has to be long or even serious. If it fits with your brand, short and sweet or even silly works well on Instagram Threads.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/instagram-threads-wordstream-funny.webp\" alt=\"Instagram Threads - Thread from Tostitos.\" width=\"877\" height=\"484\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89339 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/instagram-threads-wordstream-funny.webp 877w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/instagram-threads-wordstream-funny-480x265.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 877px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>3. Pay attention to your formatting<\/h3>\n<p>In your posts, Instagram Threads allows you to include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Up to 500 characters<\/li>\n<li>Links<\/li>\n<li>Photo content<\/li>\n<li>Carousels of photos or GIFs<\/li>\n<li>Videos of up to 5 minutes<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/20\/daily-hashtags\">Hashtags<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It\u2019s important to keep these guidelines in mind when you\u2019re creating content. And it\u2019s equally important to consider the best way to convey your point when planning<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/content-plan\"> your posts<\/a>. Sometimes, a video might make sense; other times, you might skip the visuals and lean on text-based Threads with plenty of line breaks and emoji to encourage quick reading.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/instagram-threads-wordstream-leave.webp\" alt=\"Instagram Threads - Holiday themed Thread.\" width=\"468\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89340 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/instagram-threads-wordstream-leave.webp 468w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/instagram-threads-wordstream-leave-234x300.webp 234w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Hashtag-heavy text and a carousel of holiday decor work for this ~ signing offline ~ post.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Mixing up the format of your posts is a good way to discover what works for your brand and your audience. Just remember to keep your voice and your themes consistent.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Engaging with your audience<\/h3>\n<p>The primary benefit of using Threads versus Instagram\u2019s primary platform is the ability to start, continue, or contribute to public conversations. You want to prioritize engaging with your audience on the platform as a part of your Instagram Threads strategy. Here\u2019s how users interact with content on Instagram Threads:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Views<\/li>\n<li>Likes<\/li>\n<li>Quotes<\/li>\n<li>Replies<\/li>\n<li>Reposts<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When you\u2019re creating your content, consider how you\u2019re encouraging engagement. This could be as simple as publishing a funny one-liner that you\u2019re hoping will encourage smiles and likes, or it could be a more explicit request for replies and reposts in the form of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/09\/call-to-action\">calls to action<\/a> (CTAs). Instagram Threads also offers interactive content, including polls, questions, and stickers that you can try out.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/instagram-threads-wordstream-question.webp\" alt=\"Instagram Threads - Thread with a question.\" width=\"771\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89341 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/instagram-threads-wordstream-question.webp 771w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/instagram-threads-wordstream-question-480x374.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 771px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A curious question? Excellent for engagement.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Remember, your goal is to create a sense of community and participate in conversations. That means you also need to engage with content. Respond to replies on your content, and take the time to reply, repost, or quote relevant Threads from other accounts, too.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Consider your marketing goals<\/h3>\n<p>Whenever you\u2019re looking into new marketing platforms, it\u2019s important to think about how the channel aligns with your existing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/15\/marketing-objectives\">marketing objectives<\/a>. Instagram Threads could be a great place to pursue a few different marketing goals, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lead generation<\/strong>: If your goal is to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/lead-generation-ideas\">generate leads<\/a>, consider how you\u2019re building an audience and sharing links to your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/lead-generation-website-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lead-capturing website<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Brand awareness<\/strong>: Use your content to discuss the problems your product or service solves and mention your solution as appropriate.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Customer education<\/strong>: Share tutorials, FAQs, and value-packed tips for customers or potential clients.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Product or service launches<\/strong>: Focus your content around sneak peeks, previews, countdowns, and in-depth announcements on launch days.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The key is making sure it works for your business, your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">audience<\/a>, and your workflow.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Track your performance on Instagram Threads<\/h3>\n<p>In order to accurately align your Instagram Threads strategy to your marketing goals, you need to track your performance. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/business.facebook.com\/business\/help\/metrics-labeling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Meta<\/a>, more robust Instagram Threads analytics will be available soon. But for now, the Insights tab in your threads account offers a good overview. This includes your views, interactions, top posts, and your followers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/instagram-threads-wordstream-settings.webp\" alt=\"Instagram Threads - Menu from Threads account.\" width=\"509\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89342 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/instagram-threads-wordstream-settings.webp 509w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/instagram-threads-wordstream-settings-480x566.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 509px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Access Insights by clicking on the settings menu in your Threads account.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Also, if you\u2019re already using a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/01\/17\/best-free-social-media-management-tools\">social media management tool<\/a> to schedule and monitor your other social media accounts, you can also track your Instagram Threads performance there.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Avoid common mistakes<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re going through the trouble of learning about a new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/11\/most-popular-social-media-platforms\">social media platform<\/a>, setting up a profile, and creating content, it would be silly to undermine those efforts by making simple mistakes.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few common mistakes to avoid when you\u2019re getting started on Instagram Threads:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Making it too complicated: <\/strong>Threads is a casual, conversational platform. Try not to make your strategy or content too complicated.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Straying from your brand voice: <\/strong>Your content and profile on Threads should be recognizable as your brand. That means sticking to your brand voice and your brand values.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ignoring your audience: <\/strong>You can\u2019t just drop posts and hope they engage your audience on their own. You\u2019ll need to dive into the conversations for your account to grow.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Forgetting your settings: <\/strong>To grow your brand\u2019s presence on Instagram Threads, you need to have a public profile that allows responses from followers and non-followers alike. Double-check your settings.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Start using Instagram Threads today<\/h2>\n<p>In this guide, we shared everything you need to know to get started on Instagram Threads. You can quickly set up a profile, brainstorm compelling content that aligns with your marketing goals, stick to the platform\u2019s formatting standards, keep engaging with your audience, and avoid the biggest mistakes.
