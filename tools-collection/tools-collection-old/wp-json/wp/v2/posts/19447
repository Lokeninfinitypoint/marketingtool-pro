The advent of business profiles, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/01\/instagram-analytics\">insights<\/a>, advanced metrics, bulk schedulers\u2014these, combined with the platform\u2019s original, unique value proposition (highly visual, immediate and widescale brand exposure) make Instagram a powerful asset for small and local businesses.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s perhaps no industry for which Instagram is better geared than the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/14\/restaurant-marketing?camplink=searchresults\">restaurant industry<\/a>. Research has shown that people 18-35 spend five whole days a year <a href=\"http:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/life-style\/food-and-drink\/millenials-restaurant-how-choose-instagram-social-media-where-eat-a7677786.html\">browsing food images on Instagram<\/a>, and <strong>30% would avoid a restaurant if their Instagram presence was weak<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Much of the below content is derived from a new social project I\u2019ve taken on at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/tapestryboston\/\">Tapestry Restaurant<\/a> in Boston. I\u2019ll show you some of the strategies we use, and some of the results we\u2019ve achieved thus far.<\/p>\n<p>Restaurant owners: here\u2019s how to hack the ever-loving <em>burrata<\/em> out of your Instagram profiles, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/19\/get-more-instagram-followers\">get more followers<\/a>, and drive hungry people through the door.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Court food bloggers (oh so many food bloggers)<\/h2>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/restaurant-instagram-hacks-food-blogger-compressor-min.png\" alt=\"Instagram Marketing for Restaurants Blogger\" width=\"1300\" height=\"848\" \/><\/div>\n<p>We\u2019ll start things off with an ostensibly obvious hack \u2013 if you can get a food blogger with a large following to post about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/20\/facebook-ads-for-restaurants\">your restaurant<\/a>, you\u2019ll get the benefit of a huge amount of brand exposure to an interested foodie audience.<\/p>\n<p>But here\u2019s the kicker: however often you\u2019re currently wining, dining, and pork rind-ing <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/14\/restaurant-marketing?camplink=searchresults\">food bloggers<\/a>, you\u2019re not doing it nearly enough. You should start confusing these people for wait staff. They\u2019re easily reachable (most list emails in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/09\/instagram-bios\">their bios<\/a>, but DM is just as effective), anxious to gain more followers (you\u2019ll do this together), and dirt cheap (especially next to the influence they wield).<\/p>\n<p>A lot of bloggers\/influencers will charge you quite a bit for their services, but don\u2019t get it twisted\u2014there are more than enough willing to smother their social media platforms with your city-best Neapolitan pizza for the price of\u2026well, your city-best Neapolitan pizza.<\/p>\n<p>How big of a following should you be looking for? A good rule of thumb here is 30k-50k followers\u2014these people have mastered the art of #foodporn, have amassed a loyal following because of it, but aren\u2019t so preposterous as to ask for copious amounts of money to make your tagliatelle look sexy (it already was). 50k+ is where things start getting expensive. Although, we shouldn\u2019t generalize. Shoot for as many followers as possible.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Run contests (oh so many contests)<\/h2>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-marketing-for-restaurants-min.png\" alt=\"Instagram Marketing for Restaurants Contests\" width=\"1010\" height=\"471\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Here\u2019s an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/12\/04\/instagram-story-hacks\">Instagram hack<\/a> that goes hand-in-hand with the above, but with one caveat: limit contests to one\/two per partnership. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/11\/instagram-giveaways?camplink=searchresults\">Running an Instagram contest<\/a>\u00a0with an influencer will cost you at least the amount you put up for a prize\u2014I\u2019ve generated significantly more interest with a $50 gift card than a $25 gift card, and would recommend that as a minimum\u2014so you want each contest to reach a different set of followers (inevitably there will be some overlap). You also want to keep in mind contest fatigue (a real and troublesome phenomenon).<\/p>\n<p>That said, once you\u2019ve isolated a followership, it\u2019s as simple as this: \u201cLike this picture, tag the friend you\u2019ll share your winnings with, and follow [your restaurant handle here].\u201d Ask the influencer if they\u2019ll share four or five pictures over the course of the next week and a half, and watch the followers roll in. Tapestry gained about 75 followers over the course of the contest we ran with the above-pictured blogger\u2014an increase of a little over 4%. Not at all negligible, when you\u2019re dealing with thousands of followers.<\/p>\n<p>Owners: whip up enough gnocchi to feed a food blogger and a contest winner, and you&#8217;ve basically grown your Instagram following for free.<\/p>\n<h2>3. \u201cYou #knead this pizza\u201d: live and die by catchy, authoritative copy<\/h2>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/restaurant-instagram-hacks-short-copy-bacon-compressor-min.png\" alt=\"Instagram Marketing for Restaurants Bacon\" width=\"863\" height=\"599\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Throw in a CTA and we\u2019re cooking with\u2026grease, here!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Save the long copy for that novel you are totally going to finish.

Use the right\u00a0scheduling tool<\/h2>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/restaurant-instagram-hacks-scheduling-tool-compressor.gif\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1290px) 1290px, 100vw\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/max_325x325\/public\/images\/restaurant-instagram-hacks-scheduling-tool-compressor.gif?hQcyU78fGrumxJ_A.X1h5fi2rplgluMc&amp;itok=_C_A0gVu 325w, https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/max_650x650\/public\/images\/restaurant-instagram-hacks-scheduling-tool-compressor.gif?mh2tlRQqviAaB0xL2bv_kGoRGv2oKy6C&amp;itok=Gq_OZw33 400w\" \/><\/div>\n<p>There are some pretty thorough articles out there on this subject\u2014here\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/strategic-content-marketing\/social-media-scheduling-tool-comparison-2017-b175d2c568ec\">one<\/a>, and here\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloggingwizard.com\/instagram-tools\/\">another<\/a>\u2014and I recommend reading all of them (avoiding, obviously, those that seem biased toward one tool or another). Post scheduling is something you don\u2019t want to mess around with. Instagram has long prided itself on being an app of \u201cspontaneous posting,\u201d and therefore does not allow third-party apps to post <em>for <\/em>you.<\/p>\n<p>You know that awesome bulk scheduling tool you get in Facebook Business Manager? Yeah, there\u2019s nothing of the sort in the Instagram UI. And no third-party posting means that apps like Hootsuite and Sprout Social have their hands tied.<\/p>\n<p>The best these apps can do is send a pin to your smartphone\u2014i.e., here is the post you scheduled, from your desktop, to appear on this date and time, now copy\/paste the text to Instagram and post with your smartphone. This isn\u2019t the worst thing in the world. It just means you have to remember to be <em>on<\/em> your phone when you get the reminder. Obviously not the best thing in the world, either.<\/p>\n<p>Your other option is to pay for a third-party app to outsource your scheduled posts to tech farms in Ukraine, India, and elsewhere. It\u2019s a hands-off alternative. They\u2019ll send your posts for you. But you risk having your account suspended.<\/p>\n<p>The following list of third-party apps is far from comprehensive, but comes from a guy who has made a mistake or two (or three) in the social game and feels thus inclined to expound upon his own tomfoolery.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/schedugr.am\/\">ScheduGram<\/a><strong>: <\/strong>Check the forums: ScheduGram is the undisputed king of third-party posting. You can post videos, manage filters, post the first comment (important feature, more on that shortly), and integrate Canva for edits. Instagram seems to more or less allow ScheduGram to do its thing\u2014few, if any accounts using it get suspended. One thing: it costs $20 per month. For one account. See above gif.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/onlypult.com\/\">Onlypult<\/a>: Pretty cost-effective (about $8\/month), but you lose some of the functionality of ScheduGram. I used Onlypult for about three days on an account, had trouble posting, resolved that, then promptly had a \u201cshadow ban\u201d imposed on my account. My posts stopped showing up in my hashtag lists. Likes plummeted. Impressions plummeted.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/restaurant-instagram-hacks-family-guy-2-min.png\" alt=\"Instagram Marketing for Restaurants \" width=\"507\" height=\"379\" \/><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/gramblr.com\/uploader\/#home\">Gramblr<\/a>: When you\u2019re in the annals of a Reddit thread about Gramblr, and a user with a name like \u201cgramblrlovr11\u201d come out of the woodwork and protests, \u201cI dont no why you say a bad thing about Gramblr, Gramblr is best app,\u201d you can safely take it with a grain of salt. This app follows\/unfollows users at a rampant pace, posts erroneous comments, and messes with your DMs. It will, in all likelihood, get your account suspended. And judging by its Reddit presence, its bots are learning and will soon render us all obsolete.<\/p>\n<p>*General internet consensus: stick with apps like Hootsuite, Buffer, and Sprout Social\u2014even if you have to use the free versions of these, with limited functionality. The hope is that, in the near future, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/13\/instagram-algorithm\">Instagram<\/a> will take pity on social media contractors everywhere and either integrate bulk scheduling into its UI, or allow third-party posting.<\/p>\n<h2>5.

This means that if you really want people to see your slick new homepage, but you also want to send low-funnel users right to your OpenTable page to make a reservation, you have to choose one or the other (unless you\u2019re running <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/22\/best-instagram-ads?camplink=searchresults\">Instagram ads<\/a>, in which case your options open up quite a bit).<\/p>\n<p>Just win a \u201cBest of Boston\u201d category, or get linked to in a \u201cBest City Patios\u201d article?

Users will be able to \u201cscroll up\u201d on a story to a webpage of the restaurant\u2019s choosing (perhaps a beautifully formatted menu, or an even more beautifully formatted \u201creserve table now\u201d button). The story link function is currently available to all verified <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/25\/inspiring-instagram-accounts\">Instagram accounts<\/a>, and to a lucky few among us in the bourgeois. The belief among erudite forum-dwellers seems to be that, like <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/16\/instagram-stories-analytics\">Instagram stories<\/a> before them, story links are being gradually \u201crolled out\u201d to all users.<\/p>\n<h2>6.

The idea is to have content that doesn\u2019t need coiffing, and Instagram users are surprisingly keen on making that association: filter (in any capacity) equals content that couldn\u2019t stand on its own.
