Here are a few ways to take this update in stride:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Take inventory of old searches<\/h3>\n<p>Since we\u2019re potentially losing past searches from before September 2020 (depending on the privacy thresholds) you may want to take a sweep through for anything notable. You can take inventory of any past search terms you may want to use as keywords, negatives, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/14\/ppc-ad-copywriting\">ad copy ideas <\/a>for future.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, now that we have access to more searches from February 2021 to now, take a look through your past searches from this year and see if anything new catches your eye.<\/p>\n<p>Aaron Levy, head of paid search at Tinuiti, has the same idea, telling advertisers to \u201charvest your long term trends.\u201d<\/p>\n<div data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"09b7c53f-4d36-48b0-8fa2-ab3297e1c277\" data-langcode=\"en\" class=\"embedded-entity align-center\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/search-terms-report-update-reaction-tweet.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"540\" alt=\"tweet about september 2021 google search terms report update\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bigalittlea\/status\/1435992309196337160\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>2. Start looking through your current searches more regularly<\/h3>\n<p>Remember, we now have the ability to see a bit more into our current search terms! The practice of making regular check ups on the search terms report may have been abandoned by some folks due to the previous September 2020 changes. If this sounds like you, try incorporating a search terms review back into<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/06\/ppc-account-audit\"> <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/06\/ppc-account-audit\">your regular PPC audit routine<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/06\/ppc-account-audit\">. <\/a><\/p>\n<p>Searches with impressions but no clicks can be just as telling because they indicate those users were not inclined to click on your ad.

Use Auction Insights and Google Trends for extra help<\/h3>\n<p>Lastly, these changes to the search terms report aren\u2019t super significant. I can anticipate some advertisers, myself included, still wanting more. While this may be the best we can get from the search terms report for now, you can piece together what your SERP looks like elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/2579754?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Auction insights <\/a>is a great place to start because, while it doesn\u2019t indicate what searches triggered your competitors to show, you at least know who else was sharing the SERP with you.

Therefore, it\u2019s best to take them in stride and see how you can make every update work for your business.<\/p>\n<p>So, what are you going to do to make this change work in your favor?
