You&#8217;ve probably already noticed the transition to the new-look Google logo, which aligns more closely with the aesthetic of its new parent company.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"942dc474-b2f3-471a-8163-9c1fbb110955\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-alphabet-new-logo.png\" alt=\"Google Alphabet new logo\" width=\"610\" height=\"271\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Many search industry pundits weren\u2019t sure what to make of <a href=\"https:\/\/abc.xyz\/\">the official announcement<\/a> at first, but it soon became apparent that Google wasn\u2019t kidding, and that Alphabet was indeed a real company. Underwhelming name notwithstanding, Alphabet will undoubtedly help Google shake things up, but many marketers had \u2013 and have \u2013 questions about the move.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s everything you need to know about Google, Alphabet, and how the new structure will affect you (or not).<\/p>\n<h2>What Is Alphabet, Inc.?<\/h2>\n<p>Alphabet, Inc. is a proposed holding company that will be the \u201cparent\u201d company to Google and many of Google\u2019s subsidiary organizations. Alphabet won\u2019t make or sell anything directly, but will instead be home to Google\u2019s search business and dozens of subsidiary organizations that are currently under the Google umbrella.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Is Google Doing This?<\/h2>\n<p>Over the years, Google has acquired dozens of companies and expanded its vast empire far beyond search, the bread and butter of its business. As such, Google\u2019s operational structure has become understandably complex. Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and numerous company stakeholders felt it was time to fold all the smaller companies (and Google itself) into a single, larger corporate entity that will allow each individual component of the business to function more efficiently independent of Google\u2019s primary search business.<\/p>\n<h2>Who\u2019s Going to Be In Charge at Alphabet?<\/h2>\n<p>Larry Page will assume the role of CEO at Alphabet, while Sergey Brin will become the company\u2019s president. Sundar Pichai, current Product Chief of Google\u2019s Internet business, will become CEO of Google, Inc., under the new structure. In addition, each individual subsidiary organization will have its own CEO to allow for greater organizational control and oversight, two of the main reasons for the switch. Many existing CEOs of Google-owned companies, such as Nest\u2019s Tony Fadell and YouTube\u2019s Susan Wojcicki, will remain in their current roles.<\/p>\n<h2>When Is This Going to Happen?<\/h2>\n<p>At this time, Alphabet is merely a proposed umbrella company \u2013 nothing has been finalized or set in stone. To complete the transition, Alphabet must first be created as a subsidiary company of Google. Once this is done, the roles of the two companies will be reversed, with Google becoming a subsidiary of Alphabet. In Google\u2019s official filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Alphabet is expected to report its earnings as a Google subsidiary by the end of this year, so the transition should be finalized by sometime next year.<\/p>\n<h2>Is the Google Search Engine Going to Be Rebranded Alphabet?<\/h2>\n<p>No. The Google we\u2019ve all come to rely upon isn\u2019t going anywhere. You won\u2019t have to switch to alphabet.com as your primary search engine, nor is \u201calphabetting\u201d going to become a verb the way \u201cGoogle\u201d did. Google as it exists today will be preserved under the new structure.<\/p>\n<h2>What Will Happen to AdWords?<\/h2>\n<p>Nothing. As AdWords is a core part of Google\u2019s search business \u2013 and represents the vast majority of Google\u2019s immense annual earnings \u2013 AdWords will also be left intact. You won\u2019t have to make any changes to your existing or future campaigns, and you won\u2019t be forced to get to grips with any new editors or tools that wouldn\u2019t have been introduced by Google anyway. Everything AdWords-related will continue to operate as normal.<\/p>\n<h2>What Will Happen to My Google Shares?<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re fortunate enough to own shares in Google, you don\u2019t have anything to worry about. Stock in Google, Inc. (Google\u2019s Internet business) will continue to trade under the GOOG and GOOGL ticker symbols on the NASDAQ. Following the completion of the transition outlined above, Google stock will be rebranded as Alphabet stock, retaining the shares\u2019 value and price history. In short, nothing much will change aside from some naming conventions (depending on which stock you own). If you\u2019re worried, talk to your investment manager.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"87ed8671-b6f3-4643-9442-de5cec447112\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-alphabet-shares.jpg\" alt=\"Google Alphabet shares\" width=\"1910\" height=\"1000\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Is Google Selling Off Parts of Its Business?<\/h2>\n<p>No official announcements about potential sales of Google properties have been announced, but it\u2019s highly unlikely that Google will be willing to part with any of the companies it has acquired in the past few years. We\u2019re unlikely to see a sale of YouTube due to the new organizational structure or anything like that, and if we do, it has probably been in the works for some time anyway.<\/p>\n<h2>How Many Subsidiary Companies Will Become Part of Alphabet?<\/h2>\n<p>In short, quite a few. Google, Inc. \u2013 the Google we all know today \u2013 will be the largest of the companies under the Alphabet umbrella. Moving forward, many of Google\u2019s individual departments will be spun off into smaller subsidiary organizations that will operate and function as small, self-contained companies rather than departments, including Android and YouTube.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5761e3f6-d74e-4e59-a873-dd47c6551d19\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-alphabet-organizational-structure-diagram.png\" alt=\"Google Alphabet organizational structure\" width=\"300\" height=\"243\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s All This About Contact Lenses and Internet Balloons?<\/h2>\n<p>Google hasn\u2019t been a plain old Internet company for a <em>long<\/em> time. During the past decade, Google has embarked on increasingly ambitious projects that could \u2013 literally \u2013 change the course of human history. Many of these projects, such as the driverless car initiative, were conceived within Google\u2019s secretive ideas laboratory Google X.<\/p>\n<p>As part of the new Alphabet corporate structure, Google X and many other of Google\u2019s more esoteric interests will be free to operate outside of the confines of Google, Inc. Calico Labs (Google\u2019s research division focused on life expectancy and combatting the ageing process), Google Life Sciences (home of the Google contact lens project), and Google\u2019s robotics division will all operate autonomously as part of Alphabet.<\/p>\n<p>Check out this pretty cool video of how Google has changed over the years, from its humble beginnings to its potentially world-altering future:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"videos\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_video\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ba5f852a-e0b2-438d-a72f-8d7df48f484e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/olFEpeMwgHk?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/profile\/view?authToken=zRgB&amp;authType=name&amp;id=14611789\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Want to know what&#8217;s going on with Google and Alphabet?
