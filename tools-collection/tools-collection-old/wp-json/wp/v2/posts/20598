Check out our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/18\/search-advertising-benchmarks\">2022 Search Advertising Benchmarks<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: Is there any data available for non-profits?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: Interestingly, we didn&#8217;t see many non-profit advertisers on Facebook (and we looked)! Facebook doesn&#8217;t offer the same free advertising grants for non-profits and charities that Google does so we see a lot more non-profits on Google rather than Facebook.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: Do you have any benchmarks for Facebook Lead Gen ads?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: The above benchmarks include all ad types, including Lead Gen ads.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: I&#8217;m a bit confused by your conversion rate percentage. It seems incredibly high. What are you considering conversions? Was it a form filled out and the FB pixel counted once the submission takes the visitor to a thank you page or is it as simple as a page view?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: Conversions are measured based on the goals on the advertisers &#8211; for some, that may be a sale, providing your contact information, submitting a form, or placing a call.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: When you are talking about clicks are you talking about link clicks or all clicks on the ad? In my opinion, it&#8217;s vital to differentiate CTR (All) and CTR (Link Click-Through Rate). To make it a little more complex, there are Unique CTRs in Facebook metrics. The percentages can be very different. Of course, every marketer can find out about all of this thanks to Facebook&#8217;s Help Center, but since your post is giving averages it should be clear which metric you&#8217;re showing us.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: Here we&#8217;re using the Clicks (All) metric for simplicity, which includes link clicks as well as other media engagements, app downloads, lead fill, etc<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: I was also wondering what&#8217;s your definition for Actions? Is it the total number of actions people took that are attributed to the ads? The metric includes any action that was recorded and attributed to the ads which is the sum of engagement actions (such as post reactions or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/30\/facebook-video-views\">video views<\/a>), link clicks and conversions (such as website adds to cart or offline purchases).<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: Here we&#8217;re using the action metric as defined within Facebook, which is typically conversions, but also includes similar engagements such as lead submissions and app downloads.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: Which countries\/regions are included in this data?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: This data is based on US-based advertisers only.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: How exactly do you define a conversion and an action in this context?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: Conversions are measured based on the goals on the advertisers &#8211; for some, that may be a sale, providing your contact information, submitting a form, or placing a call.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: Wondering if this data includes both prospecting and retargeting ads? We see much higher performance on retargeting, obviously, so these numbers would be higher if you had included both types of campaign.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: This data here includes all ad targeting types. We see similar great success from remarketing ads on Facebook, so most of our clients use them more than other types of targeting, so data may skew remarketing-heavy above, but it does include everything.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: I was just wondering which FB definition you use for CPC. Are you talking about CPC (All) or CPC (Cost per Link Click)?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: Here we\u2019re looking at CPC (all).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: Do you have any data regarding the average cost per impression or CPC for this year?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: Not yet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: Thanks for sharing your research! Do you happen to have done a similar study for LinkedIn and Bing? I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing those too! Thanks again!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/06\/bing-ads-performance-benchmarks\">We do have this data for Bing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: Do you know what the average product price was per industry for those rates? It would be a great help in understanding how to use the data, for instance if a Technology product was based on the average price of a laptop at $1500 and the CPA was $55.21 compared to say Phone charger at $25 with a CA of $55.21.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: We don\u2019t and that data doesn\u2019t pass through the API, so it would be difficult to get.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: I don&#8217;t see anywhere which settings for attribution is used? 1-day view and 28-day click? Or? Please share!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: Yes, the standard Facebook attribution window is used here.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can you clarify how you are defining the industries or do you have a link to how they are defined?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: This was done manually since it only included a few hundred clients.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: Great post! I would like to know the formulas you used in order to determine the numbers in your charts so I can use the same formulas to calculate on my end.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: Click through rate= Clicks \/ Impressions<\/p>\n<p>Cost per click = Cost \/ Clicks<\/p>\n<p>Conversion rate = Conversions\/ Clicks<\/p>\n<p>Cost per Acquisition = Cost\/ Conversions<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: So basically you&#8217;re paying $200 for 1 click to a site (1% avg CTR and $2 avg per click) on Facebook&#8230; And that doesn&#8217;t even factor in conversion ratios. Pretty rough out there.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: No &#8211; a $2 cost per click means that you\u2019d pay $2 to send a visitor to your site.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why would conversion rate be much much higher than CTR? All contributed by lead ads? 10% average is&#8230; I can&#8217;t understand.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: Facebook\u2019s ads can be highly targeted so that you only reach the audiences and demographics you\u2019re most sure will convert on your site. Although CTR and CVR are generally correlated, it\u2019s fine to have an ad with a higher CVR than CTR.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: Could you please give some more insight into which brands\/companies have you evaluated to arrive at the industry metrics? Are they established brands, startups, large\/mid-sized?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: The companies in this sample were all different sizes but leaning toward small\/midsize rather than large established brands.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: Is the definition of Action the same for your Facebook and Google Benchmark study? If so, should I say that ROI on Facebook seems to be much better than on Google for most of the sectors when measured by CPA? Thanks.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: Yes! Many of our clients find success on both networks \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: Have you done any comparisons with Google Ads?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: Indeed! <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/29\/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks\">Here you go.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: Does this data reflect ads that were only placed on Facebook (newsfeed, desktop right column, instant articles) or does this also include ads placed through Facebook on Instagram and the Audience Network?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: The data here is reflective only of those on Facebook and the Facebook app and does not include Instagram or the Audience network.<em><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook ad performance can vary widely for different business types and industries.
