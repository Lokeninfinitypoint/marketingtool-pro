So far it\u2019s having the intended effect: Google reports that accounts have seen up to a 3% increase in clicks as a result.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s justification for this change makes sense: function words rarely (if ever) have an impact on searcher intent; someone searching for \u201cjobs in united states\u201d is probably looking for the same information as someone searching for \u201cjobs in the united states\u201d or \u201cjobs united states.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are cases in which semantic match is inconvenient, counter-productive, and potentially costly.<\/p>\n<p>Per our data scientist Mark Irvine,<\/p>\n<p><em>Brand advertisers may notice their accounts struggle because of this change, particularly if their brand name includes a location or other common words. Consider The Copley Square Hotel bidding on the exact keyword of its brand name [The Copley Square Hotel]. To them, someone searching for the exact term \u201cThe Copley Square Hotel\u201d is highly qualified brand traffic whereas someone searching for the term \u201cHotel by Copley Square\u201d or even \u201cCopley Square Hotel\u201d is effectively a non-branded search.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>The Aggregate Impact of Exact-Enough Match Keywords<\/h2>\n<p>Our marketing team\u2019s dear sweet data guy, Josh, wrote a script to remove function words from the active Exact Match keywords of 100 client accounts.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a17449b8-0faa-4b14-9132-56bc1835086f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/josh-brackett.png\" alt=\"joshua brackett wordstream marketing data analyst\" width=\"366\" height=\"401\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>By doing so, we ascertained what kind of impact the new, broader Exact Match might have on different sized AdWords accounts across an array of verticals.<\/p>\n<p>The 100 accounts we used were selected at random and all exceed $1,000 in monthly spend. \u00a0All metrics reflect performance during the 30-day period before March 23.<\/p>\n<p>After stripping away function words, Josh de-duplicated the new data set to account for keywords which, thanks to the new, broader definition of \u201cExact,\u201d have been rendered superfluous.<\/p>\n<p>A quick note on the larger conversation on the impact of Exact Match changing.

Where Aaron focused his in-depth analysis on three individual accounts, we tried to get the view from 10,000 feet. In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll be digging into a few individual accounts that have seen a particularly large impact from the match type changes: stay tuned!<\/p>\n<p>Before jumping into the high-level overview, here are some quick-hits:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Of the 100 randomly selected accounts, only 67 had active Exact Match keywords<\/li>\n<li>In total, we analyzed 3,399 active Exact Match keywords<\/li>\n<li>On average, each account contained 9 exact match keywords that were stripped away during deduplication<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>41% of Exact Match Keyword Spend Was Impacted<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"fda04b47-174e-4e64-85a6-0bf0a4f2c7dd\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/exact-match-keywords-adwords-total-spent.png\" alt=\"new exact match keyword rules\" width=\"516\" height=\"328\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Our data set consisted of just under $69,000 in Exact Match keyword spend over the course of 30 days; of that $69k, <strong>41% was spent on keywords that, today, Google would consider duplicates<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>While we found that the majority of the money spent on active Exact Match keywords (59%) was unimpacted by the change (meaning our advertisers are doing a solid job taking advantage of close variants and adding negative keywords), that still leaves a substantial chunk of money unaccounted for. In fact, that\u2019s about $422 per account analyzed that AdWords will now allocate to close-ish keyword auctions.<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019d much rather have full control over my four hundred and twenty-two hard-earned advertising dollars.<\/p>\n<h2>36% of Exact Match Keyword Impressions Impacted<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d3fb4a43-4afe-423b-bcb4-f4f9022f7b7b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/exact-match-keyword-adwords-total-impressions.png\" alt=\"exact match keyword change data impressions\" width=\"547\" height=\"343\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Previously, impressions tied to Exact Match keywords meant that a search query was a literal doppelganger or a close variant (see previous section for a breakdown).<\/p>\n<p>We determined that, out of the 1,080,989 impressions tied to Exact Match keywords in the accounts analyzed, 36% were for keywords that, for all intents and purposes, have been rendered irrelevant.<\/p>\n<p>Consequently, this means that 36% of these Exact Match keywords are now competing in the same auctions\u2014 for the same impressions\u2014 as the other Exact Match keywords in these accounts.<\/p>\n<p>This has the potential to frustrate advertisers on two fronts.<\/p>\n<p>First, it makes account management more difficult. Not knowing that you have duplicate keywords is a pain, but figuring out where they are and if they\u2019re costing you money can be a massive investment of time, too.<\/p>\n<p>More importantly, though, by bidding on multiple keywords vying for SERP real estate in the same auction, you can drive up your own CPC\u2019s for each keyword.<\/p>\n<p>No thank you.<\/p>\n<h2>18% of Exact Match Keywords Impacted by Google\u2019s Shift Towards Semantic-Match<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"700cba19-8e18-45de-b3c4-d7541a1ebb95\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/aggregate-impact-google-adwords-exact-match-keyword-change1.png\" alt=\"aggregate impact of google adwords exact match keyword change\" width=\"532\" height=\"313\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Overall, across the 100 accounts we analyzed, Josh identified that, when stripped of function words, 18% of all Exact Match keywords were now considered duplicates of at least one other Exact Match Keyword.<\/p>\n<p>I already touched on the fact that this means your keywords are competing against themselves.

If you had maximum control over your keywords, you probably would. As such, it\u2019s important to understand that, while 18% might not sound like much in the abstract, a change that impacts nearly one fifth of your Exact Match keywords has the potential to increase your costs and decrease your ad\u2019s relevance to a searcher.<\/p>\n<h2>What to do about the Exact Match Keyword changes<\/h2>\n<p>First: my sincere apologies for making you read the phrase \u201cExact Match keyword\u201d 327 times.<\/p>\n<p>As you continue to wrap your head around Google\u2019s new version of Exact Match keywords, watch your Search Terms Report (or QueryStream) like a hawk. Look at your most popular Exact Match keywords. Are they made up of single words or are they long-tail phrases? If your keywords include multiple words, write down each word of that keyword and then write out every permutation of those words in different orders.<\/p>\n<p>In the event any of those re-ordered search terms are irrelevant to your business, add them as negatives and adjust bids so that your top performing keywords receive their fair share of your overall budget and let newly useless terms fade into the ether.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"e6425a1f-ade2-48f4-a076-2b97b4bd0329\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/wordstream-exact-match-keyword-change-webinar.png\" alt=\"wordstream exact match keyword change webinar\" width=\"692\" height=\"535\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Looking for more information?
