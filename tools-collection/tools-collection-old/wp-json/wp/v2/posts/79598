Decide if flexibility or ease is your priority before launching.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Avoid the temptation to be overly promotional<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When you have access to a group of loyal customers, it\u2019s easy to get carried away with sending sales promotions. An occasional offer (especially if it\u2019s exclusive to the group) is OK, but spend more time fostering conversations and support between members.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stay engaged<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>People like to be heard by the brands they support. So stay active in your community. Ask for opinions, spotlight community members, and hold Q&amp;A sessions to keep the conversation flowing.<\/p>\n<div id=\"see-an-influencer-influx-in-B2B-marketing\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. We\u2019ll see an influencer influx in B2B marketing<\/h3>\n<p>In 2024, B2B marketers will be looking for ways to create authentic engagements that feature real people offering relatable insights and solutions.

Use these tips to develop a high-performing B2B influencer marketing strategy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Consider a micro-influencer<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Your best influencer isn\u2019t necessarily the one with the biggest social media following. In fact, someone who has high engagement with a thousand people in your target market could deliver a huge return. Remember that your influencer\u2019s followers also have a network, so you could gain visibility well beyond the initial audience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reward your internal influencers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If social media isn\u2019t a part of someone\u2019s regular job duties, make sure to offer them something in exchange for their brand evangelism. They\u2019re not only creating posts, but they\u2019re also giving you access to their personal social media accounts\u2014which they\u2019ve spent time developing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Set clear goals from the start<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll need to justify your influencer investment. You should have a clear idea of what a good payback looks like for your company before launching the strategy. Get buy-in from senior management on your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/19\/ppc-metrics\">metrics<\/a> so there\u2019s no question that the program is working.<\/p>\n<div id=\"Original-data-will-be-key-to-working-with-and-besting-AI\"><\/div>\n<h3>Original data will be key to working with, and besting, AI<\/h3>\n<p>Prompt-and-post AI content can steal your search traffic in the short term. Original data and experiences will not only retake the SERPs, but it\u2019ll also help you get clicks outside of search engines.<\/p>\n<p>Some shady AI content factories got a lot of early traffic pushing hundreds of posts out quickly. Google is starting to take action, dropping those robo posts from the ranks and throttling the websites\u2019 traffic.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/B2B-marketing-trends-wordstream-ross-2.webp\" alt=\"B2B marketing trends - Tweet about falling Google traffic from AI content.\" width=\"424\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-79609 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/B2B-marketing-trends-wordstream-ross-2.webp 424w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/B2B-marketing-trends-wordstream-ross-2-212x300.webp 212w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In 2024, expect to see more marketers creating content based on original data and first-hand experiences that no one else has as an AI-proof solution.

These tips are useful no matter how big your marketing is.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conduct customer interviews<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Pretty much every business has customers and they\u2019re all a great source of stories and insights about your industry. You can talk to them about how they use your product. Or go up-funnel and ask them to describe a common industry challenge they had and how they overcame it. The idea is to use their original experiences to educate others in their position.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pull internal data<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>What data do you have about your customers? If it\u2019s useful to others and you can make it anonymous, build a blog post, report, or video around it. The data will be easier to gather if you sell some type of software. But say you sell a range of power tools to professional landscapers. What types of tools are they buying this year? What time of year do they start buying? These insights could be helpful to resellers or landscapers looking to make a purchase.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Share your own experience<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s not a business on earth that doesn\u2019t have a \u201chow we got here\u201d story. And it\u2019ll be interesting to any other business that\u2019s trying to grow. Even better, if you made a bad choice along the way and learned something from it, write about it. People will flock to that content.<\/p>\n<h2>Have your best year ever with these B2B marketing trends<\/h2>\n<p>2024 could either be the best of times or the worst of times for B2B marketers.
