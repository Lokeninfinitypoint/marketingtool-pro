Every time you get a call from a recruiter or another company, document the rate they are pitching you at.<\/p>\n<p>Capture as many data points as you can wherever you can get them. We&#8217;ll use these data points to build your case to get a raise. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/elanagross\/2016\/06\/27\/8-managers-share-the-best-way-to-ask-for-a-raise-and-get-it\/?sh=2c312f3f74ff\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">best way to ask for a raise<\/a> is using data and logic, not emotion.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Be specific<\/h3>\n<p>Like all negotiations, you can ask for whatever you want! However, you have to be able to justify what you are asking.<\/p>\n<p>The market average is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/articles\/personal-finance\/090415\/salary-secrets-what-considered-big-raise.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">3-5%<\/a> of your current salary. This of course will vary depending on your industry and company as well as your experience and individual performance.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Build your case<\/h3>\n<p>Great results are the key to you getting a raise. Be meticulous about documenting every win, accomplishment, and result you&#8217;ve produced that moved the company forward. Yes, I&#8217;m asking you to keep a log of results.<\/p>\n<p>This will actually make you a better employee because you&#8217;ll be more aware of the contributions you&#8217;ve made to your company. This greater awareness will also increase your confidence when asking for a raise.<\/p>\n<p>The best results to document are ones you can tie to cost savings, time savings, increased revenue, and increased efficiency.<\/p>\n<p><em>Here&#8217;s a real-world example:<\/em> On the first day of my job at my previous employer, I walked into a stack of receipts from staffing agencies. Staffing agencies charge on average 20% of a candidate&#8217;s base salary as a placement fee. Therefore, a $100,000 software engineer would cost $20,000 to hire. As the internal recruiter, my job was to relieve the company of its dependence on staffing agencies to save costs. During my seven years with this company, we hired over 400 team members and didn&#8217;t pay a single perm placement fee. I documented every hire we made as well as how much it would have cost if we hired through an agency. This is I how grew my salary by 57% and ranked in the top 1% of highest-paid corporate recruiters in the nation.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Make the ask<\/h3>\n<p>Be direct and lead with results. The key to making an effective ask is your preparation. Speak to your manager in terms they care about.<\/p>\n<p>The following are actual supporting points I&#8217;ve used to consistently get raises.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hired 114 employees while paying $0 in hiring fees to 3rd party agencies (7 years consecutive).<\/li>\n<li>Saved $8,000 \/ year by discontinuing unnecessary recruiting software licenses.<\/li>\n<li>Effectiveness &amp; Results: 77 hires (42 regular, 22 temps, 13 contractors) despite the loss of one full-time recruiter.<\/li>\n<li>Facilitated nearshore resourcing initiative which cut development costs 50%.<\/li>\n<li>Implemented &#8220;pipeline recruiting&#8221; strategy which reduced time to hire by 50%.<\/li>\n<li>Saved $5,000 of approved recruiting spend by maximizing organic recruitment strategies.<\/li>\n<li>Achieved 60% y-o-y increase of internal referrals (135 total) by influencing a recruiting culture.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As you can see, I&#8217;m big into tying my results to cost savings and increased efficiency. This is a highly effective strategy to get a raise and should also give you an example of the way you can and should structure your results.<\/p>\n<div id=\"what-not-to-say-when-asking-for-a-raise\">\n<p><a class=\"subhead-anchor\" rel=\"#what-not-to-say-when-asking-for-a-raise\"><svg width=\"19\" height=\"19\" viewbox=\"0 0 14 14\"><g fill=\"none\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\"><path d=\"M0 0h14v14H0z\"><\/path><path d=\"M7.45 9.887l-1.62 1.621c-.92.92-2.418.92-3.338 0a2.364 2.364 0 0 1 0-3.339l1.62-1.62-1.273-1.272-1.62 1.62a4.161 4.161 0 1 0 5.885 5.884l1.62-1.62L7.45 9.886zM5.527 5.135L7.17 3.492c.92-.92 2.418-.92 3.339 0 .92.92.92 2.418 0 3.339L8.866 8.473l1.272 1.273 1.644-1.643A4.161 4.161 0 1 0 5.897 2.22L4.254 3.863l1.272 1.272zm-.66 3.998a.749.749 0 0 1 0-1.06l2.208-2.206a.749.749 0 1 1 1.06 1.06L5.928 9.133a.75.75 0 0 1-1.061 0z\"><\/path><\/g><\/svg><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>What not to say when asking for a raise<\/h2>\n<\/div>\n<p>When asking for a raise, there are a few things not to say.
