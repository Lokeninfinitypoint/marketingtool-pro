Sales promotions take many different forms, but they all focus on persuading a target audience to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/04\/nurture-marketing\">become customers of a business<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sales20promotion20examples20fall20sale.png\" alt=\"sales promotion examples fall sale\" width=\"800\" height=\"512\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Sales promotions can be announced over free channels like social media, email, or your website;\u00a0or they can be the focal point of your paid advertising campaigns such as with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/05\/linkedin-advertising\">LinkedIn ads<\/a> or Google Ads.

By offering free samples to all in the store regardless of whether they purchase something, this strategy (employed by businesses like Costco and Whole Foods) introduces\u00a0consumers\u00a0to products they may not have considered before, and oftentimes cordially\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/03\/increase-sales-online\">encourages them to buy<\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Do you have a product that you\u2019re trying to sell? Give out samples! While this works best with food (both in-store and at farmer&#8217;s markets), it can also be used by spas and salons\u2014with tester lotions, perfumes, or aromatherapy products. The bottom line is that people like things they can try before buying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udea8 <strong>Free guide download &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite15SalesPromoExamples.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_15SalesPromoExamples_Download\">15 Insanely Effective Sales Promotion Examples to Win More Customers<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">3. Buy one, get one free promotions<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Buy one, get one free deals (aka BOGO) are among the most popular types of sales promotions. Offering two of an in-demand product at a reduced price and for a short time creates a sense of urgency that can boost sales. It can also clear stock, which is why, within business circles, BOGO promos are often referred to as \u201cself-liquidating\u201d. <\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sales20promotion20examples20buy20one20get20one20free20papa20johns20pizza_0.png\" alt=\"sales promotion examples buy one get one free papa johns pizza\" width=\"400\" height=\"535\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The great thing is that these promotions <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/01\/marketing-ideas-for-small-businesses\">rarely cost anything<\/a>. In fact, they\u2019re designed to <em>increase<\/em> revenue. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">For example, let\u2019s say you pay $3 for a product that you sell for $10. If you offer a 50% discount, you\u2019d be making $2 from selling just one at the discounted price. However, running a BOGO discount means you can sell one item at full price minus your cost for two items so, in the end, you\u2019d be earning $4. With more people buying that product as a result of your promo, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/07\/agency-profitability-metrics\">your profits would soar<\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">The great thing is that these promotions rarely cost anything. In fact, they\u2019re designed to <em>increase<\/em> revenue.<\/span><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">BOGO deals work with more than just product-based businesses; they also work for service-based businesses. Fitness studios, spas, salons, consultants, and trainers can offer BOGO deals on their classes or trainings to fill their schedules or <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing\/marketing-during-slow-economy-recession\/\">get new clients during a slow season<\/a>. Since service-based businesses are more time- than product value-related, the only cost is time. So especially if you have time to spare, this is a perfect promotion to try.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">4. Cashback promotions<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Many consumers would agree that it doesn\u2019t feel as bad to spend money when you get some in return. It\u2019s almost like paying less from the start and then having extra money to get other desirable products.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sales20promotion20examples20get20cash20back_0.png\" alt=\"sales promotion examples get cash back\" width=\"330\" height=\"516\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Plus, giving back to customers in this way usually results in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/10\/customer-loyalty\">more loyalty and business from them<\/a>. This kind of offer is a win-win for both you and your customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">5. Lifestyle discounts<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Lifestyle discounts are those that apply to a particular profession, age group, or demographic.\u2014usually one associated with an ID.\u00a0They\u00a0commonly available for:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Teachers<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Students <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Veterans<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Seniors<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">While you can offer these promotions year-round, there are also months and days of the year dedicated to specific groups of people, so be sure to take advantage of that. For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/back-to-school-marketing-ideas\/\">back to school discounts<\/a> are <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/10\/september-marketing-ideas\">great September promotions<\/a>, while August is home to National Senior Citizen&#8217;s Day. Keep an eye on your calendar for these <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/21\/october-marketing-ideas\">monthly marketing themes <\/a>so that you can plan your promos well in advance and maximize their results! <\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sales20promotion20examples20teacher20special.png\" alt=\"sales promotion examples teacher special\" width=\"800\" height=\"513\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">6. Flash sales and discounts<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">A flash sale creates a sense of urgency among your customer base to buy <em>now<\/em>. So especially if you have a business that does a lot of online sales, flash sales may be one of the more effective sales promotion strategies for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sales20promotion20examples20flas20sale20promo20code.png\" alt=\"sales promotion examples flash sale promo code\" width=\"800\" height=\"510\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">There are at least two ways to go about this type of sales promotion. One, you could do a flash sale once or twice a year. Or, two, you could do one on a set schedule each month so that people are anticipating the event and prepared to make purchases on short notice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In either case, be sure to utilize social media and email marketing campaigns to announce when the sale will be happening. You can even create a fun branded hashtag to get your audience hyped to buy!<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; align-content: space-evenly; border-top: 1px solid #000; border-bottom: 1px solid #000; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly; padding-top: 50px; padding-bottom: 50px;\">\n<div style=\"margin: auto; display: flex; flex-direction: row; flex-wrap: wrap; align-items: flex-start;\">\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px !important; padding-right: 10px;\">Brought to you by<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/WS-Logo-2023.webp\" alt=\"wordstream logo\" width=\"130\" height=\"auto\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 30px !important; text-align: center; margin-top: 5px;\">Ready to grow your business?<\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin: auto; width: 70%; padding-bottom: 25px;\">\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px; text-align: center;\">Unlock the results you\u2019re looking for with technology-backed solutions designed for small businesses and agencies.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"margin: auto;\"><a style=\"padding: 10px 50px; border-radius: 24px; background-color: #0047ff; color: #f9f5ea; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;\" onmouseover=\"this.style.background='#0097ff'\" onmouseout=\"this.style.background='#0047ff'\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/marketing-services?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Demo_Blog_Demo&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links&amp;itm_content=incontent_links_htmldesign\">Get your free demo<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"sales-promotion-examples-to-encourage-repeat-business\"><\/div>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">Sales promotions that encourage repeat business<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Repeat business is often the best business.

Vouchers and coupons<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">You can offer vouchers and coupons via email, your website, or print materials such as product packaging, catalogs, and so on. They are a great way to thank your current customers and to encourage them to continue doing business with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">One way to really get people excited about their next purchase with you is to offer a mystery coupon. Not only is it <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/04\/interactive-content\">interactive<\/a>, but it also makes customers feel as if they\u2019re playing a game and getting more than just a run-of-the-mill discount.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sales20promotion20examples20mystery20coupon_0.png\" alt=\"sales promotion examples mystery coupon\" width=\"480\" height=\"536\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If you do give this a try, be sure to capitalize on every opportunity with a multi-pronged campaign and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/02\/landing-page-tips-and-tricks\">strategically-crafted landing page<\/a>.

All you have to do is bundle products or services from each brand into a package and promote it via the other brand(s). Your partners can do the same for you, which means free promotion for both of you. <\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sales20promotion20examples20joint20promotions.png\" alt=\"sales promotion examples joint promotions\" width=\"800\" height=\"326\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This type of arrangement can extend the reach of your brand. It familiarizes new potential customers with what you offer and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/11\/get-more-conversions\">increases the likelihood that they\u2019ll convert <\/a>in the future. <span lang=\"EN\">The partnership between Red Robin and the X-Men Wolverine franchise is a fine example of a joint promotion.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sales20promotion20examples20joint20promo20red20robin.png\" alt=\"sales promotion examples joint promo red robin\" width=\"800\" height=\"531\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Red Robin offered discounts to patrons who showed up for a burger with their Wolverine ticket stub in hand. While they may not have received a discount for the actual movie, the film benefitted from attracting people who were more excited about the burger at the end of the tunnel than the movie itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">12. Social media contests and giveaways<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/11\/instagram-giveaways\">A contest or giveaway on Facebook<\/a>, Instagram, or your target audience\u2019s social platform of choice is a great way to get new customers interested in your business and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/19\/get-more-instagram-followers\">gain more quality followers<\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">For example, one common method is to require followers to tag a certain number of people in the comments, or post to their stories, to be entered to win. <\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sales20promotion20examples20giveaway20instagram.png\" alt=\"sales promotion examples giveaway instagram\" width=\"800\" height=\"446\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If you can get your existing audience excited enough about your contest or giveaway, this is basically guaranteed exposure. And not only does it increase your business\u2019s reach on social media, but it specifically increases awareness of your brand <em>among <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/23\/buyer-personas\">your ideal customer base<\/a><\/em>! This boosts the probability of meaningful engagement and sales in the future. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">13. Shopping sprees<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">One of the most exciting in-store sales promotions you can do is an \u201center to win\u201d contest that gives the winner a shopping spree in your store. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Of course, you have to be careful not to leave too much merchandise up for grabs because that could end up costing you dearly. However, allowing for a generous shopping spree can prompt <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/26\/word-of-mouth-marketing\">powerful word-of-mouth marketing.<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sales20promotion20examples20shopping20sprees_0.jpg\" alt=\"sales promotion examples shopping sprees\" width=\"350\" height=\"438\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">No doubt, the winner will be excited to share their good news and, after the spree is finished, to show off their goods. This <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/28\/user-generated-content\">user-generated content <\/a>can put your business on the radar of potential customers and encourage them to check out what you offer.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">14. Give branded gifts or bundles<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Additional value for less can be very enticing, so you may bundle together your most popular or closely-related services for a reduced price. This is an excellent way to get people talking about your business. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Alternatively, you can offer branded gifts to existing customers and others. The more loyal a supporter of your brand, the more often they\u2019ll use your branded gifts. Who knows how many people will find out about, be reminded of, and check out your brand as a result? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Both bundles and branded gifts can spark a good deal of new interest in your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Businesses that give out promotional merchandise increase their chances of getting new customers by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gopromotional.co.uk\/blog\/10-amazing-statistics-about-promotional-products\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">83%<\/a>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">15. Referral discounts<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Bringing new customers into the fold should always be on your radar. One way to keep the new customers rolling in is to offer discounts when current customers refer a friend or promote you on social media. <\/span><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sales20promotion20ideas20referral20promotions_0.png\" alt=\"sales promotion ideas and examples referral promotions\" width=\"582\" height=\"623\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Alternatively, you could give money that can be put toward a customer\u2019s next purchase. In either case, you\u2019ll need to decide if the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/06\/referral-marketing\">referral<\/a> alone is enough or if the discount is only applied after the new customer makes a purchase. If you choose to offer a discount regardless of whether or not anything is purchased, try to place a threshold on the number of referrals required before the discount takes effect. For example, get 25% off your next visit if you make three referrals.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">Which sales promotion ideas will you try?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">These 15 proven sales promotion examples and ideas include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Google My Business offer posts<\/li>\n<li>Free samples<\/li>\n<li>Buy one, get one free deals<\/li>\n<li>Cashback promotions<\/li>\n<li>Lifestyle discounts<\/li>\n<li>Flash sales and discounts<\/li>\n<li>Vouchers and coupons<\/li>\n<li>Charitable cause promotions<\/li>\n<li>Free shipping and returns<\/li>\n<li>Loyalty program promotions<\/li>\n<li>Joint promotions<\/li>\n<li>Social media contests or giveaways<\/li>\n<li>Shopping sprees<\/li>\n<li>Branded gifts or bundles<\/li>\n<li>Referral discounts<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">No doubt, there are at least a few you could implement and test at little to no cost to you.
