Perfect your account structure<\/h3>\n<p>This one isn\u2019t so much an optimization as a best practice, or rather, a requirement if you want to succeed at all in Facebook ads; and Empiric Marketing, LLC founder Brett McHale addresses it in his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/13\/facebook-advertising-tips\">habits of highly effective Facebook advertisers post<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Too many times, advertisers break out their campaigns according to who their targeting rather than what their objective is. So let\u2019s say you have an SEO ebook for small businesses. You have three different variations of the ebook\u2014one for physical therapists, one for interior designers, and one for lawyers.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of creating three separate campaigns for each audience, the better way to go is to create one campaign for the ebook and then within the campaign create three ad sets for each audience. This is how Facebook campaigns and ad sets are meant to be used.<\/p>\n<p>With this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/30\/facebook-ads-account-structure\">proper Facebook ad account structure<\/a>, you can more efficiently manage and optimize your ads as well as scale your efforts and offers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/how-to-optimize-facebook-ads-account-structure-right-wrong.png\" alt=\"how to optimize facebook ads - account structure setup\" width=\"720\" height=\"391\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64860 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/how-to-optimize-facebook-ads-account-structure-right-wrong.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/how-to-optimize-facebook-ads-account-structure-right-wrong-480x261.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/how-to-optimize-facebook-ads-account-structure-right-wrong-full-size.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Click to enlarge<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a id=\"pixel\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>2. Set up the Meta Pixel with Google Tag Manager<\/h3>\n<p>That&#8217;s right. Google Tag Manager can be used for more than just <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/30\/google-ads-conversion-tracking\">Google Ads conversion tracking<\/a>. For any <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/10\/paid-media-strategy\">paid media strategy<\/a>, if you want to track conversions that take place on your website, you\u2019ll need to install a tracking pixel. Through partner integrations, Facebook Ads Manager has made it possible to set up the Meta Pixel without using code\u2014but some of them can get clunky. There is one, however, that isn&#8217;t exactly codeless but that Brett has found, in his years of experience, to be the easiest: through Google Tag Manager.<\/p>\n<p>With Google Tag Manager, you can install a container code on each of your website pages. Then insead of, having to add code to each of your pages every time you want to install a pixel, you can just connect it to GTM. <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/tagmanager\/answer\/6103696?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google&#8217;s page on GTM is here.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/how-to-optimize-facebook-ads-google-tag-manager.png\" alt=\"facebook ad optimization - google tag manager pixel setup\" width=\"720\" height=\"525\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64862 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/how-to-optimize-facebook-ads-google-tag-manager.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/how-to-optimize-facebook-ads-google-tag-manager-480x350.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can then do the same to set up the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/06\/facebook-conversions-api\">Facebook Conversions API<\/a>. Because of privacy measures, you&#8217;ll want to use both the Facebook Conversions API and Meta Pixel together get a more complete picture of your ads&#8217; performance.<\/p>\n<p>With visibility into what actions visitors are taking after viewing your ads, and who those visitors are, you can then make data-driven optimizations and retarget people who have been to your site.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Consolidate your conversions<\/h3>\n<p>Okay one more tip from Brett. Once your pixel is set up, you can then tell Facebook which conversion events you want to track. Looking back to our SEO ebook example, you could set up a separate conversion event for each ebook download, but if you do, this is what you&#8217;ll see when you&#8217;re at the campaign-level view:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/facebook-ad-campaign-view.png\" alt=\"facebook ad campaign level view\" width=\"720\" height=\"59\" class=\"size-full wp-image-68270 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/facebook-ad-campaign-view.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/facebook-ad-campaign-view-480x39.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll have to dig into each ad set\u2019s data to look at how many total conversions you\u2019re getting from the campaign.<\/p>\n<p>But if you create one ebook download conversion event, you can then get a total conversion count quickly from the campaign view. It\u2019s a small detail that can save you time and help you make decisions faster.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/20\/facebook-aggregated-event-measurement\">Aggregated Event Measurement<\/a>, you\u2019ll want to consolidate your conversions as much as possible. While you can create events that are not in your eight priority events list, these events will not be reported on if they\u2019re taken by iOS 14+ users who have opted out of Facebook tracking.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p><strong>\ud83e\udd14 Are you taking advantage of all that Facebook ads have to offer? \ud83e\udd14 <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Find opportunities to optimize your performance with the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/facebook-advertising?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FBGrader_FBGrader\">Free Facebook Ads Grader<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<p><a id=\"bidding\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>4. Choose the right bidding strategy<\/h3>\n<p>There are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/31\/facebook-ads-bidding-strategies\">five different bidding strategies in Facebook Ads<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Highest volume (formerly lowest cost)<\/li>\n<li>Highest value<\/li>\n<li>Cost per result (formerly cost cap)<\/li>\n<li>ROAS goal (formerly minimum ROAS)<\/li>\n<li>Bid cap<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you\u2019re running an ad with a lead generation focus and you have your funnel mapped out with costs and conversion rates, then cost per result bidding is a great choice. If you don\u2019t have clear idea on what an ideal cost per conversion will be, go with highest volume.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re an ecommerce business and you&#8217;re running ads for purchases with a fixed conversion value, cost per result, ROAS goal, or highest value would be best.<\/p>\n<p>Manual bidding is still an option, and gives you strategic control over the delivery of your ads, but it\u2019s less common and should only be used if you have a strong understanding of your costs and conversion rates. This knowledge comes with time and you may have to run your campaigns using automatic bidding first, to get a baseline.<\/p>\n<p>All that being said, PPC influencer and international speaker (and also WordStream alum!) Navah Hopkins advises that every business should set conversion values as much as possible. Even if you&#8217;re not ecommerce.\u00a0 She shows you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/10\/how-to-determine-conversion-value\">how to set conversion values for any business here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/facebook-ads-bidding-strategies.png\" alt=\"how to optimize facebook ads - bidding strategies in facebook\" width=\"514\" height=\"567\" class=\"wp-image-67650 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/facebook-ads-bidding-strategies.png 514w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/facebook-ads-bidding-strategies-480x529.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 514px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\n<a id=\"delivery\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>5. Optimize for your objective<\/h3>\n<p>Once you get to the ad set stage of your Facebook ad campaign creation, you&#8217;ll find an &#8220;Optimization for ad delivery&#8221; section. This is a little confusing, since you&#8217;ll see options like Conversions, Landing Page Views, Link Clicks, Impressions, and more. But didn&#8217;t you already establish the goal of your campaign when you chose your campaign objective? Yes.<\/p>\n<p>This setting just allows you to further fine-tune who Facebook delivers your ad to within your audience settings. As you can imagine, for the most part, it&#8217;s best to stick with the default option Facebook provides, which is usually the same as or similar to the campaign objective. Here are some tips on that front:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Awareness campaigns:<\/strong> Facebook defaults to reach, and this is good, since it will reach as many people as possible. Impressions, on the other hand, will serve the same ad to the same account to get the<\/li>\n<li><strong>Traffic campaigns:<\/strong> Facebook defaults to link clicks. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.leadguru.co.uk\/facebook-ads-optimization-for-ad-delivery-which-is-best\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ben Heath<\/a>, founder of Lead Guru,\u00a0 recommends changing to landing page views, since it&#8217;s easy for people to accidentally click on an ad in Facebook and Instagram. Landing page views will filter out those accidental clicks.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Engagement campaigns:<\/strong> Facebook defaults to ThruPlay (15 seconds) vs 2-second continuous video views. Stick with ThruPlay.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Leads and sales campaigns: <\/strong>\u00a0Go with the default (conversions).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/facebook-ad-optimization-delivery.png\" alt=\"facebook ads optimization for ad delivery\" width=\"600\" height=\"488\" class=\"size-full wp-image-67654 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/facebook-ad-optimization-delivery.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/facebook-ad-optimization-delivery-480x390.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>6.

Let the campaign run with this budget until it reaches 10,000 impressions, then bring the budget back down. This will speed up the learning phase and also give you data you can use to make your own optimizations.<br \/>\n<a id=\"interests\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>7.

But instead of targeting an interest identical to the product or service you\u2019re advertising, think outside the box a bit.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re advertising toys, for example, instead of targeting just \u201ctoys\u201d as an interest, you might target children\u2019s clothing. Or if you\u2019re advertising workout equipment, you might try people interested in electronic music or healthy recipes.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/how-to-optimize-facebook-ads-detailed-interest-targeting.png\" alt=\"how to optimize facebook ads - detailed targeting\" width=\"600\" height=\"355\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-64796\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/how-to-optimize-facebook-ads-detailed-interest-targeting.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/how-to-optimize-facebook-ads-detailed-interest-targeting-480x284.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\n<a id=\"influencer\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>8.

Even if you\u2019re targeting the right interests, you can\u2019t tell, until you\u2019ve chosen the interest, just how big that audience will be.
