But not just any video ad will do. In a sea of content, videos that include creative hooks are going to get far more views (and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/11\/12\/facebook-ad-benchmarks\">better results<\/a>). <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook_benchmarks_2019_CVR.png\" alt=\"average conversion rates on Facebook 2019\" width=\"706\" height=\"850\" \/><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If you\u2019re not familiar with \u201cthe hook\u201d concept or just want to refine your hook approach, we have some tips to help you achieve the best possible results for your hard-earned ad and production dollars\u2014and make your Facebook video ads unmissable.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">Why is your Facebook video ads hook so critically important?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">When you invest your time and budget in making a Facebook video ad, you\u2019re banking on the hope that your ad will bear fruit in the form of sales or conversions. Your goal from the get-go should be to make every second of that video count, but if you don\u2019t wow your viewers in the introduction, you can kiss your conversions goodbye. That\u2019s where your hook\u2014the first 10 seconds of your video ad\u2014comes in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Let me explain why the hook is so important to make your Facebook video ad unmissable.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Reason #1: Facebook users are always in a hurry<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Think about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/27\/facebook-ads-for-entrepreneurs\">how you use Facebook<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">\u2014are you slowly browsing and intently reading every post and watching every video that shows up in your feed? Of course not. Just like everyone else, you\u2019re probably just browsing\u2014using a rapid scroll style while searching for something that catches your eye\u2014and so are your customers.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-video-ad-viewing-habits.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook video ad viewing habits graphic\" width=\"649\" height=\"493\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">Image via Facebook<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">A recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/science\/2016\/03\/12\/humans-have-shorter-attention-span-than-goldfish-thanks-to-smart\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Canadian study<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> shows that the average Facebook user\u2019s person\u2019s attention span has shrunk down to just eight seconds! And Facebook\u2019s own research shows that when viewing Facebook ads, the attention span of users age <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/news\/how-people-are-watching-video-and-what-this-means-for-advertisers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">18 to 24 is a whopping 75% less than that of users<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> ages 65 and over.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Reason #2: Facebook ads play automatically<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Facebook ads are usually always set to auto play, so the title and thumbnail isn\u2019t the thing that is going to grab your audience\u2019s attention; it\u2019s the first few seconds of your video.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Reason #3: You can retarget short ad views<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">When using Facebook video ads to promote your product, service or company, the goal is always to get your viewer to stick around for the entire video. But you can also get measurable results from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.business2community.com\/facebook\/10-solid-ways-to-stop-the-scroll-for-your-facebook-video-ads-02088007\">people viewing your video from three seconds to 10 seconds<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">. These are both times trackable by Facebook ad manager. With these short views, you can then re-target these viewers with other ads in the following days or weeks to close the marketing loop.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to improve your Facebook video ads<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Now that you\u2019re starting to understand why the early moments of a video ad are so critical, it\u2019s time to think about some quick and creative ways you can capture your viewer\u2019s attention. Use these strategies to build a powerful intro and make the most of your video\u2019s first 10 seconds<strong><span lang=\"EN\">.<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">1. Use a blurred image for the intro<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">When Facebook videos load, they all have one thing in common\u2014a momentarily blurry screen. Piggyback on this fact by kicking off your video with an equally blurry image, just for a few seconds. This little trick is a slight deviation from the norm, so it\u2019s likely to stand out to scrollers. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-video-ad-blurred-intro-image.jpg\" alt=\"example of a blurred intro image for a Facebook video ad\" width=\"750\" height=\"501\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">2. Make your brand mark early<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Whether your aim is to drive traffic to your website or retail stores, get viewers to click-through to buy or join an email list, or another action, you\u2019ll win some cool points by planting the basics of your brand within the early moments of your messaging. Your brand should actually show up within the first three seconds! Facebook has found that consumers are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/news\/insights\/stand-out-in-feed-optimizing-video-creative-on-mobile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">23% more likely to remember a brand if it is featured in the first three seconds of the ad<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">. Show your audience what your brand stands for to help build trust and brand awareness, and improve the chances that they\u2019ll follow through on the call to action<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/VIh5ViMW-9Q?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In this bright and colorful ad, Harmony Proteins opens the video with their logo to make sure people remember the brand even if they don\u2019t finish the video.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">3. Get your message across with or without sound<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Roughly <a href=\"https:\/\/digiday.com\/media\/silent-world-facebook-video\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">85% of Facebook\u00a0video views happen with the sound turned off<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">, so a big part of the 10-second trick is being able to grab a viewer\u2019s attention without the luxury of voice-over or music. <a href=\"https:\/\/thesparkhouse.com\/7-steps-to-video-success-on-facebook-using-silent-videos\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Since most videos play automatically without sound<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">, forcing viewers to click to turn sound on, it\u2019s almost an afterthought. Also, Facebook users tend to scroll in public places where it can be hard to hear, or in environments like work or school where turning sound on isn\u2019t even an option. Combat the potential sound deficit with bold visuals, clear stories with obvious visuals, and the use of graphic text to convey any crucial messaging. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">4. Shoot for high production quality<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Think about how many opportunities Facebook users have to stay and watch during their scrolling time. Would you give your precious time to a video that looks like it\u2019s a budget saver? Viewers can tell the difference between low-quality video production and high-quality videos. If you cut corners, it\u2019ll show. When you make the extra effort to hire a production team known for polished, professional videos, you\u2019ll see rewards in terms of how your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/28\/facebook-video-marketing\">Facebook video marketing performs<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">. Not only does going with a high-quality production win <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/30\/facebook-video-views\">more viewers<\/a>, but it also helps establish your brand as one of style and quality\u2014and lets people know you value their time. Also, since <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/25\/facebook-video-ads\">most of the content on Facebook is user-generated<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">, a well-done, pro video ad will help you stand out from other videos in the feed. Just be careful not to make it look <em>too <\/em>polished (more on this below).<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/RTyFhErtr5k?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In this ad, UAG uses a super slow-motion camera to really up the production value and grab the attention of the viewers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">5. Present your offer early<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If you\u2019ve got a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\">value proposition<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> you\u2019d like to extend to your viewers, why \u201cbury the lead,\u201d as they say? It\u2019s that something special that gives your ad an edge, so put it out there as early as you possibly can. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/22\/facebook-sales-funnel\">Let the offer be the thing that hooks them<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">, then spend the rest of your video telling them why and how they\u2019ll benefit from doing what they\u2019re tempted to do\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/21\/facebook-offer-ads\">take you up on your offer<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">! And, if you\u2019re wondering what kind of offer viewers will respond to best, do a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/29\/facebook-ad-targeting-strategies\">few versions of the video<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> with different promotions to test the impact of each. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">6. Be bold with graphics<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Don\u2019t be modest; tell your viewers what you\u2019re offering and why you\u2019re the best company\/product\/brand for the job with captivating graphics that communicates your messaging clearly to your audience. Great graphics that are eye-catching not only help hook your viewer in the first 10 seconds, but also ensure that everyone understands your story with or without sound. Graphic text can be used in the intro to tease a later payoff, drop your value proposition right away or reinforce already strong visuals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Take this example.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/K62MrW4Y9Y4?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In this video, Nekter uses bold graphics and imagery to keep the viewer engaged and entertained through the entire ad.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">7. Add in visual effects<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">What might make the average Facebook user stop and stay on your video? It\u2019s often something that\u2019s so graphically different that it jumps off the screen. Visual effects can be the differentiator that you need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.singlegrain.com\/video-marketing\/how-to-create-a-facebook-video-ad-that-gets-attention\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">command attention within the first few seconds of your Facebook video ad<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">. While off-the-wall effects may not fit within the brand image of, say, a high-end law firm, it could be just what the doctor ordered if you\u2019re a film school trying to recruit on the basis of innovation. Recent trends include shaking images, bouncing visuals and sliding transitions, but, again, the point is to stand out from what\u2019s popular. Defer to your production team to help find the right fit for visual effects. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/rG4klFf2cqk?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">XFX uses the power of visual effects to bring the viewer into the experience of a 3D glasses.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">8. Animate!<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Facebook viewers of all ages <a href=\"https:\/\/businesscollective.com\/top-tricks-for-creating-a-killer-animated-explainer-video\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">love a good animation because they\u2019re easy to understand and fun to watch<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">. Whether you decide to animate the intro only or the whole ad, animations can be an enjoyable way to package your messaging. Even if the viewer isn\u2019t necessarily a big fan of animation, the illustrated style is definitely a deviation from the influx of static photos and similar videos on Facebook. You may be a step ahead, just by choosing to go animated. It\u2019s also a terrific way to present complex or unsexy stats, product details, and other information in a more vibrant way. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In this example below, Zivelo uses the power of animation to explain BIG ideas in a short amount of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/KAVPX7tlwn0?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">9. Look and feel native<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">While your Facebook ad should encapsulate a high production quality, you don\u2019t want it to be so professional that it comes off as inauthentic. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/07\/facebook-statistics\">If it looks too much like an ad, you risk losing trust<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">. Some of the styles that companies are using today to stay relatable to their target Facebook audience include shooting the spokesperson or actors with selfie angles, going with a vlog feel and realistic environments and backgrounds (as opposed to fake studio sets or green screens). In some cases, you\u2019ll connect with audiences more by mimicking the look and feel of native content. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">A good example is this ad below, run in the summer for Stella Artois and\u00a0featuring Idris Elba. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/PZ3yQOiJx_0?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Though the production had a big brand backing it, along with a big movie star, the ad doesn\u2019t feel over produced. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">10. Get to the point<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Are you debuting a brand new product, dangling a limited time offer or explaining how your new product works? Rather than a slow build, use the \u201cshort and sweet\u201d principle and get to the point quickly. Remember, your viewers have places to be! Make your point within the 10-second window. If you want to expand a little later with testimonials, product details or instructions, go ahead, just make sure it\u2019s clear why you\u2019re making the video a few moments in. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Take a look at this video. Liquipel jumps right into it by showing the actor in the video drenched in water. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-vimeo video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/68577186?autoplay=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The ad is to talk about the waterproof technology, and it doesn\u2019t wait to tell you\u2014rather it jumps right in and shows you. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">11. Borrow the news model<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Facebook is much more than a social medium; in fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/sproutsocial.com\/insights\/facebook-stats-for-marketers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">43% of users<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> go here to get their news. Depending on your brand image and the messaging of your video ad, you may want to try a news style to help attract viewers and increase your chances of getting organic shares. Recreating the serious tone of news broadcasts with a third-person narration may make certain types of viewers sit up and take notice. You can also use graphic text to highlight the important points of your message, similar to what you might see on the news.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/F52jdfW8nfU?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">A great<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/13\/video-ad-tools\"> video content creation tool<\/a> is <a href=\"https:\/\/lumen5.com\/\">lumen5<\/a><u><span lang=\"EN\">,<\/span><\/u><span lang=\"EN\"> which many news organizations use for quick reporting on social media.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">Now, go and hook those Facebook ad views!<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Here\u2019s a recap of the 11 ways to improve your Facebook video ad with a killer hook:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Use a blurred image for the intro<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Make your brand mark early<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Get your message across with or without sound<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Shoot for high production quality<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Present your offer early<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Be bold with graphics<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Add in visual effects<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Animate!<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Look and feel native<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Get to the point<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Borrow the news model<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Now that you know a few things about developing a strong and creative 10-second hook, you\u2019re ready to make a video.
