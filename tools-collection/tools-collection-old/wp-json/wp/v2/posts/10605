[Core Web Vitals] measure dimensions of web usability such as load time, interactivity, and the stability of content as it loads (so you don\u2019t accidentally tap that button when it shifts under your finger\u2014how annoying!).&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>To the layperson, you can think of<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/19\/improve-core-web-vitals\"> Core Web Vitals<\/a> as indicators Google uses to evaluate the UX (user experience) of a page.

So that \u201cno immediate need to take action\u201d clause still stands. Barring something unforeseen, we are looking at Spring 2021 as the earliest date this update could be rolled out to the general public.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Barring something unforeseen, we are looking at Spring 2021 as the earliest date this update could be rolled out to the general public.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>That said: if you\u2019re looking in your Core Web Vitals report right now and seeing more than a few \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cneeds improvement\u201d URLs, you have some work to do. Optimizing page experience while retaining content value is not always easy. Because while <em>rich <\/em>content and <em>useful <\/em>content aren\u2019t exactly synonymous, you have a better chance of engaging a user if your content is <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/04\/interactive-content\">immersive<\/a> and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/15\/quality-content-defined\">contextually deep<\/a>.
