It encompasses a number of factors, including the time it takes for the browser to receive the first byte of information from the server (i.e. Time To First Byte), the time needed to render and display content, and the overall responsiveness of a website or web page to various interactions by the user.<\/p>\n<p>Web speed is critical for user experience (UX) and can significantly impact user satisfaction, engagement, and conversion rates. Studies have shown that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.portent.com\/blog\/analytics\/research-site-speed-hurting-everyones-revenue.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sites that load in 1 second<\/a> have conversion rates <em>3 times higher<\/em> than sites that load in 5 seconds.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/page-load-speed-vs-conversion-rate.webp\" alt=\"chart showing correlation between page speed and conversions\" width=\"866\" height=\"440\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85353\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/page-load-speed-vs-conversion-rate.webp 866w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/page-load-speed-vs-conversion-rate-480x244.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 866px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s a crazy delta for a little bit of site optimization.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc40 <strong>Looking for more ways to drive people to your (newly fast) site?<\/strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download\">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"why-is-website-speed-important\"><\/div>\n<h2>Why is website speed important?<\/h2>\n<p>From a tech perspective, website speed is influenced by multiple factors, including server performance, network latency, code efficiency, and file size optimization. That may seem like a headache, but as discussed above: the benefits can be huge. Here are just a few of the reasons that website speed is critical:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>User experience<\/strong>. Faster loading times lead to better user experiences, reducing bounce rates and increasing engagement. Per Google, as page load time goes from one second to ten seconds, the probability of a mobile <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adlift.com\/blog\/impact-of-google-web-page-speed-on-user-experience\/s\/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20study%20by,one%20to%20ten%2Dsecond%20range.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">site visitor bouncing <strong>increases by 123%<\/strong><\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Conversion rates.<\/strong> We cited one conversion rate stat above, and here\u2019s another: Walmart reported a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cloudways.com\/blog\/impact-of-website-speed\/#:~:text=Case%20Study%201%3A%20Walmart,their%20conversions%20increased%20by%202%25.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2% increase in conversions<\/a> for every 1 second improvement in page load time.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Better rankings.<\/strong> As discussed above, site speed <em>is a ranking factor for search engines like Google<\/em>, and studies by site like Backlinko have proven this out.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Increased revenue.<\/strong> It stands to reason, but we should spell it out here anyway: improved site speed directly impacts revenue. Amazon, for instance, reported a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.conductor.com\/academy\/page-speed-resources\/faq\/amazon-page-speed-study\/#:~:text=Back%20in%202006%2C%20Amazon%20found,a%20fast%20site%20is%20important.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>1% increase in revenue<\/em><\/a> for every 100 milliseconds improvement in page load time.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>\ud83d\ude80 <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/first-page-of-google?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_10WaysFirstPageGoogle_Download\">10 Tangible &amp; Free Ways to Get on the First Page of Google<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-increase-website-speed\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to increase website speed<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve talked about the what and the why, now let\u2019s discuss the <em>how <\/em>of site speed optimization. Here are my top six strategies for increasing speed on your site.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Compress and convert (i.e. \u201coptimize\u201d) your images<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019ve had any exposure to the site speed optimization game, you probably know that this is the easiest, and often the most productive, step you can take to reduce latency and increase <a href=\"https:\/\/pagespeed.web.dev\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PageSpeed Insights<\/a> scores. Let\u2019s take a look at one such report, from a brand I like called Den that sells beautiful but egregiously overpriced cabin plans.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/pagespeed-insights-for-den.webp\" alt=\"pagespeed insights for den\" width=\"881\" height=\"524\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85354\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/pagespeed-insights-for-den.webp 881w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/pagespeed-insights-for-den-480x285.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 881px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>First of all, I should mention: if you\u2019re trying to increase site speed, PageSpeed Insights and <a href=\"https:\/\/gtmetrix.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GTmetrix<\/a> are hands down the best diagnostic tools you can use to do so. They\u2019re free, fast (usually), and they provide easy-to-follow lists of action items (and approximate bandwidth savings) that you can knock out to reduce page load time. These two tools are your best friend in this quest.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing you\u2019ll notice in this report is that Den\u2019s homepage passes the Core Web Vitals assessment (if you want to learn more about Core Web Vitals, read our post <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/19\/core-web-vitals-google-page-experience-update\">here<\/a>.) Each of the Core Web Vital metrics, except for Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), relates to page speed, and as such, we need to pay attention to them. And insofar as Core Web Vitals are a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/09\/google-ranking-factors\">ranking factor<\/a>, and help determine how high in the search results Google ranks your website, they are super important. But you should view them more as benchmarks that you can use to measure performance as you optimize for speed. That is to say: don\u2019t freak out if you\u2019re not passing, and there is nothing in these numbers themselves that you can actually use to improve your site speed.<\/p>\n<p>Where the report gets juicy is when you scroll down to the performance section.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/pagespeed-insights-performance-report.webp\" alt=\"pagespeed insights performance report\" width=\"879\" height=\"517\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85355\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/pagespeed-insights-performance-report.webp 879w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/pagespeed-insights-performance-report-480x282.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 879px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here you\u2019re going to get a snapshot, on a scale of 1-100, of how fast your page is. As you can see, Den\u2019s homepage has strong scores for Best Practices, SEO, and Accessibility, but is lacking a bit on the Performance front, with a score of 66 out of 100. Not bad for a fairly dynamic and image-intensive page, but with definite room for improvement. This performance score is what you need to pay attention to, as it takes into account all speed-related factors that <em>Google<\/em> takes into account when determining speed (and consequently, ranking your site).<\/p>\n<p>Scroll down a bit more, and we can start digging into the various factors that are causing Den\u2019s suboptimal website performance.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/pagespeed-website-performance-factors.webp\" alt=\"pagespeed website performance factors\" width=\"890\" height=\"597\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85356\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/pagespeed-website-performance-factors.webp 890w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/pagespeed-website-performance-factors-480x322.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 890px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As you can see, items related to images occupy the number two and three spots on Google\u2019s list of most actionable inputs. In my fairly extensive experience, that is where you should expect to be when you run this report on your website. For the purposes of this section, we\u2019re going to focus on \u201cproperly size images\u201d (we\u2019ll get to \u201cdefer offscreen images\u201d in the next section). Let\u2019s pull down the tab and see what Google tells us.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/pagespeed-insights-image-sizes.webp\" alt=\"pagespeed insights image sizes\" width=\"894\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85357\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/pagespeed-insights-image-sizes.webp 894w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/pagespeed-insights-image-sizes-480x322.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 894px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For reference, anything above 500 KiB (kilobytes) is pretty damn big. And really, in today\u2019s age of next gen image formats, you should really never be above 250 KiB. So there\u2019s a lot for Den to to work on here, with some potentially big savings available.<\/p>\n<p>How would one optimize these images? There are a few ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Run the image through a free compression tool, like TinyPNG or <a href=\"https:\/\/compressor.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">compressor.io<\/a>, then re-upload the image to your web page or CMS.<\/li>\n<li>Convert the image to a next-gen image format (specifically, WebP) using a free tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/cloudconvert.com\/png-to-webp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cloudconvert.com<\/a>. WebP is inherently served in the most compressed version, so if your CMS can accept it, I would highly recommend using this method.<\/li>\n<li>Use your CMS to either bulk compress your PNGs and JPGs, or bulk convert your images to WebP. Webflow, for instance, has an out-of-the-box feature that allows for this conversion in bulk. If you\u2019re using WordPress, you can download any number of extensions that allow you to accomplish the same.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Image compression is really the lowest-hanging fruit in site speed optimization. Leverage the above methods, and you\u2019ll see your speed scores climb quickly.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Lazy load your images<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/08\/lazy-loading-seo\">Lazy loading<\/a> is number two on this list because, once again, I often find it at or near the top of Google\u2019s reports. Remember that \u201cDefer offscreen images\u201d recommendation from above? Anytime you see that, know that Google is referring to <em>lazy loading<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Lazy loading, as I discuss in this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/08\/lazy-loading-seo\">excellent post on the topic<\/a>, is defined as the following:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cLazy loading, in a nutshell, allows you to defer slow-loading page elements until after your page has rendered. It\u2019s a way of making sure a user \u201cgets\u201d to your site (and doesn\u2019t bounce) before doing the heavy work of loading some of the bigger, non-critical, below-the-fold elements on your web page.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>So let\u2019s revisit that PageSpeed Insights report and see what it says under the \u201cDefer offscreen images\u201d tab:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/pagespeed-defer-offscreen-images.webp\" alt=\"pagespeed insights report - defer offscreen images\" width=\"890\" height=\"575\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85358\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/pagespeed-defer-offscreen-images.webp 890w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/pagespeed-defer-offscreen-images-480x310.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 890px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Would you look at that: it\u2019s all the same culprits that we found in the prior section! This is actually great news. Because depending on what kind of CMS you\u2019re using, be it Shopify, WordPress, Bigcommerce, or Webflow, you\u2019ll often be able to knock out image compression and lazy loading in one fell swoop. WordPress, for instance, has a great extension called Smush that implements lazy loading and bulk compression for you.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/smush-report.webp\" alt=\"smush report\" width=\"884\" height=\"561\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85359\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/smush-report.webp 884w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/smush-report-480x305.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 884px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.shopify.com\/partners\/blog\/lazy-loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shopify<\/a>, on the other hand, will require some very specific (but very doable) CSS tricks that you can pass on to your developer. <a href=\"https:\/\/sqskits.com\/plugins\/lazy-loading-images-for-squarespace\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Squarespace<\/a> has its own plugin that you can work with. And <a href=\"https:\/\/webflow.com\/feature\/new-images-set-to-lazy-load-by-default\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Webflow<\/a>, bless its heart, sets all of its images to lazy load by default. Whatever backend you\u2019re working with, simply research the implementation they recommend and attack from there.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Optimize for mobile first!<\/h3>\n<p>Now that you\u2019ve seen the power of Google\u2019s PageSpeed Insights in action, and before we move onto the next section, I\u2019d be remiss to mention: <strong>do not sleep on the Mobile tab of this report<\/strong>!<\/p>\n<p>Depending on your business model and the nature of your site, you may (and may likely, in some cases) be getting more mobile traffic than desktop traffic. Take a quick peak into Google Analytics to find the exact percentage. Even sites with strong desktop scores often score poorly on mobile, because mobile has its own specific set of requirements you need to fulfill for optimal speed. And we can use Den\u2019s scores as a case in point here.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/pagespeed-mobile-report.webp\" alt=\"pagespeed mobile report\" width=\"852\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85360\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/pagespeed-mobile-report.webp 852w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/pagespeed-mobile-report-480x337.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 852px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>33 looks pretty brutal on its face, and I\u2019m sorry to say that if you\u2019ve never worked on mobile speed, you\u2019re likely to see something similar. Most site owners neglect this area, and consequently see scores in the 30s and 40s. But guess what? That probably means your competitors haven\u2019t dug into this area either. You can and should use this report as an opportunity to forge and spring ahead.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc95 <strong>Want more tips and ideas?<\/strong> We&#8217;ve got 130+ for you!

Reduce unused JavaScript<\/h3>\n<p>Number three on our list is, you guessed it, another recommendation that Google often lists at or near the top of its PageSpeed Insights reports. Because if we\u2019re going to do the work, why not go after the most profitable outcomes, right? In this case, we\u2019re talking about reducing unused JavaScript.<\/p>\n<p>A quick note: you\u2019ll often see code <em>compression <\/em>(as opposed to reduction) also listed in this report, but in my experience, the potential savings are generally far lower. Den, for instance, can save a mere 4 KiB of data from compression, compared to reduction, which can save them 332 KiB.<\/p>\n<p>In my experience, the biggest offenders here are nearly always third-party scripts. Scripts from Google Tag Manager, various ad platforms, Google Analytics, and the like, can really hinder speed (when they are not needed). Let\u2019s check out the report.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/pagespeed-javascript-savings.webp\" alt=\"pagespeed insights report javascript\" width=\"856\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85361\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/pagespeed-javascript-savings.webp 856w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/pagespeed-javascript-savings-480x336.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 856px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For their part, you can see that most of Den\u2019s issues are coming from the variety of snippets they are firing through Google Tag Manager. Now, the idea is not to remove all of these. It\u2019s simply to go through and see what you really need and what you don\u2019t. For instance: are you firing a Facebook pixel on a landing page you specifically set up for a Google Ads campaign? Are you firing a HotJar pixel on your product page, despite not including it in the split test you\u2019re running? Are you firing an instance of Google Analytics from Google Tag Manager when you already have it hard-coded into the header of your site?<\/p>\n<p>For their part, Google has some <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.chrome.com\/docs\/lighthouse\/performance\/unused-javascript\/?utm_source=lighthouse&amp;utm_medium=lr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">useful documentation<\/a> on how to reduce JavaScript in a given situation, depending on the CMS. Again, the idea is not to remove everything, just the stuff you\u2019re not using.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind: saving 332 KiB of bandwidth is great, but it\u2019s possible that you just accomplished that by compressing a single image. That is not to dissuade you from tackling this step, but simply to hammer home that you should be spending your time on the items in the report that are going to yield you the greatest savings.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Leverage a Content Delivery Network (CDN)<\/h3>\n<p>A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of distributed servers placed in data centers across various geos. Its primary purpose is to deliver content and other assets (think: images, videos, scripts, stylesheets, etc.) to users <strong>more efficiently and reliably.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>CDNs work by<strong> caching content in edge servers located closer to end-users<\/strong>. This reduces the physical distance data needs to travel, which thereby decreases latency and improves speed. Here\u2019s a quick visual of what that looks like in practice:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/content-delivery-network.webp\" alt=\"how content delivery network works\" width=\"843\" height=\"378\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85362\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/content-delivery-network.webp 843w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/content-delivery-network-480x215.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 843px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Implementing a CDN provides several benefits that contribute to improving site speed. Here are the top 3:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Reduced latency.<\/strong> By delivering content from servers closer to the user&#8217;s location, CDNs minimize the time it takes for data to travel, significantly reducing latency and improving page load times.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Load balancing.<\/strong> CDNs distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers, preventing any single server from becoming overwhelmed and ensuring consistent performance even during periods of high traffic.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Caching static content.<\/strong> CDNs cache static content like images, CSS files, and scripts, storing them on edge servers for faster retrieval. This reduces the load on the origin server and speeds up content delivery.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>To set up a CDN, all you have to do is choose a reputable provider, configure the settings to specify which content to cache and how it should be delivered, and integrate it with your site.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Enable browser caching<\/h3>\n<p>Browser caching is the process of <strong>storing resources locally<\/strong> on a user&#8217;s device the first time they visit a website. These resources are then <strong>reused for subsequent visits<\/strong>, rather than being downloaded from the server again. Caching is a huge lever for increasing site speed, and it can provide the very pleasant double whammy of reducing hosting costs.<\/p>\n<p>To set up browser caching, the first thing you need to do is configure your server to include cache-control headers in HTTP responses. These headers specify how long a browser should cache resources before checking for updates. Here&#8217;s a basic approach:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Edit server configuration.<\/strong> Access your server&#8217;s configuration file (such as .htaccess for Apache servers or nginx.conf for Nginx servers).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Add cache-control headers. <\/strong>Include directives like &#8220;Cache-Control&#8221; or &#8220;Expires&#8221; to specify the caching duration for different types of resources. For example, you can set a longer expiration time (i.e., one year) for static resources like images, CSS, and JavaScript files, and a shorter expiration time for dynamic content like HTML pages.<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/cache-control-headers.webp\" alt=\"cache control headers\" width=\"871\" height=\"438\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85363\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/cache-control-headers.webp 871w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/cache-control-headers-480x241.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 871px, 100vw\" \/><\/li>\n<li><strong>Check your status.<\/strong> After making changes, pop your website back into PageSpeed Insights to see how much of an improvement was made!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>By implementing browser caching effectively, you can enhance your site&#8217;s performance, reduce server load, and provide a faster and smoother browsing experience for your visitors.<\/p>\n<h2>Increase your website speed, increase your revenue<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s really that simple. Speed was important before Google ever made it a ranking signal because of its impact on the user experience. But now that Google is actively using signals like Core Web Vitals to determine where your site should rank in comparison to your competitors, it\u2019s no longer something business owners and marketers can ignore. <em>Especially<\/em> in today\u2019s age of mobile proliferation and instant gratification, where consumers want the information they want, where they want it, right now.<\/p>\n<p>So the next time you dive into a PageSpeed Insights report, think not about how mundane or overly technical it all seems; think about how much money you\u2019re going to make by taking these three simple steps.
