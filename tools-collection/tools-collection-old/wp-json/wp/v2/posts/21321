More than I hate going to the hospital or eating my vegetables, the dentist is my least favorite appointment. And, due to the fact I move around a lot, I\u2019m constantly looking for a new dentist to trust my teeth with.<\/p>\n<p>Talking to friends who also struggled with finding a dentist, I heard all kinds of horror stories\u2014anything from getting fake cavities filled to being overcharged for a service they didn\u2019t receive. What we could all agree on: finding a good dentist is hard.<\/p>\n<p>You might find that bringing in good clients, and lots of them, is hard too! Here are some smart marketing ideas to make it easier for your potential customers to find your practice.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Local Awareness Facebook Ads<\/h2>\n<p>While you want to get the word out about your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/industries\/healthcare\/\">dental practice<\/a>, being specific about who you market to is important. Most likely, you don\u2019t want to be showing ads for your practice outside of a 50-mile radius\u2014if you are in Pennsylvania and someone in California is seeing your ad, that doesn\u2019t do anyone any good.<\/p>\n<p>Local Awareness ads are a great way to reach a local audience, and you can now use the new map card to share locally relevant details about your dental business, like the address, distance to the business, hours of operation, and a \u201cGet directions\u201d link. Your CTA can even be a call button, an easy prompt to make an appointment.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/dental-marketing-local-awareness.png\" alt=\"Local Awareness for Dental Practices\" width=\"668\" height=\"305\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>2. Click to Call Ads<\/h2>\n<p>The main goal for <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/dental-marketing-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dental marketing<\/a> or advertising is that patients and prospects book an appointment\u2014which is usually done by picking up the phone and calling the office. Click-to-call ads are available through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/31\/facebook-ads-for-dentists\">Facebook<\/a> and Google Ads (formerly known as Google AdWords)\u00a0on mobile, desktop, and tablet. This extension can be added to existing ads, or you can create call-only campaigns.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-dental-practices-click-to-call.png\" alt=\"Click-to-Call Ads\" width=\"260\" height=\"223\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>3. Mobile Call-Only Ads<\/h2>\n<p>According to Google, most healthcare-related searches are performed on a smartphone. And one in twenty Google searches is for health-related information. Don\u2019t miss out. You can create ads exclusively for mobile with <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/20\/google-call-only-campaigns\">call-only campaigns<\/a> through Google Ads.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/dental-marketing-on-mobile.png\" alt=\"Dental Marketing on Mobile\" width=\"607\" height=\"202\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>4. Facebook Demographic Targeting<\/h2>\n<p>Facebook has an insane amount of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/27\/facebook-ad-targeting-options-infographic\">demographic targeting available<\/a>, and you can be using this to your advantage. Other than the obvious, you can also target potential customers by language, relationship status, employment, income, and interests. Research has shown that women make <a href=\"http:\/\/www.patientnews.com\/understanding-who-you-are-selling\">90% of all dental buying decisions<\/a>. Make sure you\u2019re getting in front of the crowd by targeting ads to women who recently bought children\u2019s clothes and live in your area.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Appointment Reminders<\/h2>\n<p>Whether it comes in the form of a postcard or a phone call, appointment reminders are important to make sure your patients show up. Streamline this process by using Google calendar alerts, and sending appointment confirmations and reminder by email.<\/p>\n<p>You can also easily use these methods to remind your patients to make an appointment, i.e. for an annual cleaning.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/appointment-reminder-dental-marketing.png\" alt=\"Appointment Reminders for Dental Practices\" width=\"630\" height=\"477\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>6. Google Ads\u00a0Income Targeting<\/h2>\n<p>Yes, everyone should floss regularly and go to the dentist for annual cleanings. In truth, most people don\u2019t. In Google Ads,\u00a0you can target different demographics based on income level.<\/p>\n<p>Navigate over to the settings tab and select \u201cAdvanced Location.\u201d It will bring up this menu:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/income-targeting-dental-marketing.png\" alt=\"Income Targeting on AdWords\" width=\"507\" height=\"93\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Select the \u201cLocation groups\u201d tab and you\u2019ll notice a list of three options. The one you want is called \u201cDemographics.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/income-targeting-dental-marketing-2.png\" alt=\"Income Targeting on AdWords\" width=\"508\" height=\"191\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Now, choose the household income tier (or tiers) you\u2019re interested in and click the big red \u201cadd\u201d button!<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/income-targeting-dental-marketing-3.png\" alt=\"Income Targeting on AdWords\" width=\"270\" height=\"193\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This can be used to target higher income levels with ads for teeth whitening or veneers; lower income levels may be more interested in maintaining basic health.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Remarketing Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Remarketing is frequently described as \u201ceasy money.\u201d It helps you reach people who have visited your website (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/29\/dentist-websites\">some pretty awesome dentist websites here<\/a>) or practice, by serving specific ads focused on re-capturing those potential customers.\u00a0 At your dental practice, if you collect email addresses, you can leverage these through <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/11\/02\/adwords-customer-match-setup\">Customer Match<\/a> on Google Ads\u00a0and Facebook! Just upload the email addresses to create a remarketing audience and create an ad that would entice patients to visit your practice again\u2014maybe a reminder for a cleaning, or whitening.<\/p>\n<h2>8. Facebook Messaging Ad Type<\/h2>\n<p>Facebook announced an <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.facebook.com\/blog\/post\/2016\/09\/12\/new-messenger-features-payments-ads-enhanced-mobile-websites\/\">ad feature<\/a> that utilizes Messenger to communicate with businesses. Advertisers will be able to use \u201cSend Message\u201d as a CTA on their ads, which would then take the prospect to Messenger. This is only in beta now, but should be rolling out fully soon!<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-messenger-dental-marketing.gif\" alt=\"New Facebook Messaging Ads\" width=\"400\" height=\"817\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>9. Google Maps Ads<\/h2>\n<p>An advertisement on Google maps could literally lead a potential patient right to your dental practice. When \u201cdentist\u201d is entered into the search bar, results are shown on the map and on the search results list. On mobile, these ads also include directions and call CTAs.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-maps-marketing-dentists.png\" alt=\"Google Maps Ads\" width=\"800\" height=\"266\" \/><\/div>\n<div>Speaking of Google Maps&#8230;find out how your Google Business Profile and other <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/listings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">directory listings<\/a> look with our <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/free-business-listings-grader\/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free business listings grader<\/a>.<\/div>\n<h2>10. Waze Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Like Google Maps, you can also directly advertise on <a href=\"https:\/\/biz.waze.com\/\">Waze<\/a>. Because Waze is a community-based application, advertisements are a little different\u2014customers near your business will see a \u201cdigital billboard\u201d appear on the map, as well as in the search results. They can either navigate to your dental practice or save the location for later.<\/p>\n<h2>11. Emergency Keywords<\/h2>\n<p>Two months ago, I found myself googling \u201cemergency wisdom tooth extraction boston\u201d at 2AM. The first two results didn\u2019t provide a \u201ccall\u201d CTA, so I chose the third and two more from the Google maps results with the highest ratings. None of them picked up (which was expected), but I made an appointment with the first practice that called me back.<\/p>\n<p>Bidding on keywords like \u201cemergency\u201d or \u201curgent\u201d is an easy way to get clients with immediate needs and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/30\/commercial-intent-keywords\">high intent<\/a>; imagine the return on investment for those keywords! But make sure that your practice can take emergency cases and provides an easy way to contact the practice, or else you may get a bad review on Google\u2026<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-for-dentists-emergency.png\" alt=\"Emergency keywords for Dentists\" width=\"836\" height=\"599\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>12. ZocDoc<\/h2>\n<p>If there is something <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/09\/28\/generational-marketing-tactics\">millennials<\/a> hate as much as having to pay for wifi, it\u2019s talking to medical professionals on the phone. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zocdoc.com\/about\/\">ZocDoc<\/a> is a mobile app that helps patients find doctors based on specialty, insurance, location, and availability; it\u2019s almost like booking a doctor\u2019s appointment on Open Table. It is now in most major cities\u2014and some smaller ones too!<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/zocdoc-dental-marketing.png\" alt=\"ZocDoc Enrollment\" width=\"439\" height=\"593\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>13. Yelp<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.smilemarketing.com\/10-dental-marketing-ideas\/\">According to a study done in 2014<\/a>, 88% of consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations. I cannot stress the importance of Yelp enough\u2014claim your business! Likely, people are already writing reviews of your practice, which should be fielded and checked for accuracy. Yelp is the first place millennials go looking for a good dentist, make sure you\u2019re getting in front of potential patients.<\/p>\n<h2>14. Instagram<\/h2>\n<p>Ever heard of Dr. Pimple Popper? Though not for the faint of heart, this dermatologist popularized popping zits on Instagram. Celebrities advertise teeth whitening products on their Instagram\u2019s, and orthodontists show off nice before-and-after pictures.<\/p>\n<p>Instagram has become a place to shop as well\u2014create an Instagram for your practice to show-off your unique techniques, and advertise to potential patients through social media. If you regularly update, it is sure to keep your practice top-of-mind for your followers.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-marketing-dental.png\" alt=\"Instagram for Dentists\" width=\"917\" height=\"520\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>15. Email Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>Imagine a world in which your patients could email the practice when they wanted to make an appointment. Your receptionist could respond with a few timing options, and ta-da, an appointment is made and on the calendar. Even better, you can send bills this way, reminder emails, and cute \u201cwe haven\u2019t seen you in a while!\u201d emails.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/dental-marketing-email.png\" alt=\"Dental Marketing on Email\" width=\"595\" height=\"498\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>16. Referral Bonuses<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dentistryiq.com\/articles\/2013\/03\/9-marketing-tips-from-dental-practice-management-experts.html\">The Pride Institute<\/a> reports that 93% of people trust recommendations from their friends. Encourage those recommendations! Referral bonuses can be used to retain current customers and expand your practice. Express your gratitude and give $10 off a dental visit for every referral that makes an appointment! To make it easy, give out business referral cards when patients check-out and tuck them into any mail you send.<\/p>\n<h2>17. Video Advertising<\/h2>\n<p>As <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/21\/video-marketing-strategy\">Margot recently reported<\/a>, the healthcare industry is increasingly using video marketing. Don\u2019t miss the boat! Video with real people from your practice can help develop a personal connection with your prospects, which can lead to trust, recommendations, and more appointments.<\/p>\n<h2>18. Direct Mail<\/h2>\n<p>The days of stuffing mailboxes with postcard advertisements are not over. Direct mail still works, especially for baby boomers, and it is a good opportunity to show off your specialty or competitive price points. <a href=\"http:\/\/fitsmallbusiness.com\/dental-marketing-ideas\/\">One practice found<\/a> that out of every 5,000 postcards sent, they received an average of 35 phone calls and 7 new patients. That\u2019s a great return on investment!<\/p>\n<h2>19. Local Events<\/h2>\n<p>As a kid, I played in recreational sports leagues where each team was sponsored by a local business, which paid for our team shirts emblazoned with the business\u2019s logo. Not only does this get your business out in front of parents with little kids, you could also throw in free toothbrushes and a small postcard with information on kid\u2019s dental health. <a href=\"http:\/\/fitsmallbusiness.com\/dental-marketing-ideas\/\">A practice that did this with kindergarteners<\/a> reported that 70% of parents switched to the practice after receiving this info.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a dentist, bringing in good clients, and lots of them, is hard!
