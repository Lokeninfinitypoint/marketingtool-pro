The only rule is that they had to be shows from approachable, ground-level marketers (no big names).<\/p>\n<p>To make it even easier to pick your next pod, I asked the hosts for a little background on their shows, the big takeaway they\u2019ve learned from producing them, and which episode stands out as a must-listen.

SEO office hours<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodsignals.com\/seo-office-hours\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO Office Hours<\/a> is a weekly, one-hour podcast that brings together some of the smartest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/seo\">search engine optimization<\/a> pros in the business. But what\u2019s really cool is that it\u2019s a Q&amp;A format recorded live from Zoom, complete with an audience full of the questions we all have about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/06\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google\">getting found through search<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-office-hours.webp\" alt=\"Best marketing podcasts - SEO office hours.\" width=\"937\" height=\"459\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93769 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-office-hours.webp 937w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-office-hours-480x235.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodsignals.com\/seo-office-hours\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>If a live Q&amp;A chat about SEO reminds you of John Mueller\u2019s old Webmaster Hangouts, that\u2019s intentional. \u201cWhen John stopped, I didn\u2019t want that resource to disappear,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/michaelchidzey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Michael Chidzey<\/a>, co-host of SEO Office Hours and CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodsignals.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Good Signals<\/a>. \u201cI reached out and asked if he\u2019d be okay with me giving it a go, and he\u2019s been incredibly supportive ever since.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Michael tuned into Mueller\u2019s sessions religiously. \u201cThey weren\u2019t just Q&amp;A sessions. They were a lifeline for anyone struggling with a traffic drop, wanting to sound out a new idea, or discussing some sort of change or update.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>With Mueller\u2019s blessing, he worked to create a similarly supportive atmosphere, but with a collaborative mindset. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m not John Mueller from Google, so I built the show in my own way,\u201d Michael told me. \u201cI invited special guests to bring their perspectives. The first was a good friend of mine, Jo Juliana Turnbull. She was so good that I asked her to come back as a regular host. From there, we evolved into a panel format with me, Jo, and two rotating guests.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For Michael\u2019s co-host, Jo, it\u2019s the lack of barriers that makes the show special. \u201cWe welcome first-time speakers, we answer all<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/2025-local-seo-trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> SEO questions<\/a>, there is no such thing as a silly question,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople feel welcome, and we have a regular group of attendees from all over the world.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The live format plays a big role in the podcast, since it lets the audience run the show. \u201cAs a host, I\u2019m constantly watching the audience\u2019s expressions: puzzled looks, nods of agreement, those moments of real engagement,\u201d Michael said. \u201cThat dictates whether we dig deeper into a topic, clarify something, or swiftly move on to the next question.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cToday, SEO Office Hours feels less like a podcast and more like a weekly gathering of some of the smartest, most generous people in the industry,\u201d Michael added. \u201cAnd honestly, even if I weren\u2019t running it, I\u2019d still be there every Friday.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>One big takeaway<\/h4>\n<p>The lesson for Michael is that consistency wins the day. \u201cWhen we started SEO Office Hours, I set a target: every Friday for three months, no matter what,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout that commitment, it would have been easy to stop after the first or second episode. But when giving up isn\u2019t an option, you focus on making it better and better\u2014and on optimizing your time to keep it going.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think that mindset applies to everything in marketing: whether it\u2019s launching a newsletter, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/social-media-strategy\">building a social presence<\/a>, or implementing a content strategy. Consistency compounds. The longer you stick with it, the more valuable it becomes.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>The past episode to have in your playlist<\/h4>\n<p>Michael said they\u2019ve begun rotating in occasional co-hosts, and that\u2019s expanded the show\u2019s ability to deliver diverse ideas. \u201cOne of my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=A4qHN3pqZtU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">favorite episodes<\/a> was when I sat in the audience myself and Yordan Dimitrov co-hosted with Jo,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was amazing to experience the show from the audience\u2019s perspective and see just how valuable\u2014and fun\u2014it is when you\u2019re on the other side.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 <strong>Podcasts help get more people to your website.<\/strong> Download <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/increase-traffic-to-your-website?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download\">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website<\/a> for even more.<\/p>\n<div id=\"market-movers-building-brands-and-links-with-linkifi\"><\/div>\n<h3>2.

We cover a wide range of topics and invite a variety of guests. A lot of them we\u2019ve actually met in person, often at conferences. Having that prior connection really breaks down the third wall and makes the conversations more open.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That open exchange of ideas that happens when professionals meet is exactly the vibe Christopher and Nick curate on their show. \u201cWe were doing a lot of networking at conferences and kept meeting interesting people with great stories and insights,\u201d Christopher said. \u201cYou pick up so many useful tidbits at conferences that it almost feels like a waste not to share them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>My favorite part of Market Movers is the enthusiasm Nick and Christopher bring to learning right along with the audience. \u201cWe don\u2019t pretend to know everything, and we\u2019re genuinely curious,\u201d Christopher said. \u201cWhen a guest talks about something we don\u2019t fully understand, we\u2019re not afraid to ask more questions and dig deeper.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>One big takeaway<\/h4>\n<p>If you find yourself stuck in the planning phase of projects for too long, you\u2019re not alone. Running the Market Movers podcast has helped Christopher get past his analysis paralysis.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the biggest mindset shifts I\u2019ve had is that you just have to test things and get them out there,\u201d Michael said. \u201cYou can plan forever, but real value comes from launching and learning in real-time. Whether it\u2019s a new funnel, an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/lead-nurturing-emails\">email sequence<\/a>, or anything else, it\u2019s better to put it live, get feedback, and make changes on the fly.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSome of the best results I\u2019ve seen have come from launching something that flopped, tweaking it, relaunching it, and eventually figuring out what worked and why,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat\u2019s been the biggest shift for me, to stop waiting for perfect. Just launch, learn, and refine.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>The past episode to have in your playlist<\/h4>\n<p>\u201cPersonally, the solo <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketmoverspod.com\/e\/the-7-figure-deal-tim-stoddart-s-risky-bet-on-copyblogger\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interview I did with Tim Stoddart<\/a> really stuck with me,\u201d Christopher said. \u201cHis story is powerful. He\u2019s overcome a lot and achieved a huge amount, and I think he\u2019s in a really good place now. That episode definitely resonated with me, and I\u2019d recommend giving it a listen.\u201d<\/p>\n<div id=\"the-market-mindset-podcast\"><\/div>\n<h3>3.

That mantra drives<a href=\"https:\/\/www.brighterclick.com\/marketing-mindset-podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> The Marketing Mindset<\/a>\u2014a podcast that gets in the weeds of ground-level marketing with people who live and breathe it every day.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-marketing-mindset.webp\" alt=\"Best marketing podcasts - Marketing Mindset\" width=\"835\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93771 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-marketing-mindset.webp 835w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-marketing-mindset-480x345.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 835px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLfney7s8PpE8dHdI296ujqFIDv4Z4ydlO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I think sets Marketing Mindset apart is the intent behind it,\u201d Colby said. \u201cEverything we share is driven by a single priority, which is helping people grow and learn, both personally and in their business. That means keeping the content transparent, trustworthy, and free from hidden agendas.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I love how they dig deep into a specific topic in each episode. Look over the list and you\u2019ll see titles like \u201cHow to start <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/tiktok-marketing-for-small-businesses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">selling on TikTok<\/a> Shops\u201d and \u201cCreating a Facebook Ads Creative Report Template.\u201d There\u2019s even a seven-part series dedicated to building a high-level creative strategy process.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy vision for the podcast has evolved from being a place to communicate with people already well-known in the industry, to also finding the people working in the weeds to have them share their expertise, and help build their personal brands,\u201d Colby said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur goal is simple,\u201d he added. \u201cKeep the main priority the main priority, which is delivering honest, actionable insights that help people succeed.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>One big takeaway<\/h4>\n<p>I\u2019m guilty of reading a marketing success story and forgetting all the background context that led to the result. Colby said that getting the full story from his guests reminds him of all the turbulence that happens before a smooth landing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the most refreshing things I have learned from hosting the show is that a lot of growth lessons come in hindsight,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, there are people who can plan and execute exactly as intended, but more often the real breakthroughs are understood retrospectively.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOn social media, it can seem like every success story was the result of a flawless plan,\u201d Colby explained. \u201cPeople share how they did X, Y, or Z, and it led to a big win, and it can give the impression that it was all intentional from the start. In reality, many of those wins become clear only when you look back and analyze what actually drove the results.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThrough my own experience and countless guest conversations, I have realized the value of post-implementation reviews. Taking the time to reflect on what truly worked and why can turn everyday actions into long-term growth lessons.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>The past episode to have in your playlist<\/h4>\n<p>\u201cOne episode that really stands out to me was my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tI9jscqQ1Qo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interview with Ben<\/a>, the CEO of True Classic,\u201d Colby shared. \u201cBefore that conversation, I was a meticulous planner. I would map out the year, then the quarter, then the month, break that into weeks, and even down to daily tasks. Planning has value, but Ben really shifted my perspective on execution.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe emphasized the importance of focusing on what needs to be done today or this week, especially in a fast-moving business. Things change so quickly that planning too far ahead can sometimes work against you, particularly in a startup.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLooking back, I think my heavy focus on planning was a bit of a defense mechanism to avoid failure. But real growth comes from failing fast, learning quickly, and pivoting when needed. That episode helped me embrace the idea of spending less time perfecting a plan and more time acting on it.\u201d<\/p>\n<div id=\"the-marketing-chatroom\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. The Marketing Chatroom<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for a little fresh air in the sometimes stuffy confines of digital marketing, I highly recommend giving <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL9cBWyQM0Rb4_eMtKTsSPxBD1eOnYy0go\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Marketing Chatroom<\/a> a listen. Host <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/kayla-bryant-sacramento\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kayla Bryant<\/a>, general manager of <a href=\"https:\/\/twotreesppc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Two Trees PPC<\/a>, brings a vibe that she describes as \u201cupbeat, slightly silly, and that should feel like you\u2019re talking to a friend.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-marketing-chatroom.webp\" alt=\"Best marketing podcasts - The Marketing Chatroom\" width=\"814\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93772 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-marketing-chatroom.webp 814w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-marketing-chatroom-480x354.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 814px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL9cBWyQM0Rb4_eMtKTsSPxBD1eOnYy0go\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u201cBased on what I hear from guests and listeners, my podcast is more approachable and casual,\u201d she said. \u201cI talk with marketers about their real challenges and unique approaches toward success in their careers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Kayla and her guests get into the tactical side of marketing often, but the best bits for me are the episodes that explore soft\u2014but critical\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/07\/marketing-skills\">marketing skills<\/a> like empathy and creativity. It\u2019s interesting to learn how people in the field put those ideas into practice.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI thought it would be cool to have a platform to highlight insights from marketing professionals in a variety of industries, roles, and places in their careers,\u201d she said. \u201cI&#8217;ve learned that as a host, I don&#8217;t have to be perfect or have a formal plan or specific questions prepared. As long as I have a guest with a story to tell and a general episode theme in mind- being open to a genuine conversation about something the guest is passionate about or expert at produces the best results.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>One big takeaway<\/h4>\n<p>Remote work has plenty of benefits, but sometimes it can feel a little isolating. Kayla said that listening to her guests confirms that a collaborative attitude is still critical for marketing success.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAcross the board, through my conversations, I&#8217;ve noticed that the most successful marketers (in my opinion) are those who have a true team mindset,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey&#8217;ve become leaders in the space because they rise by lifting up others. They all started in the trenches doing the work, but they&#8217;ve found opportunities to improve upon their own work and taught others along the way. They aren&#8217;t afraid to share their knowledge alongside their challenges.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>The past episode to have in your playlist<\/h4>\n<p>\u201cI struggle to not label every episode as my favorite, because each one is so interesting and unique,\u201d Kayla told me. Fair enough, I\u2019m not sure I can pick favorites from my work, either.<\/p>\n<p>But if I were picking a place to start in the Marketing Chatroom, I\u2019d say the<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/mAZfQrUynoM?si=_wF4S936V0mkCJnp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> chat with David Young<\/a> on the power of storytelling. Storytelling has become almost clich\u00e9 these days, but David does a great job of grounding it in results.<\/p>\n<div id=\"fm\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Plugin.fm<\/h3>\n<p>Where many podcasts cover marketing broadly across every industry,<a href=\"http:\/\/plugin.fm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Plugin.fm<\/a> stays narrow and deep by helping practitioners build a software business to navigate various growth challenges.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMost marketing podcasts are marketers talking to other marketers,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/goranmirkovic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Goran Mirkovic<\/a>, the chief marketing officer at <a href=\"https:\/\/freemius.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Freemius<\/a>, who co-hosts the show with Patrick Rauland. \u201cOurs is different because it speaks directly to indie software makers and encourages them to take bigger swings with their products.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-pluginfm.webp\" alt=\"Best marketing podcasts - Plugin.fm\" width=\"937\" height=\"608\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93773 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-pluginfm.webp 937w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-pluginfm-480x311.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"http:\/\/plugin.fm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Originally, the show was a great way for the Freemius folks to learn about their <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/customer-pain-points\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">target audience\u2019s struggles<\/a> and to build relationships with industry leaders. \u201cThe podcast gave us a reason to sit down with them for an hour and ask the questions we genuinely cared about,\u201d Goran said.<\/p>\n<p>As they compiled more episodes, though, Goran said they noticed the library had a different purpose. \u201c[It became] more about co-creating useful resources with industry experts for indie founders and small software teams who don\u2019t have mentors or investors guiding them. What began as a learning tool has grown into a library of practical stories and strategies from real builders.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While marketing is a core component of the show\u2019s topics, it also seeks to solve other hurdles like pricing experiments, subscription headaches, and customer support struggles.\u201cThese are the challenges that actually keep small teams up at night,\u201d Goran said. \u201cOur goal is to inspire and educate, not to sell.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>One big takeaway<\/h4>\n<p>Software startups can get caught up in the race to grow fast. So can we marketers. Goran said the conversations on Plugin.fm have reminded him that having a strong foundation is more important than growing sky-high too fast.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cStop chasing \u2018scale\u2019 too early,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of our guests reinforced the idea that you don\u2019t need 10,000 customers. What you need is 50 loyal ones who give feedback, renew, and tell others about you. That shift in mindset is freeing. Instead of obsessing over growth hacks, focus on building something so useful that a small group sticks with you.

Content, Briefly<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/podcast.superpath.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Content, Briefly<\/a> is one of my personal favorite marketing podcasts, so I was glad when another marketer suggested it.
