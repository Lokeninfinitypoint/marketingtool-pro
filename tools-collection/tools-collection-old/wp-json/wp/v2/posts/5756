As we\u2019ve discussed in previous posts, the chances of getting an ad to go viral are pretty low \u2013 you\u2019re much better off creating educational or how-to videos that will gain a steady stream of visitors over time.<\/p>\n<p>What about the 1% though? Those ads that practically promote themselves? One thing seems clear \u2013 most of them are utterly hilarious. Not just funny, but odd, quirky, and even downright bizarre. Today we\u2019re looking at some of the weirdest, wackiest ads online, and examining why they are successful.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>PooPourri: Before-You-Go Toilet Spray<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>This video was what inspired this post \u2013 I was dying to share this ridiculously oddball ad.<\/p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ZKLnhuzh9uY?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>This video ad is very clever, but also so convincing! It has you wonder how you\u2019ve survived all these years without PooPourri. So, what makes this ad work? Why has it reached over 9 million views after only 2 weeks on YouTube? I have some ideas\u2026<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It Appeals to Our Base Immaturity<\/strong>: We\u2019re all middle school boys at heart, and poop will always be hilarious. It may even be <em>too<\/em> funny \u2013 in the ad they have to make a point of announcing that it is, in fact, a real product, and that no, it\u2019s not a joke.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Taboo Topic:<\/strong> Let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s not every day you watch an ad about fecal matter. Bowel movement discussions are reserved for the elderly and perhaps <em>very <\/em>intimate friends. To throw it all out in the open is extreme, and as an audience, we just can\u2019t look away!<\/li>\n<li><strong>There\u2019s Something Familiar:<\/strong> The female British character feels oddly familiar. Perhaps she reminds you of\u2026<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/psO4uKNSa0Y?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Another ad about being \u201cfresh!\u201d Coincidence? Maybe. However, the whole idea of having a cute British woman promoting something as menial as gum or lavatory potpourri is familiar, and perhaps that familiarity provides a small bit of comfort for what is, in some ways, a truly strange and foreign advert.<\/p>\n<p>The presentation format of the Poopourri ad, featuring a spokesperson directly engaging with audiences, is also reminiscent of another popular funny ad that achieved momentous success on YouTube\u2026<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Dollar Shave Club Funny YouTube Ad<\/strong><\/h2>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ZUG9qYTJMsI?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>Why Do Folks Like the Dollar Shave Club Ad?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Random Humor:<\/strong> The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dollarshaveclub.com\/\">Dollar Shave Club<\/a> ad utilizes the same kind of random comedy that makes Family Guy popular \u2013 the unexpected, oddball, out-of-nowhere elements bring a sense of hilarity.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Long Shots:<\/strong> There are quite a few long shots in this ad as the announcer walks towards the camera, or with the camera following the speaker. The continuous movement helps keep viewers\u2019 attention and builds anticipation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Both the Dollar Shave Club and PooPourri humorous advertisements come in succession to the Old Spice ads, which feature a nearly identical style. We could spend the whole post talking about the incredible Old Spice marketing campaign, but it\u2019s already discussed quite a bit in our <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/11\/27\/youtube-advertising\">YouTube Advertising Guide.<\/a>\u00a0Also check out our in-depth post about <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/13\/explainer-videos\">how to make your own explainer video<\/a> &#8211; videos like these can be really valuable pieces of content for your business.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Moon Cup vs. Tampon Rap Battle<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>To continue with our bathroom theme, here\u2019s another odd but informative ad detailing the advantages of using a menstrual cup as opposed to tampons. I know, sorry dudes, but denial won\u2019t protect you.<\/p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/9zj4NhC8ahM?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Taboo Topic (Again):<\/strong> Any whisper of a woman\u2019s bodily functions tends to be considered taboo. Similar to PooPourri, the mere shock value will get people talking about this ad.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Music:<\/strong> The mini rap battle really is funny, and people just can\u2019t resist a good song. Even when it\u2019s about the beloved women\u2019s curse. A song can make even the most serious topics seem light-hearted and fancy-free. Have you ever tried to sing about lost puppies? Drowning polar bears? What about dying tragically like this YouTube hit\u2026<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/IJNR2EpS0jw?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2><strong>Kmart\u2019s Ship My Pants<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>This funny video ad highlights that tingly sensation you get when you\u2026<\/p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/I03UmJbK0lA?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pun Intended:<\/strong> Great play on words!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Unexpected (Especially Considering the Source):<\/strong> This kind of humor seems really out of left field coming from Kmart, but it\u2019s a pleasant surprise. It\u2019s cool to see Kmart experimenting with its marketing approach. Kudos to the bold and brave!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Do you have any wacky weird YouTube ads that stand out for you? Why do you think they work well as advertisements? Let us know in the comments!<\/p>\n<p>Next let\u2019s move on to funny PPC ads. And yes, they do exist!<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Funny PPC Ads: Are We Laughing With You or at You?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There are two types of \u201cfunny PPC ads\u201d \u2013 the ones that are funny because they are utterly disastrous, and those that earn a chuckle for their cleverness and ingenuity. The former are plentiful, while the latter are in short supply.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/bad-ppc-ads-1.jpg\" alt=\"Bad PPC Ads\" width=\"239\" height=\"85\" \/><\/div>\n<p><em>Don\u2019t you just hate paying full price for children?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The ad above is funny, but for all the wrong reasons. This is just a plain old bad PPC ad. To check out more fail-worthy PPC advertisements, read our post about <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/03\/13\/dear-ebay-its-not-adwords-its-you\">eBay\u2019s truly terrible PPC ads.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>What about the PPC ads that are genuinely funny? Traditionally there is little room for humor in PPC ads. Literally, there just isn\u2019t the physical space \u2013 with only 130 characters (less than a tweet!), it\u2019s hard to promote your product or offering while simultaneously showcasing your wit.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s impossible. Check out this PPC ad from the Braille Bookstore.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/funny-ppc-ad-1.jpg\" alt=\"Funny PPC Ads\" width=\"271\" height=\"127\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Here we\u2019ve got a lot of winning elements that we already discussed, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pun:<\/strong> Products you\u2019ve never seen before. Because\u2026..you\u2019re blind.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Taboo:<\/strong> Making jokes about the blind community is somewhat taboo. Especially when they\u2019re your main customer! Maybe it\u2019s all in good fun?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The format of the PPC ad makes this humor even more impressive \u2013 it\u2019s really rare to see a truly funny PPC ad, and it takes planning to deliver a punch line like that in a PPC ad. To top it all off, the ad is subtle enough that you have to wonder if the joke is even intentional\u2026<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/weird-ppc-ads-1.jpg\" alt=\"wacky ppc ads\" width=\"580\" height=\"150\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This one is more creative than funny, but still worth calling out. <a href=\"http:\/\/royal.pingdom.com\/2008\/05\/23\/smart-and-funny-use-of-google-adwords\/\">Royal Pingdom<\/a> claims that this ad had a 47% increase in CTR! Now that\u2019s nothing to laugh at.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/silly-ppc-ad-1.jpg\" alt=\"Funniest PPC Ads\" width=\"477\" height=\"279\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The site I found this World of Warcraft PPC ad on had this ad labeled as one of the \u201clamest PPC ads ever\u201d but I thought it was actually pretty clever. Hey, know your audience, right?<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Ingenious Image Ads<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Continuing with our funny theme, we\u2019ve also got some funny image ads. Why are image ads so popular? Images grab attention more powerfully than text, and familiar brands don\u2019t need a ton of space to explain their product \u2013 as the Dothraki would say, <em>it is known<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>The prevalence of online space and online content supplementing in-print ads means that some advertisers, even those that aren\u2019t so well known, would rather use print space to capture attention with a powerful image. Then users can simply direct viewers to a information-heavy website via a suggested URL or QR code.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some favorites borrowed from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/copyranter\/the-15-most-creative-print-ads-of-the-year\">Buzzfeed<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Girls rule and boys drool<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/funny-print-ads-1.jpg\" alt=\"funniest ads of all time \" width=\"723\" height=\"517\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The mighty hunter.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/funny-image-ad-1.jpg\" alt=\"humorous ads\" width=\"988\" height=\"507\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Oh I get it. Wait, no I don\u2019t. OK, now I do&#8230;<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/funny-commerical-ads-1.jpg\" alt=\"funny commercials\" width=\"990\" height=\"700\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You <em>do<\/em> have to go right now.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/funniest-advertising-campaigns-1.jpg\" alt=\"funniest advertisements of all time\" width=\"2200\" height=\"566\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You may notice that a lot of the image ads above are somewhat juvenile. Not to say that a video about poop belongs in the New Yorker, but there is a cleverness you don\u2019t see represented in many of the above print ads.<\/p>\n<p>Limited space means that advertisers are responsible for capturing the most intense emotion possible in the least amount of time. Often times the easiest way to do this is through humor, with laughs as unsophisticated as Helen Keller jokes. Not classy, not witty, but gosh darn-it, they do make us laugh.<\/p>\n<p>I hope you enjoyed this brief examination of the funny ads of our time. Maybe some of these wacky ads inspired some funny, creative ideas of your own?<\/p>\n<p>As always, if you have some insight to add, <strong>please comment!
