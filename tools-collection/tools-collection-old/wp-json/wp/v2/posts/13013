But it\u2019s certainly not the only one at B2B marketers\u2019 disposal.<\/p>\n<p>Here, we\u2019re looking 10 B2B lead generation strategies, including content marketing, to share how you can add these to your marketing plan and make sure your hard work and effort is effective\u2014and certainly not ending up neutral.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s get started.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Content Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>Content marketing is certainly a popular suggestion, and perhaps worthy of its own post. That\u2019s because, like consumers, businesses also want to arm themselves with information before a big purchase.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c[B2B marketing publication] the Demand Gen Report estimated that 47% of buyers read between three and five pieces of copy before contacting a sales rep while [research firm] Gartner estimates that more than 65% of purchasing decisions occur before a buyer ever makes contact with a supplier,\u201d said Anu Ramani, founder and managing director of content marketing agency Isoline Communications.<\/p>\n<p>And so, Tony Mastri, digital marketing manager at B2B agency Marion Integrated Marketing, said nothing beats an ongoing SEO campaign with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/12\/01\/b2b-content-marketing\">B2B content marketing<\/a> support in generating leads.<\/p>\n<p>He recommends using a tool like SEMrush to identify keywords and content length recommendations for your core product\/service pages and to then build out said pages to address your perceived user intent. Mastri also says to go as niche as possible with your pages and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/09\/how-to-write-a-blog-post\">blog posts<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor example, if you\u2019re a child support lawyer in Dallas, Texas, all of your long-form blog content should be about child support issues in Texas or Dallas specifically,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>This can also help compensate for advertisers in industries with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/29\/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks\">high CPC rates<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-industry-benchmarks-average-cpc-1.png\" alt=\"contextual display costs\" width=\"800\" height=\"913\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cIn these industries, paid advertisements are often too costly to achieve a positive ROI, so organic traffic with positively compounding results is the clear strategy of choice,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, Md Mohsin Ansari, marketing manager at office chat and messaging app Troop Messenger, said the startup decided to target \u201cMicrosoft Teams vs. Slack\u201d rather than broader keywords like \u201cteam chat apps,\u201d \u201coffice chat\u201d or \u201cbusiness chat\u201d thanks to Ahrefs keyword planner tool.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe fact that customers were searching for \u2018Microsoft Teams vs Slack\u2019 itself indicates that they are aware of both the products but [are] unable to pick which one meets their requirements adequately,\u201d Ansari said. \u201cSo, it [was] high time for us to pinpoint the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/28\/pain-points\">pain points<\/a> in using them through our post with the keyword and [introduce] our product \u2026 as an alternative.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While he did not share specifics, he said this keyword-post combination resulted in increased brand awareness, traffic, SERP positions, and CTR.<\/p>\n<p>Per Sneh Ratna Choudhary, a content marketer at B2B SaaS tech startup MobStac, you shouldn\u2019t forget platforms like Quora and Medium, which can also help generate traffic to high-intent landing pages and answer questions potential customers might have.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor countries where Google is banned, we have seen a small number of leads trickle in because of our detailed answers on these forums,\u201d Choudhary added.<\/p>\n<h2>2. LinkedIn<\/h2>\n<p>Not surprisingly, professional network <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/17\/generate-leads-linkedin\">LinkedIn is also high on the list of best B2B lead generation strategies<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>According to Zuza Witulska, growth hacker at software development company Netguru, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/07\/linkedin-lead-generation\">Linkedin lead generation ads<\/a> give users very specific targeting criteria.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis gives our ads the chance to reach C-level decision-makers from companies of our interest, as well as potential leads,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>One of Netguru\u2019s best-performing lead generation campaigns on the network targeted fintech companies with an ebook.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe were iterating on the ad copy [both visual and messaging] to figure out which version resonates best with the fintech community and adjust the budget accordingly,\u201d Witulska said. \u201cLong story short, not only did we generate more than 240 high quality contacts \u2026 but also the lead acquisition cost was 78% lower than in other lead gen campaigns.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Choudhary agreed LinkedIn Ads can generate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/26\/intent-marketing\">high-intent leads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/b2b-lead-generation-strategies-linkedin.jpg\" alt=\"LinkedIn lead generation ad\" width=\"546\" height=\"580\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cWe procured data about the companies and industries we wanted to target from [business information site] Crunchbase and then segmented ads based on industry and job title on LinkedIn,\u201d she said. \u201cThe ad ran on LinkedIn for two weeks, and we received <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/08\/lead-quality\">high-quality enterprise leads<\/a> that would have otherwise probably not found us.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>3. Google Ads\u2014especially when they\u2019re well-timed<\/h2>\n<p>After a competitor had an outage, Internet traffic optimization company Constellix created a Google Ads campaign to target those who were impacted using phrases from reviews and forums in its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/14\/writing-ad-copy-at-scale\">ad copy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe did notice that some of our ads weren&#8217;t as effective because they focused too much on the negative impacts of outages rather than the desired benefits,\u201d said Blair McKee, digital marketing manager at Constellix. \u201cSo we pivoted and modified our ad copy to push the benefits of switching providers and saw immediate improvement [in] both click-through rates and impressions. Our quality score also improved, which I attribute to our ad copy, [which] was more representative of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/02\/landing-page-copywriting\">landing copy<\/a>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Learn more about using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/20\/google-ads-for-lead-generation\">Google Ads for lead generation<\/a> here.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Facebook lead ad campaigns<\/h2>\n<p>Don\u2019t dismiss Facebook as waste of time in B2B. In fact, web developer Rob Smith of WebDesignCity\u00a0pointed to a study from marketing platform <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/marketing-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HubSpot<\/a>, which found 74% of consumers use Facebook in professional capacities, too.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lead-ad-examples-facebook-blueprint.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook lead ads event promotion\" width=\"615\" height=\"688\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Alistair Dodds, marketing director at digital marketing agency Ever Increasing Circles Marketing, agreed his go-to B2B lead generation strategy includes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/26\/facebook-lead-ads\">Facebook lead ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The firm starts by split-testing clients\u2019 custom audiences to produce lookalike audiences versus interest-based audiences, and it tests a lead magnet offer to ensure the content includes what prospects are looking for.\u00a0Then, Dodds said he split-tests the angle of the subject material.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo, for example, one campaign will focus on benefits whereas another will target a [fear of missing out (FOMO)]-play to see which resonates with our prospects the most,\u201d he added. \u201cAgain, we&#8217;ll split-test the ad content to find the video or image that garners the most attention and build out creative assets from that. We&#8217;ll also split-test the copy to match the angle we are taking.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you\u2019re a financial services firm targeting mortgage brokers, you could offer a tiered level of data analysis reports or white papers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe found the FOMO play to [be] especially effective in this market as each broker is looking for a competitive advantage over the competition,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth types of lead magnet material were offered to the first 100 users to sign up. The data analysis reports outperformed the white papers by a factor of 3.2x.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>5. Live chat<\/h2>\n<p>For his part, Guillaume Moubeche, CEO of automated outreach email platform Lemlist, said its B2B lead generation is usually based on live chat\u2014with customer service reps delivering more than 11,000 messages per month, making it the firm\u2019s best-performing lead generation channel. By focusing on customer experience, Lemlist converts around 30% of these site visitors, he added.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/b2b-lead-generation-strategies-live-chat.jpg\" alt=\"live chat example\" width=\"728\" height=\"333\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cTo save our resources, we&#8217;re using [customer service and live chat Slack app] Lemtalk\u00a0live chat that&#8217;s fully integrated into Slack,\u201d Moubeche said. \u201cSo we&#8217;re receiving and answering all of our messages directly from Slack. The best part is that on Slack we&#8217;re also receiving messages that came through Facebook, SMS or email, so we&#8217;re basically receiving all of our messages into one Slack.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>6. Live video<\/h2>\n<p>Digital marketing specialist Sirarpi Sahakyan said live video is an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/12\/how-to-generate-leads\">effective way to generate leads<\/a> as data from review site Techjury found 87% of businesses use video as a marketing tool.<\/p>\n<p>Topics for live video campaigns include webinars, product launches, Q&amp;As, teasers, how-tos, events and special guests. Platforms include LinkedIn, YouTube and\/or Facebook, although Sahakyan said marketers can stream to multiple channels at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt the end of the live <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/08\/video-marketing-statistics\">video campaigns<\/a>, we noticed that more people showed interest in the product than through our blog content,\u201d Sahakyan said. \u201cMultistreaming helped us analyze our audience through [cloud multistreaming service] Restream analytics and see where we could improve.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>7. Facebook ThruPlay<\/h2>\n<p>Brands with smaller budgets should try Facebook\u2019s ThruPlay, a new optimization and pay-per-view feature for video ads, said Stacey Kehoe of digital marketing agency Brandlective Communications.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUnlike the existing formats, designed to achieve the lowest cost per three-second or 10-second video view, ThruPlay allows advertisers to optimize and pay only for ads that are watched for at least 15 seconds,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a game-changer for those with a limited budget because it means they can be savvy by creating a marketing message that repels the audience that do not meet their \u2018perfect avatar\u2019 in the first 15 seconds.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Advertisers can then segment relevant viewers into new lists and retarget them with another ThruPlay ad that further narrows the field.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/wordstream-facebook-gif-ad-example1-compressor-2.gif\" alt=\"Facebook Ad Gifs\" width=\"516\" height=\"558\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cYou can repeat this process to build a highly targeted, warm list of prospects paying very little on Facebook ads,\u201d she added.<\/p>\n<h2>8. Gated videos<\/h2>\n<p>The first thing most marketers think of with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/18\/gated-content\">gated content<\/a> is guides\/ebooks. But video works well here too. Phil Nottingham, brand marketing strategist at video software company Wistia, suggests adding <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/30\/video-email-marketing\">email collection functionality to videos<\/a> with some kind of incentive.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/video-email-marketing-wistia.jpg\" alt=\"video email marketing\" width=\"482\" height=\"542\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cA discount offer is a worthwhile exchange for that email subscription,\u201d he said. \u201cPlacing the email gate at the beginning of a video with a solid incentive can increase email sign-up by 400%, as discovered by the Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch, a local chicken restaurant in California. This client also measured no significant loss in content views from this strategy.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>9. Personalized videos<\/h2>\n<p>Not surprisingly, Vito Santoro, co-founder of Vaetas, which produces personalized call-to-action videos, is a fan of personalized videos.<\/p>\n<p>Before connecting with prospects, Vaetas records a short video, which it sends via email, text or social.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/b2b-lead-generation-personalized-video.jpg\" alt=\"Wista personalized video\" width=\"768\" height=\"480\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Wistia calls these <a href=\"https:\/\/wistia.com\/learn\/marketing\/video-that-dont-scale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&#8220;videos that don&#8217;t scale.&#8221;<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe found that this approach increased our cold conversions by 38%,\u201d Santoro said. \u201cWarm follow-up emails and text messages converted at an amazing 99%. The key is to be authentic and communicate that you understand your prospect&#8217;s needs, as opposed to immediately trying to sell your products or services.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>10. Free stuff<\/h2>\n<p>Then there\u2019s always the age-old tactic of offering something free as a carrot.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, Sam Orchard, director of web design agency Edge of the Web, said it\u2019s one of his agency\u2019s most popular lead generation methods, but you have to offer something of real value\u2014and even something a competitor might charge for.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had great success by offering signups [for] a free SEO audit for their site,\u201d Orchard said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that takes relatively little time for us to do, but provides the business with something valuable. It\u2019s been a very successful strategy for us, with around 30% of people who signed up for a free SEO audit continuing to request paid work with us.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/b2b-lead-generation-free-stuff-offer.jpg\" alt=\"HubSpot example of a free stuff offer\" width=\"737\" height=\"410\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/b2b-marketing\">HubSpot<\/a> offers a free product marketing go-to-market kit here.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In a similar vein, Choudhary said MobStac built a free QR code generator after its product line expanded to include QR codes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe search volume for this keyword is 550,000\/month,\u201d she said. \u201cSince the launch, our visitor-to-trial <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/19\/conversion-rate-benchmarks\">conversion rates<\/a> have picked up and are currently hovering at 15.6%.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Another tactic in this vein is offering a closed beta to potential customers.<\/p>\n<p>Nadiia Shevelieva, CMO of online marketing tools firm Crowdy.ai, said it had 100 free beta accounts, which Crowdy.ai promoted through ads and social media.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOnce someone joined the beta, they would have free access to our app for three months after signup instead of paying about $50 monthly,\u201d Shevelieva said. \u201cIn return, we asked for comments about our app and how it performed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As a result, 72 of 100 users became paying customers and 58 new users were added as a result of recommendation s from the beta group.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOverall, this strategy has performed great for us since we\u2019ve just launched our product,\u201d Shevelieva added.<\/p>\n<h2>Test these B2B lead generation strategies out!<\/h2>\n<p>Here are ten strategies you can use to attract more high-quality B2B leads:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Content marketing<\/li>\n<li>LinkedIn<\/li>\n<li>Google Ads<\/li>\n<li>Facebook lead ads<\/li>\n<li>Live chat<\/li>\n<li>Live video<\/li>\n<li>Facebook ThruPlay<\/li>\n<li>Gated video<\/li>\n<li>Personalized video<\/li>\n<li>Free stuff<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Now, test them out to see what works best for your audience\u2014and get those leads!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Let&#8217;s face it: B2B marketers need their own toolkit.
