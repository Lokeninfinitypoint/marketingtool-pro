Warm days are ahead! While the seasons were changing, so was the world of online advertising\u2014that\u2019s why it\u2019s time for another <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/taxonomy\/term\/165\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">news round-up<\/a>. Let\u2019s see what\u2019s been going on recently.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Facebook removes more targeting options<\/h2>\n<p>In 2018, the National Fair Housing Alliance, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Communication Workers of America, and several other groups <a href=\"https:\/\/nationalfairhousing.org\/2018\/03\/27\/facebook-sued-by-civil-rights-groups-for-discrimination-in-online-housing-advertisements\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">filed suit<\/a> against Facebook due to concerns that its advertising platform enables discrimination against particular audiences on the basis of race, gender, age, and so on.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2bd6549f-d3a6-4fe2-a095-55afa59cd064\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-removes-more-targeting-options.png\" alt=\"facebook-removes-more-targeting-options-infographic\" width=\"500\" height=\"854\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Last summer, Facebook <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/22\/facebook-removes-targeting-options\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">removed<\/a> over 5,000 targeting options from its advertising platform\u2014a decision that impacted advertisers from all verticals. Now, Facebook has <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.fb.com\/news\/2019\/03\/protecting-against-discrimination-in-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced<\/a> new policies specifically geared towards advertisers in the housing, employment, and credit industries:<\/p>\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\n<li>Facebook will no longer allow advertisers in these industries to target users according to gender, age, or ZIP code.<\/li>\n<li>Facebook will disable targeting that appears to exclude users on the basis of race, gender, age, class, sexual orientation, or religion.<\/li>\n<li>Facebook is building a tool that will enable users to view all the housing-related ads that are currently running in the US.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It goes without saying that everyone at WordStream fully supports this decision and the broader trend of Facebook more diligently working to eliminate discriminatory ads.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">LinkedIn introduces lookalike audiences<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">LinkedIn, which now boasts over 600 million users, has <a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/marketing-solutions\/blog\/linkedin-news\/2019\/targeting-on-linkedin-just-got-more-powerful\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced<\/a> that advertisers now have the ability to create and target lookalike audiences on the platform.<\/p>\n<p>Long employed by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/facebook-lookalike-audiences\">savvy Facebook marketers<\/a>, lookalike audiences enable you to target users similar to those who\u2019ve already engaged your business in some way\u2014visited your website, downloaded a whitepaper, or even become a paying customer. The idea behind lookalike audiences is that the users who look and act like those who\u2019ve engaged your business are more likely than others to take the action you want them to take.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c43902ef-2f98-43d3-98b2-5eca4584e453\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-removes-more-targeting-options-linkedin-lookalikes-finalpng.png\" alt=\"facebook-removes-more-targeting-options-linkedin-launches-lookalike-audiences\" width=\"780\" height=\"463\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In a nutshell, you can expand the reach of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/05\/linkedin-advertising\">LinkedIn ads<\/a> and remain confident that the impressions and clicks you\u2019re driving are coming from relevant, high-quality users. In fact, LinkedIn says that some of the advertisers who got early access to the lookalike audience functionality grew their reach tenfold without sacrificing quality.<\/p>\n<p>To get started with LinkedIn lookalike audiences, head to Campaign Manager and create a Matched Audience. If you\u2019re looking for ways to build out your first audience, you can pull a list of contacts from your CRM or a list of people who\u2019ve visited your website.<\/p>\n<p>LinkedIn has also announced the expansion of interest targeting, which the platform initially <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/25\/linkedin-interest-targeting\">rolled out<\/a> to advertisers in January. Now, you can target LinkedIn users according to <em>combinations <\/em>of their professional interests\u2014thus allowing you to get more granular. To help you get started, LinkedIn has created a couple dozen templates of predefined audiences that you can target.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Facebook launches a search engine for ads<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Competitive research on Facebook just got a little bit easier. Late last week, Facebook <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.fb.com\/news\/2019\/03\/a-better-way-to-learn-about-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced<\/a> the expansion of the Ad Library to include every business page that\u2019s running ads\u2014not just pages related to politics and social issues, as was previously the case.<\/p>\n<p>For those who don\u2019t know, the Ad Library\u2014launched in the US as the Ad Archive a while back\u2014was originally intended to enable Facebook users to get more information about the political ads they saw on the platform. Basically, if a user saw an inflammatory, politically charged ad and wanted to make sure it wasn\u2019t being run by a tech savvy man based in\u2014oh, I don\u2019t know\u2014a massive Eurasian powerhouse, they could so with the Ad Library.<\/p>\n<p>Now, in step with their continued efforts towards greater transparency, Facebook has expanded the Ad Library to enable users to get more information about <em>everyone\u2019s<\/em> ads. If your business has a Facebook page and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/01\/31\/low-budget-facebook-ad-campaigns\">you\u2019re running ads on the platform<\/a>, anyone can use the Ad Library to see what you\u2019re putting out there.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5f4f06df-0a95-4278-b272-cd12ff57a1d7\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-removes-more-targeting-options-ad-library-whole-foods.jpg\" alt=\"facebook-removes-more-targeting-options-new-ad-library\" width=\"738\" height=\"496\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">(Technically, users could already do this by navigating to your Facebook page and clicking on the Info and Ads tab. The Ad Library simply makes it easier and more streamlined.)<\/p>\n<p>But, users aren\u2019t really the concern, right? Nope\u2014it\u2019s your <em>competitors<\/em> that you have to worry about. The Ad Library is essentially a search engine for Facebook ads. Your closest rival can simply type your name into the search box and get instant access to all the creative advertising assets you\u2019re running.<\/p>\n<p>The <em>good news<\/em> is that your competitors still can\u2019t see all the behind-the-scenes stuff\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/10\/facebook-ad-targeting-options\">the demographics you\u2019re targeting<\/a>, the parameters of your lookalike audiences, and so on. And, at the end of the day, as important as it is to write strong copy and create compelling visuals, those audienced-based details are what really matter.<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, it doesn\u2019t hurt to keep an eye on the other businesses in your space and make sure their ads aren\u2019t getting too similar to yours.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Google makes Gmail dynamic, interactive<\/h2>\n<p>Gmail is about to become a lot more useful. Last week, Google <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/gmail\/take-action-and-stay-up-to-date-with-dynamic-email-in-gmail\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced<\/a> that it has improved its email property\u2014which boasts over a billion monthly active users\u2014by making it far more dynamic and interactive than ever before.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"align-center\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-removes-more-targeting-options-google-makes-gmail-dynamic.gif\" alt=\"facebook-removes-more-targeting-options-interactive-gmail\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"0790cfdb-7a97-46d4-ad83-24ba309d98c0\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>Via Google.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Compared to other web-based experiences, said Gmail product manager Aakash Sahney in the announcement blog post, \u201cemail has largely stayed the same\u2014with static messages that eventually go out of date or merely serve as springboards to accomplish more complex tasks.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve all been there: You get an email invitation to RSVP to an event and, rather than taking care of it within the email itself, you have to navigate to another website and fill out a form there. Not anymore. Thanks to the new, dynamic interface, you\u2019ll be able to accept meeting invitations, complete forms, browse products, respond to Google doc comments, book hotel rooms, and more\u2014all within Gmail.<\/p>\n<p>Business owners and digital marketers alike should certainly feel excited about this. In the past, it\u2019s been all too easy to suffer low engagement across your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/13\/targeted-email-marketing-strategies\">email marketing campaigns<\/a> due to the static nature of the messages and the frustration that your contacts may have felt when trying to complete simple tasks.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you run a local gym, for example. Previously, when you\u2019ve asked your email contacts to fill out the sign-up form for a new exercise class, you\u2019ve probably lost interested participants simply because they didn\u2019t feel like clicking through to your website. Now, as long as you\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/gsuite.google.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a G Suite customer<\/a>, you\u2019ll be able to drive more conversions with the help of dynamic, interactive Gmail templates.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Instagram makes Stories ads interactive<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Great news for social media marketers who (wisely) incorporate engagement with users into their strategies: Instagram has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/news\/instagram\/bringing-interactivity-to-instagram-stories-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced<\/a> that polls are coming to Stories ads.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/26\/instagram-stories-shopping\">Instagram Stories<\/a> are insanely popular, and a lot of businesses have been using interactive elements\u2014polls, hashtags, mentions\u2014in their <em>organic<\/em> Stories posts for some time now. It\u2019s a smart tactic\u2014and for more than one reason.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d29acd02-ed75-4bef-9e92-1133fbe6bf7d\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-removes-more-targeting-options-organic-instagram-stories.jpg\" alt=\"facebook-removes-more-targeting-options-organic-stories-poll\" width=\"800\" height=\"686\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>Via <a href=\"https:\/\/later.com\/blog\/instagram-stories-polls\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Later<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Using a Stories poll to directly ask your followers for their input on your product is a fantastic way to inform the path your business takes going forward. By no means is this a new idea\u2014solving for the customer should be the primary reason you\u2019re in business, after all. A Stories poll enables you to glean those valuable, customer-minded insights in fun, informal way.<\/p>\n<p>Tangentially, fielding customers\u2019 opinions through a Stories poll shows them that you care. You\u2019re giving them an opportunity to influence the development of your product according to their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/28\/pain-points\">pain points<\/a>, needs, and concerns.

With the extension of polls to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/07\/instagram-story-ads\">Stories ads<\/a>, you can now field opinions not only from your followers, but from Instagram users <strong>at large.<\/strong><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4e90ddbf-b7a7-4665-822d-fd4616a0d3ec\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-removes-more-targeting-options-instagram-stories-ads-polls_1.jpg\" alt=\"facebook-removes-more-targeting-options-interactive-instagram-stories-ads\" width=\"670\" height=\"359\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>Via <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/news\/instagram\/bringing-interactivity-to-instagram-stories-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let\u2019s say you\u2019re the in-house social media manager for a coffee house in Boston.
