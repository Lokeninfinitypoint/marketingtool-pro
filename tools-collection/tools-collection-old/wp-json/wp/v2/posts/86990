While there\u2019s no universal definition for these terms, typically they refer to influencers with a follower count in the thousands or tens of thousands.<\/p>\n<p>These smaller influencers deliver big for the brands they work with. In a survey of marketing specialists from Influencer Intelligence, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.influencerintelligence.com\/blog\/TT1\/new-report-the-rise-of-nano-influencers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">69%<\/a> reported that nano-influencers had boosted engagement with their brand.<\/p>\n<p>With all that in mind, you can see why deploying a holiday influencer marketing campaign might be a smart move for your business. Let\u2019s explore how to find a place for influencer marketing in your broader strategy.<\/p>\n<h3>Contents<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#holiday-influencer-marketing-tips\">Tips for super-effective holiday influencer marketing campaigns<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#holiday-influencer-marketing-ideas\">Holiday influencer marketing campaign ideas to try<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#holiday-influencer-marketing-wrap-up\">Wrap-up<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"holiday-influencer-marketing-tips\"><\/div>\n<h2>Holiday influencer marketing tips<\/h2>\n<p>Before you dive in to holiday influencer marketing, here are the steps you need to take to make it a hit.<\/p>\n<h3>Start with a holiday marketing plan<\/h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/performance-max-holiday-strategies\">holidays<\/a> are a critical time for businesses of all stripes to focus on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/17\/holiday-marketing-ideas\">marketing<\/a>. Consumer-facing brands often see their biggest revenue-generating months during the holiday season while B2Bs are closing deals with clients who wish to spend the rest of their annual budget and lock in vendors for the next year.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why implementing a coordinated marketing effort during this time is crucial. And like any <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-create-a-small-business-marketing-plan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">good marketing plan<\/a>, your approach to the holiday season should begin with SMART goals.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/smart-goals-acronym.webp\" alt=\"smart goals acronym\" width=\"460\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-80522\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/smart-goals-acronym.webp 460w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/smart-goals-acronym-231x300.webp 231w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>By defining clear, measurable objectives, you can then work backward to identify the tactics (and associated budget) to get you there. As you consider the tactics at your disposal, you can then sketch out how holiday influencer marketing might slot into your bigger plan.<\/p>\n<p>\u26a1\ufe0f<strong> Free guide download &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLPPC101.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_PPC101_Download\">PPC 101: Complete Guide to Google Ads<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Set your influencer marketing KPIs<\/h3>\n<p>While your broad <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/holiday-promotions-and-marketing-campaign-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">holiday marketing plan<\/a> will have its own defined goals, so too should each tactic within the larger strategy.<\/p>\n<p>The key performance indicators, or KPIs, for each tactic should roll up into your larger strategic goals. So, how do you define what success looks like for your influencer marketing efforts, specifically, and how does that contribute to your big picture?<\/p>\n<p>With influencer marketing, there are <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-metrics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">several metrics<\/a> that can help you assess the success of a campaign. You can easily measure statistics like views, impressions, and follower growth rate, all of which help you understand a campaign\u2019s performance.<\/p>\n<p>To take things a step further, look to create opportunities for clear attribution. For example, many brands provide their influencer partners with a branded promo code or URL. Then, when any sale comes in via that URL or code, the business knows it came through the influencer.<\/p>\n<h3>Find the right influencers<\/h3>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve defined your own expectations for your influencer campaign, you have the clarity to go out and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/influencer-outreach\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">find the ideal person<\/a> (or people) to partner with.<\/p>\n<p>The best part about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/21\/social-media-influencers\">working with influencers<\/a> is that they\u2019ve cultivated an audience for themselves. Most nano- and micro-influencers have a well-defined niche.<\/p>\n<p>BookTok influencers speak to readers, while personal finance influencers help followers make smarter money moves. And, of course, there are the fashion, beauty, and wellness influencers sharing trending clothes, makeup tips, and fitness or nutrition advice.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/holiday-influencer-marketing-beauty-influencer.webp\" alt=\"holiday influencer marketing example from beauty influencer\" width=\"719\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87075\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/holiday-influencer-marketing-beauty-influencer.webp 719w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/holiday-influencer-marketing-beauty-influencer-480x400.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 719px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reel\/C0KRjYTOj1M\/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Finding the right influencers for your brand starts with defining your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">target audience<\/a>. Put yourself in the mindset of your brand\u2019s ideal customer: Which influencers would you follow? And which of these influencers is a natural fit for your business?<\/p>\n<p>Depending on your business model, you might also want to consider geography. If you need an influencer who can create content in person at your store or restaurant, you\u2019ll need someone local.<\/p>\n<p>If heading out into the wilds of social media to find someone seems overwhelming, you might ask other small business owners for recommendations. Or, consider turning to a platform that helps connect brands with the best influencers for their audience and campaign goals.<\/p>\n<h3>Pitch the influencers you like<\/h3>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve created a shortlist of potential influencers, it\u2019s time to reach out with your pitch. Start by introducing your company, sharing what you appreciate about the influencer\u2019s personal brand, and explaining why you think you\u2019d be the right fit to work together.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/holiday-influencer-marketing-example-merricksart.webp\" alt=\"example of holiday influencer partnership with target\" width=\"718\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87076\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/holiday-influencer-marketing-example-merricksart.webp 718w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/holiday-influencer-marketing-example-merricksart-480x400.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 718px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reel\/DBaPI_qM4D9\/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Be specific about your needs.

People who don\u2019t know you might be hesitant to pay for your product right away, but they\u2019re far more likely to give you a chance if you\u2019re offering a freebie.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/holiday-influencer-marketing-example-mokosh.webp\" alt=\"holiday influencer marketing example from Mokosh\" width=\"889\" height=\"565\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87078\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/holiday-influencer-marketing-example-mokosh.webp 889w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/holiday-influencer-marketing-example-mokosh-480x305.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 889px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Organic skincare brand <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CznIXA8PQ9f\/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mokosh<\/a> partnered with wellness influencer Amy Crawford to give away some of its new products.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Consider giving away your hero product or a sample-sized set of products that are most representative of your brand.

Provide your influencer partner with a specific discount or promotional code, which their followers can enter at checkout on your website.<\/p>\n<p>This allows you to offer something tailored to this influencer\u2019s audience, whether it\u2019s a special discount or a free gift included with anything their followers buy.<\/p>\n<p>It also gives your team the opportunity to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/08\/attribution-models\">attribute sales<\/a> to your influencer marketing campaign. When new customers enter an influencer\u2019s promo code on your site, you\u2019ll know it was the influencer\u2019s content that brought them to you.<\/p>\n<h3>Live selling<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019ve ever watched QVC or HSN, you\u2019re familiar with the concept of live selling. A host showcases a set of items one by one and invites viewers to purchase the products.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/holiday-influencer-marketing-campaign-example-lizzo.webp\" alt=\"holiday influencer marketing example from lizzo\" width=\"718\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87079\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/holiday-influencer-marketing-campaign-example-lizzo.webp 718w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/holiday-influencer-marketing-campaign-example-lizzo-480x400.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 718px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>In a similar vein of selling, pop superstar Lizzo often hops onto her Instagram to try on products from her clothing brand, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reel\/DBMGt2wvwKz\/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Yitty<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Today, brands and influencers have reimagined this approach for the digital era with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/social-selling\">live selling<\/a> on social media. By going live on Instagram or TikTok, brands show off products in real-time, engage with prospective buyers, and direct viewers to the brand\u2019s website to buy.<\/p>\n<p>You can undertake this approach on your own via your brand\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/11\/most-popular-social-media-platforms\">social channel<\/a>, or you may tap an influencer to go live with you. This is a more involved influencer tactic and might be best for influencers who have a proven track record with your business.<\/p>\n<h3>Brand-influencer collaboration<\/h3>\n<p>To tap into the popularity of your brand and your influencer partner&#8217;s following, consider launching a collaboration for the holidays.<\/p>\n<p>Brand-influencer collaborations are a more advanced type of influencer partnership, so this is another tactic that might be best for an influencer you already know, like, and trust.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/holiday-influencer-marketing-brand-partnership-example.webp\" alt=\"holiday influencer marketing brand partnership example\" width=\"719\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87080\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/holiday-influencer-marketing-brand-partnership-example.webp 719w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/holiday-influencer-marketing-brand-partnership-example-480x400.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 719px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reel\/Cqqb1tKs50_\/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>These collaborations can be fruitful for you and the influencer you work with. They can be the basis of a longer-term partnership if initial sales are successful and you choose to continue (or even expand) your collaboration.<\/p>\n<h3>In-person event<\/h3>\n<p>If your broader holiday marketing plans involve hosting a live event, inviting an influencer to promote it and attend on the day is another tactic to try.<\/p>\n<p>Here, it\u2019s essential to select an influencer who you know has sway with your target audience. You want their presence at your event to entice your followers to actually show up.<\/p>\n<p>This is also a more involved influencer campaign. It requires the influencer to promote the event in advance and engage your audience at the event. What does that in-person appearance look like? Are they simply attending and mingling with guests, or will they have a more formal role? Perhaps they take selfies with fans or sign their book or product.<\/p>\n<h3>Unboxing<\/h3>\n<p>Unboxing videos are wildly popular in the influencer arena. In them, an influencer walks through the entire process of opening a shipment from a brand, complete with narration of their inner monologue throughout.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/unboxing-holiday-influencer-marketing-example.webp\" alt=\"holiday influencer marketing example of unboxing video\" width=\"720\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-87081\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/unboxing-holiday-influencer-marketing-example.webp 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/unboxing-holiday-influencer-marketing-example-480x399.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reel\/DBTqv43u3Eh\/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like your influencer partner to create an unboxing video, plan to send them some goodies you\u2019d like to sell during this holiday season.
