Emphasize Benefits Over Features<\/h2>\n<p>One of the most common mistakes companies make with their web copy is spending too much time talking about how great they are. While it\u2019s understandable to want to highlight the accomplishments, distinctions, and aspects of your organization that make it great, this is not why your visitors came to your site.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve said it before, but I\u2019ll say it again \u2013 <strong>people don\u2019t care about your company, they only care about how your company can solve their problems.<\/strong><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/website-copy-i-dont-care.jpg\" alt=\"Website copy I don't care rainbow illustration\" width=\"504\" height=\"315\" \/><\/div>\n<p>That\u2019s not to say that <em>none<\/em> of your visitors care about your company. Some, like <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/24\/brand-advocacy-paid-social\">your fiercely loyal brand evangelists<\/a>, may in fact care about your company quite deeply. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that most visitors are looking for a solution to a very real problem.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/21\/features-vs-benefits\">the differences between benefit-driven copy and feature-driven copy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Feature-Driven Copy<\/h3>\n<p>The screenshot below was taken from the Infinity website.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/website-copy-infiniti-features-example.png\" alt=\"Website copy Infinity rear parking sensor illustration\" width=\"1004\" height=\"610\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As you can see, this particular page tells the reader about Infiniti\u2019s rear-view camera and proximity sensor technology, and features several high-resolution images showing this tech in action.<\/p>\n<p>This is all well and good, but the copy \u2013 and the overall framing \u2013 doesn\u2019t mention any benefits explicitly. You could argue that the benefits of this technology are obvious or implied; having a 360-degree field of vision around the entirety of the vehicle will definitely make parallel parking easier, but the copy doesn\u2019t <em>tell<\/em> us that; we\u2019re left to <em>assume<\/em> what the benefits of these features are.<\/p>\n<h3>Benefit-Driven Copy<\/h3>\n<p>The screenshot below is taken from Slack\u2019s website.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/website-copy-slack-benefits-example.jpg\" alt=\"Website copy Slack benefits illustration\" width=\"800\" height=\"415\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As a communications platform, Slack could have focused on the bells and whistles that people like about Slack, such as private chat rooms, emoji responses, and the service\u2019s many integrations. However, Slack knows that its ideal customers aren\u2019t interested in that \u2013 at least, not as much. No, Slack\u2019s potential users want to save time and hassle, which is why Slack\u2019s primarily benefit-driven copy is so <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/13\/persuasive-ads\">persuasive<\/a>. Who wouldn\u2019t want to receive almost 50% fewer emails or spend 25% less time in meetings?<\/p>\n<p>By leading with the benefits, Slack is answering the user\u2019s most important question \u2013 <em>how will this make my life better or easier?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Emphasizing the benefits of your products or services doesn\u2019t stop you from mentioning features completely \u2013 it\u2019s just a simple matter of priorities. By all means include copy that tells visitors how great your products are, but don\u2019t do so at the expense of explaining clearly and concisely why using your products or services will make visitors\u2019 lives better.<\/p>\n<h3>How this improves your website copy<\/h3>\n<p>By showing visitors exactly how your offerings will make their lives better.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Use The Voice of the Customer<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/31\/brand-voice\">Tone and style<\/a> are crucial when it comes to website copy, as they define the voice of your brand across multiple channels. However, as important as style and tone can be in establishing and maintaining editorial consistency, we can take it one step further to serve as a powerfully persuasive way to reach prospective customers with your copy, known as the \u201cvoice of the customer.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>What Is the Voice of the Customer?<\/h3>\n<p>As Brad McMillen explains in <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/11\/voice-of-the-customer\">his excellent primer on the technique<\/a>, the voice of the customer is a technique commonly used in market research, which \u201cfocuses on customers\u2019 (and prospects\u2019) wants and needs, then prioritizes them into a hierarchical structure before prioritizing them in terms of relative importance and satisfaction with current alternatives.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, VOC is a way to describe your customers\u2019 experiences with and expectations for your products or services in their own language.<\/p>\n<p>What does this mean? Let\u2019s take a look.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/website-copy-freshbooks-voice-of-the-customer.jpg\" alt=\"Website copy FreshBooks voice of the customer example\" width=\"800\" height=\"453\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>An example of web copy written using the voice of the customer.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>You can find examples of your customers&#8217; real language in a number of different ways; for example, reading customer reviews and conducting surveys are two of the best ways to gather this data, as they provide customers with ample opportunity to tell you about their problems in their own words.<\/p>\n<p>Before we can <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/18\/beginners-guide-to-target-markets\">create a profile<\/a> to begin crafting our voice of the customer, we need to identify several key data points, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The problems that frustrate people who could benefit from your products or services<\/li>\n<li>What they would like to see as a potential solution<\/li>\n<li>Customer desires and expectations for companies like yours<\/li>\n<li>Powerful or <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/19\/customer-testimonial-examples\">memorable quotes based on actual user experiences<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Identifying common pain points should be among the first things to look for in your customer research data. This likely includes the frustrations that are common in your industry; think labyrinthine automated customer service helplines, hidden fees or opaque pricing structures, lack of competition, that kind of thing.<\/p>\n<p>Following on from this, you should identify the things your customers want in a company or service provider like yours, such as responsive customer assistance from an actual person, or a simple, easily understood pricing structure.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have this data, you can write copy that addresses each of these elements in order of importance. All the information on your site \u2013 from <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/27\/guide-to-about-us-pages\">your About page<\/a> to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/07\/ecommerce-sales-product-pages\">individual product descriptions<\/a> \u2013 should address one of the dimensions you identified in your market research. This means that, wherever a user happens to be on your site (or within <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/12\/06\/sales-funnel-stages\">the traditional marketing funnel<\/a>), your copy is speaking to something that your prospective users have identified as a priority for them.<\/p>\n<p>In the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/14\/website-examples\"> website example<\/a> above from FreshBooks, the copy mirrors common customer pain points, such as the time-intensive nature of some bookkeeping workflows, as well as the solution that these customers want, which is simplified, streamlined accounting software that lets them get on with actually running their business.<\/p>\n<h3>How this improves your website copy<\/h3>\n<p>By showing visitors your speak their language, you&#8217;re on their level, and you understand their problems.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Conduct Customer Surveys to Determine Brand Values<\/h2>\n<p>These days, many companies have jumped firmly on the \u201ccorporate values\u201d bandwagon in an attempt to attract top talent. However, brand values aren\u2019t just what you <em>say<\/em> they are \u2013 they\u2019re just as much a byproduct of how your customers and audience views your business. How can you discover what values people associate with your brand? By conducting customer surveys.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/website-copy-survey-concept-illustration.jpg\" alt=\"Website copy customer survey illustration\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lynda.com\/Business-Skills-tutorials\/Using-Customer-Surveys-Improve-Service\/191341-2.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Lynda.com<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Similar to the market research you conducted to gather data to create the voice of the customer, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/10\/best-online-survey-tools\">surveys and questionnaires<\/a> are an excellent way to learn how people perceive your brand with regard to brand values. Just as there is often a considerable disconnect between how we <em>think<\/em> users behave and how they <em>actually<\/em> behave, there can sometimes be a similar gap between the brand values you think your company exemplifies and how prospective customers actually see your company.<\/p>\n<p>At the heart of this process is a concept known as \u201cbrand attributes.\u201d This refers to the characteristics that people associate with your brand. For example, philanthropy and charitable giving is a brand attribute of companies that have embraced <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/20\/ethical-marketing\">ethical marketing<\/a>, such as TOMS shoes. Similarly, glamour and opulence are brand attributes commonly associated with brands such as Rolex or Swarovski.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/localiq-grader?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Is your website doing the job? Get an instant SEO and online presence audit with the free LocaliQ website grader.<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Conducting Brand Value Research<\/h3>\n<p>One of the greatest challenges of conducting brand value research is that it is primarily qualitative, meaning that the responses necessary to create this kind of profile are often much more in-depth and personal to the person taking the survey. Quantitative research, on the other hand, usually relies on larger data sets often involving standardized questions, typically presented as yes\/no or agree\/disagree scenarios or multiple choice questions.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/website-copy-qualitative-research-concept.jpg\" alt=\"Website copy qualitative research concept illustration\" width=\"600\" height=\"298\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This presents both a challenge and an opportunity. Although this type of qualitative research can be tremendously valuable, it\u2019s also significantly more time-consuming to gather than quantitative research data, and it asks a great deal more of your respondents. To offset this, many companies offer incentives such as discounts, coupons, freebies, and other goodies to tempt people into completing these surveys.<\/p>\n<p>However you decide to structure your questionnaires, consider the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don\u2019t just ask respondents which brands they like \u2013 ask them <em>why<\/em> they like those brands<\/li>\n<li>Invite participants to explain how their perceive those brands and the characteristics they share<\/li>\n<li>Ask speculative questions about not only the brand attributes your audience already associates with your brand, but the attributes they <em>want<\/em> to associate with your brand in the future<\/li>\n<li>Embrace negative feedback \u2013 it can be just as valuable (if not more so) than positive feedback<\/li>\n<li>Ask open-ended questions that give respondents ample opportunity to answer<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>A Real-World Brand Values Case Study<\/h3>\n<p>Fortunately for you, WordStream recently conducted this research for our own use, so I can show you exactly what this process looks like.<\/p>\n<p>We asked respondents to select five brand attributes that they associate with the WordStream brand. Here\u2019s what they told us:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/website-copy-wordstream-brand-attributes.png\" alt=\"Website copy WordStream brand attributes\" width=\"502\" height=\"441\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As you can see, the top five attributes respondents associated with WordStream are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Knowledgeable<\/li>\n<li>Helpful<\/li>\n<li>Educational<\/li>\n<li>Influential<\/li>\n<li>Friendly<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This data was not only immensely useful to us, but also very rewarding. Our aim is to make digital marketing and PPC accessible to businesses of all sizes \u2013 small businesses in particular \u2013 by providing valuable, actionable, and insightful content. The participants\u2019 responses tell us that we\u2019re succeeding in this goal, which is awesome.<\/p>\n<p>We didn\u2019t stop there, however. We also asked participants which attributes they want to associate with the WordStream brand in the future:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/website-copy-wordstream-desired-brand-attributes.png\" alt=\"Website copy WordStream desired brand attributes\" width=\"515\" height=\"443\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This is almost as revealing as our initial results. Based on these responses, we know that the top five brand attributes people want to associate with WordStream in the future are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creative<\/li>\n<li>Trustworthy<\/li>\n<li>Influential<\/li>\n<li>Helpful<\/li>\n<li>Friendly\/Educational<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This tells us several things. For one, people want to see WordStream as a creative brand; we like to think we\u2019re on our way, but it\u2019s clear we still have room to improve. Secondly, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/27\/trust-signals\">trust remains a highly desirable brand attribute<\/a>, and it\u2019s one that we\u2019re constantly striving to cultivate. Finally, this data tells us that what we\u2019re doing is working and that we need to not only diversify and branch out into more creative avenues, but also that we need to continue to develop the influential, helpful, and friendly\/educational brand values people already associate with the WordStream brand.<\/p>\n<p>In just two slides of actual audience response data, we\u2019ve gained incredible insight into how our audience perceives us, highlighting how useful and actionable this kind of market research data can be.<\/p>\n<h3>How this improves your website copy<\/h3>\n<p>By ensuring that your writers reflect the brand values that your valued customers want to see on your site.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Create a House Style Guide to Establish Brand Voice<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019ve probably heard of news agencies such as The Associated Press, or AP. The AP began as a newswire service, meaning that it provided newspapers around the world with syndicated news content produced in part by regional reporters known as stringers who work exclusively for news agencies rather than newspapers themselves.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/website-copy-ap-style-tweet.jpg\" alt=\"Website copy AP style headline with corrections\" width=\"599\" height=\"253\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>TFW an Associated Press story doesn\u2019t adhere to AP style.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Since the AP was founded long before the advent of online content, space in newspapers was (and still is) at a premium, meaning no space \u2013 typically measured in column inches \u2013 could be wasted. This necessary brevity resulted in the creation of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apstylebook.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the AP Stylebook<\/a>, a bible for journalists and copyeditors alike that states how certain things should be written and formatted.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, your own brand style guide doesn&#8217;t need to be as detailed as the style guides that newspapers use. Instead, you want to use the brand values you established in the last exercise to create some guidelines for all your content writers and creators to follow. This can help them make decisions like how formal to be, and whether it&#8217;s ever OK to swear (say, on your blog).<\/p>\n<h3>Getting Started with an In-House Style Guide<\/h3>\n<p>The first thing you need to do when creating an in-house style guide is to meet with your editorial team and relevant stakeholders and identify the priorities to be addressed by the style guide.<\/p>\n<p>Voice and tone have an incredible impact on the entire experience of using your site, so it\u2019s important to settle on an appropriate brand voice for your company that aligns with the business goals of your copy and content.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/styleguide.mailchimp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MailChimp has a particularly good in-house style guide<\/a> that covers a range of content types including technical documentation, social media content, general copy, and also features <a href=\"https:\/\/styleguide.mailchimp.com\/voice-and-tone\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a section dedicated to voice and tone<\/a>. For example, it includes this list of guidelines for how to nail the MailChimp voice:<\/p>\n<p><em>One way to think of our voice is to compare what it is to what it isn\u2019t. MailChimp\u2019s voice is:<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Fun but not silly<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>Confident but not cocky<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>Smart but not stodgy<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>Informal but not sloppy<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>Helpful but not overbearing<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>Expert but not bossy<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>Weird but not inappropriate<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This is an excellent resource for marketers hoping to create their own style guides, and should give you an idea of the kind of things a solid style guide should cover.<\/p>\n<h3>How this improves your website copy<\/h3>\n<p>By establishing brand standards that all your writers can reference for a consistent user experience.<\/p>\n<h2>5. A\/B Test Copy on High-Value Pages<\/h2>\n<p>Nobody knows your customers better than you do, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should gamble by making decisions based on how you think your visitors will behave. Just as you would (or should) <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/06\/16\/ab-testing-tips\">test crucial elements of your campaigns<\/a> such as landing pages, you should be regularly A\/B testing the copy on your highest-value pages.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/website-copy-ab-test-concept.jpg\" alt=\"Website copy A\/B test concept\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Not All Copy Is Created Equal<\/h3>\n<p>Before we go any further, it\u2019s important to mention that even if you have the resources to do so, it\u2019s probably unnecessary to A\/B test every single word of copy on your site \u2013 you just need to focus on the pages that really bring home the bacon. Maybe your product overview page has a killer conversion rate, or maybe it\u2019s your FAQ page or product documentation. Whatever your strongest pages are, those are the pages you should be testing.<\/p>\n<p>Some web copy elements you might want to test could include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Questions versus statements in headlines<\/li>\n<li>Headline length<\/li>\n<li>Short-form versus long-form copy<\/li>\n<li>Language and\/or word choice (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/22\/power-words\">power words<\/a> anyone?)<\/li>\n<li>Points of view (i.e. first-person versus third-person)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Actually <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/27\/ab-tests\">conducting an A\/B test on your web copy<\/a> is largely similar to the way you\u2019d split-test pretty much anything else. Begin by identifying those high-value pages <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/15\/google-analytics-tips\">using Google Analytics<\/a> or similar data, then create two versions of the page, each with its own unique copy. Send approximately 50% of your total traffic to the control version of the page (the original page as it exists today), and send the other half to the variant (the page with the new copy). Allow the test sufficient time to ensure you\u2019re working with a statistically significant data set, and see which page converted better. Easy, right? Well, kinda.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/website-copy-ab-test-concept-2.png\" alt=\"Website copy A\/B test concept\" width=\"1260\" height=\"716\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via <\/em><em><a href=\"https:\/\/vwo.com\/features\/\">VWO<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Since you want to figure out which copy performs more strongly, you need to test copy that actually asks the user to do something. This could be a prompt to download a guide, sign up for a free trial, subscribe to a newsletter \u2013 some kind of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/07\/call-to-action-marketing\">clearly defined call to action<\/a>. If you don\u2019t focus on actionable copy with a true call to action, it\u2019s harder to determine if the variant of your copy is any better than the control page. However, since your highest-value pages are likely already associated with a defined conversion pathway, this shouldn\u2019t be an issue but it\u2019s worth bearing in mind.<\/p>\n<h3>How this improves your website copy<\/h3>\n<p>By giving you data, rather than assumptions, on what copy really resonates with potential buyers.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Think About Intent At All Times and Write From the Perspective of the User<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve talked about <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/30\/commercial-intent-keywords\">commercial intent<\/a> before (as well as the wider topic of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/26\/intent-marketing\">intent marketing<\/a>), but it amazes me how few websites seem to factor in user intent into their web copy.<\/p>\n<h3>What Is User Intent?<\/h3>\n<p>User intent refers to what a given person <em>intends<\/em> to do when they reach your site. Sometimes this intent leads to a clearly defined action \u2013 such as buying something \u2013 while other times it may not.<\/p>\n<p>Although the underlying problems your users are trying to solve are likely quite diverse, there are only a few reasons a person visits a website. These align with one of the three primary types of search \u2013 informational, navigational, and transactional \u2013 and include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>To learn about the industry in which your company operates<\/li>\n<li>To learn more about service offerings in your industry<\/li>\n<li>To learn more about your company in particular<\/li>\n<li>To comparison shop and compare products, offers, prices etc.<\/li>\n<li>To buy something<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Obviously, it\u2019s impossible to account for every user\u2019s intent in your web copy, and you definitely shouldn\u2019t attempt to. However, considering user intent should inform every aspect of your web copy.<\/p>\n<h3>How to Write Web Copy with User Intent in Mind<\/h3>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re writing the copy for <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/websites-landing-pages\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">your website<\/a> yourself or hiring someone to do it for you, it\u2019s crucial that you consider user intent from the outset.<\/p>\n<p>Picture yourself in your prospective customers\u2019 shoes and ask questions about your copy:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is it immediately obvious what your company sells or does?<\/li>\n<li>Is your web copy benefit-driven, and are those benefits clear?<\/li>\n<li>Does your website assume prior industry knowledge on the part of the visitor? Is this knowledge necessary to understand and navigate your site?<\/li>\n<li>Does your site\u2019s navigation allow different kinds of users at different stages of the funnel to quickly and easily access the information they need?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Considering user intent can be challenging, because it can be difficult to truly divorce yourself \u2013 and your considerable industry knowledge and expertise \u2013 from the reality of the experience of using your site. To this end, it may be worth conducting qualitative market research by asking laypersons who aren\u2019t familiar with your business to use your site and provide feedback. This can highlight gaps in both your web copy and your awareness of these gaps, allowing you to craft web copy that better addresses these issues.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/website-copy-user-intent-diagram.jpg\" alt=\"Website copy user intent diagram\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.superxgh.com\/i-lost-31-of-my-search-traffic-but-my-sales-went-up-by-73\/\"><em>SuperX Growth Hackers<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Writing from the perspective of the user, on the other hand, is a little easier than trying to preemptively solve for user intent. Whenever you\u2019re writing any copy \u2013 or content \u2013 ask yourself whether your copy follows our variant of Vonnegut\u2019s rule: does every single sentence of copy reveal some useful information about your products or services, or advance your visitors\u2019 understanding of what you do?<\/p>\n<p>Many people mistakenly assume that focusing on user intent or benefit-driven copy means there\u2019s no room to talk about their company\u2019s achievements. This isn\u2019t true at all \u2013 you just have to consider where and when to wax lyrical about how great you are.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you\u2019d never heard of a company and weren\u2019t familiar with their goods, you probably wouldn\u2019t care about how that company is a great place to work, or how many awards it has won \u2013 none of this information answers your questions or helps you solve your problems.<\/p>\n<p>If, however, you\u2019ve already done some research into the company, like its products, and can visualize how patronizing this company will make your life better \u2013 essentially at any point during or beyond <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/04\/nurture-marketing\">the \u201cconsideration\u201d stage of the classic sales funnel<\/a> \u2013 information about how great the company is might be a powerfully persuasive tool. <em>That\u2019s<\/em> when you want to hit your visitors with your innumerable accolades.<\/p>\n<p>It all comes back to thinking about the user and what <em>they<\/em> want, rather than what <em>you<\/em> want.<\/p>\n<h3>How this improves your website copy<\/h3>\n<p>By giving your visitors what they want to see, increasing their satisfaction and encouraging them to stick around.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Include Statistics, Quotes, and Original Data to Increase Your Site\u2019s Authority<\/h2>\n<p>Not so long ago, blogs and bloggers were rightly seen as amateur ventures whose passion and enthusiasm were faultless, but whose actual credibility and authority were suspect. Not so today, when some blogs and independent bloggers have become on par (or even surpassed) \u201ctraditional\u201d journalism and media outlets.<\/p>\n<p>However, the little guys still have to work harder than the bigger players, and one of the best things you can do to establish (or enhance) your credibility and authority is to use <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/14\/marketing-data\">statistics, quotes, and original data<\/a> in your web copy and content.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/website-copy-wordstream-original-research.png\" alt=\"Website copy WordStream original data\" width=\"737\" height=\"473\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>An example of WordStream\u2019s original research data.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>One of the reasons that the inclusion of statistics, quotes from industry experts, and original data is so persuasive is because it strengthens the points you make in your copy considerably. It\u2019s one thing to make a vague assertion about, say, Facebook\u2019s growing ad revenue, but it\u2019s another thing to say that Facebook\u2019s total revenue increased by 56% and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/05\/social-media-marketing-statistics\">ad revenue increased by 59% in 2016<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This technique works so well because it\u2019s an established journalistic convention, and readers expect this kind of citation in their content. However, it\u2019s not without its downsides.<\/p>\n<h3>The Dangers of Overreliance on Third-Party Data<\/h3>\n<p>There is no doubt that including statistics, quotes, and original or third-party data in your copy can significantly increase the authority of your site. Overreliance on this kind of data, however, can have a detrimental effect.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/website-copy-how-many-citations-is-too-many.jpg\" alt=\"Website copy how many citations is too many PhD comics\" width=\"465\" height=\"373\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/phdcomics.com\/comics\/archive.php?comicid=1821\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Jorge Cham\/PhD Comics<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll already know what I\u2019m talking about if you\u2019ve ever read a blog post in which every other statement is cited or begins with, \u201cAccording to\u2026\u201d Relying too heavily on cited stats \u2013 no matter how well-sourced or relevant \u2013 can dilute the authority of your copy because it suggests either an inability or reluctance to make an assertive, original statement. People don\u2019t want to read copy or content that reads like a book report written by a nervous high-school student \u2013 they want to hear original thoughts and opinions that challenge their ideas or help them learn more about a topic.<\/p>\n<p>One way to offset this without losing the authority that comes with including and correctly citing statistical data is to use original research. Here at WordStream, we devote a great deal of time and energy to producing <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/29\/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks\">original data and research<\/a>. This isn\u2019t just a ploy to increase our authority; it\u2019s a way to reinforce our copy and content with research that other publications want to link to.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/website-copy-wordstream-original-research-2.png\" alt=\"Website copy WordStream original data\" width=\"643\" height=\"392\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Granted, creating original research requires sufficient data to draw from (which we\u2019re lucky to have in abundance, something not every business has) or the financial means to commission professional researchers to produce original data, but as far as assets go, it\u2019s hard to beat in terms of return on investment. Our original research has generated millions of unique visits and hundreds of inbound links over the past several years, making it one of our most consistently valuable and strongest-performing content assets.<\/p>\n<h3>How this improves your website copy<\/h3>\n<p>By making your brand more trustworthy and dependable.<\/p>\n<h2>Better Copy, Better Results<\/h2>\n<p>Writing web copy that converts like gangbusters is a lot harder than it looks.
