While national SEO focuses more on ranking in searches across the country, local SEO prioritizes appearing on SERPs in a specific location. This strategy relies on marketing your brand, products, and services to local leads and customers.<\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/12\/27\/eleven-seo-tips-for-local-search-optimization\">Optimizing your local SEO<\/a> means more website traffic, leads, and conversions since the strategy is more relevant to your base of local customers. Think of this focused strategy as a way to help you compete more effectively against larger national brands that have unlimited resources to spend. By focusing on specific local-SEO to-dos, you can neutralize the advantage of bigger brands that routinely optimize for broader keywords and rely on brand recognition, instead of value propositions, to bring in traffic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Further, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reviewtrackers.com\/local-search\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">35% of all search traffic is local<\/a> according to an estimate in a 2017 ReviewTrackers\u2019 study.

Optimize for Voice Search<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/04\/10\/voice-search-statistics-2018\">Voice search<\/a> will grow rapidly in the coming years. Therefore, in <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/local-marketing-lab\/seo\/\">local SEO<\/a>, it\u2019s vital to optimize for how people ask questions when they speak into devices, as opposed to how they type out their searches.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Essentially, your customers use more long-tail keywords when doing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesagencycouncil\/2018\/08\/20\/hey-google-how-do-i-optimize-for-voice-search\/#9b9cb8e38000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">voice searches<\/a> compared with regular search. Because of this, you\u2019ll also have to adjust the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/search-engine-optimization\/\">SEO<\/a> of your content to fit the more conversational tone of someone speaking. For example, you\u2019ll want to account for the traditional question starters (who, what, when, where, why and how).<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/local-seo-voice-search.jpg\" alt=\"local SEO voice search\" width=\"810\" height=\"540\" \/><\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s also crucial to consider user intent when <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/14\/google-voice-search\">optimizing for voice<\/a>, as these searches are most often performed when the user needs a specific piece of information. If they\u2019re baking and ask Alexa to convert tablespoons to cups, they\u2019re expecting a quick and useful answer. If a potential customer uses voice search to ask what your business\u2019s hours are, this information should also be readily available<\/p>\n<h2>4. Create Content Based on Local News Stories or Events<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s nothing quite like authoring content that speaks or relates directly to a local issue to grab your local customers\u2019 attention.<\/p>\n<p>Some strategies include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Writing blog posts around local news stories, activities, or events<\/li>\n<li>Creating videos about local charities or causes that your business supports<\/li>\n<li>Setting up location-specific webpages on your website with high-quality local content if you serve different parts of a region\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/local-seo-voice-search-newspaper.jpg\" alt=\"local SEO voice search\" width=\"811\" height=\"541\" \/><\/div>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/photos\/F7n6gixbJK0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image from Keenan Constance<\/a><\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a local <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/16\/real-estate-marketing\">real estate business<\/a>. You can create different pages, one for each of your locations, where you can feature hyperlocal content around news events or changes in the local real-estate market. This strategy could also help you get ranked for each specific location.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Optimize Your Website for Mobile<\/h2>\n<p>A 2018 Stone Temple study that looked at 2017\u2019s mobile vs. desktop trends found that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stonetemple.com\/mobile-vs-desktop-usage-study\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the shift to mobile is occurring faster than expected<\/a>. Mobile visits to websites grew from 57% in 2016 to 63% in 2017, and the overall visits to websites from desktop shrunk from 43% in 2016 to just 37% in 2017.<\/p>\n<p>Another 2017 study from Acquisio determined that traffic from local searches can be especially lucrative, with a remarkable <a href=\"https:\/\/www.acquisio.com\/blog\/local\/75-local-searches-store-visits\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">75% of all mobile searches that exhibit local intent actually producing in-store, offline visits within 24 hours<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This confirms that you have to optimize your website for mobile to be a player in local SEO (and, really, for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/28\/technical-seo\">good SEO<\/a> period).<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/local-seo-search_0.jpg\" alt=\"local SEO search\" width=\"945\" height=\"630\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"http:\/\/xezxeh_fieu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image from Yura Fresh<\/a><\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Here are some tips to achieve this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure your website loads quickly (no more than three seconds)<\/li>\n<li>Use bigger fonts that are easy to read<\/li>\n<li>Use images and copy sparingly, conveying only the information you need (no room for filler on a mobile screen!)<\/li>\n<li>Ensure intuitive UI for great UX<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>6. Hone in on Local Keywords<\/h2>\n<p>Your keywords should be relevant to local customers. It only makes sense, doesn\u2019t it?<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s own <a href=\"https:\/\/ads.google.com\/intl\/en_ca\/home\/tools\/keyword-planner\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Keyword Planner<\/a> lets you filter keyword searches based on location so you get an idea of the popular search terms for a given region. This lets you create a list of locally relevant keywords to target. Once you have them, they should make appearances in your site\u2019s meta content, copy, and URLs.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/local-seo-google-keyword-planner.jpg\" alt=\"local SEO Google keyword planner\" width=\"892\" height=\"581\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/serps.com\/library\/guide-google-keyword-planner-seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image from Serps<\/a><\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Also, include mentions of region-specific landmarks and hotspots in your content. For instance, if your local restaurant serves dinner in downtown Seattle, include references to \u201cdining by the Space Needle\u201d or \u201cjust steps from the Space Needle\u201d on your site.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RELATED:<\/strong> Find out <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/local-keyword-research\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how to do local keyword research<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Use Location Pages or a Location-Specific \u201cAbout Us\u201d Page<\/h2>\n<p>Location pages are a must if your business has more than one location in an area. These pages need to provide the following, at a minimum:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Store hours<\/li>\n<li>Name, address, and phone number<\/li>\n<li>Individualized descriptions<\/li>\n<li>Testimonials<\/li>\n<li>Promotions<\/li>\n<li>Parking availability<\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/12\/03\/google-maps-marketing\">Google Maps<\/a> attached to each location page<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Take care when you have multiple locations, because you need to create unique content for each page.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/local-seo-location-based-about-us-page.jpg\" alt=\"local SEO location-based &quot;About Us&quot; page\" width=\"1067\" height=\"642\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.crazyegg.com\/blog\/optimize-local-search\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image from Crazy Egg<\/a><\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p>If you only have one location, creating an \u201cAbout Us\u201d page that focuses on local, relevant information is essential. For example, if you have a florist shop, your \u201cAbout Us\u201d page is the perfect spot to mention your shop\u2019s involvement in supplying the flowers for any parades in your town or city.<\/p>\n<h2>8. Take Advantage of Online Business Directories<\/h2>\n<p>Online business directories are websites like Yelp, Foursquare, MapQuest, and YellowPages, just to name a few. There are <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/blog\/tabid\/6307\/bid\/10322\/the-ultimate-list-50-local-business-directories.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">many more<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Not only will getting your business name, address, and phone number into these directories help visibility, but it\u2019ll also boost your local SEO.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/local-seo-foursquare.jpg\" alt=\"local SEO foursquare\" width=\"1565\" height=\"640\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.programmableweb.com\/news\/foursquare-launches-places-api-start-ups\/2018\/04\/12\">Image from ProgrammableWeb<\/a><\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/listings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">company listing<\/a> should include the following basics:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Business name\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/08\/business-name-ideas\">(creative business name ideas here!)<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Address\u00a0and phone number<\/li>\n<li>A backlink to your website<\/li>\n<li>A thorough description of your business<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These should be consistent across all directories.<\/p>\n<h2>9. Focus on Link Signals (Get High-Quality Backlinks)<\/h2>\n<p>According to Moz\u2019s 2017 Local Search Ranking Factors study, <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/local-search-ranking-factors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">link signals are the first- and second-most important factors<\/a> for local pack (or snack pack) results and for localized organic results, respectively. Link signals are backlinks pointing to your site.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s vital to get links to boost your local SEO, but their quality is important.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/local-seo-serp.jpg\" alt=\"Local SEO SERP\" width=\"753\" height=\"704\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Here are some tips on getting high-quality <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2010\/04\/01\/build-amazing-backlinks\">backlinks<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create high-quality content on your site so others want to link to your content<\/li>\n<li>Guest blog on reputable sites with a high domain authority<\/li>\n<li>Engage with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/21\/social-media-influencers\">local influencers on social media<\/a> or by email to get them to link back to you<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>10. Create a Dedicated Webpage for Each Product\/Service You Offer<\/h2>\n<p>While it can be tempting to just lump all of your products or services together in one big page, resist doing so. Instead, dedicate one page to each unique product or service you offer.<\/p>\n<p>Your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/seo\/whats-difference-between-organic-seo-and-local-seo\">local SEO<\/a> juice isn\u2019t as powerful if you lump everything into one page because search engines tend not to see your brand as an authority in one specific area. This lowers your ranking possibilities.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/local-seo-dental-marketing.jpg\" alt=\"Local SEO dental marekting\" width=\"1352\" height=\"899\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If you\u2019re a business without different products or services, but have various locations, simply utilize location-based copy for each page. For instance, \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/30\/dental-marketing-ideas\">dental marketing<\/a>\u201d will become \u201cNew York dental marketing\u201d or \u201cBuffalo <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/31\/facebook-ads-for-dentists\">dental marketing<\/a>.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Local SEO: More Important Than Ever<\/h2>\n<p>SEO changes quite rapidly. You never know when Google will introduce new features on its SERPs for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/01\/google-local-search-trends\">local searches,<\/a> but you can count on these changes coming. That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential to always stay on top of local SEO. By implementing these 10 actionable items, you will ensure that your business doesn\u2019t just take advantage of lucrative local searches but also has a solid foundation when new SEO features are introduced.
