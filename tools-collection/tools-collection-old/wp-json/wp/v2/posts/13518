We can trace the origins of this back to 2014, when Google <a href=\"https:\/\/adwords.googleblog.com\/2014\/08\/close-variant-matching-for-all-exact.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stopped allowing advertisers<\/a> to keep their exact and phrase match keywords from matching to things like accidental plurals and misspellings.<\/p>\n<p>Then, in 2017, Google <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/20\/exact-match-keywords\">further expanded<\/a> the definition of an exact match close variant by allowing your exact match keywords to match to queries that ordered the terms differently or included function words like articles and prepositions.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3d0d78a2-3de6-4d8b-9954-09ec6d49b7e2\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/phrase-match-broad-match-modifier-close-variants-exact-match-changes-2017.png\" alt=\"phrase-match-broad-match-modifier-close-variants-exact-match-update-2017\" width=\"640\" height=\"300\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The common idea behind these decisions is that an ad for dog day care is still relevant to someone who searches \u201cdog day xare\u201d or \u201cday care for dogs.\u201d Though the point of keyword match types is to give advertisers much-needed control over the queries that trigger their ads, Google has seen fit to balance that control with some flexibility.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a difference, however, between <em>accidentally<\/em> misspelling a word and <em>deliberately<\/em> typing a different word altogether. That\u2019s why search marketers were so thrown when Google <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/07\/exact-match-keywords-even-more-variants\">announced<\/a> the further extension of exact match close variants to include <strong>same-meaning words<\/strong>. All of a sudden, a business targeting the exact match keyword [yosemite camping] could have their ads shown for queries like \u201cyosemite campground\u201d and \u201ccamping in yosemite.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7ad78a14-33e1-4960-aaa2-74c3d0ec4eb1\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/phrase-match-broad-match-modifier-clost-variants-exact-match-changes-2018-1.png\" alt=\"phrase-match-broad-match-modifier-close-variants-exact-match-update-2018\" width=\"716\" height=\"302\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Google\u2019s defense of this decision was three-fold:<\/p>\n<ol dir=\"ltr\">\n<li>Even if the <em>semantics<\/em> of a query doesn\u2019t exactly match your keyword, the <em>user intent<\/em> may be all the same.<\/li>\n<li>Loosening the definition of exact match enables businesses to connect with a larger pool of relevant prospects.<\/li>\n<li>Nobody has time to find every single keyword that\u2019s relevant to their business.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The results? A mixed bag. As our own Mark Irvine <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/12\/exact-match-update\">reported<\/a> last November, some advertisers benefited considerably from their heightened exposure on the SERPs\u2014others didn\u2019t. The commonalities across these winners and losers were (1) an increase in the proportion of their impressions and clicks being attributed to close variants and (2) an increase in overall costs.<\/p>\n<p>OK\u2014now that we\u2019ve contextualized today\u2019s announcement, let\u2019s dive deeper into it.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">The extension of same-meaning close variants<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At some point in the next few weeks, your phrase match and broad match modifier keywords will begin matching to search queries that include same-meaning words: synonyms, paraphrases, and the like. Given the importance of this change, a quick refresher is in order:<\/p>\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\n<li>Traditionally, a <strong>phrase match keyword<\/strong> matches to queries that include the entirety of the keyword <em>in its specified order<\/em>. For example, the phrase match keyword \u201cdog day care\u201d is eligible to match to queries like \u201cboston dog day care\u201d and \u201cdog day care costs.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Traditionally, a <strong>broad match modifier keyword<\/strong> matches to queries that include each term specified in the keyword <em>in any order<\/em>. For example, the broad match modifier keyword +dog +day +care is eligible to match to queries like \u201cday care for my dog\u201d and \u201ctake care of my dog during the day.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Up until now, phrase match and broad match modifier keywords have been eligible to show for close variant queries like accidental plurals and misspellings. <strong>Now, like exact match keywords, they\u2019ll also be eligible to show for same-meaning close variants like synonyms and paraphrases.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Google provided an example for each match type in their blog post. Take a look at this one, which illustrates the changes coming to broad match modifier:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"741b65a5-10b8-4bd7-84c7-f45c93cd981a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/phrase-match-broad-match-modifier-close-variants-query-examples_0-1.png\" alt=\"phrase-match-broad-match-modifier-close-variants-example-queries\" width=\"716\" height=\"122\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>And here\u2019s the phrase match example:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"04cbea7a-cae3-454d-8307-9da7bb2d76ac\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/phrase-match-broad-match-modifier-close-variants-query-examples-2.png\" alt=\"phrase-match-broad-match-modifier-close-variants-example-queries-2\" width=\"716\" height=\"122\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You may be wondering: \u201cWait. What if I were already targeting both \u2018lawn mowing services\u2019 and \u2018grass cutting services\u2019 as phrase match keywords? Which keyword would get triggered?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t worry\u2014Google is making the appropriate change to keyword selection preferences. Even if you\u2019re targeting two separate keywords that are synonymous with one another, the semantically relevant one will continue to be entered into the ad auction.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Reactions from WordStream HQ<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Navah Hopkins, WordStream\u2019s services innovation strategist and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/06\/07\/ppc-experts\">one of PPC Hero\u2019s top 25 PPC experts<\/a>, noted that given the limit of 10,000 negatives per campaign, this change makes it difficult if not impossible to protect a true SKAG structure. (SKAGs, or single keyword ad groups, restrict your ad group to a single keyword and a single ad.)<\/p>\n<p>You can\u2019t optimize your ad copy for a single keyword when that keyword is liable to match to a wide range of queries. Instead, Navah advises, \u201cfocus on the themes of your keywords and create copy that speaks to the true pain point of the user.\u201d She added: \u201cThis change is actually quite liberating from a management standpoint as you&#8217;ll have fewer ad groups and campaigns to build.\u00a0Also, it&#8217;s\u00a0yet another signal from the ad networks that health indicator metrics are being depreciated in favor of \u2018We have data\u2014trust us\u2019 metrics (e.g.,\u00a0top of page instead of average position).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I also spoke with Kristina Simonson, who manages our own paid search and social accounts. Here&#8217;s what she had to say:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Considering\u00a0the shift towards automation, I&#8217;m\u00a0not surprised to hear about this update\u2014and honestly, I&#8217;m not mad about it either. As Google points out, 15% of queries are new; unfortunately,\u00a0humans don&#8217;t have the ability to predict brand new queries that a prospect may search on a given day. As the manager of our own account, I&#8217;m\u00a0happy to know that Google will look for opportunities to expand our reach to further relevant queries.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Reactions from around the PPC community<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What do other digital marketers have to say about the news? Generally, they share a concern that the weakening of keyword match types limits control and hinders their ability to optimize their ads according to different types of queries.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"da711957-4da2-439d-848d-03a375e36996\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/phrase-match-broad-match-modifier-close-variants-twitter-reaction-3_0.png\" alt=\"phrase-match-broad-match-modifier-close-variants-melissa-mackey-reaction\" width=\"594\" height=\"308\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There\u2019s that word again: <strong>intent<\/strong>. Indeed, whether the broadening of phrase match and broad match modifier proves beneficial to advertisers will depend on Google\u2019s ability to successfully decipher the intent behind users\u2019 queries. Some, evidently, are skeptical.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"169d189d-172a-49e0-be54-735840352e48\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/phrase-match-broad-match-modifier-close-variants-twitter-reaction-2.png\" alt=\"phrase-match-broad-match-modifier-close-variants-julie-bacchini-reaction\" width=\"593\" height=\"191\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here, \u201cnuance\u201d is synonymous with \u201cintent\u201d\u2014Julie is essentially echoing the sentiment expressed by Melissa in the previous tweet. I\u2019m intrigued by the idea of a \u201cbad match reporting mechanism.\u201d If advertisers had a direct line to Google\u2019s algorithms that they could use to call out misinterpretations of user intent, that would certainly be helpful.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1cd23b7d-e747-4e89-a489-4bd765aaf505\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/phrase-match-broad-match-modifier-close-variants-twitter-reaction-5.jpg\" alt=\"phrase-match-broad-match-modifier-close-variants-jon-kagan-reaction\" width=\"597\" height=\"635\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Though the notion that match types are dead is obviously an exaggeration, Jon has certainly gotten to the heart of the issue: As the divisions between keyword match types become less and less clear, advertisers have less and less control over which queries trigger their ads. True\u2014for some, gaining exposure will lead to more profit overall. But for others, it\u2019ll lead to greater costs and diminished click-through rates.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c5b09557-75dc-49c0-b13b-e1462e613b2b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/phrase-match-broad-match-modifier-close-variants-aaron-levy-reaction.png\" alt=\"phrase-match-broad-match-modifier-close-variants-aaron-levy-tweet\" width=\"594\" height=\"444\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Aaron Levy, for his part, has a much more positive outlook on the situation than some of his peers\u2014one that echoes Mark\u2019s conclusion that last year\u2019s changes to exact match yielded a mixed bag of results. Whereas some will reap the benefits that come with more impressions and higher click volume, others will bear the costs. Which camp you fall into depends on a variety of factors (e.g., goals, industry, colloquialisms, etc.)<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Looking ahead<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As these changes to phrase match and broad match modifier roll out, it\u2019s imperative that you keep an even closer eye on your search terms than usual. Though results will vary across verticals, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll see an uptick in impressions and clicks from users whose queries are irrelevant to your business\u2014that is, an uptick in queries that you should add as negative keywords. As long as you\u2019re vigilant about keeping irrelevant users away from your ads, you should be able to mitigate the potential cost increases that may come with these changes, and focus on the potential upside.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">More broadly, I recommend taking Navah\u2019s advice to heart: Do your best to write ads that\u2014above all else\u2014speak to the unique pain points your prospects are experiencing. Does it become more difficult to do that as the intent behind your keywords and the intent behind the queries <em>triggering<\/em> your keywords grow further apart? Of course. But despite its imperfections, Google is pretty darn good at discerning what users are trying to accomplish. If you do what you can to be helpful and relevant, you\u2019ll be fine.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your phrase match and broad match modifier keywords will now match to same-meaning close variant queries.
