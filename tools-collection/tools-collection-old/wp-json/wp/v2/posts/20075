However, when I check to see if we\u2019ve lost our ranking, we\u2019re still on the first page, or even ranking at #1. So what gives?<\/p>\n<p>I suspected that changes to the Google SERP, such as the introduction of fancy new SERP features, were lowering our <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/10\/google-ctr\">organic click-through rate<\/a> (CTR), so I did a little digging to find out what exactly was going on.<\/p>\n<h2>A note on study methodology<\/h2>\n<p>For this study, we looked at 24 keywords (from our own site) where we\u2019ve maintained the same or very close to the same ranking for about two years (between May 2015 and April 2017) according to Search Console data. In most cases the keyword maintained a #1 ranking, but for some keywords the average ranking for the period is reported as 1.1 or 1.2 due to some ranking flux. Results were not filtered by device or country.<\/p>\n<p>I would characterize the majority of these keywords as informational. Only one of them is clearly commercial (\u201cppc software\u201d) and one is potentially branded or navigational (\u201cfree keyword tool\u201d is ambiguous, since it\u2019s both the name of our tool and a generic phrase). <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/12\/10\/three-types-of-search-queries\">More on what these keyword categories mean here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>And thanks to my smarty-pants colleagues Meg Lister and Josh Brackett, who are approximately 9 million times better at Excel and statistics than me, for helping me analyze this data, and to our new designer Kate Lindsay for pretty-ing up the graphs.<\/p>\n<h2>The upshot: Median CTR is down by 37%<\/h2>\n<p>Looking at all 24 queries on our list, we had an average position change of -0.1% (not significant) and <strong>an average CTR change of -28% (a median change of -37%)<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"936304e4-a2e4-4538-9cb0-a05faa55b64f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/change-in-average-google-organic-ctr-2015-vs-20171-2.jpg\" alt=\"organic search rnaking are worth less in 2017\" width=\"650\" height=\"500\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>CTR only went <em>up<\/em> for three keywords in the set (by 3%, 4%, and 37%).

For these keywords there was an average position change of 0% and a median CTR change of -39%. <strong>That means even with the coveted Featured Snippet, organic CTR for a #1 ranking is lower in 2017 than it was in 2015.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>And it\u2019s not because we\u2019re competing with more ads \u2013 16 of these keywords have no ads on the SERP at all.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c87461eb-ab3d-41ca-9f3b-576d09c9332a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-organic-ctr-change-no-snippet.jpg\" alt=\"ctr for keywords with no featured snippet\" width=\"700\" height=\"500\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>For keywords without a featured snippet (6 of the 24), median CTR change was only -32%. This suggests that the featured snippet is actually associated with a <em>decrease<\/em> in CTR(?!)<\/p>\n<p>This would make sense for simple question-type keywords that can be answered right on the SERP, like \u201chow tall was Abraham Lincoln,\u201d \u201cwhen is the Super Bowl\u201d etc. See also the recent kerfuffle over <a href=\"https:\/\/theoutline.com\/post\/1399\/how-google-ate-celebritynetworth-com\">Celebrity Net Worth<\/a> \u2013 a website that has taken a major hit due to Google\u2019s Featured Snippets making it largely unnecessary to click through to discover what a celebrity is worth.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"e8f9430f-a3ff-4eee-b5cf-55af0d256b55\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/net-worth-featured-snippet.png\" alt=\"featured snippet controversy\" width=\"673\" height=\"410\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>This is why I think it\u2019s so important to answer <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/09\/question-keywords\">COMPLEX questions<\/a> if you want to drive value from Featured Snippets.<\/p>\n<p>But most of the keywords I looked at weren\u2019t simple questions, or phrased as questions at all. So there\u2019s actually no reason to assume that people were looking for a quick answer. For example, two of the keywords were \u201cgreat marketing ideas\u201d and \u201ckeyword strategy.\u201d To me it\u2019s pretty clear that the intent with these is relatively deep; they\u2019re looking for multiple ideas or a complex strategy, not just a definition.<\/p>\n<h2>So why has organic CTR for a #1 ranking fallen?<\/h2>\n<p>Here\u2019s the tricky part: Why is this happening? It\u2019s not immediately obvious.<\/p>\n<h3>Are we losing clicks to ads?<\/h3>\n<p>It would be easy to assume that organic CTR has fallen because Google has increasingly moved to monetize the SERP \u2013 for example, just last year <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/22\/google-kills-off-right-side-ads\">Google increased the number of top ads from three to four<\/a> (while simultaneously removing the right-rail ads).<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"04d4c3dd-191c-4e94-9c2f-7826c635b97b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-removes-right-side-rail-ads.png\" alt=\"no google adwords ads on right rail\" width=\"906\" height=\"860\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Old enough to remember when there were ads there<\/em><\/p>\n<p>However, that change has minimal impact on this keyword set, since only four of the 24 keywords we looked at were triggering ads at all, and of those four, only one triggered four top ads. Two of the keywords triggered just one top ad, and one triggered no top ad but a panel of sponsored results on the right (on desktop).<\/p>\n<p>Incidentally, the keyword that now triggers four ads showed exactly the median drop in CTR (-32%). It wasn\u2019t an outlier in terms of losing clicks to ads.<\/p>\n<p>Long story short, ads are definitely not the whole story here.<\/p>\n<h3>What about other SERP features?<\/h3>\n<p>There were a few cases where the keyword triggered a Featured Snippet but the Featured Snippet wasn\u2019t ours (even though we had the #1 ranking). The Featured Snippet was introduced in 2015 and the prevalence of the feature increased a few times during 2016 (thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dr_pete\">Dr. Pete<\/a> for confirming). According to current <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/mozcast\/features\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MozCast<\/a> data, it now appears on about 15% of queries.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c9ba0965-5415-4455-b6cb-a41e1a9ade78\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/featured-snippets-mozcast-data.png\" alt=\"mozcast serp features\" width=\"480\" height=\"694\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>10 of the keywords also triggered a \u201cPeople also ask\u201d feature (Related Questions), like the below.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"addc48d6-8c9c-4dba-8d64-4d1a4973eeac\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-people-also-ask-feature-ppc-marketing.png\" alt=\"related questions feature google\" width=\"675\" height=\"220\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>In a different industry, we might have seen a lot more features in the results \u2013 images, videos, knowledge panel, local packs, card-style carousels at the top, etc. That wasn\u2019t the case in this particular keyword set.<\/p>\n<p>Now, <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/state-of-searcher-behavior-revealed\">Moz recently published some fascinating data<\/a> (in collaboration with Jumpshot) that reveals <strong>a full third of searches result in no clicks at all<\/strong>. People do a Google search and then click nothing. Says Rand Fishkin:<\/p>\n<p>If we look at all search queries (not just distinct ones), those numbers shift to a straight 60%\/40% split. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to find that over time, we get closer and closer to Google solving half of search queries without a click.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, Rand predicts that CTR will continue to fall even for #1 rankings as Google releases features that make clicking any result unnecessary.<\/p>\n<h3>Is this a mobile problem?<\/h3>\n<p>One possibility for the drop in CTR is that a greater percentage of our site traffic is mobile now than it was 2 years ago \u2013 mobile devices account for about 20% of traffic now, compared to 13% in May 2015.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the May 2015 breakdown:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"e731c295-2d40-408a-999b-fd11e4568f2c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/wordstream-device-breakdown-may-15.png\" alt=\"traffic breakdown by device\" width=\"394\" height=\"297\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>And here\u2019s March 2017:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"81c503e1-21b0-4381-a063-306e8ee3ec6f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/wordstream-mobile-device-breakdown-april-17.png\" alt=\"percentage of mobile traffic\" width=\"401\" height=\"304\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>(As mentioned, I didn\u2019t break the above click-through rate data out by device; I download reports from Search Console monthly, but not device reports, and at this point I can\u2019t go back and get that data from 2015.)<\/p>\n<p>On mobile, organic CTR looks a little different than it does on desktop. Again, according to Moz\/Jumpshot data, organic CTR is lower on mobile devices than on desktop \u2013 Rand says:<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve always suspected CTR on mobile is lower than on desktop, and now it&#8217;s confirmed. For mobile devices, 40.9% of Google searches result in an organic click, 2% in a paid click, and 57.1% in no click at all. For desktop devices, 62.2% of Google searches result in an organic click, 2.8% in a paid click, and 35% in no click.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"9955e633-0e52-45d5-9cf8-a18239923e67\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/moz-ctr-data-desktop-vs-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"google search clicks on mobile devices\" width=\"738\" height=\"340\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>So well more than half of mobile searches don\u2019t result in clicks.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s another source \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.advancedwebranking.com\/cloud\/ctrstudy\/\">according to Advanced Web Ranking<\/a>, \u201cranking #1 in Google has a 23.5% mobile click-through rate, down from 28.6% in 2015.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That means it\u2019s not just the increase in mobile search share, but that <strong>CTR\u2019s are falling across all devices<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>None of these explanations (more and larger ads, other organic features, or shifts in mobile usage\/behavior) fully explain the dip in organic CTR that we\u2019re seeing, but it could be a combination of these changes along with other, smaller <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/09\/google-ranking-factors\">ranking factors<\/a>. Heck, maybe people are just more distracted than they were two years ago, so we\u2019re seeing a higher incidence of people doing a Google search and then dropping the task to watch a squirrel out the window\u2026<\/p>\n<h3>One more caveat\u2026<\/h3>\n<p>This was our own, wordstream.com account data so we\u2019re only looking at one vertical: marketing. The results may be very different <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/29\/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks\">for different industries<\/a>. I can actually imagine the average CTR falling much more for industries that do less content marketing than we do, meaning more of their keywords are going to be commercial vs. informational.<\/p>\n<h2>How to combat falling organic CTR\u2019s?<\/h2>\n<p>Feeling dispirited? Me too, honestly, but your focus shouldn\u2019t change too much:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keep working to <\/strong><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/13\/organic-seo-ctr-infographic\"><strong>increase your organic CTR\u2019s<\/strong><\/a> by aiming to meet <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/26\/intent-marketing\">the searcher\u2019s true intent<\/a> with exceptionally high-quality content, and by writing headlines and <a href=\"\/meta-tags\">meta descriptions<\/a> that make the value you\u2019re offering crystal-clear upfront.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Scale your content marketing so you have more opportunities to rank.<\/strong> Consider publishing more <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/09\/08\/why-create-content-outside-your-niche\">off-topic content<\/a> that reaches a wider audience and increases your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/08\/brand-affinity-marketing\">brand affinity<\/a> (then use remarketing to convert more of those visitors).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Invest in social promotion, email marketing, PPC and other channels<\/strong> that can offset any losses on the organic SERP.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>TL;DR<\/h2>\n<p>In short, though our data set was limited:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>This study suggests that a #1 ranking on Google is 37% less valuable, at least in terms of click-through rate, than it was just two years ago.
