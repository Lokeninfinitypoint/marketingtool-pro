Who knew Average CPC data have a longer shelf life than Vegemite?<\/p>\n<p>(I had to get that out of the way. I\u2019m sorry. Please don\u2019t leave.)<\/p>\n<p>The premise underpinning that sliver of SEO magic was simple: leverage data from our Free Keyword Tool in order to figure out which keywords carried unfortunately wallet-thinning CPCs. People (probably you!) loved it. They continue to cite it to this day.<\/p>\n<p>But a lot\u2019s changed since 2011: as a company we\u2019ve gotten bigger, faster, and stronger with age. Like Micky Rourke. In keeping with this growth, we thought it high time to revamp our Most Expensive Keywords research and the resulting infographic(s). You know, give it a little facelift. A nip here. A tuck there. Also like Mickey Rourke.<\/p>\n<p>Simply rehashing our previous keyword research would\u2019ve been bad value for you, our cherished blog visitors, so we took it to the next level. How? By creating currency-specific iterations of the Most Expensive Keyword Infographic. At the bottom of this post, you\u2019ll find links to our USD and GBP infographics. (Versions for CAD and ZAR are coming soon!)

Likewise, keywords involving different types of lawyers (which happens to be the most expensive grouping in our AUD data set) or insurance were grouped together. We used a similar methodology when we created our first \u201cMost Expensive Keywords\u201d infographic back in 2011 so as to avoid featuring too many specific long-tail or local keywords that wouldn\u2019t have broad applicability to a large number of businesses. We separated distinct services (pest control vs. termites) as much as possible.<\/p>\n<p>We also filtered out keywords with less than 100 clicks from our data set. We only looked at advertisers bidding in USD, AUD, CAD, and ZAR, and analyzed different currencies separately. We also eliminated non-English ads and duplicates (where both the keyword and the CPC were exactly the same) from that set. The results you\u2019re reading about in this article are in AUD.<\/p>\n<p>(Thank you to everyone who helped compile, analyze, and illustrate the data: our data analyst Josh Brackett, our web team leader Meg Lister, and our designer Kate Lindsay!)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What are the most expensive keywords in Australia?
