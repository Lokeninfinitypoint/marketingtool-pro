The tech giant has been making several tweaks to various aspects of its platform in an overall attempt\u00a0to make the product more accessible to businesses looking to advertise.<\/p>\n<p>To add to these technical changes, Google has released its new Insights page from beta.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"16ec3d1d-377b-41b0-9dfe-3e7231f6e737\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-insights-page-1.jpeg\" alt=\"google ads insights page pros and cons consumer insights meme\" width=\"429\" height=\"321\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>For the most part, any tool or feature that provides insights through data is generally a welcomed asset. But with Google these days, it is important to take a closer look.\u00a0In this post, I\u2019m going to discuss the overall pros and cons of the Google Ads Insights page, and then walk you through how to use it. This way, you can\u00a0decide whether it&#8217;s right for your business.<\/p>\n<h2>The pros\u00a0of the Google Ads Insights page<\/h2>\n<p>The Insights page is the latest beta-tested offering from Google that essentially curates custom insights based on your business account. The idea behind the tool is to deliver relevant trends and opportunities unique to the advertiser\u2019s business.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Keep up with changing consumer behavior<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It works by using your account\u2019s performance history, campaign settings, and trends across Google to automatically generate insights and recommendations for your business. According to Google, this is a tool to help marketers and advertisers keep up with the rapidly <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/18\/post-covid-19-customers\">changing consumer behavior that was set off by the pandemic<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Get ahead of competitors<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In a way, this tool doesn&#8217;t just allow you to keep up with consumers, but also to get ahead of competitors. For example, Google notes that \u201csearches for \u2018curbside pickup\u2019 increased by over 3000%\u201d during the pandemic. Businesses who were relevant to this query would have been able to capitalize by targeting these keywords before the competition caught on to the trend.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1576e3fa-ed17-4d2b-b024-74b6c4717dfc\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-insights-page-trending-charts-2-1.png\" alt=\"trend charts on the google ads insights page\" width=\"936\" height=\"836\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>Great for scaling<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To the individual marketer (or agency), the tool itself is certainly an added bonus\u2014particularly for those who are looking for ways to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/27\/scaling-your-advertising\">scale their account <\/a>and increase their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/16\/return-on-ad-spend-roas\">return on ad spend<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Potential cons of the Google Ads Insights page<\/h2>\n<p>There is a flipside to the page that comes into play from my perspective. Now obviously not every person advertising or using Google Ads will frequently use this tool but let&#8217;s say that a vast majority do.<\/p>\n<p><strong>With everyone using it, can you really get ahead?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If all of these <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/18\/ppc-competitor-analysis\">competitors<\/a> are using the tool and increasing their spend towards \u201ctrending terms,\u201d then the party that will benefit the most would be Google. It\u2019s in every business\u2019s best interest to increase revenue wherever possible, but it seems Google has been blurring the lines between \u201chelping you <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/02\/promote-your-business\">grow your business<\/a>\u201d and helping their bottom line for quite some time now.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Push toward more spending<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This may seem like a cynical perspective but I feel\u00a0it is\u00a0necessary to point out that although many of Google\u2019s recommendations may be helpful, most of them will try to persuade you to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/20\/stop-burning-your-adwords-budget\">spend more money<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Not the best fit for every account<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Finally, while <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/01\/google-local-search-trends\">search trends<\/a> provide a great deal of opportunity from an advertising perspective, some industries will derive more value from the Insights page than others.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AdWordsGrader_AWGrader\"><em><strong>For insights into your account performance you can rely on, use our Free Google Ads Performance Grader!<\/strong><\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<div>\n<h2>How to use the Google Ads Insights page<\/h2>\n<p>The Google Ads Insights page is conveniently located in the main menu of your Google Ads account under the recommendations tab:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"35d07611-8ba5-401c-aa23-01e4b6f13bee\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-insights-page-dashboard-1.png\" alt=\"google ads insights dashboard\" width=\"1528\" height=\"846\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>From a broad-strokes point of view, these Insights can be intriguing. To see the changes in trends, particularly those within your account, is pretty valuable. Prior to this tool being available you would have to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/15\/google-ads-account-audit-post-covid\">analyze campaign information<\/a> and compare it to a third party tool, but now can receive this information at a glance.<\/p>\n<p>From the start, you are presented with a broad overview of trends that you show ads for as well as suggested trends for your business. You can get a deeper look into the report by selecting \u201cView Trend Details\u201d in the bottom right of the window:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"dd3ddf00-78eb-4a6c-b57e-d61f284dc3b3\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-insights-page-view-trend-details-1.png\" alt=\"view trend details button on google ads insights page\" width=\"936\" height=\"448\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Here you will be presented with some specific insights in addition to recommendations from Google:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"e1503b48-4ac0-434f-95b0-9442edd0a0ba\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/googe-ads-insights-page-trending-search-terms-1.png\" alt=\"trending search terms and recommendations on the google ads insights page\" width=\"936\" height=\"546\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>If you select \u201cView\u201d in the recommendations section, you can see what Google is proposing specifically:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"b94715ff-0df1-48fa-abd5-ed6dca398b32\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-insights-page-select-keywords-1.png\" alt=\"select keywords to add from the google ads insights recommendations\" width=\"936\" height=\"682\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>As with any auto-generated recommendations from Google, I suggest you always review and determine whether these changes should be made. You may find some that would be worth implementing while others not so much.<\/p>\n<p>If you select \u201cView Trend Details\u201d on the \u201csuggested tends for your business\u201d window, you will be taken to a report that looks like this:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"213c6835-a6c8-4a34-853b-45d89eae0c26\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-insights-page-learn-more-trending-search-terms-1.png\" alt=\"learn more about trending search terms in the google ads insights page\" width=\"936\" height=\"866\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>This is where you will be able to view general trends that are related to your business but not necessarily your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/05\/online-advertising-costs\">current ad spend<\/a>. Due to the fact that this report is a much broader generalization of your business, I found this report to be much less helpful or relevant to the clients I manage. Depending on your industry, however, this report may show much more relevant data or at least trends that may be worth capitalizing on.<\/p>\n<h2>So is the Google Ads Insights page helpful?<\/h2>\n<p>As with many auto-generated recommendation tools released by Google to help marketers grow their business, there are some great advantages and some not-so-great.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Insights\u00a0are truly unique to each account<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you manage several accounts you will see how much variation there is in the information you receive, depending upon which business you are viewing. The data and trends truly reflect the individual businesses and the history of the ad accounts themselves.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Insights are readily available<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As mentioned above, the fact that this information is readily available within your account is valuable enough. You don\u2019t have to use the Insights page if you don\u2019t wish to but it is always there to inspect.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Recommendations aren&#8217;t necessarily optimizations<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The page may give you some ideas or show trends that may be worth capitalizing on, but for an experienced marketer, they will likely find many of the trends and recommendations generally unhelpful.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Some accounts don&#8217;t have them<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I have also found that not every Google Ad account will have active trends and insights. For some businesses you will be shown this window:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3ca2774a-804f-424d-af49-0b86da84864c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-insights-page-no-insights-1.png\" alt=\"google ads insights sometimes have no insights\" width=\"936\" height=\"336\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>This makes sense because there may not be a surge in search volume for every industry and every vertical. This means the data you receive from this page is pretty reliable. I would certainly recommend viewing the Insights page every time you are going through an account and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/24\/google-ads-optimization\">making optimizations. <\/a><\/p>\n<p>The beauty of paid search is that it is constantly evolving. There are search terms that will consistently provide volume every month but in many cases new queries emerge as information and trends develop.<\/p>\n<h2>Try out the Google Ads Insights page to see if it&#8217;s right for your business<\/h2>\n<p>With constant changes to the platform (particularly to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/10\/modified-broad-match-going-away\">keyword match types<\/a>) any additional information or data that can be analyzed is welcome in my opinion. Google has been pushing more and more automation in search over the past few years and although some of it has been helpful, much of it has taken the high level of control that marketers had to make decisions and fine-tune campaigns. The Insights page is a refreshing addition to the platform that isn\u2019t a dramatic change that will upset any applecarts.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"views-element-container contextual-region\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google has released its Insights page out of beta\u2014should you be using it?
