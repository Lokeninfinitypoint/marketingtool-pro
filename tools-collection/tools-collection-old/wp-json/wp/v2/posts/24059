Several people stood around the pile, gingerly picking up a candy bar here and there. But after about 30 seconds, kids swooped down in hordes, cramming piles of bars into their backpacks in sheer ecstasy. I snapped these photos to document the event:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/innovative-ads-butterfinger.jpg\" alt=\"Creative Butterfinger Pawngo Ad\" width=\"540\" height=\"622\" \/><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/butterfinger-pawngo-ad.jpg\" alt=\"Pawngo Butterfinger Advertisement\" width=\"720\" height=\"785\" \/><\/div>\n<p><em>Pawngo&#8217;s Butterfinger pile in Copley Square<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Upon closer examination, this was no glorious miracle, but actually a <a href=\"http:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDL69CreativeMarketingIdeas.html?camplink=InContentCTA\">clever advertising ploy<\/a> by Pawngo, an online pawnshop business and apparent Giants fan. Their candy bar jab gives new meaning to \u201cbittersweet.\u201d I wasn\u2019t beyond cramming some into my pockets before leaving though.<\/p>\n<p>I had never heard of Pawngo before, but they got their name out in a clever and original way. Now ordinarily a giant pile of Butterfingers appearing in downtown Boston would certainly attract notice, but the sly post-Superbowl insult made the prank that much more worthy of attention.<\/p>\n<p>Pawngo used their environment (Boston suffering after a Patriots defeat) to their advertising advantage. Here are some other unique examples of advertising that take advantage of setting and environment.<\/p>\n<h2>1. McDonald\u2019s Seed Bombing<\/h2>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/mcdonalds-seed-bomb.png\" alt=\"McDonalds Seed Bombing Ad\" width=\"500\" height=\"299\" \/><\/div>\n<p><em>McDonald&#8217;s clever seed bomb ad<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This recent McDonald\u2019s seed bomb ad was designed by Sean Click. It\u2019s certainly a unique idea, brightening up those dirty freeway shoulders with some colorful logos. But what makes the ad superbly innovative is Click\u2019s premeditation regarding the ad\u2019s geography; the flowers are California Poppies, the state\u2019s official flower, which are illegal to dig up. So it\u2019s actually illegal to destroy this McDonald\u2019s ad \u2013pretty incredible.<\/p>\n<p>Using seed bombing as an advertising method is a really cool and original idea, and I\u2019d be interested in seeing it pushed further. Makes me wonder what it would be like if dandelions were Massachusetts\u2019s state flower\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>2.
