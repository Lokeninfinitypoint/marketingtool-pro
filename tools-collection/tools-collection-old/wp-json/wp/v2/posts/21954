They are, by far, the most versatile extensions; they\u2019re useful for accounts of all verticals, they appear on all devices and advertisers can use them to say just about anything.<\/p>\n<p>Even better, I\u2019ve literally never encountered an account that <em>didn\u2019t<\/em> yield higher CTRs once enabling these bad boys. According to the crew at Google, the mere presence of <a href=\"https:\/\/adwords.googleblog.com\/2014\/01\/better-ads-via-better-sitelinks.html\">sitelinks typically lifts ad CTR by 10-20% (+20-50% on branded searches<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Sitelinks FTW.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been preaching the wonders of these extensions for years (proof: I covered them in one of my <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/06\/03\/adwords-ad-extensions-cheat-sheet\/\">first blogposts EVER<\/a>). Yet, we\u2019ve never done a true deep dive on sitelink best practices.<\/p>\n<p>Better late than never, right? Without further ado, here\u2019s a list of dos and don\u2019ts to help you make the most of these truly magical extensions.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>It&#8217;s time to find out why your text ads are wasting money. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Run our free Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a> and get an instant account audit!<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<h2><em>DO <\/em>Keep \u2018Em Short and Sweet<\/h2>\n<p>Google allows advertisers to include up to 25 characters in their sitelink descriptions but, just because you have the extra space doesn\u2019t mean you need to use it. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/adwords.googleblog.com\/2014\/01\/better-ads-via-better-sitelinks.html\">Google<\/a>, more succinct link copy performs better. It recommends aiming for a baseline of 18-20 characters for desktop links and 12-15 for mobile. This ensures that your messaging isn\u2019t truncated on the SERP.<\/p>\n<h2><em>DON\u2019T<\/em> Set Them and Forget Them<\/h2>\n<p>Sitelinks require very little maintenance, but it never hurts to check in on them from time to time. Periodically dive into your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/12\/automated-ad-extensions\">ad extensions<\/a> tab to review performance metrics for each of your sitelinks. Here\u2019re a few metrics to keep an eye on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Impressions<\/strong>: If impressions are low for a given sitelink, it\u2019s possible that Google is passing it over for a reason. Try editing the link and giving it another whirl.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Click-Through Rate<\/strong>: If CTR is high, you\u2019ve nailed your link description text. If it\u2019s low, it\u2019s a sign that your copy isn\u2019t resonating with viewers. Is this page relevant to your campaign\/ad group themes? Can you re-craft your copy to make it more appealing?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Conversion Rate<\/strong>: If your CVRs are high, pat yourself on the back. If they\u2019re low, give some extra consideration to the page you\u2019re sending visitors to. Are you putting your best foot forward? Is it accurately represented by your link text, giving searchers the appropriate expectations?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sitelink-extensions-reporting.jpg\" alt=\"reporting for sitelinks\" width=\"750\" height=\"361\" \/><\/div>\n<p>For even more insight, use the segment dropdown to see \u201cthis extension vs. other.\u201d This will show you how much direct interaction that particular sitelink received, versus the other components of the ad.<\/p>\n<h2><em>DO <\/em>Create Sitelinks for your Bing Ads Campaigns<\/h2>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sitelink-extensions-bing.jpg\" alt=\"bing sitelinks\" width=\"542\" height=\"233\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Did you know that Bing Ads offers nearly all of the same extensions as AdWords, and then some? (It\u2019s true\u2014you can find the whole shebang <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/05\/bing-ad-extensions-cheat-sheet\">here<\/a>.) All of the benefits associated with sitelink extensions in AdWords hold true for Bing too, so why not take a few minutes to port your AdWords extensions over from Bing. You don\u2019t even have to write anything new!<\/p>\n<h2><em>DON\u2019T<\/em> Apply Account Level-Sitelinks<\/h2>\n<p>Just last week, Google released account-level sitelinks, giving advertisers the opportunity to create just a single set of sitelinks to be applied across the board. \u00a0No doubt, the crew at Google created this new option to reduce the barrier to usage to boost sitelink adoption, since they\u2019re so beneficial to ad CTR.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sitelink-extensions-account-level.jpg\" alt=\"account level sitelinks\" width=\"632\" height=\"265\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As with most things, the fastest, easiest route is rarely the best route. You\u2019re far better off investing a little extra time to create your sitelinks on the campaign or ad group level. This allows you to customize the links so they directly reflect the topic that your audience is looking for.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sitelink-extensions-relevant.jpg\" alt=\"relevant sitelinks\" width=\"791\" height=\"323\" \/><\/div>\n<p>For example, if the Kate Spade ad above featured account-level sitelinks, it\u2019s likely the links would be fairly generic or only feature their best-selling products. Instead, they\u2019ve implemented them in a more strategic manner, giving the user (who is looking specifically for purses) closely related pages to check out.<\/p>\n<h2><em>DO <\/em>Give Enhanced Sitelinks a Shot<\/h2>\n<p>There are two primary benefits of sitelinks. Firstly, they allow you to consume considerably more real estate on the SERP, making your ads more prominent, and secondly, they give you the opportunity to share even more information with your audience.<\/p>\n<p>Now imagine you could make one simple change to score even more real-estate and include even more details with your searchers\u2014tempting? You can actually do this with enhanced sitelinks! These giant, robust sitelinks allow you to include two lines of description text for each link, essentially mini-ads for each one!<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sitelink-extensions-enhanced.jpg\" alt=\"enhanced sitelink extensions\" width=\"581\" height=\"259\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Google <a href=\"https:\/\/adwords.googleblog.com\/2012\/02\/introducing-enhanced-ad-sitelinks.html\">reports<\/a> a 30% CTR elevation when advertisers take advantage of this option, making it a definite \u201cdo.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2><em>DO <\/em>Schedule Start and End Dates for Time-Sensitive Sitelinks<\/h2>\n<p>Sitelinks are the perfect way to highlight holiday sales, limited-time offers and special deals. However, no one is going to get excited about your 4th of July sale on the 5th, when all of the discounts are no longer valid.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sitelink-extensions-scheduling.jpg\" alt=\"scheduling sitelinks\" width=\"503\" height=\"531\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If you create a time-sensitive sitelink, use the scheduling options to specify the dates that it is eligible to show. You can even set up specific time of day (or days of week) to serve a particular link!<\/p>\n<h2><em>DON\u2019T <\/em>Assume That Your Sitelinks Will Always Be Served<\/h2>\n<p>Just because you\u2019ve done your duty and created your sitelink extensions doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they\u2019ll always be served alongside your ads. Extensions are displayed at Google\u2019s discretion. Advertisers have virtually no impact on which are displayed, if any. Instead, Google uses a secret formula which aims to show the \u201cbest options\u201d based on the users\u2019 needs and their contexts.<\/p>\n<p>We <em>do<\/em> know that Google is more likely to display extensions for ads that appear in top positions. We also know that the number of extensions served decreases as your position decreases. So, if your ad rank is poor, chances are high that your sitelinks will never actually see the light of day.<\/p>\n<h2><em>DO<\/em> Periodically Check Your Links<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s nothing worse than seeing an ad that offers <em>exactly<\/em> what you want, clicking on the link for your desired product and then landing on a freaking 404 error page.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sitelink-extensions-broken-link.jpg\" alt=\"broken link\" width=\"507\" height=\"308\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Lego\u2019s creative spin on a 404 error page.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Most advertisers diligently update their ads when they update their landing pages (or build a mobile site). Yet, many also neglect to update their sitelinks. Serving a broken link isn\u2019t just a waste of a click and a little cash. It makes a bad impression on the searcher and dissuades them from returning to your site. Don\u2019t let your sitelinks fall by the wayside. Check your sitelink landing pages regularly to ensure they are working links.<\/p>\n<h2><em>DON\u2019T<\/em> Be Redundant<\/h2>\n<p>Nowadays, there are many different ways to enhance your ad copy. Google\u2019s added a whole slew of new extensions (structured snippets, callouts, etc.) and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/08\/create-expanded-text-ads\">Expanded Text Ads<\/a> are giving us nearly twice as much space to rave about our products.<\/p>\n<p>Pumping up the word-count in your ads is great, but do it carefully. If all of your extensions and your ad creative tout only one value proposition, you\u2019re missing out on the opportunity to build a compelling case for your product.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sitelink20extensions20resized.jpg\" alt=\"sitelink extensions\" width=\"800\" height=\"242\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Yeah, we get it. Free Shipping.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>As you add new components to your ad, consider the bigger picture.
