However, CPC and CPL for this ad type are still significantly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/2025-google-ads-benchmarks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lower than comparable ads on Google<\/a>. Despite rising advertising costs and economic challenges, Facebook Lead Ads maintain a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-cost#:~:text=The%20average%20starting%20budget%20to,per%20month%20on%20Google%20Ads.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cost advantage over Google Ads<\/a>. This means that social ads are the perfect complement to your search strategy.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Facebook Lead Ads click-through rates increased for 9 out of 15 industries<\/strong>, with an overall slight increase year over year. This shows that Facebook users are still engaging with ads on the Meta platform.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The cost per click for Facebook leads objective campaigns increased overall<\/strong>, but 10 out of 15 industries (67%) saw stable or decreased CPCs. Advertising costs are increasing across the board\u201487% of industries saw increases in CPC for Google Ads, with an overall increase of 12.88%. Lead Ads saw a slower rate of increase\u2014only 2.13% compared to 2024. And CPC is still relatively low for Lead Ads at $1.92, compared to $5.26 in Google Ads.<\/li>\n<li><strong>For Facebook leads campaigns, 12 out of 15 industries (80%) saw a decrease in conversion rate year over year.<\/strong> This follows an overall increase we saw last year. Many of the industries impacted could be seeing decreases due to the economy. For example, fewer people may be looking for entertainment, taking on home improvement projects, or investing in beauty and personal care\u2014leading to a decrease in CVR for these industries.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Facebook leads campaigns cost per lead increased for 9 out of 15 (60%) industries<\/strong>, and CPL increased 20.94% overall to $27.66. This, again, could be due to the overall increase in advertising costs we\u2019re seeing across the board due to increased competition, privacy restrictions that impact ad targeting, and inflation. However, Lead Ads CPL is substantially lower than the average CPL of Google Ads at $70.11.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/2025-facebook-benchmarks-yoy-1024x615.webp\" alt=\"2025 facebook benchmarks year over year for leads campaigns\" width=\"1024\" height=\"615\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93928 size-large\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/2025-facebook-benchmarks-yoy-980x589.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/2025-facebook-benchmarks-yoy-480x288.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>For Facebook traffic campaigns, click-through rates increased YOY for 11 out of 22 industries<\/strong> (71%) after a year of increases last year as well, with an overall increase of 8.23%.

However, try not to lose sight of your overall Facebook advertising goals. All of the metrics in your account paint a bigger picture of your overall account health when looked at in tandem with one another.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA single metric does not necessarily determine a campaign&#8217;s success. Your business\u2019s advertising outcomes typically depend on your overall objectives,\u201d said Mat Wendler, Senior Manager of Optimization Strategy and Custom Solutions at LocaliQ.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor instance, you could have a low cost per lead, but the number of qualified leads may still be insufficient, potentially impacting your business\u2019s advertising results. Each metric provides information about the campaign&#8217;s performance, and it is the responsibility of the advertiser and their marketing partners to interpret their significance,\u201d Mat said.<\/p>\n<p>So, whether or not a specific metric is doing great or in need of improvement, try to think about how it could be related to other performance indicators and your overall account health.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly rare that a well-tuned campaign meeting or exceeding benchmarks isn\u2019t providing value for a business. That said, given the fact that most metrics are taking a hit this year due to economic headwinds, it\u2019s more important than ever to scrutinize every data point and ensure marketing dollars are producing more than just good metrics,\u201d Tyler said.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also good to remember here that no two Facebook ad accounts are exactly alike\u2014and what might work for one business might not for another.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe metric that matters most is the one that ties directly to your goals. All others can be helpful indicators, but the one we need to prioritize over all the others is the main goal,\u201d said Michelle Morgan, Co-Founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.paidmediapros.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Paid Media Pros<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor those trying to generate more business sales, that ties directly to conversion rate, cost per lead, and return on ad spend. For those trying to attract and engage new audiences, that\u2019s likely more focused on CTR and CPC. It\u2019s all case dependent, but just because a metric is important to another business owner or marketer, doesn\u2019t mean it needs to be a priority for you,\u201d Michelle said.<\/p>\n<h3>Use a mix of campaign objectives<\/h3>\n<p>While the leads and traffic objectives are the pillars of most <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/scale-meta-ads-with-first-party-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Meta advertising strategies<\/a>, don\u2019t forget there are a few other campaign objective options. All the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/facebook-ad-objectives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">different Facebook ads campaign objectives<\/a> complement each other, so try to include a variety of campaign types in your account.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/facebook-ad-objectives-e1749239041209.webp\" alt=\"facebook ad objectives\" width=\"419\" height=\"515\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84952 size-full\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cFacebook provides a range of advertising objectives. It is a common misconception that advertisers should focus solely on the objective aligned with their final goal. For instance, if the intended outcome is to generate leads, it may be beneficial to consider running branding and traffic campaigns in addition to a lead campaign,\u201d Mat said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSmall and medium-sized businesses might not have substantial brand recognition, which can impact their ability to attract leads right off the bat. Facebook&#8217;s platform offers tools to support both branding and lead generation within a single source,\u201d Mat said.<\/p>\n<p>Testing a mix of campaign objectives and ad types in your strategy also helps you balance out any performance gaps.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAll of these metrics play together, and you have to balance them out for your own goals. The most common misalignment I hear is expecting a high CTR and high CVR, especially for lead generation companies. You\u2019re likely going to see decreasing CTRs (and increasing CPCs) as you focus in on your audience and improve your CVR. This is just part of the lead quality game that we all play,\u201d Michelle said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re ad copy testing and looking to drive high-quality leads, don\u2019t be discouraged by lower CTRs. Keep things in a manageable range but be flexible with where your CTR ends up. Be willing to sacrifice a few points here and there to make it up on the back end and in your bank account,\u201d Michelle said.<\/p>\n<h3>Prioritize your unique value proposition in ad copy and creative<\/h3>\n<p>You want to take users on a journey through your sales funnel when they view and interact with your ads. Focus on engaging and enriching ads that will convey your brand messaging in a unique way.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s better to tell a good story than a perfect one. Consumer demand for authenticity is at an all-time high. As AI becomes more prevalent, it\u2019s important to leverage it in ways to make more meaningful connections with customers. Do not use it just for the sake of using it. Consumers aren\u2019t looking for businesses to cut corners, they are looking for value,\u201d Tyler said.<\/p>\n<h2>What these 2025 Facebook ads benchmarks mean for your strategy<\/h2>\n<p>Use this industry data as a guideline to inform your strategy. These benchmarks can help you understand how your campaign performance might be pacing against your average competitor. This can be helpful when you want to make confident, data-backed marketing and advertising decisions this year and beyond.<\/p>\n<p>If your results don\u2019t always exactly match up to the averages in your industry, that\u2019s okay! Just be ready to flex and shift your strategy as trends in your industry evolve. And, remember, you don\u2019t have to manage the ups and downs of Facebook advertising all alone.
