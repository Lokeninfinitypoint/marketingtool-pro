Welcome back to the blog for another <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog?category=165&amp;author=All\">online advertising news round-up<\/a>. We\u2019ve got <strong>seven stories<\/strong> for you this week: Google changing the way it interprets nofollow links, Facebook testing in-app checkout, and more! Let\u2019s dive in.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">1. Google announces changes to nofollow links<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In an effort to aggregate more information and \u201cbetter understand unnatural linking patterns,\u201d Google has <a href=\"https:\/\/webmasters.googleblog.com\/2019\/09\/evolving-nofollow-new-ways-to-identify.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced<\/a> that they\u2019ll now interpret the nofollow link attribute (i.e., rel=\u201cnofollow\u201d) as a \u201chint\u201d rather than as explicit instruction to ignore the linked content. Additionally, Google has announced two new link attributes that they\u2019ll also interpret as hints:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Sponsored<\/strong> (rel=\u201csponsored\u201d): to flag a link as part of an advertisement, sponsorship, or some other compensation agreement.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>User-generated content<\/strong> (rel=\u201cugc\u201d): to flag a link within user-generated content, such as a comment on your blog post.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Launched in 2005 to combat comment spam, the nofollow attribute has long been used by website owners and SEOs to indicate that certain links aren\u2019t meant to endorse the corresponding content or publisher. Accordingly, Google has ignored links flagged with the nofollow attribute when ranking the organic search results.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a0113bac-28c4-422a-b1eb-dd5e1c937ca2\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-changes-nofollow-links.png\" alt=\"google-changes-nofollow-link-attributes\" width=\"636\" height=\"300\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>You can use the \u201cInspect\u201d function within Chrome to find the nofollow links on a page.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In their announcement <a href=\"https:\/\/webmasters.googleblog.com\/2019\/09\/evolving-nofollow-new-ways-to-identify.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog post<\/a>, Danny Sullivan and Gary Ilyes explain that Google\u2019s ability to evaluate the characteristics of individual links\u2014e.g., anchor text\u2014gives them access to important information they can use to better understand linking patterns and, thus, put an end to nefarious link schemes. In other words, ignoring links with the nofollow attribute altogether has kept Google from collecting as much information as they can. With this new model, you can still refrain from endorsing certain publishers while allowing Google to collect information they consider useful.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no need for you to change any nofollow links currently on your site. When appropriate, you\u2019re free to append multiple attributes to a single link (e.g., rel=\u201cnofollow ugc\u201d). And, no\u2014Google does not anticipate that this change will have a substantial impact on rankings.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">2. Facebook testing in-app checkout<\/h2>\n<p>Continuing to capitalize on the rise of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/25\/social-shopping\">social shopping<\/a>\u2014the practice of <em>selling<\/em> products on social media rather than simply <em>promoting<\/em> products on social media\u2014Facebook has <a href=\"https:\/\/marketingland.com\/facebook-testing-two-new-ad-features-in-app-checkout-for-facebook-ads-new-ad-unit-for-instagram-266906\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">confirmed<\/a> that it\u2019s testing <strong>in-app checkout<\/strong> for dynamic News Feed ads. Though a spokesperson has stated that the test involves a \u201csmall subset\u201d of advertisers, Facebook has not revealed who has access to in-app checkout or why they were selected for the test.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f572e853-2e80-44df-a5d8-bdb379eec5fd\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-changes-nofollow-links-facebook-tests-in-app-checkout.png\" alt=\"google-changes-nofollow-links-facebook-in-app-checkout\" width=\"293\" height=\"512\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>Via Facebook.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Dynamic ads are built to make your Facebook remarketing efforts more personalized and effective. When your dynamic ad is served to a user, Facebook automatically optimizes the promoted products or offers according to the user\u2019s past behavior on your website or within your app. If the prospect has shown clear interest in a handful of specific products, Facebook will dynamically update your ad to highlight them.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to their personalized nature, dynamic ads were already a great way to close the deal with your remarketing prospects. Now that users have the opportunity to make purchases without leaving the Facebook app, the effectiveness of dynamic ads should only improve. This is pure speculation, but based on past betas, we&#8217;re willing to bet Facebook will\u00a0roll out in-app checkout to all advertisers at some point next year.<\/p>\n<p>Tangentially, Facebook is also testing an expansion of in-app checkout on Instagram\u2014a feature that\u2019s currently limited to a small group of brands. Since its launch earlier this year, <a href=\"https:\/\/business.instagram.com\/blog\/new-to-instagram-shopping-checkout\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Checkout on Instagram<\/a> has only been available for organic posts. Now, Facebook is allowing the brands with access to turn those organic posts into ads.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">3. Google bans ads for unfounded medical treatments<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To protect vulnerable users from malicious advertisers, Google has <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/9475042\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">banned ads<\/a> for \u201cunproven or experimental medical techniques,\u201d such as stem cell therapy, cellular therapy, and gene therapy. Additionally, treatments lacking scientific basis and treatments lacking sufficient clinical testing are no longer eligible for promotion, either.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, this is an important step towards shielding users from products and treatments that may have adverse effects on their health. However, in order to allow legitimate actors to inform the public about their experiments and findings, Google will continue to permit advertising for medical research. As breakthroughs occur, Google will revisit the policies as needed.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">4. Microsoft rolls out RSA beta to everyone<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Continuing the not-so-gradual march towards fully automated search advertising, Microsoft has officially <a href=\"https:\/\/about.ads.microsoft.com\/en-us\/blog\/post\/september-2019\/creating-and-testing-ads-is-easier-with-responsive-search-ads?feed=blogposts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rolled out<\/a> the responsive search ad beta to all Bing advertisers. To join the beta, you can either reach out to your account representative or complete this <a href=\"https:\/\/microsoft.qualtrics.com\/jfe\/form\/SV_eCF75MHd5g6BPJH\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interest form<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>With a responsive search ad, or RSA, you hand over control of the text ad creation process to Microsoft\u2019s algorithms. After you\u2019ve submitted up to 15 headlines and four descriptions, Microsoft will test different variations\u2014more than <strong>32,000<\/strong> are possible\u2014to determine which work well and which don\u2019t. Eventually, users will only see your top-performers; the rest will get shelved.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"313e20b1-b484-4296-9bc3-8f9861380502\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-changes-nofollow-links-microsoft-rolls-out-responsive-search-ads.png\" alt=\"google-changes-nofollow-links-microsoft-advertising-rsa\" width=\"800\" height=\"338\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The chief advantage of using an RSA\u2014which Google <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/10\/responsive-search-ads\">initially rolled out<\/a> last year\u2014is that you can save a bunch of time. The chief <em>disadvantage<\/em>, of course, is that you\u2019re almost completely sacrificing control over the creation of your text ads. True\u2014you\u2019re the one who creates the initial headlines and descriptions. But from that point on, you\u2019re at the mercy of machine learning.<\/p>\n<p>Give the RSA beta a try. There\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll see improved performance as you reclaim a substantial portion of your workday. However, make sure you\u2019re simultaneously running standard text ads as well. Directly comparing the performance of the two ad types is the only way to determine which method works best for you.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">5. Google will soon integrate Express into Shopping<\/h2>\n<p>Per an email sent to customers last week, Google <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/09\/11\/google-express-to-close-in-a-few-weeks-will-become-part-of-google-shopping\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">plans to retire the Google Express brand<\/a> and integrate it into the new Google Shopping experience over the next few weeks. Following up on the announcement originally made at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/14\/google-marketing-live\">Google Marketing Live<\/a>, the plan to retire Google Express marks a shift in Google\u2019s approach to challenging Amazon\u2019s dominance in ecommerce.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"03b48515-0d51-4c14-ad0a-1c2d2e2a21bc\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-changes-nofollow-links-google-express-retirement.png\" alt=\"google-changes-nofollow-links-google-express-brand-retirement\" width=\"766\" height=\"400\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>Google wants you to shop across YouTube, Discover, Gmail, and more.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Google Express, for those who don\u2019t know, was Google\u2019s attempt to create a centralized online marketplace where shoppers could browse products from major retailers like Target, Walmart, Best Buy, and so on. In other words, it was Amazon\u2014minus the private-label products. As you may already know from your own online shopping experience, Google Express never really took off. Even among the people who knew it existed\u2014not a large group\u2014it failed to present itself as a compelling alternative to Amazon. Plus, the major retailers who were selling on Google Express were simultaneously finding ways to make <em>their own marketplaces<\/em> more appealing.<\/p>\n<p>So, as Google <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/06\/11\/google-vs-amazon\">ramps up its efforts to win over both ecommerce advertisers and online shoppers<\/a>, they will integrate Google Express into the new Shopping experience. Whether someone wants to make a purchase from the search engine results page, Google Images, YouTube, or Google Discover, they\u2019ll have access to the universal shopping cart, easy checkout, and free shipping options that used to be the main selling points of Google Express.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">6. Microsoft opens betas for two new audiences<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In another step towards parity with Google Ads, Microsoft Advertising has <a href=\"https:\/\/about.ads.microsoft.com\/en-us\/blog\/post\/september-2019\/audience-targeting-solutions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced<\/a> open betas for two new audience targeting solutions: product audiences and similar audiences.<\/p>\n<p>A product audience is basically a remarketing list for a specific product in your catalog. If a prospect visits your website and shows interest in a particular product, they\u2019re added to the audience. Then, when they return to Bing to search for that same product, you\u2019re there with the perfect Shopping ad. This beta is now open to ecommerce advertisers in the US, Canada, Britain, India, France, Germany, and Australia.<\/p>\n<p>A similar audience is the paid search equivalent of a lookalike audience on Facebook and Instagram. Basically, it allows you to reach new prospects who are similar to your existing customers. Similar audiences have been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/25\/similar-audiences-for-search-campaigns\">available in Google Ads<\/a> since 2017, and as you can imagine, they tend to drive above-average conversion rates. This beta is now open to search advertisers in the US.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"db544902-376f-4abc-b00c-008c8e18588a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-changes-nofollow-links-similar-audiences-data.png\" alt=\"google-changes-nofollow-links-similar-audiences-conversion-data\" width=\"784\" height=\"633\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">7. Google makes it easy for users to skim videos<\/h2>\n<p>To help Search users find the information they\u2019re looking for faster, Google has <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/search\/key-moments-video-search\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced<\/a> that they\u2019ll now link to key moments in YouTube videos directly on the SERP. If the content creator includes timestamp information in the video description, Google will use that to highlight key moments and direct users where they want to go. Here\u2019s how the new feature looks in action:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5da554de-65d6-4100-b93a-6f255d9dbddc\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-changes-nofollow-links-key-moments-in-youtube-videos.png\" alt=\"google-changes-nofollow-links-youtube-timestamp\" width=\"249\" height=\"500\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Via Google.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/12\/video-scripts\">creating YouTube videos<\/a> is part of your content marketing strategy (we recommend it), start including specific timestamp information in your video descriptions. As users get accustomed to this new feature, some may begin to disregard videos that don\u2019t allow them to skim through. To avoid a decline in valuable traffic directly from the SERP, start adding timestamps today.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In this edition of the online advertising news round-up, we look at Google changing nofollow links, Facebook testing in-app checkout, and more!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":118,"featured_media":13170,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[11],"tags":[],"dipi_cpt_category":[],"class_list":["post-13169","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-industry-news"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v25.8 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Google Changes Nofollow Link Guidelines &amp;
