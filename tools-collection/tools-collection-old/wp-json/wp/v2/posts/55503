The metaverse<\/h3>\n<p>So we\u2019re not referring to Facebook [entirely] here. The metaverse refers to the virtual world of augmented reality, virtual reality, 3D holographic avatars, and video\u2014and not just one-off experiences like with gaming, but a persistent environment where people work, play, and socialize.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/digital-marketing-trends-augmented-reality.jpg\" alt=\"digital marketing trends - augmented reality ad example\" width=\"720\" height=\"452\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-55538\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/digital-marketing-trends-augmented-reality.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/digital-marketing-trends-augmented-reality-480x301.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.iboson.io\/augmented-reality-in-marketing-advertisement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Per Patrick Casey, director of growth marketing at digital health brand\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/felixforyou.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Felix Health<\/a>, there\u2019s good reason the metaverse is generating so much buzz lately\u2014and brands should be thinking about this virtual space as part of their 2022 marketing strategies.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s in part because it has the potential to offer an <strong>entirely new set of performance metrics.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cMarketers will be able to experiment with how long virtual objects are held, how much space they take up in a user&#8217;s peripheral vision, and even where users are looking when experiencing an ad,\u201d he said. \u201cThese insights have the potential to completely re-map what you know about your audience, providing invaluable direction going forward.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Kent Lewis, president of digital marketing agency <a href=\"https:\/\/www.anvilmediainc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anvil Media<\/a>, agreed many brands will dabble with virtual worlds in 2022 and even though consumers \u201cmay be a few years from caring about the metaverse,\u201d <strong>brands can still benefit from a first-mover advantage.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/2022-digital-marketing-trends-quote-about-metaverse.png\" alt=\"2022 digital marketing trends - quote about metaverse\" width=\"720\" height=\"275\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-55585\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/2022-digital-marketing-trends-quote-about-metaverse.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/2022-digital-marketing-trends-quote-about-metaverse-480x183.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>2. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)<\/h3>\n<p>Beyond figuring out where brands fit in the metaverse, they\u2019ll also have to experiment more with blockchain technology to prepare for Web 3.0\u2014the next evolution of the web, which will be more decentralized, added Zach Passarella, marketing director of nutraceutical brand <a href=\"https:\/\/smpnutra.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Supplement Manufacturing Partners<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis preparation taken will pay off in the near future when the web turns into more of this type of realm after 2022,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>One trending aspect of blockchain is non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Non-fungible means it can&#8217;t be exchanged for something of equal value, because it doesn&#8217;t have any equals. For example, the U.S. dollar is fungible. You can exchange a $100 bill for five $20 bills. But you can&#8217;t exchange your grandmother&#8217;s wedding ring\u2014a non-fungible\u2014for anything of equal value, because there&#8217;s an authenticity factor.<\/p>\n<p>NFTs are the digital version of non-fungibles\u2014uniquely created digital assets like an animation, graphic design, GIF, audio\/video file, or meme\u2014that exist on a blockchain.<\/p>\n<p>With brands like Campbell\u2019s, Charmin, and Coca-Cola issuing NFT collectibles last year, Jeff Mains, CEO of consulting firm <a href=\"http:\/\/championleadership.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Champion Leadership Group<\/a>, noted it\u2019s a good time for other brands to figure out how they can<strong> tap into these digital assets so they aren\u2019t left behind<\/strong>.<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/digital-marketing-trends-nft-charmin.png\" alt=\"2022 digital marketing trends - Charmin NFT\" width=\"500\" height=\"667\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-55539\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/digital-marketing-trends-nft-charmin.png 500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/digital-marketing-trends-nft-charmin-480x640.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In addition, as brands like Adidas start to partner with NFT collections like the Bored Ape Yacht Club, Faizan Fahim, marketing manager at cloud hosting platform <a href=\"https:\/\/breeze.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Breeze.io<\/a>, noted we can expect more partnerships\u2014and even brands starting to sell or give away their own NFTs as a way to<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/brand-community\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong> build community among their customers<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Cryptocurrency<\/h3>\n<p>In a similar vein, we\u2019ll continue to see the proliferation of cryptocurrencies in 2022 and savvy marketers will keep their eyes on this trend toward decentralized finance.<\/p>\n<p>While still only used by a niche U.S. audience, accepting cryptocurrency now could help brands attract new customers\u2014<strong>but only if the demographic is the right fit<\/strong>, said Andrea Chapman, marketing manager at cannabis site <a href=\"https:\/\/www.natureandbloom.com\/\">Nature and Bloom<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/2022-marketing-trends-cryptocurrency-quote.png\" alt=\"digital marketing trends 2022 - quote about cryptocurrency\" width=\"720\" height=\"281\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-55586\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/2022-marketing-trends-cryptocurrency-quote.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/2022-marketing-trends-cryptocurrency-quote-480x187.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn relation to payments, for example, cryptocurrencies are driving massive changes in relation to the biggest processors like Visa, PayPal, and MasterCard,\u201d added Shaun Heng, vice president of growth and operations at price-tracking site <a href=\"https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CoinMarketCap<\/a>. \u201cThis has big implications on how products and services <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/07\/customer-engagement-strategy\">engage with their customers<\/a> and marketers will be eager to align themselves with the potential for increased demographic reach.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/2022-digital-marketing-trends-blockchain.jpeg\" alt=\"2022 digital marketing trends - cryptocurrency adoption timeline\" width=\"720\" height=\"494\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-55540\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/2022-digital-marketing-trends-blockchain.jpeg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/2022-digital-marketing-trends-blockchain-480x329.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>2022 digital marketing trends to continue<\/h2>\n<p>These two trends should come as no surprise to you.

Zero &amp; first-party data<\/h3>\n<p>Marketers still have another year until Google phases out third-party cookies, which means 2022 will be the most important year for data and privacy yet.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of really good marketers still fail to realize that, in reality, your audience is owned by Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or any other social media network you use,\u201d said Brian Snedvig, CEO <a href=\"https:\/\/jofibo.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jofibo<\/a>, which helps job seekers create resumes and cover letters. \u201cYou don&#8217;t have control over them.

Supply chain buffering<\/h3>\n<p>The 2021 holidays may be over, but headlines continue to blare about supply chain bottlenecks and their negative impact on the customer experience. That\u2019s why Chelsea Cohen, co-founder of Amazon inventory management platform <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sostocked.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SoStocked<\/a>, recommends <strong>aligning marketing goals with stock capacity.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In addition, brands will benefit from <strong>maintaining 30-day buffer stock.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cYour buffer stock, or backup inventory, safeguards you from stocking out during unexpected upsells,\u201d Cohen added. \u201cIt ensures that there\u2019s always enough product available to meet shipping deadlines, so customers won\u2019t have to wait extra time for their order while you restock.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/digital-marketing-trends-2022-supply-chain.png\" alt=\"2022 digital marketing trends - quote about supply chain\" width=\"720\" height=\"261\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-55590\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/digital-marketing-trends-2022-supply-chain.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/digital-marketing-trends-2022-supply-chain-480x174.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>2022 digital marketing trends to try<\/h2>\n<p>These two trends are super doable, no matter your business size.<\/p>\n<h3>6.

Gender neutrality<\/h3>\n<p>In 2021, we saw brands like Old Navy and Pacific Sunwear release gender-neutral clothing collections. This trend toward inclusivity is ongoing.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/2022-digital-marketing-trends-gender-neutral.png\" alt=\"2022 digital marketing trends - gender neutral products\" width=\"720\" height=\"379\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-55545\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/2022-digital-marketing-trends-gender-neutral.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/2022-digital-marketing-trends-gender-neutral-480x253.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In fact, Damien Buxton, managing director of web design firm <a href=\"https:\/\/midascreative.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Midas Creative<\/a>, expects to see more brands shy away from traditional gender roles in their marketing efforts to prevent alienating any customers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe dynamics of households and people have changed and continue to change,\u201d he said. \u201cMarketing will become more gender-neutral and less focused on pre-conceived\u00a0ideas of what sex an individual is and what they should be seeing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Stewart McGrenary, director at mobile recycling comparison site <a href=\"https:\/\/freedom-mobiles.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Freedom Mobiles<\/a>, agreed it is now vital \u201cfor brands to authentically reflect a range of backgrounds within their marketing messages\u201d as the population diversifies more and more.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s in part because showing customers other individuals who look and live like they do helps consumers feel represented and therefore drawn to that brand, added Nathalie Walton, CEO of wellness app <a href=\"https:\/\/app.expectful.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Expectful<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Accessibility<\/h3>\n<p>We can also expect to see more accessibility from brands, like department store JCPenney, which released an inclusive line of children\u2019s clothing, including pieces for kids with disabilities, last year.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/2022-digital-marketing-trends-jc-penny-adaptable-clothing.png\" alt=\"2022 digital marketing trends - adaptable clothing line\" width=\"720\" height=\"309\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-55592\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/2022-digital-marketing-trends-jc-penny-adaptable-clothing.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/2022-digital-marketing-trends-jc-penny-adaptable-clothing-480x206.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Consultant <a href=\"https:\/\/about.me\/svetlanakouznetsova\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Svetlana Kouznetsova<\/a>, who works with businesses on improving their accessibility strategies, noted there are nearly two billion disabled people worldwide, who have $1.9 trillion in disposable income.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf our needs are ignored, businesses will lose not only us, but also our family, friends, and colleagues that that make up another 3.4 billion potential customers,\u201d she said. \u201cTogether we control $13 trillion.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Carter Seuthe, CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mycreditsummit.com\/payday-loan-consolidation.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Credit Summit Payday Loan Consolidation<\/a>, agreed the push for accessibility \u201cwidens your audience and allows people who wouldn&#8217;t normally consider your products the chance to be exposed to them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/2022-digital-marketing-trends-accessibility-quote-1.png\" alt=\"2022 digital marketing trends - quote about accessibility\" width=\"720\" height=\"279\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-55588\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/2022-digital-marketing-trends-accessibility-quote-1.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/2022-digital-marketing-trends-accessibility-quote-1-480x186.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>2022 digital marketing trends [recap]<\/h2>\n<p>Some of these trends will may be easier for your business to hop onto than others.
