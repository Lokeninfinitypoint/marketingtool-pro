Facebook advertisers have two main options when running lead gen campaigns: using the Conversion campaign objective to send prospects to landing pages or using the Lead Generation objective (and lead ads) to convert leads within Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>Here at WordStream, we wanted to find out which method was more effective. We pulled the data, presented it, and offered some strategies to help Facebook <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/28\/cross-channel-lead-generation\">lead gen advertisers<\/a> get <em>way<\/em> more out of these campaign types.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/2019-Facebook-Ads-Virtual-Summit-Share-Banner-740x387_0.png\" alt=\"Facebook Lead Ads vs. Landing Pages\" width=\"740\" height=\"387\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In the weeks that followed, we received numerous emails from those among the over 16,000 registrants (and from those who heard about the event after the fact) asking for a recording of the content. That recording currently lives with Mobile Monkey (you can access all 10 of the sessions for a <a href=\"https:\/\/mobilemonkey.com\/summits\/facebook-ads\/\">very reasonable $49<\/a>); so for those who didn\u2019t catch the session, we\u2019re going to give you an in-depth (and free!) rundown of the content here today on the WordStream blog.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s dive in!<\/p>\n<h2>Background: Facebook Lead Ads in a Nutshell<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/small-business-guide-to-facebook-lead-ads\/\">Facebook lead ads<\/a> are nothing new (although<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/26\/generate-leads-facebook-ads-ios14\"> newly important post-iOS 14!<\/a>). They\u2019ve been around for two or three years. When we talk to Facebook advertisers, however, we typically get the sense that lead ads do not yet enjoy universal usage\u2014that there are a lot of advertisers out there that are still not leveraging lead ads to their max potential.<\/p>\n<p>What exactly is a Facebook lead ad? It looks like this:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lead-ads-data.png\" alt=\"Facebook Lead Ads vs. Landing Pages\" width=\"1622\" height=\"914\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You\u2019re looking at three main components when you\u2019re running this ad type.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The prospect scrolls through her News Feed. She clicks the call to action, which in this case is a Subscribe button, but could be any one of eight total options depending on your goal.<\/li>\n<li>A form opens up within the ad. The prospect enters her information into the form. Here that\u2019s just her name and email, but there are a number of other fields you would have her fill out if you really wanted to qualify her.<\/li>\n<li>She submits her information and becomes a lead.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>On the back end\u2014this is what that\u2019s going to look like for the advertiser. At the campaign level, you\u2019re choosing the Lead Generation objective.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lead-ad-data-campaign-type.png\" alt=\"Facebook Lead Ads vs. Landing Pages Campaign\" width=\"941\" height=\"466\" \/><\/div>\n<p>At the Ad Set level, you\u2019re connecting your Business page, choosing your targeting and placements, and setting your budget and bid strategy.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lead-ad-data-ad-set.png\" alt=\"Facebook Lead Ads vs. Landing Pages Ad Set\" width=\"397\" height=\"322\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Next, at the Ad level, things start to look a little different. You have your creative, your ad text, your headline copy, and your eight options for a CTA button; at the bottom, you\u2019re also going to see this \u201cInstant Form\u201d field.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lead-ad-data-form.png\" alt=\"Facebook Lead Ads vs. Landing Pages Lead Ad\" width=\"572\" height=\"847\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The instant form is what makes the lead ad a lead ad. This is where you, as the advertiser, specify what kinds of information you want to collect from your prospect.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lead-ad-data-form-2.png\" alt=\"Facebook Lead Ads vs. Landing Pages Lead Form 2\" width=\"918\" height=\"539\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You do that by either using a saved form, creating a new one from scratch, or working off an existing form and just changing certain information. Let me explain each of these customization fields:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Form Type.<\/strong> This is where you\u2019re choosing to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads\">optimize<\/a> your form for either more volume or higher intent. Facebook accomplishes the higher intent piece by adding a review step that gives prospects a chance to confirm their information before they submit it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Intro<\/strong>. This appears right at the top of your form and gives prospects more descriptive information about your form.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Questions<\/strong>. Here you\u2019re specifying which contact, demographic, and employment information you want from your prospects, and you\u2019re also adding any custom questions that are necessary for you to qualify your leads.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Privacy Policy. <\/strong>Because you\u2019re collecting people\u2019s personal information, you have to link to your company\u2019s privacy policy.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Thank You Screen<\/strong>. This is where you\u2019re customizing what people see <em>after <\/em>they submit their information.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To give you a look at what this looks like in the wild, here is a lead ad from our account where we\u2019re promoting our Hacking Google Ads guide as a way of generating leads.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lead-ad-data-finished.png\" alt=\"Facebook Lead Ads vs. Landing Pages Conversions\" width=\"497\" height=\"610\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You can see it looks pretty much like a standard ad. But then it opens up to <a href=\"https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/inline-images\/ezgif-1-6138252a7ff8.gif?e9cM5ScfjbFN1w7FhpfjG6OoMzyuaZBr\">this nice lead form <\/a>where we have an intro explaining what\u2019s in the guide, and we\u2019re able to ask all the questions we <em>know<\/em> we need to ask in order to qualify our prospects.<\/p>\n<p>And then finally we have the customized thank you screen from which our newly acquired lead can easily download the guide.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facbook-lead-ad-data-thank-you.png\" alt=\"Facebook Lead Ads vs. Landing Pages\" width=\"474\" height=\"777\" \/><\/div>\n<p>That\u2019s Facebook lead ad creation in a nutshell! And what makes this user flow so unique? <strong>The prospect never has to leave the Facebook app to give us their information. <\/strong>The prospect doesn\u2019t have to go to a landing page in a new window and doesn\u2019t have to wait for that landing page to load. This is hands down the biggest advantage of using Facebook leads ads.<\/p>\n<p>It takes <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/blog\/2015\/04\/takes-6-8-touches-generate-viable-sales-lead-heres-why-gp.html\">six to eight touches<\/a><\/u> to generate a viable sales lead. And when you start to think about all the steps a prospect has to go through in your own organization before they become \u201cviable\u201d or \u201cqualified,\u201d that number might seem pretty conservative. It takes <strong>legitimate time and effort<\/strong> to get quality leads. Any time you can streamline that process, you\u2019re giving yourself a huge advantage.<\/p>\n<h2>The Alternative: Conversion Campaigns and Landing Pages<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re a lead gen advertiser on Facebook, your alternative to Lead Generation campaigns is going to be Conversion campaigns. If you\u2019re selecting Conversions as your campaign objective, your conversion goal is to <em>acquire a lead<\/em>, and in order to acquire that lead, you\u2019re sending prospects to a landing page to fill out a form. There is absolutely nothing wrong with using conversion campaigns if you\u2019re a lead gen advertiser. In fact, most of the advertisers we talk to give us the sense that they still rely pretty heavily on conversion campaigns to meet their targets. It\u2019s just a more traditional way of doing things.<\/p>\n<p>In the WordStream account, for example, we\u2019re using conversion campaigns to promote the exact same guide, Hacking Google Ads, with pretty much the exact same creative. As you can see, it\u2019s pretty hard to tell these ads apart in your News Feed.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lead-ad-data-conversion_0.png\" alt=\"Facebook Lead Ads vs. Landing Pages\" width=\"489\" height=\"739\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Even my mom, who is seriously tech savvy, couldn\u2019t tell the difference!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The main difference we\u2019re interested in here is the user flow. When you\u2019re running conversion campaigns, you\u2019re <em>always going to be sending your prospect to a landing page<\/em>. And as you can see, we ask pretty much the same questions and provide pretty much the same bullet points on our landing pages as we do in our lead ads.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lead-ad-data-landing-page.png\" alt=\"Facebook Lead Ads vs. Landing Pages\" width=\"1147\" height=\"704\" \/><\/div>\n<p>So the main difference here, again, is just the process of physically redirecting the user out of Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>Intuitively, this might seem like a disadvantage. Redirecting to a landing page means a <strong>longer wait time<\/strong>, <strong>more touches<\/strong>, and <strong>more information<\/strong> to digest before your prospect can become a lead, right? But\u2014what are some reasons this user flow <em>could <\/em>work in our favor? Well, all the same reasons!<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Longer wait time. <\/strong>If your prospect is willing to sit through a page load before entering their information, they are probably going to be a more <em>qualified<\/em> lead.<\/li>\n<li><strong>More touches. <\/strong>A prospect who clicks eight times before entering their information is probably going to be more invested in your brand than a prospect who clicks just three times.<\/li>\n<li><strong>More information. <\/strong>A prospect who digests more information about your business <em>before <\/em>becoming a lead is probably more likely to convert to a sale.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The <em>real<\/em> issue here is not, <em>Are conversion campaigns more effective than lead generation campaigns?<\/em> It\u2019s that Facebook lead gen seems to exist on this spectrum where the more we focus on increasing lead volume, the more we run the risk of losing quality; vice versa, the more we focus on quality, the more we run the risk of losing volume. And it seems at first blush like conversion campaigns and lead generation campaigns exist at opposite ends of this spectrum, right? Lead ads might allow you to get more leads, but those leads might be higher in the funnel than you\u2019re really looking for. On the flip side, landing pages might allow you to get more quality leads, but you\u2019re going to be generating way less of them.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lead-ad-data-inverse-spectrum.png\" alt=\"Facebook Lead Ads vs. Landing Pages Spectrum\" width=\"760\" height=\"286\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Quite an unhappy dilemma! Or is it? Let\u2019s dive into some of the data we pulled around these themes.<\/p>\n<h2>The Data: Leads Ads vs. Landing Pages<\/h2>\n<p>Here at WordStream, we wanted to test this proposition that <em>generally <\/em>speaking, lead ads convert to leads at a higher clip than landing pages. We also wanted to look at the relative cost of <em>acquiring<\/em> a lead in each campaign type. So we set out to measure <strong>conversion rate<\/strong> and <strong>cost per action<\/strong> for both lead generation and conversion campaigns, and we did so by pulling the data of all WordStream clients that were using those campaign types in the past 60 days. Our data set spanned over 3,000 campaigns and about $9.5 million in spend.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a look at what we found:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lead-ad-data-graph1-1.png\" alt=\"Facebook Lead Ads vs. Landing Pages Data\" width=\"1114\" height=\"739\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Campaigns using lead ads had an average conversion rate of 12.54%, and an average cost-per-action of $17.98. Campaigns using landing pages had an average conversion rate of 10.47%, and an average cost-per-action of $13.26. So while cost per action was higher, the takeaway here is that <strong>lead generation campaigns convert to leads (from clicks) at a 2.07% higher rate than conversion campaigns<\/strong>. Which, due to the more streamlined user flow, is something we expected!<\/p>\n<p>But this data only tells half the story, right? Because it doesn\u2019t tell us anything about the <em>quality <\/em>of leads being generated from each campaign.<\/p>\n<p>To get our data on quality, we decided to look at a lead-gen-specific business that not only has a <em>massive<\/em> data set, but also accessible CRM (Customer Relationship Management) data. That would allow us to see how well leads from each Facebook campaign type were performing on the sales side. Where could we find such a data set? Our in-house account here at WordStream!<\/p>\n<p>We used the same time period (60 days). And to give you an idea of the scope of the data we looked at, we accrued over 40,000 link clicks in that time period across the lead generation and conversion campaign types. What did the data tell us?<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lead-ad-data-graph2.png\" alt=\"Facebook Lead Ads vs. Landing Pages \" width=\"1166\" height=\"770\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Just like we saw in the customer data, <strong>lead generation campaigns converted to leads at a higher rate\u2014<\/strong>this time, an<strong> 11.7% higher rate<\/strong>. However, when you take into account what our business defines as a \u201cqualified\u201d lead, the story begins to skew pretty heavily toward conversion campaigns.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conversion campaigns had a 5.7% higher conversion rate to a \u201cqualified\u201d lead, and a 1.4% higher conversion rate to a demo<\/strong>. A \u201cdemo\u201d is when a lead ultimately requests a call from our sales team to demo our software. Given the importance of that action to our business, that 1.4% increase is pretty huge!<\/p>\n<p>We also noted that cost per quality lead was <em>significantly <\/em>lower in the conversion campaign group.<\/p>\n<p>The takeaway? Lead generation campaigns seem to be more effective across the board at converting clicks to leads. But conversion campaigns seem to take the cake when it comes to generating quality leads at a lower cost.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Drive Quality AND Quantity from Lead Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Remember that dilemma we looked at earlier, where we had lead quality and lead volume locked in a mutually exclusive proposition? Taking the data into account, we\u2019ve seen that landing pages correlate to better quality leads; maybe we\u2019re not hemorrhaging volume quite as much as we thought. On the flip side, we\u2019ve seen that lead ads definitely convert to leads a little bit more effectively, but maybe we\u2019re not leaving as much to be desired in the quality department as we once thought. So maybe these two campaign types are not as far off in performance as we once thought, and the model looks something like this:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lead-ad-data-spectrum202.png\" alt=\"Facebook Lead Ads vs. Landing Pages\" width=\"546\" height=\"297\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The question <em>I <\/em>think this poses is not<em> how do we run campaigns that don\u2019t sacrifice lead volume for lead quality? <\/em>The question is this: <em>How do we flip this model on its head and start running campaigns that get volume and quality running in the same direction? <\/em><\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s talk about some tactics that will help you do just that! And because we think lead ads are sophisticated enough at this point that you can really be discerning with the quality of leads your bringing in while still maintaining that easy, lightning-fast user experience, we\u2019re going to forget about conversion campaigns for a moment and focus on strategies that can help you optimize your lead ads for both volume and quality.<\/p>\n<h2>Tactic #1: Lookalike a paying customer<\/h2>\n<p>It stands to reason that if you want leads that ultimately convert to sales, you need to target Facebook users who are similar to your existing customers. Remarketing to your 30-day site traffic is great; creating lookalikes based on existing leads is even better. But if you can build a prospect pool that consists of people who share the same traits as the people who have already purchased your product or service, you\u2019re giving yourself the best chance to generate new leads that will turn into new customers.<\/p>\n<p>To underscore this a little more: Let\u2019s say you have three seed audiences, 60-day traffic to a product page, past webinar registrants, and an existing customer list.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lead-ad-data-lookalikes.png\" alt=\"Facebook Lead Ads vs. Landing Pages Lookalikes\" width=\"602\" height=\"347\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You can <em>hope<\/em> that the prospects who look like the 60-day product people will convert to sales, but you can\u2019t <em>expect<\/em> them to, because they\u2019re derived from an audience of people who have browsed your website, not bought your product or service. Same with the audience based on webinar registrants. You can <em>hope<\/em> that your lookalike is going to download that whitepaper, read it, then click that free trial CTA, but you can\u2019t realistically <em>expect <\/em>them to.<\/p>\n<p>Then you have the customer list. This is the beauty of lead ads. The format is so streamlined for lead collection that it gives you the luxury of being able to forget about how you can get a given prospect to become a lead, and start focusing on how you can get that same prospect to become a customer. And when you leverage lead ads in conjunction with a lookalike audience based on your existing customers, that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re doing\u2014you\u2019re putting that streamlined user experience in front of the people who are most likely to be in the market for your product or service at the time they see your ad.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s see what creating a customer lookalike looks like on the back end. First you have to create your custom audience, which is pretty simple. Just head to the Audiences tab in Ads Manager\u2026<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lead-ad-data-lookalikes1.png\" alt=\"Facebook Lead Ads vs. Landing Pages\" width=\"531\" height=\"245\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Click the Create Audience button, then select Custom Audience.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lead-ad-data-custom20audience.png\" alt=\"Facebook Lead Ads vs. Landing Pages\" width=\"316\" height=\"329\" \/><\/div>\n<p>And select Customer File.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lead-ad-data-customer-file.png\" alt=\"Facebook Lead Ads vs. Landing Pages Customer File\" width=\"470\" height=\"368\" \/><\/div>\n<p>From there, if you\u2019re a MailChimp user, you have the option to just import email addresses.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lead-ad-data-import.png\" alt=\"Facebook Lead Ads vs. Landing Pages Import\" width=\"470\" height=\"329\" \/><\/div>\n<p>But for most of us, we\u2019re going to be clicking the first option here where we\u2019re just simply uploading a spreadsheet.<\/p>\n<p>After you upload your email addresses, you\u2019re going to wait one to six hours for Facebook to build that custom audience for you. When that\u2019s done, head back to Create Audience &gt;Lookalike Audience&#8230;<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lead-ad-data-lookalike3.png\" alt=\"Facebook Lead Ads vs. Landing Pages\" width=\"308\" height=\"300\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Find your new custom audience in the source field, layer your location targeting, and set your audience size.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lead-ad-data-create-audience.png\" alt=\"Facebook Lead Ads vs. Landing Pages Audience\" width=\"627\" height=\"391\" \/><\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s really that simple!<\/p>\n<p>For audience size, I would recommend starting with 1%, which is the percentage of the population that most closely matches your existing customers, and then working out from there if your audience is too small.<\/p>\n<p>You can use this strategy with any campaign type, but it\u2019s so effective with lead generation campaigns specifically because, again, when you combine that streamlined lead ad experience with this kind of tight targeting, you no longer have to choose between volume and quality.<\/p>\n<h2>Tactic #2: Animate your creative<\/h2>\n<p>When I say animate here, I don\u2019t mean Mickey Mouse! I mean you should make your stuff move. I can tell you firsthand that every time our in-house acquisition team meets with the people at Facebook this is <strong>the number one tip they give us<\/strong>. We have implemented animated creative over the past six months and seen improvements across the board\u2014so much so that we rarely opt for static creative now when we\u2019re creating new Facebook ads.<\/p>\n<p>You have probably heard the tip <em>implement video creative in your marketing campaigns<\/em> a thousand different times in a thousand different ways, but let me tell you\u2014it doesn\u2019t even <em>have <\/em>to be a video. Here&#8217;s an\u00a0examples of a piece of animated creative we\u2019ve used in lead ads over the past few months:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"align-center aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ezgif-1-dfc8c905a862.gif\" alt=\"Facebook Lead Ads vs. Landing Pages\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"a7005e3b-0474-4984-bc9f-b35540305386\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is a gif; we simply took some static elements and animated them (harder than I\u2019m making it sound, but more on that in a second). But as I said, this is pretty much our modus operandi now whenever we come out with a new ad concept. We still w<em>ill <\/em>use static creative, but more often than not we are using some sort of short animated gif or video. We know it increases performance, so it\u2019s worth it for us to put that extra effort into designing it. What you\u2019re basically doing is giving your ads that thumb-stopping power everyone loves to talk about. You\u2019re differentiating yourself from the rest of the static elements in your prospect\u2019s News Feed.<\/p>\n<p>Gifs are great, but this is not to say that video doesn\u2019t have a place! While any animated creative is going to give your ad that thumb-stopping power, only video is going to allow you to <em>control the story<\/em>, and controlling the story is a crucial part of qualifying leads.<\/p>\n<p>What do I mean by that? Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a car dealer and you invest in a 15-second ad spot for your Audi convertible.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lead-ad-data-audi.png\" alt=\"Facebook Lead Ads vs. Landing Pages\" width=\"1268\" height=\"714\" \/><\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s nothing too complex, just a short clip of the car in motion, some of the interior features, and maybe a suave-looking guy behind the wheel in sunglasses. What you\u2019re doing by making that video is making an investment in your story; <strong>making an investment in your story means making an investment in your prospect<\/strong>. Investing in your prospect is so critical when you\u2019re serving lead ads. Because it\u2019s already going to be super easy for this prospect to become a lead, you want to make sure it\u2019s <em>just as easy for him to become a sale<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s easy enough for a prospect to see this Audi convertible in his News Feed, see the Get a Quote CTA, and say, <em>Hey, I wonder just out of curiosity how much my monthly payment would be if I financed this thing, I\u2019m going to submit my info<\/em>. But by investing in video, you\u2019re allowing this same prospect to see himself behind the wheel of the car. Ok, now he understands some of the interior features. Ok, now he sees how fast the thing is on the open road. This prospect understands the product, understands what he\u2019s clicking on when he clicks that Get a Quote CTA, and is much more likely to buy.<\/p>\n<h2>A Quick Shameless Plug<\/h2>\n<p>Shameless plug time!<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lead-ad-data-shameless-plug.png\" alt=\"Facebook Lead Ads vs. Landing Pages\" width=\"447\" height=\"570\" \/><\/div>\n<p>And I only offer this plug because I truly know how difficult it can be to create animated ad assets in-house\u2014especially if you\u2019re a small business owner, but even if you\u2019re an agency or you have a bigger team. At WordStream, we have a <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/25\/smart-ads-for-google-display\">super useful tool<\/a><\/em> within our software that helps advertisers get up and running with animated creative quickly and painlessly. It\u2019s called Smart Ads. If you\u2019re an advertiser, all you have to do is enter your URL, and we scrape your site for images and text to make super dynamic HTML5 ads. That basically means that we take your static creative and set it in motion. It looks like this.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"align-center aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/00096-300x250-1.gif\" alt=\"Facebook Lead Ads vs. Landing Pages\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"5fdc19de-e39a-4be6-8bd5-762989ac865a\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can add your new dynamic ad to your Facebook and\/or Display campaigns right from within the software.<\/p>\n<p>And then the other feature I would mention here is Smart Video Ads, which exists within the Smart Ads suite. This is where we template the entire video creation process out for you, give you music to choose from, and all you have to do is drag and drop your images and type in your copy. The final product is a super dynamic, super engaging video ad that, again, you can implement right in your Facebook lead ad campaigns. This will go a long way in helping you control your story, qualify the leads your generating, and make it really easy for that prospect to become a sale <em>after<\/em> he becomes a lead.<\/p>\n<h2>Tactic #3: Ask the right questions (and the right amount!)<\/h2>\n<p>The instant form within your lead ad can have up to 15 custom questions and up to 21 questions total. Now obviously, if you can get a prospect to answer 21 questions before tapping submit, you are going to know <em>everything<\/em> about this person\u2014from their favorite color to their first girlfriend\u2019s name to how they take their coffee. But your prospect\u2019s not going to want to answer all those questions. And not all those questions are going to be absolutely vital to your sales process. This is where asking the right questions, and asking the right amount of questions, is absolutely critical.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at a bit more data. AdEspresso ran a really cool study a year or so back where they looked at how the amount of questions you ask in your instant form impacts your cost-per-lead. Their conclusion, which goes with our theme, was that <em>t<\/em>he more questions you have on your lead form, the higher your cost per lead will be. Conversely, by removing too many barriers between the user and conversion, you run the risk of attracting low-quality leads\/conversions.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/data-table.png\" alt=\"Facebook Lead Ads vs. Landing Pages Data\" width=\"816\" height=\"381\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This is nothing novel, and it goes back to that inverse relationship between quality and volume we presented earlier. But the interesting thing for me here is that when you look at the numbers, cost-per-lead rises astronomically after five questions. It\u2019s like people are totally fine with answering five questions but then if you ask them to answer one more they\u2019re like, \u201cOh no, I\u2019m going to make you pay for that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I think five questions is a good benchmark to go on here, but what I really think this data is telling us is this: <strong>Understand the objective of a given lead ad campaign, and how the leads you\u2019ll get from that campaign fit into your sales funnel<\/strong>. Then, ask the <strong>fewest amount of questions possible to get the most vital information you can<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>So for instance, if you\u2019re running a top-of-funnel lead gen campaign, and you know you\u2019re going to be sending those leads to your nurture team for further <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/25\/lead-qualification\">lead qualification<\/a>, then just ask for a name, an email address, and whatever other vital information your email marketing team needs to blast those leads. If you think you have a really good offer and really good creative, on the other hand, and your goal is to send leads right to your sales team, then ask for the information you know your sales team needs to segment those leads and hit them with calls. You\u2019re going to generate a ton of leads with these campaigns\u2014we saw that with the conversion rates. But extra leads is not a problem if you ask the sorts of super discriminating questions that are going to make it easy for your team to push those leads through the funnel.<\/p>\n<h2>If there\u2019s one thing you should take away\u2026<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Facebook lead ads are heavily underutilized.<\/strong> Because conversion campaigns have traditionally been the way of doing things, lead ads haven\u2019t achieved that ubiquitous status yet. And that means that, for all you advertisers reading this, you can use those conversion rates we talked about to generate more leads than your competitors. And you can combine them with some \u00a0tactics we talked about today to generate the <em>kinds <\/em>of leads that are going to make you a profit.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Which perform better: Facebook lead ads or landing pages?
