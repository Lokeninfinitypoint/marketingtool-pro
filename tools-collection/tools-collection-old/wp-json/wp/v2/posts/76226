Something like \u201c<em>South Florida &#8211; Search<\/em>\u201d would be a good name going off our previous examples.<\/p>\n<p>Google is going to ask you about your bidding preferences, but we\u2019ll cover that later.

By default, your ads also show on Google Search and Display networks.

An important note is that by default, Google shows your ads to \u201cpeople in, regularly in, or who&#8217;ve shown interest in your targeted locations.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This means that your ads will show up to <em>anyone<\/em> searching your keywords, regardless of their location.

Start by <em>excluding<\/em> countries that have a reputation for click farms and have a very low chance of delivering relevant traffic.<\/p>\n<p>Some recommended negative locations to start with are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>China<\/li>\n<li>India<\/li>\n<li>Indonesia<\/li>\n<li>The Philippines<\/li>\n<li>Bangladesh<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Create audience segments to improve campaign efficiency<\/h4>\n<p>Lastly, we\u2019re going to address audience segments, which will allow us to hyper-focus on Google\u2019s in-market audiences. These are consumers who are <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/displayvideo\/answer\/6213232\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">actively researching products or services<\/a> and considering buying something.<\/p>\n<p>Look up \u201c<em>real estate<\/em>\u201d and select in-market audiences that have a \u201cFor Sale\u201d label.

These are responsive ads, which means that Google <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/05\/responsive-search-ad-copy\">combines different variations<\/a> of the headlines and descriptions we provide to make a final ad.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/how-responsive-search-ads-work.webp\" alt=\"how responsive search ads work\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76246\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/how-responsive-search-ads-work.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/how-responsive-search-ads-work-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Begin your ad by inserting your final URL, which is the page a user will go to when they click your ad. This will be your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/great-landing-pages\">landing page<\/a>\u2014we&#8217;ll have more on fine-tuning that below.<\/p>\n<p>Then you\u2019ll want to choose a display path, which allows us to simplify the final URL to look more appealing in our ad. You can get creative here, but we usually advise using straightforward and clean display paths.<\/p>\n<h4>Create powerful headlines and descriptions for your ad<\/h4>\n<p>This brings us to our headlines, where we will be the main text in our ad. To <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/02\/ppc-ad-headlines\">create great ad headlines<\/a>, you want to keep some vital tips in mind:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Use keywords:<\/strong> Use the keywords you are targeting. These are, after all, what your potential clients are searching for.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Address pain points:<\/strong> Think about what your ideal client is really searching for and how you can solve their problem. Offering free home valuations or listings for sale are common magnets in the real estate industry, but don\u2019t be afraid to think of your own.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Include data and numbers: <\/strong>Feel free to include things like median home prices, number of active or sold listings, or other relevant statistics.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use pinned placements: <\/strong>You can keep each headline in positions one, two, or three, using the pin to the right of each box. It\u2019s critical to keep your headlines organized and intentional with these pins.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>After that, we\u2019re going to conjure up four descriptions, which will show up underneath the headlines. Writing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/18\/create-winner-text-ad-description\">winning Google Ad descriptions<\/a> starts with keeping your points short and relevant and including numbers and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/05\/best-call-to-action-phrases\">calls to action<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-for-real-estate-descriptions.webp\" alt=\"google ads for real estate - example of writing google ads description\" width=\"936\" height=\"319\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76247\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-for-real-estate-descriptions.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-for-real-estate-descriptions-480x164.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Use assets to improve interaction with your ad<\/h4>\n<p>Now that our ads are looking sharp, we\u2019re going to address some of the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/7331111?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">assets<\/a> that are available. These are extra pieces of information, previously called extensions, that can help your ad stand out and generate conversions.<\/p>\n<p>The initial asset we\u2019ll set up is <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/2375416?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sitelinks<\/a>, and these are additional links that show underneath your ad take visitors to relevant sub-niches that are under the umbrella of what you\u2019re offering.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-for-real-estate-ad-assets.webp\" alt=\"google ads for real estate - example of ad assets\" width=\"791\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76248\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-for-real-estate-ad-assets.webp 791w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-for-real-estate-ad-assets-480x363.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 791px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can then list out some callouts, which are additional text that quickly tell consumers why your real estate business is unique or what you specialize in.<\/p>\n<p>For example, in South Florida, we might use callouts such as <em>relocation<\/em>, <em>first-time buyers<\/em>, and <em>luxury specialists<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>There are quite a few assets that you can play around with and visualize how they improve your ad and offering. For real estate lead generation, pay close attention to the Structured Snippet, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/07\/google-ads-location-assets-enhancements\">Location<\/a>, and Calls assets.<\/p>\n<p>The Image assets are also a wonderful way to get your ad noticed, but they can\u2019t be used until your account is 90 days old.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-for-real-estate-ad-assets-structured-snippet.webp\" alt=\"google ads for real estate structured snippet asset example\" width=\"789\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76249\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-for-real-estate-ad-assets-structured-snippet.webp 789w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-for-real-estate-ad-assets-structured-snippet-480x364.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 789px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The Structure Snippet asset enables real estate companies to indicate the neighborhoods they serve.<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>Choose a suitable landing page<\/h4>\n<p>Remember the final URL we talked about? Well, let\u2019s go over picking relevant <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/07\/real-estate-landing-pages\">real estate landing pages<\/a> that potential clients are sent to when they click our ad.<\/p>\n<p>First and foremost, the landing page you send visitors to should give them exactly what they are looking for.<\/p>\n<p>If your ad group is focused on Miami, and your ad promotes \u201c<em>Miami Homes for Sale,<\/em>\u201d then your final URL should be active real estate listings.<\/p>\n<p>An ad that has headlines about \u201c<em>Free Home Valuations<\/em>\u201d should take the user to a page where they can easily get just that. It&#8217;s critical in real estate lead generation to be very consistent with this rule.<\/p>\n<p>A big mistake many will make is sending all visitors of every ad to some static page of their website. Then the potential customer has to dig around to find the information they really wanted in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>You also want to have one clear and apparent call to action so the visitor knows what they need to do to get the piece of value you are providing them.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-for-real-estate-landing-page-example.webp\" alt=\"google ads for real estate landing page example\" width=\"936\" height=\"481\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-for-real-estate-landing-page-example.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-for-real-estate-landing-page-example-480x247.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Example of a high-quality real estate landing page.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Give your target audience what they are seeking, and they will be more likely to convert and see you as the authority in the real estate space.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 5: Set your campaign budget<\/h3>\n<p>At the end of the campaign setup, you\u2019re going to set a daily budget for Google to use. This can be changed depending on your needs or industry seasonality, so set it at whatever is comfortable for your business.<\/p>\n<p>Google Ads also provides an array of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/11\/easy-adwords-bidding-strategies\">bidding strategies<\/a>, but we really only need to hone in on the main options:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Maximize Clicks:<\/strong> An automated bidding strategy that is designed to bring you the most clicks possible using your daily budget.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Maximize Conversions:<\/strong> A bidding strategy that automatically sets bids to help get the most conversions possible based on your daily budget.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Target CPA (Cost per Acquisition):<\/strong> This is my recommended strategy. It sets bids to help get as many conversions as possible at the target CPA that you set.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Step 6: Set up conversion tracking<\/h3>\n<p>As I said before, most real estate professionals starting out with Google Ads will begin maximizing clicks, but you are definitely going to want to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/08\/google-ads-conversion-tracking-mistakes\">set up conversion tracking<\/a> since we ultimately want to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/30\/google-ads-conversion-tracking\">optimize for leads<\/a> and sales.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-for-real-estate-conversion-tracking-set-up.webp\" alt=\"google ads for real estate - conversion tracking set up\" width=\"936\" height=\"358\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76251\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-for-real-estate-conversion-tracking-set-up.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-for-real-estate-conversion-tracking-set-up-480x184.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Under \u201cTools and Settings,\u201d go to \u201cConversions\u201d to set up a new conversion action.

Continually monitor key metrics<\/h3>\n<p>As your campaign runs, keep a close eye on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/09\/20\/ppc-metrics-ultimate-guide\">critical metrics<\/a> to gauge your campaign&#8217;s performance. Monitor important metrics like cost per conversion, click-through rate (CTR), cost per click (CPC), and conversion rate to assess which ads and ad groups are most effective.<\/p>\n<p>We can evaluate the effectiveness of our ads by going to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a> or a similar tool that will analyze a campaign\u2019s performance and give us some actionable steps to improve it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-for-real-estate-performance-grader.webp\" alt=\"google ads for real estate google ads grader from wordstream by localiq\" width=\"936\" height=\"343\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76252\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-for-real-estate-performance-grader.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-for-real-estate-performance-grader-480x176.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\ud83e\uddd0 Want to know how your metrics compare to others in real estate? <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteGoogleAdsBenchmarks2023.html?cid=Web_WS_incontent_guide_2023benchmarks_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incontent_links\">Download our search advertising benchmarks<\/a>!<\/div><\/div>\n<h3>2. Review your campaign\u2019s search terms<\/h3>\n<p>Regularly review the search terms that trigger your ads to show up. This insight helps you refine your keyword and negative keyword lists so that your ads only appear for relevant queries.<\/p>\n<h3>3. A\/B test your ads<\/h3>\n<p>Test <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/03\/20\/ppc-campaign-testing-tips\">different ad variations<\/a> and strategies to identify what resonates best with your potential clients. Create multiple ads with different headlines, descriptions, and calls to action to gauge which are giving you the most bang for your buck.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-for-real-estate-ab-test-example.webp\" alt=\"google ads for real estate ab test example\" width=\"936\" height=\"567\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76253\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-for-real-estate-ab-test-example.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-ads-for-real-estate-ab-test-example-480x291.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>4. Build relationships<\/h3>\n<p>Don&#8217;t focus solely on getting leads. Real estate is all about building relationships and Google Ads are just an avenue to grow your database. Provide value and come from a place of contribution and you\u2019ll have long-term success.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Commit to a follow-up plan<\/h3>\n<p>Effective follow-up is crucial in the real estate business, and it\u2019s even more pressing in the digital sphere. <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/email-marketing-tips-for-lead-nurturing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nurture leads<\/a> through email campaigns, phone calls, and personal touches to keep your services top of mind.<\/p>\n<h3>6.

Setting up, managing, and continually optimizing your Google Ads account is the first step in owning your lead source rather than relying on buying leads or waiting for your phone to ring.<\/p>\n<p>Use this as an evergreen cheat sheet when you\u2019re creating or reviewing new campaigns, and remember that it&#8217;s not just about running ads. The goal is ultimately to deliver value and build relationships that continue to pay dividends for your real estate business for years to come.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This guide has everything you need to set up, create, and run successful Google Ads for your real estate
