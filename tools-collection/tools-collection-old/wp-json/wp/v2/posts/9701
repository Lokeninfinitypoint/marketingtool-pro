So how do they get these email addresses in the first place? They ask. Placing call to action phrases and buttons on your website and other forms of content is a great way to collect email addresses to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/11\/how-to-build-an-email-list\">build your email list<\/a>. Below are 20\u00a0real examples of email signup calls to action that help to illustrate\u00a0call to action best practices.<\/p>\n<h2>Call to action examples for email signups<\/h2>\n<p>With first-party data becoming more important than ever, getting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/05\/increase-email-signups\">email signups<\/a> is crucial. Let&#8217;s take a look at some real subscribe CTAs, to help you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/11\/email-list-building\">build your list<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Nuzzle<\/h3>\n<p>With the adorable little fella in this call to action, how could we not include this example? All cute pups aside, we also like the simplicity of the design and the attractive colors. NOTE: This does not mean you should use your pooch to get email signups. Nuzzle is a dog collar company, so this image is relevant to their business.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call20to20action20examples20for20email20signups-nuzzle-1.png\" alt=\"call to action examples for email signups-nuzzle\" width=\"592\" height=\"334\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>2. Business Development Bank of Canada<\/h3>\n<p>We like a few things about this email signup call to action. The \u201cFREE\u201d, in red and all caps, informs the user of important information right off the bat. The description below is short yet it lets you know exactly what you\u2019re getting, and how. By reassuring that you\u00a0can unsubscribe at any time, and including a visual example on the left, BDC reduces the risk and uncertainty of signing up.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call20to20action20examples20for20email20newsletter20signups-20Business20Development20Bank20of20Canada-1.png\" alt=\"call to action examples for email newsletter signups- Business Development Bank of Canada\" width=\"600\" height=\"745\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>3. Cabot<\/h3>\n<p>While the previous\u00a0call to action uses detail and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/27\/design-thinking\">design<\/a>, this one uses more simplicity and exclusivity. \u201cBecome a Cabot Insider\u201d appeals to the human\u00a0desire to be a part of something special. The short description lets users\u00a0know exactly what to expect, and the green color of the subscribe button creates a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/18\/welcome-email\">welcoming<\/a> and safe feel.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call20to20action20examples20for20email20newsletter20signups-cabot-1.png\" alt=\"call to action examples for email newsletter signups-cabot\" width=\"600\" height=\"465\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>4.\u00a0Digital Trends<\/h3>\n<p>Digital Trends does not go into extreme detail about what you will get for signing up for their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/25\/email-newsletter-ideas\">email newsletter<\/a>. They assume that you are on their site to get their Computing News and thus will have an idea of what a recap will look like. Instead of detail, they focus more on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/05\/how-to-increase-urgency\">urgency<\/a> with their \u201cDon\u2019t Fall Behind\u201d headline, as well as on asking for permission to send additional emails. Another unique aspect of this call to action example is that the \u201cno\u201d option is not an X, but a longer, more human-sounding statement.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call20to20action20examples20for20email20newsletter20signups20digital20trends-1.png\" alt=\"call to action examples for email newsletter signups digital trends\" width=\"550\" height=\"757\" \/><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><strong>\ud83d\udcd7 Free guide<\/strong> &gt;&gt; <\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download\" class=\"waffle-rich-text-link\">The 36 Best Call to Action Phrases (Ever)<\/a><\/strong><span><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/div><\/div><\/span><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<h3>5.\u00a0The Country Cook<\/h3>\n<p>What we like about Country Cook\u2019s email signup call to action is its <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/06\/personalized-marketing\">personalized<\/a> language and attractive\u00a0design. Words like \u201cpop\u201d and \u201cgimme\u201d add some fun and excitement. The message below the actual button addresses some of the hesitations a user might have and adds a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/12\/23\/humanize-brand\">human element <\/a>to this digital box. There are quite a few exclamation points in here, which has its pros and its cons. In addition, the black color of the field text draws attention away from the rest of the elements in the call to action, which may or may not be intended.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call20to20action20examples20for20email20newsletter20signups20the20country20cook-1.png\" alt=\"call to action examples for email newsletter signups the country cook\" width=\"700\" height=\"471\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>6.\u00a0DIY Site<\/h3>\n<p>This <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/11\/at-home-diy-video\">DIY<\/a> site uses the same approach as Country Cook, creating the feel that a human is calling you to this action. In addition, the simplicity of the message, the use of bold font and contrasting colors, and the big white arrow makes this an <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2010\/09\/29\/unusual-effective-calls-to-action\">eye-catching\u00a0graphic<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call20to20action20examples20for20email20newsletter20sigups20DIY-2-1.png\" alt=\"call to action examples for email newsletter signups DIY\" width=\"800\" height=\"506\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>7. SMS Global<\/h3>\n<p>This email signup call to action takes an effective approach of highlighting first the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/21\/features-vs-benefits\">benefit<\/a> to the reader (\u201cGrow Your Knowledge\u201d). The use of \u201cDon\u2019t Fall Behind\u201d in example #4 has a similar effect but more of a negative connotation. This call to action also appeals to the human desires of belonging (\u201cJoin thousands\u201d) and exclusivity (Don\u2019t miss out!). Finally, the use of \u201cnow\u201d in the subscribe button creates urgency.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call20to20action20examples20for20email20newsletter20signups20SMS20global-1.png\" alt=\"call to action examples for email newsletter signups SMS global\" width=\"800\" height=\"361\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>8. Investopedia<\/h3>\n<p>Like Example #7, Investopedia encourages the reader to sign up by highlighting the benefit it will bring to them. They\u00a0also clarify the frequency of the emails, reducing uncertainty. Like Digital Trends, this call to action uses a more human-sounding\u00a0phrase for the \u201cno\u201d option. Unlike Digital Trends, this phrase is a bit more witty. This type of approach has its pros and cons as well, with regard to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/31\/brand-voice\">brand voice<\/a> and user experience.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call20to20action20examples20for20email20newsletter20signups20investopedia-1.png\" alt=\"call to action examples for email newsletter signups investopedia\" width=\"550\" height=\"356\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>9. Printsome<\/h3>\n<p>This call to action by Printsome is different from the ones before it as it asks for the user\u2019s name as well. In addition, it creates an incentive for signing up, with both an immediate and long-term <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/13\/sales-promotion-examples\">offer<\/a>. The subscribe button is bright and eye-catching, and uses urgency and excitement.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call20to20action20examples20for20email20newsletter20signups20printsome-1.png\" alt=\"call to action examples for email newsletter signups printsome\" width=\"600\" height=\"556\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>10. Remote.co<\/h3>\n<p>This call to action example is worth noting because it uses a large, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/22\/visual-marketing-tools\">attractive image<\/a> and immediately conveys the purpose\u00a0of signing up. In addition, the text below the headline attracts attention with the use of a question, and clarifies the email frequency for the subscriber.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call20to20action20examples20for20email20newsletter20signups20remote.co_-1.png\" alt=\"call to action examples for email newsletter signups remote\" width=\"800\" height=\"458\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>11. Teddy Bear Club<\/h3>\n<p>What makes this email signup <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/13\/call-to-action-examples\">call to action unique from the rest<\/a> is that it starts with a question. Questions can be a good way to catch the reader\u2019s attention. The description doesn\u2019t provide explicit details into what kind of information the subscriber will get, aside from \u201copen houses and more\u201d, but it does provide the benefit to the reader: being the first to know. The actual\u00a0button, however, is a bit confusing. \u201cLearn more\u201d makes it uncertain as to whether clicking the button is the last step for signing up or will bring the user to another information page.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call20to20action20examples20for20email20newsletter20signups20TBC-1.png\" alt=\"call to action examples for email newsletter signups TBC\" width=\"700\" height=\"334\" \/><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p>\ud83d\udceb<strong> Free email templates!<\/strong>\u00a0 <strong>&gt;&gt; <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteEmailExampleTemplate.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Email_EmailTemplates_Download\">30 Free Small Business Email Examples &amp; Templates<\/a><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h3>12. Crush Boutique<\/h3>\n<p>We like Crush Boutique\u2019s email signup call to action because even though \u201cyou\u201d isn\u2019t as effective as seeing your actual name, the phrase \u201chey you\u201d certainly grabs your attention in a friendly way. We also like its simple and attractive design. The word \u201cJoin\u201d reassures the user that\u00a0clicking that button will complete the action of being added to the list. There is\u00a0also more than one option to exit, which can\u00a0help the user to feel less confined and more in control of their experience.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call20to20action20examples20for20email20newsletter20signups20crush20boutique-1.png\" alt=\"call to action examples for email newsletter signups crush boutique\" width=\"650\" height=\"460\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>13. Popsugar<\/h3>\n<p>PopSugar\u2019s email signup call to action contains a few elements that we haven\u2019t seen yet in the above examples. The \u201cSignup with Facebook\u201d option may be preferred by regular Facebook users, and is sometimes quicker and requires fewer steps. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/05\/best-call-to-action-phrases\">call to action phrase<\/a> at the bottom creates transparency for Popsugar and confirms for the user the action they are taking\u2014giving Popsugar permission to email them. However, including \u201cagree to the Terms\u201d may cause the user to feel like they are committing to something bigger than they thought, and to feel hesitation. If this is, in fact, a legal requirement, including it at the bottom and in small font is the best solution.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call20to20action20examples20for20email20newsletter20signups20popsugar-1.png\" alt=\"call to action examples for email newsletter signups popsugar\" width=\"650\" height=\"396\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>14. Living Social<\/h3>\n<p>Like Popsugar, Living Social also includes a consent statement, at the bottom and in a small font. But what we really want to point out here is the simple and attractive design, the gift icon to convey that the reader will get something out of this, and the use of an offer to encourage signups. However, it is unclear as to whether this 80% refers to a single coupon or the average discount for items on their site.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call20to20action20examples20for20email20newsletter20signups20living20social-1.png\" alt=\"call to action examples for email newsletter signups living social\" width=\"750\" height=\"452\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>15. Nav<\/h3>\n<p>Nav&#8217;s call to action for their email <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/marketing-newsletters\">newsletter<\/a> is a great example of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/16\/copywriting-formulas\">concise copywriting<\/a>. It tells the user\u00a0the ultimate value of the newsletter and then clarifies how often the email will be sent. The example email, with it&#8217;s clean and branded design, to the right,\u00a0is an added element of appeal.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call20to20action20examples20for20email20signups20nav-1.png\" alt=\"call to action examples for email signups nav\" width=\"800\" height=\"267\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>16. Unreadit<\/h3>\n<p>Unreadit&#8217;s approach is unique in that it doesn&#8217;t just tell you what the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/05\/creative-newsletter-names\">newsletter<\/a> provides, but why. Because &#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t start the week with just work emails.&#8221; It then provides the details that potential readers want to know, but in bullet form, including past issues, day and time of email send, and how many subscribers.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/examples20of20CTAs20for20email20signups20unreadit-1.png\" alt=\"examples of CTAs for email signups unreadit\" width=\"800\" height=\"401\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>17. Later<\/h3>\n<p>Later newsletter uses that common approach of inviting\u00a0the visitor to join an existing\u00a0community, as well as that of giving the opportunity of being the first to know and detailing exactly how frequently the newsletter arrives. Even better, on the right you see <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/small-business-email-examples-and-templates\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">samples of emails<\/a> that you would receive, which allows people to get a taste and intrigue their curiosity.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call20to20action20examples20for20newsletter20signups20later-1.png\" alt=\"call to action examples for newsletter signups later\" width=\"800\" height=\"413\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>18. Austin Kleon<\/h3>\n<p>Austin&#8217;s <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/03\/copywriting-examples\">copywriting<\/a> style is in line with his simple three-color branding. In 19 words, he tells you exactly what you need to know and then gives you the opportunity to view the archives for added reassurance. His author bio on the right is also a helpful way to add personalization and build familiarity.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/cta20examples20for20newsletter20signups20austin20kleon20-1.png\" alt=\"cta examples for newsletter signups austin kleon\" width=\"800\" height=\"324\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>19. Data Viz<\/h3>\n<p>Data Viz takes a bold move here by simply including their newsletter CTA at the end of their website. This format expresses confidence that their website encompasses it all, and that their newsletter is just an extension of what the visitor has already seen. Plus, the &#8220;We\u00a0<strong>never\u00a0<\/strong>share your data&#8221; is clear and concise.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/creative20newsletter20names20data20viz-1.png\" alt=\"call to action examples for email newsletter signups data viz\" width=\"800\" height=\"213\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>20. Mel&#8217;s Sandbox<\/h3>\n<p>Started with a dog, gotta end with a dog. The Mel&#8217;s Sandbox email newsletter CTA is short and simple, even including the average word count for each email, which can get more of the fast-paced skimmers to sign up.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/call20to20action20examples20for20email20newsletter20signups20mels20sandbox-1.png\" alt=\"call to action examples for email newsletter signups mels sandbox\" width=\"800\" height=\"453\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>Get more email subscribers with better calls to action<\/h2>\n<p>You may have noticed some common themes and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/03\/email-marketing-best-practices\">best practices<\/a> in the call to action examples above, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce uncertainty for potential subscribers by giving them an idea of what to expect.<\/li>\n<li>Try out different approaches: authoritative, short and sweet (slightly bold), reassuring, casual.<\/li>\n<li>Incorporate elements of urgency and excitement.<\/li>\n<li>Be human with your copywriting; people like people.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>One final tip: As you build your email list, you should also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/11\/30\/tips-to-declutter-your-email-list\">clean it out regularly to keep your ROI strong<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully these examples have given you some inspiration and tips to brush up your email signup copy on your website, whether on your homepage, your blog, or wherever else you encourage interested readers to join your community.
