It&#8217;s invasive.

With those kinds of numbers, even with 100 visitors a day, using a newsletter subscription pop-up would give you between 92 and 274 subscribers every month.<\/p>\n<p>Aweber found that moving from a sidebar opt-in form to a pop-up <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.aweber.com\/email-marketing\/easy-secret-more-subscribers.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">increased subscription<\/a> by 1,375%.<\/p>\n<p>But why? Why do these things work when so many people complain about them?<\/p>\n<p><strong>There are a few key reasons:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pop-ups show to everyone<\/strong>. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/09\/ad-design\">Banner blindness<\/a> occurs just as frequently on your website as it does in display advertising. Pop-ups (because they have to be seen to be closed) have a 100% view rate. A 3% conversion rate may not sound that impressive, but 3% of every website visitor becomes a significant number over time.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pop-ups deliver a message when site visitors are engaged.<\/strong> Well-implemented pop-ups deliver a prompt exactly when your site visitors are most likely to click through (not including exit intent pop-ups, of course, which are a different thing entirely).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pop-ups offer value.<\/strong> No, seriously. Well-used, relevant pop-ups provide value to your readers and site visitors. We&#8217;ll show you some examples below.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pop-ups can&#8217;t be ignored. <\/strong>Unlike your sidebar blog subscription prompt or the one in your website footer, a pop-up is (by definition) seen. Visitors can&#8217;t help but read your message or value proposition when it pops up in their face. Even if they close it, the message has still been communicated.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a compelling graph showing the before and after for the addition of a newsletter subscription pop-up:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pop-up-advertising-addition-graph.jpg\" alt=\"graph of the effect of pop-up advertising\" width=\"750\" height=\"239\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.janefriedman.com\/why-i-started-using-pop-ups\/\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Seems worth it, right? But, remember, pop-up advertising works best when your pop-ups aren\u2019t annoying your website visitors.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/26\/pop-up-strategy\">pop-up advertising best practices<\/a> to follow:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make pop-ups easy to quit. Feature the \u201cx\u201d or \u201cno\u201d button clearly or allow people to click off the side of the pop-up to close. Don\u2019t hide the exit option.<\/li>\n<li>Make the content or promotion you\u2019re showing relevant to the page they\u2019re on.<\/li>\n<li>Make the value you\u2019re delivering (ebook, discount, etc.) front and center.<\/li>\n<li>Show your pop-ups only when your visitors or readers are ready to see them.<\/li>\n<li>Use personality and creativity to keep people from quitting immediately.<\/li>\n<li>Use the right pop-up type for the right use case.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Now that you have a better idea of why pop-ups work and how to implement them effectively, let&#8217;s move on to some surprisingly effective ways to use them.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Hide the form on your landing page<\/h2>\n<p>The first innovative, effective way to use pop-ups<strong>: hiding the form on your landing page.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example from Pat Flynn (Smart Passive Income). This is what the &#8220;above the fold&#8221; section looks like on the <a href=\"https:\/\/pages.smartpassiveincome.com\/epic-affiliate-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">landing page of one of his recent ebooks<\/a>:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pop-up-advertising-hidden-form.jpg\" alt=\"pop-up advertising landing page with hidden form\" width=\"793\" height=\"339\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Notice anything missing?<\/p>\n<p>Exactly.

Therefore, if your landing page has <em>no<\/em> visible form fields, its conversion rate should be even better.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pop-up-advertising-conversion-rate.jpg\" alt=\"pop-up advertising conversion rate graph\" width=\"600\" height=\"464\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cobloom.com\/blog\/form-fields-and-conversion-rates-is-less-really-more\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Click pop-ups (or, as Sumo calls them, &#8220;click triggers&#8221;) <a href=\"https:\/\/sumo.com\/stories\/best-email-optin-tool\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">convert 12x better<\/a> than any other email pop-up. This is because the pop-up&#8217;s appearance is triggered by the visitor. There&#8217;s no surprise element. In essence, they&#8217;ve requested the pop-up.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pop-up-advertising-conversion-rate-graph.jpg\" alt=\"pop-up advertising conversion rate by type of pop-up bar graph\" width=\"708\" height=\"451\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/sumo.com\/stories\/best-email-optin-tool\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>2. Give a first-time buyer discount<\/h2>\n<p>As soon as you arrive on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.revolve.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Revolve<\/a> ecommerce site, this discount offer appears in an entry pop-up:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pop-up-advertising-discount-revolve.jpg\" alt=\"pop-up advertising on Revolve\" width=\"754\" height=\"498\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Why this is an effective way to use pop-ups<\/h3>\n<p>This is the kind of pop-up that I&#8217;d be annoyed <em>not<\/em> to see.<\/p>\n<p>If I&#8217;m interested in buying something from this company (or any company) and there&#8217;s a 10% discount available, I want to know about it. Imagine seeing a coupon for &#8220;buy one get one free candy bars&#8221; lying on the ground outside a grocery store when you&#8217;re already walking out, candy bar in hand. You&#8217;d be annoyed, right?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ultimately, the reason this is pop-up effective is because it delivers relevant value when the website visitor wants it.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>10% off most products is worth my email address. Especially if I like the products and may, genuinely, be interested to learn more about them or (more likely) get more deals down the line.<\/p>\n<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\u00a0 \ud83c\udfa8 <strong>Get creative ideas for your popups!<\/strong> <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>Free guide<\/strong> &gt;&gt; <\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download\" class=\"waffle-rich-text-link\">The 36 Best Call to Action Phrases (Ever)<\/a><\/strong><span> <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><\/div><\/div><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>3. Offer a content upgrade, ebook, or exclusive content<\/h2>\n<p>For this one, it\u2019s incredibly important that you offer something relevant.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, your website visitors are literally in the middle of a paragraph when your timed or scroll pop-up appears. It\u2019s like thrusting your head into someone\u2019s face when they\u2019re reading a book. If you don\u2019t offer something valuable and relevant to what they\u2019re reading, you might get hit in the head.<\/p>\n<p>The coolest use case of this we\u2019ve seen recently is Brian Dean\u2019s exclusive articles, which have to be unlocked via the submittal of a visitor\u2019s email address.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s an example from the <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Backlinko blog directory<\/strong><\/a><strong>:<\/strong><\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pop-up-advertising-gated-content.jpg\" alt=\"pop-up advertising gated content example\" width=\"631\" height=\"554\" \/><\/div>\n<p>When the \u201cUnlock Now\u201d button is clicked, this click pop-up appears:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pop-up-advertising-gated-content-reveal.jpg\" alt=\"pop-up to unlock content\" width=\"677\" height=\"331\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Why this is an effective way to use pop-ups<\/h3>\n<p>Brian Dean already knows that people who are on his blog directory are interested in reading his blog content.<\/p>\n<p>Making his content exclusive increases the subjective value that his visitors place on that content: what isn\u2019t publicly available <em>must <\/em>contain more valuable information than what is.<\/p>\n<p>Locking that content behind an email-gate is a fantastic way to use pop-ups.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Top Tip: <\/strong>Progress bars, like the one at the top of this pop-up (which is part of many <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/learn\/landing-page-creator\">pop-up tool templates<\/a>, by the way) have been shown to increase conversion rates by as much as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.leadpages.net\/blog\/split-test-progress-bar-vs-progress-bar-version-boosted-conversions-28-29\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">28.9%<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>4.
