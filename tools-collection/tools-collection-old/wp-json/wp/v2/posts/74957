And for good reason. Pay-per-click is still, pound-for-pound, the fastest way to drive qualified prospects to your small business. Target the right keyword, set your bidding strategy, write your ad copy, and bang: people actively searching for your product or service are going to start seeing your business at or near the top of the search results.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s all well and good. But what about scale? Sure, plenty of businesses scale really effectively with paid media. But it\u2019s sort of like a faucet. You have to keep the faucet running (i.e. continue injecting capital) to keep getting results. And aside from having a solid ad strategy, you better hope you have a strong product-market fit, strong margins, and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/09\/lower-customer-acquisition-cost\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">strong CAC<\/a> (customer acquisition cost), or your bottom line is going to suffer.<\/p>\n<p>The remedy to this problem of scale? Organic traffic. Investing in organic traffic is like investing in a retirement account. It\u2019s not sexy, but if you put in the work now, you set yourself up for some serious dividends down the road. And while SEO (search engine optimization) isn\u2019t quite as simple as \u201cset it and forget it,\u201d it is, in my opinion, the most sustainable way to scale a small business\u2013this year, and beyond.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/organic-traffic-seo-growth-meme.jpg\" alt=\"organic traffic and seo leads to business growth piggy back image\" width=\"681\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-74961\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/organic-traffic-seo-growth-meme.jpg 681w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/organic-traffic-seo-growth-meme-480x423.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 681px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In this post, I\u2019m going to walk you through the art of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-referral-traffic\">driving organic traffi<\/a>c to your website, broken down into five basic steps. By the end, you\u2019ll have a good understanding of the kind of investment you need to make to set yourself up for long-term organic growth.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s rock and roll.<\/p>\n<h2>What is organic traffic?<\/h2>\n<p>Organic traffic is any <em>unpaid<\/em> session that occurs on your site. Typically, when we talk about organic traffic, we\u2019re delineating between two types: organic <em>search<\/em>, and organic <em>social<\/em>. Organic social traffic comes from unpaid posting on social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, etc.), while organic search traffic comes from search engines (most notably, Google and Bing).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/organic-traffic-definition-sources.jpg\" alt=\"what makes up organic traffic - social and search traffic sources\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-74962\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/organic-traffic-definition-sources.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/organic-traffic-definition-sources-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For the purposes of this post, we\u2019re going to be focusing on organic search traffic driven through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/seo\">SEO<\/a>. When businesses are able to achieve high organic rankings in the search results, they set themselves up to drive high-intent clicks for the long term without continuously spending money on ads.<\/p>\n<h2>Benefits of organic traffic<\/h2>\n<p>Before we dive into some top strategies for driving organic traffic, let\u2019s look a little closer at the importance and benefits of organic traffic and discuss why it\u2019s such a crucial channel to invest in.<\/p>\n<h3>Benefit #1: Free, evergreen clicks<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019ve talked a little bit about the \u201cfree\u201d nature of organic traffic, but what exactly does that look like?<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a brand that sells crochet kits. You want to drive as much traffic as possible to your high-converting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/20\/product-positioning\">product pages<\/a>, but you don\u2019t have the budget to consistently outbid your competitors on keywords related to crochet kits.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/organic-traffic-paid-ads-to-outrank.jpg\" alt=\"paid ads for popular crochet kit keyword to target\" width=\"936\" height=\"577\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-74967\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/organic-traffic-paid-ads-to-outrank.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/organic-traffic-paid-ads-to-outrank-480x296.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-research\">keyword research<\/a>, you notice that the keyword \u201cbest crochet kits for beginners\u201d is a bit more informational in nature (vs. commercial), and that it has a pretty good monthly search volume.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/organic-traffic-keyword-research.jpg\" alt=\"keyword research results for best crochet kit in wordstream keyword research tool\" width=\"936\" height=\"336\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-74960\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/organic-traffic-keyword-research.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/organic-traffic-keyword-research-480x172.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You think it would make a good blog post. So, adhering to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/local-marketing-lab\/seo\/#section4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO best practices<\/a>, you write a blog post targeting that keyword, making sure to link to your best-selling crochet kits throughout the post.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/organic-traffic-blog-post-example.jpg\" alt=\"example of blog post to drive organic traffic\" width=\"936\" height=\"543\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-74969\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/organic-traffic-blog-post-example.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/organic-traffic-blog-post-example-480x278.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Bloggers find your \u201cbest of\u201d list, think it&#8217;s useful, and start linking to it across the web.

By <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/13\/content-creation\">creating one quality piece of content<\/a> that is genuinely useful to users, you now have essentially a free billboard for your product living at the top of the search results. The 480 or so people that search for that keyword on a monthly basis are going to see your brand. Many of them will click. And probably about 2-5% of them will make a purchase. All for the low, one-time cost of creating a blog post.<\/p>\n<h3>Benefit #2: Trust and authority<\/h3>\n<p>Depending on the nature of their search query, a user is often going to find both paid and organic listings in the search results. Why, you might be asking at this point, would a user click on an organic listing over a paid listing?<\/p>\n<p>Trust and authority. Many people don\u2019t know the difference between a paid and an organic listing. But many do. And those that do, know that any brand can pay to play. It\u2019s a lot more challenging to have a listing rise to a prominent ranking based on quality and merit, and therefore, a lot more trustworthy<em>.<\/em> Especially with Google doubling down on signals around <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/12\/google-e-a-t\">expertise, authority, and trust<\/a>, and especially when people today get blitzed with multimedia advertising pretty much from the moment they wake up in the morning until they go to sleep at night.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-eeat.jpg\" alt=\"google eeat graphic\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-74959\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-eeat.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-eeat-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Benefit #3: Traffic quality<\/h3>\n<p>We talked a little bit about intent already. When a user finds your website via a search engine, they are actively searching for keywords related to your product or service. Whether that is via an informational search (like \u201chow to tie your shoes\u201d) or a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/30\/commercial-intent-keywords\">commercial search<\/a> (like \u201cbuy shoes near me\u201d), showing up organically for a search query means meeting your customer at a moment in which they need you.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/keyword-intent-wordstream.jpg\" alt=\"keyword intent chart\" width=\"859\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-73944\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/keyword-intent-wordstream.jpg 859w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/keyword-intent-wordstream-480x335.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 859px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Compare that to display advertising or social media advertising, and it\u2019s easy to see the difference. Marketing via those channels means using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/15\/audience-targeting\">audience targeting<\/a> to try to find users that most closely resemble your ideal customers. But even if you find them, there\u2019s no guarantee they\u2019re in the mood to consume the thing you\u2019re promoting. Often, they\u2019re just passively browsing, and your ad is more an interruption than an asset.<\/p>\n<p>With organic traffic, there\u2019s no danger of that. And that\u2019s why traffic quality, which you can measure via <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/27\/seo-metrics\">metrics<\/a> like average time on site or engagement rate, is <em>consistently stronger from organic search<\/em> than it is from most other channels.<\/p>\n<h2>5 ways to drive organic traffic to your website<\/h2>\n<p>Okay. Now that we\u2019ve defined organic traffic and discussed why it\u2019s important, let\u2019s walk through five time-honored strategies you can use to drive organic traffic to your website.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Update and optimize local listings<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re a local business, <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/listings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">local listings<\/a> are, for my money, the most efficient way to generate immediate results organically.

Create quality, keyword-targeted content<\/h3>\n<p>There are a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/09\/google-ranking-factors\">ton of factors<\/a> Google takes into account when ranking content in the index. But the most important thing you can do, time and time again, to make sure your website outranks the competition, is create quality content.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re writing a blog post, make sure it is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/12\/how-long-should-a-blog-post-be#:~:text=Basically%2C%20the%20internet%20says%20a,posts%20average%202%2C700%2D3%2C000%20words.\">as long or longer<\/a> than other blog posts in the search results (and more helpful and useful for searchers!).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/word-count-in-ahrefs.jpg\" alt=\"report in ahrefs that shows thin content--may need to be longer for an effective blog post\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>You can check for content with a low word count you may need to beef up in a tool like Ahrefs.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Make sure you use plenty of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/22\/visual-marketing-tools\">compelling visuals<\/a>.

And above all, make sure you are definitively targeting a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/popular-keywords\/marketing-keywords\">high-volume keyword<\/a>, and that that keyword makes an appearance throughout your post or web page.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Follow on-page SEO best practices<\/h3>\n<p>On-page SEO concerns the factors that you, as the website owner or business owner, can directly influence when optimizing for search engines. You can\u2019t always control whether or not other websites <em>link to you<\/em>, which is the crux of off-page SEO. But if you create quality content, and you follow <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/06\/on-page-seo\">on-page SEO best practices<\/a>, you will be giving yourself a big leg up.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some key on-page SEO best practices:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keyword optimization.<\/strong> As mentioned above, identifying a keyword is only half the battle. You need to make sure your keyword appears throughout your page: in your title tag, meta description, H1, H2s, and throughout the body content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/heading-tags-for-seo.jpg\" alt=\"different heading tags for seo with a tip for how to use it to drive organic traffic\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-74973\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/heading-tags-for-seo.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/heading-tags-for-seo-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><em>Including keywords throughout these different page elements tells Google that your page is relevant for a given search query.<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Optimize meta tags<\/strong>. Your meta title should be under 60 characters to ensure it displays fully in the search engine. Your meta descriptions should be around 150-160 characters, and include an enticing call-to-action. Both should contain your target keyword, and should be relevant and compelling.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Optimize URL structure<\/strong>. Create clean and descriptive URLs that provide a clear indication of the page&#8217;s content. Avoid using long and complex URLs with unnecessary characters or numbers. Instead, use hyphens to separate words and keep the URL concise.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We also put together a full <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/06\/on-page-seo#:~:text=Go%20to%20the%20Google%20Sheet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on-page SEO checklist<\/a> you can use here:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/drive-organic-traffic-on-page-seo-checklist.jpg\" alt=\"on-page SEO checklist from wordstream to drive organic traffic\" width=\"903\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-74972\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/drive-organic-traffic-on-page-seo-checklist.jpg 903w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/drive-organic-traffic-on-page-seo-checklist-480x319.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 903px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And read through these <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/seo-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO examples<\/a> to see how other brands do it.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\ud83d\ude97 Want to drive more website traffic?

Optimize page speed<\/h3>\n<p>Google <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/ranking-factors\/page-speed\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">made page speed a ranking factor<\/a> in 2020 when it released its Core Web Vitals. If your website has a slow load time, not only will users hold it against you by leaving at a higher rate, Google will actually rank your site lower than your competitors\u2019 sites.<\/p>\n<p>The first step in optimizing site speed is understanding whether or not you have a speed problem. Sadly, the majority of websites do. You can use tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/gtmetrix.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GT Metrix<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/pagespeed.web.dev\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PageSpeed Insights<\/a> to quickly diagnose how effectively your site is loading.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/drive-organic-traffic-pagespeed.jpg\" alt=\"google pagespeeds insight tool to help drive organic traffic\" width=\"936\" height=\"566\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-74974\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/drive-organic-traffic-pagespeed.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/drive-organic-traffic-pagespeed-480x290.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Overwhelmingly, the most common area of improvement you\u2019re going to see on these reports concerns images. Uncompressed images, or images with old formats (JPG, PNG, etc.), will really slow down your site speed.<\/p>\n<p>Many CMS platforms have bulk compression tools that you can use to compress images across your site. If they don\u2019t, you can use a tool like tinypng.com to do the job. But the gold standard in today\u2019s SEO world is WebP.<\/p>\n<p>When you convert and re-upload your images as WebP, you are ensuring they are at the smallest possible file size. Making this change across your site can give you a massive lift\u2013taking speed scores from mediocre to solid, and enhancing organic traffic along the way.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Guest posting<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019ve talked a bit about the importance of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/13\/off-page-seo\">off-page SEO<\/a>, and how, when it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/10\/link-building-secrets\">generating backlinks<\/a>, it\u2019s not always in your control. The problem is that, in order to get a link, you typically need to give the other website something significant. If your content is good enough, businesses will link to it naturally. But it\u2019s not always the easiest thing to do.<\/p>\n<p>Guest posting is a natural solution here.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/drive-organic-traffic-guest-posting.jpg\" alt=\"guest posting example to drive organic traffic\" width=\"656\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-74975\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/drive-organic-traffic-guest-posting.jpg 656w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/drive-organic-traffic-guest-posting-480x438.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 656px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When you write a guest post for another brand, especially one that has good authority in a given space, you not only give your brand exposure with a new audience, you (typically) will be able to link back to your website multiple times. And because the brand you\u2019re working with receives the benefit of a quality piece of content, they\u2019ll be happy to share the wealth.<\/p>\n<h2>An investment in organic traffic is an investment in scale<\/h2>\n<p>Everyone wants that one hands-off investment that pays off in perpetuity. In marketing, as in business, it doesn\u2019t exist. SEO is no different. In order to see results, you need to constantly create fresh, quality content, update content, and make sure your site is clear of technical inefficiencies.<\/p>\n<p>But, when done correctly, no other channel offers the ability to produce evergreen output with relatively small upfront input. And that\u2019s what makes organic traffic so valuable.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the five best ways to drive organic traffic to your website:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Update and optimize local listings<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Create quality, keyword-targeted content<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Follow on-page SEO best practices<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Optimize page speed<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Guest posting<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Investing in organic traffic can propel your business growth long-term.
