It\u2019s full of data visualizations and expanding three-dot menus and colorful representations of account data. But while it might feel intuitive to the uninitiated, seasoned vets will quickly find themselves lost in search of features they\u2019ve used a thousand times.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a flip side to this coin, though: the reshuffling of just about everything means there are some pretty great new features at your disposal. Some are right in front of you (see: the uncountable number of colors painted across the dozen graphs that greet you), others are hidden gems.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a quick look at five things buried in the new Google Ads\u00a0UI that should excite advertisers and agencies alike.<\/p>\n<h2>1. New Demographic Targeting Options!<\/h2>\n<p>Recently, Google released <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/09\/12\/demographic-targeting-for-search-campaigns\">Demographic Targeting for Search Ads<\/a> as a powerful tool for advertisers to cater their reach and messaging to users of different genders and ages. These targeting options were immediately powerful for advertisers of countless verticals.<\/p>\n<p>In the old Google Ads\u00a0UI <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/31\/detailed-demographics\">Demographic<\/a> information was available for advertisers to use. For search, at least, it looked a little something like this:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f37c3f84-dd3d-42c8-991f-44f902420812\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/new-adwords-experience-demographics.png\" alt=\"old adwords ui demographic targeting\" width=\"581\" height=\"253\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>In their new UI, Google doubles down on these demographic targeting options, allowing advertisers to target users based on their household income and parental status as well.<\/p>\n<p>Previously, only <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/20\/adwords-parental-status\">display advertisers could target by parental status<\/a>. Likewise, advertisers could previously target <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/01\/killer-underused-adwords-features\">locations based on their relative average household income<\/a> under their locations targeting, but not target individuals. These two additions grant advertisers additional flexibility in who and how they reach different audiences on line.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"8b9d4795-0e21-47e8-a9fb-16e3b70a0365\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/new-adwords-experience-household-income-targeting-2.png\" alt=\"adwords demographic targeting information easier to find in new UI\" width=\"800\" height=\"173\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Parental status targeting could be a game-changer for several industries. Sure, brands that sell baby products or childrens\u2019 toys will enjoy this one, and parents become an increasingly important audience during the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/10\/15\/holiday-marketing-tips\">holiday shopping periods<\/a> and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/21\/top-10-colleges-for-ppc\">Back to School<\/a> shopping. But savvy real estate and auto advertisers could potentially take advantage of this targeting and attempt to sell larger homes or cars to larger families!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/adwords-income-targeting\">Household income targeting<\/a> can be particularly powerful in helping you cater your ads to audiences with different price sensitivities. If your product or service is competitively priced, promote that in your ads targeted at low and average income audiences. Conversely, if you\u2019re selling <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/15\/luxury-marketing-strategies\">high-end luxury products<\/a>, you may want to bid more aggressively for affluent (or price-insensitive) users.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Promotion Extensions [Still Coming Soon!]<\/h2>\n<p>Google\u2019s newest extension \u2013 <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/24\/adwords-promotion-extension\">Promotion Extensions<\/a> &#8211; is\u00a0listed among the other extensions (in the conveniently renamed \u201cAds &amp; Extensions\u201d tab).<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a3dde9cc-f7cf-4045-9a06-42b1beda3787\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/new-adwords-experience-promotion-extensions.png\" alt=\"new adwords experience promotion extensions\" width=\"612\" height=\"748\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Promotion extensions will allow you to highlight a special sale on your website. By doing so through an extension, you\u2019ll save yourself valuable, limited characters in your ad copy. You can also use the opportunity to double down on your promo, referring to it in one of your two headlines, a URL path, <em>and<\/em> the extension as you close in on the end of your offer to hammer home the value it represents.<\/p>\n<p>In accounts using Promotion extensions we\u2019ve seen very high CTRs \u2013 often well over 10%!<\/p>\n<h2>3. Reporting Gets a Facelift<\/h2>\n<p>The new UI offers plenty of powerful reports to make <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/01\/24\/analyzing-google-adwords-ads\">analyzing your PPC campaigns<\/a> easier. Google Ads now visually displays the breakdown of clicks, cost, and conversions across desktop, tablet, and mobile, making it easier to manage your campaigns and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/26\/device-level-bid-adjustments\">optimize your device bid adjustments<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"54f0cddc-4e3b-4c76-9aef-55ac25978e9e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/new-adwords-experience-device-reporting-3.png\" alt=\"AdWords device reporting\" width=\"481\" height=\"279\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The new Google Ads\u00a0also highlights bar graphs and heatmaps for how your ads perform across different days of the week and hours of the day, making it easier to manage your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/30\/ad-scheduling\">campaigns\u2019 ad scheduling<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"376b755c-679a-44aa-bc49-9be07353d2a1\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/new-adowrds-experience-day-and-hour-heatmap-1.png\" alt=\"adwords dayparting data viz 2017\" width=\"474\" height=\"292\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>This one hits home for me: I\u2019ve been making heat maps in Excel for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/marketing-services\">marketing services<\/a> reps for years now. It\u2019s nice to see Google\u2019s finally ready and willing to take some work off my plate.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, Google now lets you sort both the search terms and words within your search terms in word clouds so that you can easily identify <a href=\"\/keywords\">new keyword ideas<\/a> and find <a href=\"\/negative-keywords\">new negative keywords<\/a> for your campaigns.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"e4944798-71c4-49c3-9073-8e55fc8345d5\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/new-adwords-experience-word-cloud-reporting.png\" alt=\"new adwords experience word cloud reporting\" width=\"480\" height=\"324\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Logophiles and data-junkies rejoice!<\/p>\n<h2>4. Advanced Bid Adjustments Make Life Easier<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"\/adwords-bid-management\">Managing your bids<\/a> can be tough, guys.<\/p>\n<p>But it\u2019s even more difficult when you\u2019ve got active adjustments in one direction or the other at six different levels in nine different places. This is shockingly common. It also guarantees weekly headaches.<\/p>\n<p>Well, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/11\/easy-adwords-bidding-strategies\">managing all your bid adjustments<\/a> just got easier.<\/p>\n<p>The new UI introduces advanced bid adjustments, which allow you to adjust your bid to drive certain actions from the SERP, such as placing a call from a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2011\/10\/06\/google-adwords-call-extensions\">call extension<\/a> or <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/20\/google-call-only-campaigns\">call-only campaign<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a1da173f-f8ac-433c-b213-a79018032771\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/new-adwords-experience-advanced-bid-adj-1.png\" alt=\"advanced bid adjustments\" width=\"365\" height=\"322\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Better still, it simplifies the way you can view and use <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/20\/device-bid-adjustment-alert\">bid adjustments<\/a>, (almost) eliminating the desire to pull your hair out.<\/p>\n<h2>Some downsides of the new Google Ads\u00a0UI<\/h2>\n<p>Advertisers have a lot to be excited about within the new interface, but they shouldn\u2019t forget about their old Google Ads\u00a0experience just yet.<\/p>\n<p>Although powerful, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/20\/adwords-old-ui-retired\">the new interface<\/a> doesn\u2019t include everything in the old Google Ads, at least not yet. Advertisers may need to navigate back into the old Google Ads\u00a0UI to manage popular features such as display <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/17\/remarketing-audiences\">remarketing audiences<\/a> and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/11\/adwords-price-extensions\">price extensions<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2d55ffe6-dc99-4071-a4a2-b9f35cbd1d1c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/new-adwords-experience-missing-features.png\" alt=\"features missing from the new adwords ui\" width=\"710\" height=\"492\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>While it\u2019s safe to assume that these features will be addressed through addition or consolidation before the new UI becomes <em>the<\/em> UI, the fact that they aren\u2019t currently available to trailblazing advertisers makes it unlikely that many of us will spend much time performing any actual account work in the new UI.<\/p>\n<p>Exploration, though, is totally encouraged.<\/p>\n<p>One more disadvantage of switching: Everything&#8217;s different! So if you&#8217;re used to the old UI, you&#8217;re going to have to spend some time relearning where everything is.<\/p>\n<p>If you find something in the new Google Ads\u00a0UI that seems obscure, out of place, or just plain interesting, let us know on Twitter and in the comments, below!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The new AdWords UI, referred to as the new AdWords Experience, boasts a whole new look and, along with it, new features!
