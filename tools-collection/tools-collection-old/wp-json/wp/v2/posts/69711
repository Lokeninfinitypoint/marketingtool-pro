You can review ad previews to get an idea of how your ads will look. Once you set the campaign live, Google will generate ads across the applicable channels whenever eligible, using machine learning to serve the right ad at the right time with the right bid, to optimize for your goal.<\/p>\n<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\u2734\ufe0f <\/span><strong>Free guide: <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteHackingGoogleAds.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_HackingGoogleAds_Download\" class=\"waffle-rich-text-link\">Hacking Google Ads: The One Trick That Could Save You Thousands<\/a><\/strong><span><\/div><\/div><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Pros and cons of Performance Max campaigns<\/h2>\n<p>Like any campaign type, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/20\/performance-max-pros-cons\">Performance Max comes with its pros and cons<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>PMax pros<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Full automation means Google does the work for you, but you\u2019re able to steer that automation and performance with the assets and Audience Signals you provide.<\/li>\n<li>You can reach new audiences across all of Google\u2019s channels.<\/li>\n<li>As goal-based campaigns, they are ideal for ecommerce and lead generation businesses.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>PMax cons<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You need to have full-funnel <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/30\/google-ads-conversion-tracking\">conversion tracking<\/a> set up\u2014both because it\u2019s a requirement based on the way the campaign type works, and also in order to assess and optimize your performance.<\/li>\n<li>While it can take work off your plate, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/04\/google-ads-automation\">automation comes with its own pros and cons<\/a>.

Let&#8217;s take a look.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Commit to your campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>Being fully automated, PMax campaigns require sufficient amounts of data and machine learning to be effective. Be prepared to budget at least $50-100 per day for at least a month. In fact, Google recommends <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/11385582#zippy=%2Cbest-practices-for-all-business-types\">at least 6 weeks<\/a> to allow the machine learning algorithm to ramp up and have sufficient data to compare performance.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Add as many assets as you can<\/h3>\n<p>The more assets you add, the better, because it will increase the chances of an ad being eligible to serve across all types of inventory. Note that if you\u2019re using a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/18\/google-shopping-feed\">Merchant Center feed<\/a>, you don\u2019t need to upload any product images. Instead, go with lifestyle or brand creatives that will complement product feed images.<\/p>\n<p>If you only want to run Google Shopping campaigns, don\u2019t add any assets at all and simply use your feed. This way, your campaign will deliver Shopping ads along with Display and YouTube ads but the latter will both be in Shopping format.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/optimize-performance-max-campaigns-shopping-ads-youtube.png\" alt=\"how to optimize performance max campaigns - shopping ads on youtube\" width=\"720\" height=\"318\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69734 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/optimize-performance-max-campaigns-shopping-ads-youtube.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/optimize-performance-max-campaigns-shopping-ads-youtube-480x212.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>3. Know the watchouts and workarounds<\/h3>\n<p>We&#8217;ve shared a full post on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/05\/performance-max-tips\">Performance Max dos, don&#8217;ts, watchouts, and workarounds<\/a>, but some of them are worth repeating:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bidding: <\/strong>For <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/19\/google-ads-automated-bidding\">bidding strategy<\/a>, you are limited to either Maximize conversions or Maximize conversion value, which makes sense given Performance Max campaigns are conversion focused.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Location settings:<\/strong> Like any other campaign, PMax location settings default to \u201cPresence or interest.\u201d If you only want to reach people in that location, switch to presence only.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Audience signals:<\/strong> With PMax campaigns, you don\u2019t choose an exact audience to target. Rather, you provide \u201cAudience Signals\u201d which Google uses as a starting point. It\u2019s similar to optimized targeting.<\/li>\n<li><strong>URL expansion:<\/strong> PMax also turns URL expansion on by default. Similar to Dynamic Ads, this feature allows Google Ads to send users to landing pages other than your final URL. If this goes against what you want to achieve, turn this feature off. Or, leave it on but use URL exclusions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/optimize-performance-max-campaigns-final-url-expansion.png\" alt=\"how to optimize performance max campaigns - final url expansion\" width=\"720\" height=\"357\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69730 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/optimize-performance-max-campaigns-final-url-expansion.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/optimize-performance-max-campaigns-final-url-expansion-480x238.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>4. Use the customer acquisition feature<\/h3>\n<p>Unique to Performance Max campaigns, this feature allows you to choose whether you want to serve the campaign to new and existing customers, or just new users.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/optimize-performance-max-campaigns-customer-acquisition.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"185\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69725 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/optimize-performance-max-campaigns-customer-acquisition.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/optimize-performance-max-campaigns-customer-acquisition-480x123.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>5. Optimize your asset groups<\/h3>\n<p>When building a Performance Max campaign, you\u2019ll add all of your assets into an asset group. An <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/10729160?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=11336002\">asset group<\/a> is a set of creatives that will be used to create an ad depending on the channel it\u2019s being served on. It&#8217;s best practice to organise asset groups by a common theme similar to how you organise your ad groups.<\/p>\n<p>Once the campaign has been built, you can go back and add additional asset groups. Structure them in a way that makes sense for your business, which could mean separating them by products or services that you offer.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/optimize-performance-max-campaigns-asset-groups.jpeg\" alt=\"how to optimize performance max campaigns - asset groups\" width=\"720\" height=\"310\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69735 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/optimize-performance-max-campaigns-asset-groups.jpeg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/optimize-performance-max-campaigns-asset-groups-480x207.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sol8.com\/performance-max-asset-groups\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>6. Use campaign exclusions<\/h3>\n<p>The next PMax optimization strategy is to use campaign exclusions to prevent wasted budget and improve the efficiency of your campaign. This includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Product exclusions. On average, 17% of products in advertising catalogs are not available for purchase, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.datafeedwatch.com\/feed-marketing-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DataFeedWatch&#8217;s 2022 Feed Marketing Report<\/a>. So these items should be the starting point for catalog exclusions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/optimize-performance-max-campaigns-datafeedwatch-report.png\" alt=\"how to optimize performance max campaigns - datafeedwatch report\" width=\"506\" height=\"572\" class=\" wp-image-69731 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/optimize-performance-max-campaigns-datafeedwatch-report.png 506w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/optimize-performance-max-campaigns-datafeedwatch-report-480x542.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 506px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It also makes sense to exclude product variations that are relevant for the same search query, products that are not profitable or low margin, and products with a low conversion rate. To achieve this, you can use Listing Groups and exclude these products by Brand, Product ID, Category, Custom Labels, and more.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to improving the efficiency of your campaign, these campaign exclusions will also minimize the number of products that Google will need to put through the learning phase, essentially speeding it up.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keyword exclusions. Use negative keywords to prevent wasted budget on irrelevant queries.<\/li>\n<li>Existing customers. As mentioned earlier in this article, you can exclude existing customers so that your Performance Max campaign focuses solely on new customer acquisition. When setting up the campaign, check the box \u2018Only bid for new customers.\u2019<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>7. Choose the right bidding strategy<\/h3>\n<p>When launching a new Performance Max campaign, you have two options for bidding:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maximize Conversions to get the highest number of conversions for your budget.<\/li>\n<li>Maximize Conversion Value to get the highest value conversions. You may get fewer conversions with this bid strategy, but the idea is they are worth more.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Once your campaign has a sufficient amount of conversion data, you can experiment with either Maximize Conversions with Target CPA or Maximize Conversion Value with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/02\/target-roas\">Target ROAS<\/a> bid strategies in order to take your campaign to the next level.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/target-roas-max-conversion-value.png\" alt=\"target roas option in the max conversion value bidding strategy in google ads\" width=\"561\" height=\"328\" class=\" wp-image-57902 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/target-roas-max-conversion-value.png 561w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/target-roas-max-conversion-value-480x281.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 561px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You do have the option to use Target CPA or Target ROAS from the get-go but it is a best practice to first gather all important conversion data when launching a new campaign.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Use ad extensions<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/25\/google-ads-extensions-guide\">Google Ads extensions<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/16\/google-ads-extensions-now-assets\">now called assets<\/a>) allow you to increase your ad real estate and increase its relevance and attractiveness with additional information.<\/p>\n<p>There are 14 ad extensions in total\u2014reviews, locations, call, pricing, promotion, and more\u2014but you should always consider using the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sitelinks:<\/strong> These highlight and direct users to other relevant pages. For example, you could use an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/27\/guide-to-about-us-pages\">about us page<\/a>, highlight relevant product categories, a pricing page, and more. There are plenty of options and they have a large visual impact on your ad. According to Google, by using the recommended minimum of four site links alone, <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/11394461\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">advertisers can see a 20% increase in click-through rate on average<\/a> by using this one form of ad extension.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Callouts:<\/strong> Small snippets of information, each 25 characters in length, which can highlight selling features or key USPs. Try to include a minimum of 8 callouts<\/li>\n<li><strong>Structured snippets:<\/strong> These are used to highlight specific products, services or features in a listicle format. For example, a bag retailer may include a Product Structured Snippet to highlight clutch bags, handbags, tote bags, backpacks, messenger bags, and card wallets<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To illustrate how powerful ad extensions can be, here is an example of a Search ad without any ad extensions running alongside it:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/optimize-performance-max-campaigns-no-ad-extensions.png\" alt=\"how to optimize performance max campaigns - ad without extensions\" width=\"720\" height=\"184\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69733 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/optimize-performance-max-campaigns-no-ad-extensions.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/optimize-performance-max-campaigns-no-ad-extensions-480x123.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As a comparison, here are two other Search ads that have served in the same auction showing numerous ad extensions. The Wolf and Badger ad features sitelinks, a promotion extension, and a location extension, while the Cambridge Satchel ad features sitelinks, a location extension, a review extension, and a price extension.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/optimize-performance-max-campaigns-ad-extensions.png\" alt=\"how to optimize performance max campaigns - ad with extensions\" width=\"720\" height=\"488\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69732 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/optimize-performance-max-campaigns-ad-extensions.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/optimize-performance-max-campaigns-ad-extensions-480x325.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>9.

Ensure you include as much information as possible in your feed and that it is up to date and relevant.<\/p>\n<p>Important product identifiers that need your attention are listed below.

Optimize your audience signals<\/h3>\n<p>If you are not seeing the desired results after running Performance Max campaigns for a sufficient amount of time, one area to review is Audience Signals.<\/p>\n<p>Tighten up Audience Signals by using your actual business data and prioritize this over using Google\u2019s interests, which include the in-market and affinity audiences.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Customer lists should be your number one choice, providing you have enough customer data and the permission to use data for advertising purposes. Customer lists are powerful because they use your real-life customer data to help find new customers<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Customer intent audiences take Google\u2019s interests to the next level using relevant keywords<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Website visitor audiences are also a good option, particularly if you are unable to use customer lists.
