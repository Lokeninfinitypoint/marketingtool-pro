And LinkedIn Ads can help you reach them even more effectively.<\/p>\n<p>But how do you know your LinkedIn Ads account is set up for success? A LinkedIn Ads audit can help.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to auditing your LinkedIn Ads account, the process is quite a bit different from other channels we\u2019ve covered not only because it\u2019s a social platform, but also because its tools and options are unique to this platform. I\u2019m going to go through this in roughly the same order I would do for an actual audit for a client and give some examples along the way.<\/p>\n<h2>How to do a LinkedIn Ads audit<\/h2>\n<p>Follow these steps to complete a comprehensive LinkedIn Ads audit that will set you up for long-term success:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#linkedin-ads-account-objectives\">Determine your account objectives<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#performance-and-conversion-tracking\">Get clear on performance and conversion tracking<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#linkedin-campaign-objectives\">Choose campaign objectives<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#linkedin-ads-audience-targeting\">Dig into your audience targeting<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#linkedin-ads-audience-settings\">Look into additional audience settings<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#linkedin-ads-audience-size\">Analyze audience size<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#linkedin-ads-audit-placements\">Check ad placements<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#linkedin-ads-audit-budget-and-schedule\">Review budget and schedule<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#linkedin-ads-bidding-strategies\">Look at your bidding strategies<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#linkedin-ads-conversion-strategies\">Make sure applicable conversion settings are applied<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#linkedin-ads-audit-formats-and-creative\">Check your ad formats and creative<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#linkedin-ads-calls-to-action\">Review your calls to action<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div id=\"linkedin-ads-account-objectives\"><\/div>\n<h3>1. Determine your LinkedIn Ads account objectives<\/h3>\n<p>Before I start any <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/25\/optimize-linkedin-ads\">LinkedIn Ads<\/a> audit, I have a discussion with the client to understand what they\u2019re trying to get out of the platform. Every account is different and everyone\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/smart-goals-examples\">goals<\/a> are different, so what works for one might not be what another is trying to go for.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the questions to ask yourself as you begin this process:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are you trying to accomplish with your LinkedIn campaigns?<\/li>\n<li>Are you looking for conversions?\n<ul>\n<li>If so, what are the conversion actions you want? Demo requests, content downloads, webinar registrations, inbound phone calls?<\/li>\n<li>If not, are you looking for on-platform engagement, traffic to the site, audience and awareness building, etc?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>What types of efficiency metrics are you looking for? Do we need cost per lead (CPL) or cost per acquisition (CPA) to be within a certain range or are we just trying to get as much traffic to the site for the lowest CPC we can attain?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The answers to these questions will help you in your audit process in two ways. First, you\u2019ll be able to tell if your current setup is helping you achieve your goals or not. Second, you\u2019ll be able to identify new tools you may not be using that can also help you realize your goals. Those will all come as we move through the audit, but without this foundational information about what you&#8217;re trying to achieve, it\u2019s hard to know what you\u2019re looking for.<\/p>\n<p>At this stage, we also need to understand who the target audience is. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/04\/26\/linkedin-b2b-lead-generation\">LinkedIn\u2019s B2B targeting<\/a> is second to none, but that also comes with a premium on cost. It\u2019s expensive to reach those users, so you want to make sure you\u2019re reaching the right folks and only the right folks.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">Who is your target audience<\/a> and how do you identify them? Job titles, company size, company revenue, industry, job function, interests?<\/li>\n<li>Are there segmentations to be aware of for better targeting? Do you only focus on companies with 500 or less employees? Is your system not suitable for companies in a different industry?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Just like the account goals above, knowing who the target audience is will help you make better optimization and testing suggestions throughout the audit.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f <strong>Want to understand who you should be targeting with your marketing?<\/strong> Download the guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteTargetAudience.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_TargetAudineceGuide_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\">How to Find Your Target Audience [Simple Steps!]<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"performance-and-conversion-tracking\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Get clear on performance and conversion tracking<\/h3>\n<p>The second area we need to review is how we\u2019re tracking performance and campaign success. Just like understanding the goals of the account, we need to know if the data we\u2019re looking at is accurate or not. It\u2019s one thing to audit an account and give ideas on why someone isn\u2019t achieving their goals. It\u2019s an entirely different thing to do that and then realize later on that conversion tracking is broken and none of the data you\u2019re looking at is accurate. Trust me, I\u2019ve been there.<\/p>\n<p>Always start by auditing the conversion tracking setup on any account to ensure you\u2019re making changes based on good data. Look for the pixels to be placed on the right pages of the site and ensure all triggers are firing appropriately for each call to action in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/marketing-funnel\">buyer funnel<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"linkedin-campaign-objectives\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Choose campaign objectives<\/h3>\n<p>Depending on what the stated goals are of the account, campaign objectives can make or break an account\u2019s success.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re trying to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/generating-leads-on-linkedin\">generate more sales from LinkedIn<\/a> but you&#8217;re only using Video View or Brand Awareness objectives, there\u2019s a bit of a mismatch there. Conversely, if you want to drive awareness and spread the word about your product but are focused only on Website Conversions, that could also be a problem.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-campaign-objectives.webp\" alt=\"linkedin ads campaign objective overview\" width=\"779\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-88228\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-campaign-objectives.webp 779w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-campaign-objectives-480x370.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 779px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here are the questions to ask when looking at campaign objectives:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do the campaign objectives you&#8217;re using align with your stated goals?<\/li>\n<li>Are there additional campaign objectives you should be using to complement your current efforts?<\/li>\n<li>Are there any campaign objectives you should stay away from based on what you&#8217;re trying to do?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\ud83d\udc40 <strong>Is driving website traffic one of your goals?<\/strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download\">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"linkedin-ads-audience-targeting\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Dig into your audience targeting<\/h3>\n<p>Now comes the fun part, at least for me, we get to see how you&#8217;re targeting your potential customers. This is where we need to apply the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/25\/buyer-persona-examples\">persona information<\/a> we received to determine if the campaigns are actually reaching the users you want or if they\u2019re missing the mark.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-audience-attributes.webp\" alt=\"linkedin ads audience attributes\" width=\"836\" height=\"380\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-88229\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-audience-attributes.webp 836w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-audience-attributes-480x218.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 836px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Start by determining how you&#8217;re reaching your audience: are you using Job Titles, Industries, Company Size, Company Lists, or some combination of multiple options? There\u2019s no right or wrong with this one, you\u2019re just simply trying to determine if you&#8217;re reaching the right users.<\/p>\n<p>A helpful tool for this is the Segment breakdown on the right-hand side of the screen. You\u2019ll see the audience size, which we\u2019ll come to in a second, and then a Show segments link below it. If you click on that, it\u2019ll open up a short list, usually starting with Function. This tells you the breakdown of the audience you&#8217;re currently targeting with that campaign.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-segment-size-results.webp\" alt=\"linkedin ads audience segment breakdown\" width=\"582\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-88230\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-segment-size-results.webp 582w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-segment-size-results-480x495.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 582px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now, if you\u2019re using certain Job Function targeting, you would expect that it would match up pretty closely, but it doesn\u2019t always. In the image above, Healthcare is who we\u2019re trying to target, but there\u2019s 19% for both Business Development and Accounting. These aren\u2019t who we\u2019re trying to reach, so I would suggest adding these as exclusions.<\/p>\n<p>But as you can see in the second image, you can choose from a few different dropdowns to get different insights on the audience. Check through each of these to make sure the Seniority, Company Size, and Industries match up. Years of Experience and Interests aren\u2019t as finite of targeting options as we\u2019d like, so I usually just make note of those but don\u2019t necessarily take action based on them.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-company-size.webp\" alt=\"linkedin ads audit company size audience breakdown\" width=\"401\" height=\"577\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-88231\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-company-size.webp 401w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-company-size-208x300.webp 208w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In addition to looking at who you&#8217;re targeting, it\u2019s also important to look at who you&#8217;re excluding.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are there any exclusions at all?<\/li>\n<li>Are you excluding your customers?<\/li>\n<li>If you&#8217;re using lead generation forms, are you excluding anyone who has filled out the form?<\/li>\n<li>Do you exclude <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/competitors-ads\">competitors<\/a> from your campaigns? What about partner companies?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"linkedin-ads-audience-settings\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Look into additional audience settings<\/h3>\n<p>In addition to the targeting and exclusion settings, there are a few other things you can do in the audience section on LinkedIn.<\/p>\n<p>The first is pretty straightforward: what location and language are you targeting? This is likely a quick check off the list if you\u2019re in the right place and using the right language. Easy-peasy.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-target-audience-location.webp\" alt=\"linkedin ads audience location\" width=\"851\" height=\"418\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-88232\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-target-audience-location.webp 851w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-target-audience-location-480x236.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 851px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The same is true for the last option in the audience builder: Audience Expansion. With a simple check box, you give LinkedIn the ability to reach users who are \u201csimilar\u201d to your audience but wouldn\u2019t qualify to be in it. Personally, I never check this box and I don\u2019t think you (or anyone else) should either. If you need expansion, there are plenty of other targeting types you can test and iterate on without ever needing to use the Expansion feature.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-audience-expansion.webp\" alt=\"linkedin ads audience expansion option\" width=\"730\" height=\"191\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-88233\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-audience-expansion.webp 730w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-audience-expansion-480x126.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 730px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If this is checked, I suggest you uncheck the box and then try other audiences to test if you need more scale.<\/p>\n<div id=\"linkedin-ads-audience-size\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. Analyze audience size<\/h3>\n<p>Speaking of scale, what\u2019s the right size audience for LinkedIn?<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no one single answer for this, but usually somewhere in the 30,000 to 100,000 range is a pretty solid size.<\/p>\n<p>Anything below that can get restricted and you can oversaturate your group pretty quickly. Anything above that can leave potential for performance optimizations with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/04\/customer-segmentation-models\">audience segmentations<\/a> on the table.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s not to say that audiences outside this range can\u2019t work, but on average, you likely have an uphill battle in one way or another.<\/p>\n<p>If the audience you\u2019re auditing is less than 30,000:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try and research additional targeting options you could test to expand the campaign\u2019s reach.<\/li>\n<li>Look to see if you&#8217;re being too restrictive with exclusions.<\/li>\n<li>Potentially try other personas based on how the buying process works. For example, if you\u2019re selling software and only targeting the folks who will sign the contract, you could be leaving valuable influence on the table by not targeting the folks who will actually use the software and empowering them to make the case to those decision-makers for you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the audience you\u2019re auditing is more than 100,000:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can you find meaningful segmentations to try? Should you break your campaigns out by company size for more direct messaging?<\/li>\n<li>Are there Job Functions or Industries sneaking into your targeting without knowing that they should be excluded?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Building and targeting the right audience on LinkedIn is a bit of art and a bit of science. The size doesn\u2019t have to be exactly in that range, but as long as you\u2019re targeting the right folks with an audience size that\u2019s close to the goal range, you should be in a good position.<\/p>\n<div id=\"linkedin-ads-audit-placements\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. Check ad placements<\/h3>\n<p>For now, we\u2019re going to skip the Ad Format section and cover creatives all at once, so that brings us to the next important section of Placement targeting.<\/p>\n<p>Like just about every other advertising platform, LinkedIn lets you publish ads directly on their platform as well as a network of third-party sites that they\u2019ve partnered with.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-placements.webp\" alt=\"linkedin ads placement options\" width=\"854\" height=\"441\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-88234\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-placements.webp 854w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-placements-480x248.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 854px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Just like with Audience Expansion, I turn this off on all of my campaigns. The benefit of LinkedIn is the control and placement of the ads to the exact right users. While the network says you can reach the same folks around the web, my experience (and the experience of many others I\u2019ve talked to) is that the network only drives crap to the site. The CPCs might be lower, but the actual ROAS isn\u2019t there.<\/p>\n<p>If the account you\u2019re auditing does have the Audience Network turned on, then do your due diligence and check the network performance.<\/p>\n<p>In the main campaign tab, click on Breakdown, then select Placement. As I mentioned, I don\u2019t have any accounts with this on, but this view will show you how the Audience Network is performing compared to \u201cOn LinkedIn\u201d so you can see how it\u2019s contributing before suggesting to turn it off.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-placements-list.webp\" alt=\"linkedin ads placement breakdown\" width=\"851\" height=\"419\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-88235\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-placements-list.webp 851w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-placements-list-480x236.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 851px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If it\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/12\/how-to-generate-leads\">driving leads<\/a> and overall performance looks good in the account you\u2019re auditing, I would ask how the overall quality of the leads is before making that suggestion. If you\u2019re the rare case where the leads from that network are fine, then keeping it on is okay, but keep an eye on quality and if that ever wanes, then one of the first things would be to test turning off the extended network and see if that fixes the problem.<\/p>\n<div id=\"linkedin-ads-audit-budget-and-schedule\"><\/div>\n<h3>8. Review budget and schedule<\/h3>\n<p>The Budget &amp; Schedule section is a pretty simple review: are you following the budget you have assigned and are you running the ads during the right period of time?<\/p>\n<p>The budget can be daily, lifetime, or a combination of daily and lifetime controls. No real \u201cwrong\u201d way to do this. Just make sure whatever you have in the settings matches up to your stated budget.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-budget-and-schedule.webp\" alt=\"linkedin ads budget and schedule\" width=\"879\" height=\"526\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-88236\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-budget-and-schedule.webp 879w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-budget-and-schedule-480x287.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 879px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Same thing with scheduling. You can set up an ad schedule to have a start and end date or to be always on, or what I call evergreen. Make sure this lines up with your calendar of efforts and make changes if it\u2019s not.<\/p>\n<div id=\"linkedin-ads-bidding-strategies\"><\/div>\n<h3>9. Look at your bidding strategies<\/h3>\n<p>This section of the audit is typically where I see most folks doing the wrong thing. It\u2019s small, and there\u2019s really only one way to fix it, but my guess is that most of the accounts you encounter will be in a similar position.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on which campaign objective the campaign is using, there are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/linkedin-ads-bidding\">up to three bidding options on LinkedIn<\/a>: Maximum delivery, cost cap, and manual bidding. As a note, if you don\u2019t see manual bidding, it\u2019s because they have it hidden under the \u201cShow Additional Options\u201d link, which only hides that one item.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-bidding-strategy.webp\" alt=\"linkedin ads bidding strategy options\" width=\"823\" height=\"323\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-88237\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-bidding-strategy.webp 823w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-bidding-strategy-480x188.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 823px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In the vast majority of accounts, the setting we want to avoid is maximum delivery. As my friend AJ Wilcox says, \u201cIt\u2019s expensive.\u201d And he\u2019s right.<\/p>\n<p>The key phrase in the maximum delivery description is \u201cwith your full budget.\u201d With this setting, LinkedIn tries to spend the full amount it has available every single day, regardless of what the returns are.<\/p>\n<p>Cost cap is its own beast and if the account you\u2019re auditing is using it and it\u2019s hitting goals, then it\u2019s fine to keep it.<\/p>\n<p>But <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/linkedin-ads-bidding#:~:text=3.-,Manual%20bidding,-With%20manual%20bidding\">the best option on LinkedIn is manual bidding<\/a>. With this option, you set your bids to whatever the maximum you\u2019re willing to pay for a click rather than letting LinkedIn set it for you.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the strategy I always use for this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Opt into manual bidding.<\/li>\n<li>Set your starting bid super low. Way lower than the range they suggest.<\/li>\n<li>As you see performance come in, increase your bids slowly to get more volume and ideally more leads.<\/li>\n<li>If you don\u2019t see any traction in the first few days, you might be too low, and that\u2019s OK! Just slowly increase your bid until you do, then adjust accordingly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This way, you get the same target audience but with the lowest CPCs possible to start, then you control the volume and CPC you get by increasing or decreasing bids based on the performance you see. And make sure you&#8217;re <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin\">posting at the right time<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"linkedin-ads-conversion-strategies\"><\/div>\n<h3>10. Make sure applicable conversion settings are applied<\/h3>\n<p>Lastly in your campaign setup, we need to make sure that all <a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/marketing-solutions\/conversion-tracking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">applicable conversion actions<\/a> are added to the campaign if you\u2019re using a compatible campaign objective.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on the goals for the campaign, make sure all applicable conversions are added so you\u2019ll be able to see the full results in the campaign\u2019s tab. Additionally, no matter which bidding strategy you use, the platform will help you hit your goals in some way, shape, or form. With maximum delivery or most cap, it\u2019s fully automated, but with manual bidding, you\u2019ll see in the section above, that LinkedIn will \u201cEnhance\u201d your bid when it thinks a conversion is likely.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-conversion-tracking.webp\" alt=\"linkedin ads conversion tracking\" width=\"865\" height=\"483\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-88238\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-conversion-tracking.webp 865w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-conversion-tracking-480x268.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 865px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For this setting, make sure all valuable conversions are tracked for each campaign, depending on their individual goals.<\/p>\n<div id=\"linkedin-ads-audit-formats-and-creative\"><\/div>\n<h3>11. Check your ad formats and creatives<\/h3>\n<p>Now on to what your LinkedIn ads actually look like.<\/p>\n<h4>Formats<\/h4>\n<p>As you\u2019re likely aware, there are <a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/marketing-solutions\/success\/ads-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">quite a few different ad formats on LinkedIn<\/a> depending on which campaign objective you\u2019re using.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-ad-format.webp\" alt=\"linkedin ad format options\" width=\"887\" height=\"582\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-88239\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-ad-format.webp 887w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-ad-format-480x315.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 887px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>All of them have their use cases and different accounts and calls to action will perform differently, so there\u2019s no single format to avoid or always include. If anything, I like to see accounts using multiple different formats depending on what they\u2019re advertising and who they\u2019re trying to reach.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some questions to ask:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Which ad formats are you using?<\/li>\n<li>Are there any that seem to be performing better or worse than others?<\/li>\n<li>Are there ad formats you\u2019re not using that you should test?<\/li>\n<li>Should you change campaign objectives based on the call to action you\u2019re using so you can leverage a different ad format?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Creatives<\/h4>\n<p>No matter what format you select, it\u2019s important to review the ad creative and make sure you\u2019re taking advantage of all they\u2019re able to.<\/p>\n<p>LinkedIn will always suggest having five or more creatives in a campaign to help improve your CTR. I actually agree with LinkedIn on this, but the number five is a little arbitrary.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-feed-image-ads.webp\" alt=\"linkedin ads creative optimization\" width=\"758\" height=\"217\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-88240\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-feed-image-ads.webp 758w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-feed-image-ads-480x137.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 758px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Ideally, any campaign should have anywhere from three to six ad creatives running at a time to create some variety for your target audience and also provide you with insights on what works best.<\/p>\n<p>From there, you should review the creatives themselves for some key points:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are the images you\u2019re using eye-catching or are they boring and bland?<\/li>\n<li>Do you have landscape, square, and mobile images to cover the best rendering on all devices?<\/li>\n<li>Are you using the surrounding text to the fullest? Does the messaging entice someone to click or is it boring and sales-y?<\/li>\n<li>Are you speaking directly to the target audience you\u2019ve cultivated or are you simply reusing corporate messaging?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This is where you need to be creative. Clearly, there are thousands of ways to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/05\/linkedin-advertising\">create an ad on LinkedIn<\/a>, but it\u2019s your job to help the client make those ads appealing. What are you seeing that could be better? What do you see that\u2019s working well? How can you level up your ad game?<\/p>\n<div id=\"linkedin-ads-calls-to-action\"><\/div>\n<h3>12. Review your calls to action<\/h3>\n<p>The last point I have for you is not a specific setting but is instead a bit of a soapbox topic for me.<\/p>\n<p>What <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/09\/call-to-action\">calls to action<\/a> is the account using? Or put a different way, what is the account offering its prospective customers?<\/p>\n<p>All too often we get so excited about our ability to target the exact buyer persona we need on LinkedIn that we jump right to the bottom of the funnel and ask for a sale before even introducing ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>For example, this is an actual ad from my personal LinkedIn feed. No shade on Crunchbase, but I\u2019ve only tangentially heard of them so I\u2019m not entirely sure what they do, plus I\u2019ve never engaged with the brand before, but here they are asking me to sign up for a free trial.<\/p>\n<p>A free trial of what?<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-calls-to-action.webp\" alt=\"example of linkedin ad with unclear call to action\" width=\"411\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-88241\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-calls-to-action.webp 411w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/linkedin-ads-audit-calls-to-action-206x300.webp 206w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 411px) 100vw, 411px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Okay, company intelligence, sure. But what does that even mean? Am I getting a user interface? A list of companies to target on LinkedIn? What types of intelligence am I getting?<\/p>\n<p>All of this is a perfectly good ad\u2026IF I would have been nurtured to this point.<\/p>\n<p>For the call to action review, you\u2019re looking for a few things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are you <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/always-on-marketing\/#:~:text=12-,ideas%20for%20always%2Don%20marketing,-While%20always%2Don\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">targeting multiple stages of the funnel<\/a> or only the bottom?<\/li>\n<li>What types of formats are you using to engage with prospects? Website visits, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/10\/linkedin-lead-gen-forms\">lead gen forms<\/a>, some combination?<\/li>\n<li>What are you offering your users? Is there a case study, an industry report, access to a webinar, demo request, sales call, or request to watch customer review videos?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If there\u2019s not a combination of assets and options for the prospective customers, then you should be pointing out that their offer is one-dimensional and needs to be spiced up a bit. Quite frankly, bottom of the funnel only marketing on LinkedIn just doesn\u2019t work.
