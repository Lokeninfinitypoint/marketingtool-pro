Because they determine just about every marketing and selling action you take.<\/p>\n<p>Let me explain. First, let\u2019s start with acquisition costs. <a href=\"https:\/\/shanebarker.com\/blog\/customer-acquisition-strategies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Acquiring customers<\/a> costs money, unfortunately. Whether you are getting them through content marketing, social media <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/15\/lead-magnet-ideas\">lead magnets,<\/a> pay-per-click advertising, on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.garyvaynerchuk.com\/the-snap-generation-a-guide-to-snapchats-history\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Snapchat<\/a> or even by sponsoring a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smartpassiveincome.com\/tutorials\/start-podcast-pats-complete-step-step-podcasting-tutorial\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new podcast<\/a>, everything you do costs money.<\/p>\n<p>While PPC is a more direct way of paying for traffic via clicks\u2026<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f1861435-8097-434b-b2a5-01c177f77a6d\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-kpis-keyword-overview.jpg\" alt=\"ecommerce keyword overview\" width=\"427\" height=\"401\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&#8230;you still incur costs when creating posts for social media or detailed content marketing pieces to attract organic visits.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, the <a href=\"https:\/\/ryrob.com\/how-start-blog\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">best blog<\/a> posts for content marketing take at least six hours.

This mean that you\u2019ll be paying for 12 hours or more of labor for a single piece of high-quality content. And labor ain\u2019t cheap when you are hiring top quality writers.<\/p>\n<p>All of this requires labor, design, and development that, unfortunately, you have to factor those into your acquisition costs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Simply put, cost per acquisition is the average amount of money your ecommerce store has to spend to acquire a single customer. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Cost per acquisition is vitally important, as it can dramatically impact your\u00a0acquisition strategy.<\/p>\n<p>But, to get the full picture, you need to look at lifetime value too.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Customer lifetime value is the average amount of money a single customer will spend with you over their lifetime\/relationship with your ecommerce store. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The connection here is important, as analyzing either of these ecommerce KPIs alone won\u2019t make sense.<\/p>\n<p>Why? Here is an example:<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say your cost per acquisition is $50. That\u2019s fifty bucks for a single customer to do business with you.<\/p>\n<p>So what? Alone, that doesn\u2019t tell you much.<\/p>\n<p>Now, let\u2019s say your lifetime value is $45.<\/p>\n<p>Only now can you make sense of these ecommerce KPIs. From the example above, your acquisition costs are too high, because they surpass the amount the customer spends with you!<\/p>\n<p>But if your lifetime value is $500, a $50 cost per acquisition is nothing!<\/p>\n<p>When analyzing ecommerce KPIs, you should always start from the top with lifetime value and customer acquisition costs (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/09\/lower-customer-acquisition-cost\">how to lower your CAC here!<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Depending on these metrics, you can easily plan the next steps you need to take:<\/p>\n<p><strong>If your CPA is higher than your lifetime value<\/strong>: You are paying more to land the customer than they spend with you. This means you are not producing a profit. To combat this, you have a few options. You can cut costs on advertising or find ways to produce cheaper lead magnets and content marketing. Or you can focus on improving your customer retention and focus on upselling existing and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/19\/customer-marketing-strategies\">loyal customers<\/a> to build lifetime value. Building lifetime value per customer will help you afford those acquisition costs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If your lifetime value is higher than your CPA<\/strong>: Congrats! You are doing great. This opens the door for tons of growth. If LTV is far higher than CPA, you are making a profit per customer and have room to spend even more on customer acquisition because of your high lifetime values. LTV can be higher for ecommerce subscription businesses or companies <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adamenfroy.com\/best-online-course-platforms\">selling online courses<\/a> and digital subscriptions, as monthly recurring revenue can greatly increase LTV. With a return on ad spend (ROAS) over 3:1, you can focus heavily on new customer acquisition and sustainable growth.<\/p>\n<h2>Ecommerce KPI #2:\u00a0Cart abandonment rate<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Cart abandonment rate is the percentage of people who leave their cart after putting items into it on your store.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This pesky little ecommerce KPI\u00a0can tell you a lot about your current\u00a0store and website. Cart abandonment tells you if your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/14\/increase-traffic-to-my-website\">website is killing it<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.landbot.io\/is-your-website-driving-people-away-heres-how-to-fix-it\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">driving people away<\/a> in masses. It\u2019s one of the most annoying metrics to see on your dashboard, but it\u2019s also one of the most telling, helpful metrics to analyze.<\/p>\n<p>According to Statista data, cart abandonment averages at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/457078\/category-cart-abandonment-rate-worldwide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">74.2%<\/a> for online retailers in 2018.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s high. Too high.<\/p>\n<p>While not all stores will have such a high rate, the average ecommerce store does. What are the most common reasons? Almost all of them have to do with key purchasing pain points:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expensive shipping<\/li>\n<li>No free shipping<\/li>\n<li>Unaware of shipping costs<\/li>\n<li>Slow shipping<\/li>\n<li>Researching<\/li>\n<li>Long process<\/li>\n<li>Bad site UI<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Thanks to Amazon, shipping has become a value point in its own right. No longer are the days where people will patiently wait 7-10 business days to receive the product they ordered. Not when Amazon delivers in two days (or even same-day).<\/p>\n<p>Do you have competitors selling on Amazon with similar products and pricing to you? Do you have high cart abandonment rates?<\/p>\n<p>You can bet that people are abandoning your cart, looking to Amazon, finding competitors, and getting their products because of shipping.<\/p>\n<p>So, how can you combat it?<\/p>\n<p>By tackling cart abandonment rates at the source:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Showcase pain points during the cart process<\/li>\n<li>Improve speed<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>First, you need to combat pain points during the checkout process. And the biggest pain points all revolve around shipping:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cost<\/li>\n<li>Time to ship<\/li>\n<li>Estimated delivery dates<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Amazon wins the shipping game not just because they have two-day shipping, but also because they are so clear about your shipping expectations before you even order the product:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2345e6aa-2ed0-4dad-8ef5-a758bb509d88\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-kpis-amazon-review-shipping.jpg\" alt=\"review shipping page\" width=\"845\" height=\"425\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>People know exactly when they are going to get their product instead of seeing \u201c7-10 business days after order processing.\u201d What does that even mean for a consumer? How are they supposed to know what your order processing looks like? Is that one day? Next week?<\/p>\n<p>These all cause frustration and lead to cart abandonment rates. On your checkout page, be sure to make shipping as clear as Amazon does.<\/p>\n<p>Another key reason for cart abandonment is bad user experience. How fast is your site? Is it easy to navigate?
