Customize your columns<\/h3>\n<p>Custom columns within your ad accounts per platform will save you time later when reporting. When you\u2019re in the accounts working on action items daily or weekly, you\u2019ll be able to see your personalized column set with data specific to your reports.<\/p>\n<p>That way, you can make educated decisions regarding changes to your account with your PPC reporting always in mind. It\u2019s easy to set up by simply selecting the column icon and following the custom column choices from there. Whether you\u2019re at the campaign level, ad set level, or any view in between, custom columns can be a PPC reporting time-saver.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/custom-columns-in-ppc-reporting-facebook-example.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"390\" alt=\"custom column creation for ppc reporting in google ads\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>2. Tell a story with your data<\/h3>\n<p>When you\u2019re crunching data, sometimes that \u201cnorth star\u201d main point gets lost along the way. Don\u2019t let that happen by always trying to keep your \u201cbig picture\u201d goals in mind. Otherwise, if someone\u2019s staring at numbers with no context, they\u2019re just that: numbers. However, those numbers mean something when you apply how they relate to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/28\/growth-strategy\">your business growth<\/a> or the current state of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/04\/best-marketing-strategies-2021\">marketing strategies<\/a> within the real world.<\/p>\n<p>Try including a quick sentence below charts or a notes section within your PPC reporting to explain what\u2019s going on with the data. Perhaps include your reasoning behind why a metric went up or down, or mention external factors like a change in operating hours during that time frame. The more context you can provide in your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/25\/data-driven-marketing\">data-driven strategy<\/a>, the better.<\/p>\n<p>Even if the report is just for yourself, you may not always remember exactly what was happening or what changes were made when looking back on those reports down the line.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ppc-reporting-example-of-report-notes.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"429\" alt=\"example of ppc reporting with notes\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>3. Make sure there are clear takeaways<\/h3>\n<p>Treat your PPC reporting like you would any other part of marketing: you want to answer that question of \u201cso what?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>On top of telling a story with your data, your PPC reporting should be action-oriented. The point of reporting is to guide yourself, your client, or your team on what to do next. Reports act as a sounding board for data-backed decisions on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/06\/adwords-account-structure\">how you can improve your account<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Even with the best accounts, I always say there\u2019s room for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/24\/ppc-performance\">improvement in PPC<\/a>. So take advantage of your PPC reporting to help you identify where you can improve. For example, similar to the notes section we mentioned above for context, you may also want to include a quick \u201crecommendations\u201d section where you input what you think should be the next few action items based on the data.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ppc-reporting-example-report-with-recommendations.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"288\" alt=\"example of ppc report with recommendations\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>4. Get into a PPC reporting cadence<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s been said many times before, but both in marketing and PPC, <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/brand-consistency\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">consistency is key<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>Be sure to set up a regular report schedule and stick to it. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Weekly reports<\/strong> help you make tweaks to your tactics and campaigns during your day-to-day work in the account.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Monthly reports <\/strong>help you to track goal progression.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Quarterly reports<\/strong> help to inform you on high-level strategy efforts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Whether you choose one that works best for your bandwidth or a mix of all three, keeping to a regular PPC reporting cadence will help you stay on track without letting anything slip through the cracks.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ppc-reports-with-comparison-data.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"403\" alt=\"example of ppc reporting date range selection\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/octoboard-ppc-reporting-strategies-for-2020\/371457\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>5.

Here are some common <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/16\/marketing-analysis-tools\">PPC reporting and analysis tools <\/a>you could try:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Platform-specific reports<\/h3>\n<p>Google ads, Facebook ads, Microsoft ads, Twitter, LinkedIn and everything in between offers some type of reporting within their own platform. If you don\u2019t have the resources to ramp up a new third party tool, using what\u2019s already readily available to you within the platform can be just as helpful.<\/p>\n<p>You can even take screenshots of dashboards, or <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/6201327?hl=en\">schedule your Google Ads reports<\/a> and have them ready to go. If you\u2019re unsure where to start when it comes to PPC reporting, exploring reporting capabilities right from within your accounts is a great place to kick your PPC reporting off.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ppc-reporting-20in-google-ads.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"258\" alt=\"reports tab in google ads analytics\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>2. Google Data Studio<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/marketingplatform.google.com\/about\/data-studio\/\">Google Ads Data Studio<\/a> was released a few years back, and has now become a heavily leveraged tool among the PPC and general marketing community.<\/p>\n<p>Data Studio aggregates your PPC data along with your other data sources, like Google Analytics, to give you detailed information on both your paid and organic performance. Set up is easy, and it\u2019s free to use. Plus, you can share and download the reports.<\/p>\n<p>Data Studio is great for someone ready to take their PPC reporting a step beyond what\u2019s readily available in the ad platforms themselves, without having to sacrifice a ton of time or resources.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ppc-reporting-data-studio-example.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"447\" alt=\"example of ppc reporting with data studio dashboard\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<div>You can also<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/11\/18\/how-to-use-google-data-studio\"> use Google Data Studio for your SEO reporting and strategy<\/a>.<\/div>\n<h3>3.

But Analytics can also report on so much more, like organic and social performance across your site.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/15\/google-analytics-tips\">use Google Analytics to understand your audience<\/a> and top paths of the customer journey. Unlike some of the other tools, where you\u2019re at the mercy of the pre-set metrics and visuals, Google Analytics is also extremely customizable.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for more advanced, custom reports, Analytics is a fitting solution.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-to-import-cost-data-google-analytics-customize-cost-analysis-report.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"361\" alt=\"customized cost analysis report creation in google analytics\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/11\/import-cost-data-to-google-analytics\"><em>Learn how to view and analyze cost data from all platforms in GA here<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>4.
