Often, these people are new to content marketing \u2013 they have a new site or business, or they just haven\u2019t tried to build traffic and an audience with content marketing yet. They want to know the single biggest action they can take to start building their brand with content.<\/p>\n<p>When I get this question, I always say the same thing: <strong>My #1 tip is to create a cornerstone content piece<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/cornerstone-content-guide1.png\" alt=\"cornerstone content\" width=\"380\" height=\"350\" \/><\/div>\n<p>What the heck does this even mean? Why is cornerstone content so important? And how do you actually do it? These are questions you\u2019ll get the answers to today!<\/p>\n<h2>What is cornerstone content?<\/h2>\n<p>Cornerstone content is a <strong>high-value, foundational piece of content<\/strong> that is intended to help you start building traffic and brand awareness by showing people what you can offer. Your cornerstone content should be highly relevant to your business goals \u2013 it helps you establish authority in your industry and will bring in a steady stream of site visitors who are likely to be interested, sooner or later, in the products or services you offer.<\/p>\n<p>However, keep in mind that a cornerstone content piece is usually pretty top-of-funnel \u2013 that means it should be open and free (not locked behind a paywall or registration form), and you shouldn\u2019t expect everyone who visits this content to buy something or otherwise convert. <strong>The real goal of cornerstone content is to create a positive first impression<\/strong>, so people get a warm, fuzzy feeling about your brand. That way, when they <em>are<\/em> ready to convert, they\u2019re much more likely to turn to you.<\/p>\n<p>The metaphor of the cornerstone comes to us from masonry. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/browse\/cornerstone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">As the folks at Dictionary.com define it<\/a>, a cornerstone is:<\/p>\n<p>1. a stone uniting two masonry walls at an intersection.<\/p>\n<p>2. a stone representing the nominal starting place in the construction of a monumental building, usually carved with the date and laid with appropriate ceremonies.<\/p>\n<p>3. something that is essential, indispensable, or basic: <em>The cornerstone of democratic government is a free press.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>4. the chief foundation on which something is constructed or developed: <em>The cornerstone of his argument was that all people are created equal.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This definition is handy because your cornerstone content should do these things too \u2013 it should support the rest of your content as you build out your website, and form an essential part of your traffic base. (You might also want to take a page from that \u201cappropriate ceremonies\u201d bit \u2013 more on that when we get to content promotion.)<\/p>\n<h2>What are the benefits of a cornerstone content piece?<\/h2>\n<p>Cornerstone content has a number of benefits for your business:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Raises your brand awareness<\/li>\n<li>Brings in relevant site visitors<\/li>\n<li>Builds natural links (which help the rest of your site\u2019s <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/30\/seo-basics\">SEO<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Establishes authority, trust, and positive brand sentiment<\/li>\n<li>Feeds your funnel (helping you build an email list, for example)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you\u2019re asking me for help with content marketing, then I know you\u2019re interested in all of these outcomes!

He found the results so helpful that it sold him on their financial planning services. Nice work, Wealthfront! This is how giving something valuable away for free can pay off.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/wealthfront-cornerstone-content.jpg\" alt=\"cornerstone content free tool example\" width=\"800\" height=\"402\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This also illustrates how a free tool can actually be a form of content. Take our own <a href=\"\/keywords\/?dt=1\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a> \u2013 we launched it way back in the aughts, and today, it\u2019s one of the top five most trafficked pages on our website (with over half a million visitors a year), as well as one of the most <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/24\/link-building-now\">frequently linked<\/a>, and it drives a huge portion of our first actions.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/free-tools-as-cornerstone-content.jpg\" alt=\"how to create cornerstone content\" width=\"800\" height=\"288\" \/><\/div>\n<p>So when planning out what your cornerstone content will be, consider other forms of content beyond just articles and guides.<\/p>\n<p>Another example of what I\u2019d consider our own cornerstone content: our <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/29\/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks\">advertising benchmarks for Google AdWords<\/a> and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/28\/facebook-advertising-benchmarks\">Facebook advertising<\/a>. Since we sell software to help businesses manage their AdWords and Facebook campaigns, we tapped our wealth of customer data to provide some guidelines for advertisers on the averages they should be looking to beat when it comes to key metrics like click-through rate and conversion rate.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ads-average-conversion-rate.png\" alt=\"wordstream cornerstone content\" width=\"800\" height=\"792\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Again, these two content pieces drive a huge amount of traffic, links, and leads for us, because <strong>our target audience truly finds them helpful, and this data isn\u2019t easy to find anywhere else<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Now that we\u2019ve established what cornerstone content is and why you need it, let\u2019s walk through the seven steps you\u2019ll need to follow, in detail, to create your own cornerstone content.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 1: Choosing your content topic and format<\/h2>\n<p>The first step in this process is extremely important \u2013 in fact, I\u2019d say choosing the right topic for your cornerstone content piece is actually just as important as the execution.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/target-customer-shoes.jpeg\" alt=\"how to brainstorm cornerstone content topics\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Start by putting yourself in your target audience\u2019s shoes, since these are the people that you\u2019re trying to reach with your content. Ask questions like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What big problems do my target customers have? What are the burning questions they need answers to?<\/li>\n<li>Of those problems, which ones aren\u2019t already solved by existing content on the web? Are there important questions that they\u2019re not getting adequate answers to?<\/li>\n<li>Of <em>those<\/em> problems, are there any that you\u2019re uniquely positioned to address? Do you have special knowledge, insight, or data that could help people facing these problems?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Give yourself plenty of time to think about these questions. Gather ideas from everyone in your business. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/11\/voice-of-the-customer\">Talk to your actual customers<\/a>! Your cornerstone content needs to be relevant to your audience.<\/p>\n<p>When you find a meaty problem or question, do some competitive research to make sure you have something new to bring to the table. For example, you might think a mattress buying guide is a great idea for a cornerstone content piece \u2013 but that\u2019s already a very crowded (and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/3065928\/sleepopolis-casper-bloggers-lawsuits-underside-of-the-mattress-wars\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">surprisingly controversial<\/a>!) space, and you might not be able to create something unique or <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/how-to-create-10x-content-whiteboard-friday\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10X better<\/a> than what\u2019s already available.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/competitive-research-cornerstone-content.jpg\" alt=\"competitive keyword research for content\" width=\"500\" height=\"654\" \/><\/div>\n<p><em>It\u2019s hard to rank for competitive queries if you can\u2019t create something much better than what\u2019s already ranking<\/em><\/p>\n<p>What you\u2019re looking for here is a hole, a point of entry.<strong> The ideal topic for a cornerstone content piece is something that people are commonly searching for, without getting satisfying results. <\/strong>This way, you can swoop in and be the hero.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve settled on a topic idea, think about the format that would best deliver what people are looking for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A long-form how-to guide? (like that SEO guide for beginners mentioned above)<\/li>\n<li>A video or series of videos? (like <a href=\"http:\/\/videos.homedepot.com\/detail\/videos\/bath\/video\/5034083179001\/how-to-install-a-bathroom-faucet?autoStart=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Home Depot\u2019s DIY project series<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Some kind of data visualization?

(like that beauty review site)<\/li>\n<li>A free tool or app? (like a mortgage calculator or a photo editor)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Delivering super-helpful information or guidance in the right format is crucial to great cornerstone content.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 2: Keyword research<\/h2>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve got your topic idea in mind, the next step is <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">keyword research<\/a>. You want to be sure that there\u2019s healthy <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/23\/keyword-search-volume\">keyword search volume<\/a> related to your topic of choice, because keyword volume is a sign of interest and demand. If a lot of people are searching for something in Google or other search engines, there\u2019s a big opportunity for you to capture that traffic and create that great first impression of your brand.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say we\u2019re hoping to create a great cornerstone content piece for a boutique men\u2019s grooming shop, selling vintage-y shaving supplies, beard oil, mustache wax, all that hipster nonsense.

This is largely going to depend on your current staff and resources. If you\u2019ve got an actual marketing team, you can probably pull it off in-house. If you\u2019re a one- or two-man\/woman affair, it might be tricky to devote the necessary time and effort while also keeping the rest of your business running.<\/p>\n<p>If you decide to hire out, check our <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/31\/ultimate-guide-hiring-an-agency\">3-Step Guide to Hiring an Agency or Any Third-Party Vendor<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that you can also do it partially outsourced and partially in-house. For example, you could do all the research for your cornerstone content in-house, then hire a contractor to turn your research into a visual asset like an infographic, or a video.<\/p>\n<h3>Put some milestones in place<\/h3>\n<p>However you plan to create this thing, think like a project manager and put some milestones in place to keep the project moving. Remember, your cornerstone content piece needs to be truly awesome, so don\u2019t expect it to come together in a matter of days.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/program-management-tree.jpg\" alt=\"content marketing project management\" width=\"736\" height=\"556\" \/><\/div>\n<p><em>I was not told there would be biology<\/em><\/p>\n<p>A solid guide could take up to a month to produce.

These costs will vary pretty widely depending on what kind of content you\u2019re trying to produce. Potential costs include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fees for a freelance writer (don\u2019t skimp here \u2013 a good freelance writer may charge up to a dollar per word)<\/li>\n<li>Design costs<\/li>\n<li>Development costs<\/li>\n<li>Promotion budget (social media promotion can be quite cost-effective for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/31\/content-amplification\">content amplification<\/a>)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Don\u2019t be afraid to spend some money on this!

It should be completely accurate, truly helpful, a real \u201cWow\u201d experience for prospects. So hire the best talent you can afford to create it, and build in time for review and revision.

For example, there should be a \u201cchapter\u201d or section in your beard guide about how long it takes to grow a beard.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Intent, intent, intent.<\/strong> Matching intent is so crucial. Try to tackle a topic that you understand inside and out, and ensure that your content really and truly solves the problem and gets your visitor where they want to be.

It also helps them scan and skip around, which web readers are especially wont to do.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t forget about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shopify.com\/blog\/7412852-10-must-know-image-optimization-tips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">image optimization<\/a> \u2013 use relevant keywords in your image file names, use alt text, and keep your images light and fast-loading. (Also, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/01\/content-marketing-images\">use plenty of images in your content<\/a> \u2013 one per every 100-200 words or so.)<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re creating a video or an infographic, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/02\/video-seo\">make sure you provide some supplementary text<\/a> that Google can \u201cread\u201d \u2013 like a transcript. Be wary of infographics in general \u2013 they don\u2019t necessarily provide a great mobile experience. Consider responsive, even interactive forms of data visualization that aren\u2019t just a giant image file.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, whatever the content type, <strong>make sure it works just as well on mobile<\/strong>! The \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/faq-google-mobile-first-index-262751\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mobile-first index<\/a>\u201d is a reality we can\u2019t ignore.<\/p>\n<p>These on-page elements are really important, but don\u2019t forget about off-page SEO, AKA links. Create some internal links to your new cornerstone content piece, ideally from high-value, high-engagement pages on your site, like your homepage. You\u2019ll also want to get some external links pointing in \u2013 more on that in the promotion section below.<\/p>\n<h3>Optimizing your content for social<\/h3>\n<p>Part of what makes content shareable is the content itself: Is it truly helpful? Does it make people <em>feel<\/em> something?<\/p>\n<p>But once you\u2019ve got that down, you also need to make it really easy for people to share your content. Here are some tips to get more shares out of your cornerstone content:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Get some social buttons on there so people can share it with one click.<\/strong> There are lots of plugins available to make this easy, and if you have the resources you can customize or develop your own. Keep the buttons visible.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/social-buttons-wordpress.png\" alt=\"social media buttons\" width=\"700\" height=\"474\" \/><\/div>\n<p><em>Via <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/social-pug\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WordPress<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>When creating your content, don\u2019t just think about who might read it \u2013 think about who might <em>share<\/em> it.<\/strong> Consider quoting or referencing <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/26\/influencer-marketing\">influencers in your industry<\/a> who might be inclined to share the content with their followers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Consider creating images or videos that encapsulate your content, optimized for different social platforms.<\/strong> For video, choose an appealing thumbnail image; smiling people tend to do well. An appealing featured image for Twitter, Facebook, etc. should be colorful and on-brand.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Finally, don\u2019t just rely on organic social promotion \u2013 more on this in the next section.<\/p>\n<h3>Optimizing for action<\/h3>\n<p>Like I said above \u2013 your cornerstone content shouldn\u2019t be sales-y. It\u2019s OK if people visit your content and don\u2019t immediately become customers. Don\u2019t expect a bangin\u2019 conversion rate at this stage of the funnel.<\/p>\n<p>That said, don\u2019t shut down the possibility of visitors becoming customers! There\u2019s room in your content for some low-friction, next-step offers.<\/p>\n<p>For example, you might want to implement an exit-banner campaign \u2013 don\u2019t do it in a way that interrupts users, but when people are moving to leave your site, you can show them a pop-up that incents them to join your email list (maybe offering, say, 20% off their first order if they sign up).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/exit-offer-on-cornerstone-content.jpg\" alt=\"exit popup example\" width=\"355\" height=\"521\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Also, cookie your visitors so you can remarket to them later! Once you\u2019ve used this awesome content to turn them into a fan of your brand, show them remarketing ads that will remind them you exist and force them to come back for more. You already know these people are trying to grow a beard \u2013 wouldn\u2019t it be great if you could show them an ad for your best-selling shaving kit every time they log into Facebook?<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about this tactic, read our guides to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/11\/16\/facebook-remarketing\">remarketing on Facebook<\/a> and on the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/12\/04\/adwords-remarketing-best-practices-guide\">Google Display Network<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 6: Promotion<\/h2>\n<p>It would be crazy to put this much effort into a content piece and then fall down on promoting it. You want it to make a splash. It takes time for new content to rank in organic search (especially if you\u2019re a new business!), so you\u2019ll need to pursue other avenues to get your content in front of people in the meantime.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-promotion-sky-dancers.gif\" alt=\"content promotion\" width=\"370\" height=\"222\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Buzzsumo recently published a <a href=\"http:\/\/buzzsumo.com\/blog\/went-viral-lessons-promoting-content-influencers-ads-pr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">great case study<\/a> on how they got a blog post leveraging internal data to \u201cgo viral.\u201d Check it out, and try the below strategies:<\/p>\n<h3>Email promotion<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019ve got an email list, use it! Send out a dedicated email announcing your awesome new content piece to your database. Top-of-funnel emails like this often see great open and click-through rates.<\/p>\n<p>But don\u2019t stop there \u2013 do a little targeted email outreach, writing personalized emails for specific people that you believe would be especially interested in reading your new content, sharing it, or \u2013 best of all \u2013 linking to it.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some great tips for <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/outreach\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">writing an awesome outreach email<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/outreach-email-for-cornerstone-content.jpg\" alt=\"email outreach for content promotion\" width=\"900\" height=\"484\" \/><\/div>\n<p><em>Making it personal always helps!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>When thinking about how to target, look for those almighty influencers, but also look for related content that is already popular. If you run across a good list of resources for the well-dressed, well-groomed gentleman, reach out to the author and suggest they add a link to your great new beard-growing guide. (Try <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/25\/twitter-link-building\">adding an incentive for them to link to you<\/a> \u2013 mention that you\u2019ll promote their post to return the favor.)<\/p>\n<h3>Social media promotion<\/h3>\n<p>Organic social promotion is a no-brainer. Of course you should post your new content to all your social networks, but it\u2019ll take a little more work than that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tailor your text, image, etc. for different social networks<\/strong>. Different content succeeds on different platforms. For example, videos tend to do well on Facebook, so you could make a video version of your content just for FB and then link to the full guide from there.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Share more than once. WAY MORE THAN ONCE.<\/strong> Put your content into a rotation so it\u2019s getting regular exposure to more, new, different people.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Focus on the platforms that work best in your industry.<\/strong> If you\u2019re in the grooming business, you\u2019re going to want to create some beautiful images of bearded men (with the beards as the focal point, natch) for Instagram and Pinterest.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pinterest-beard-board.jpg\" alt=\"social media content promotion\" width=\"700\" height=\"547\" \/><\/div>\n<p><em>Sick beard content, bro<\/em><\/p>\n<p>But hey. Hey. Organic social promotion might not be enough. Good news though \u2013 paid social promotion is pretty affordable! And it can really get the ball rolling, leading to more people reading and sharing your content for free.<\/p>\n<p>Our founder Larry Kim is kind of the king of paid social promotion. Some of his <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/30\/social-media-advertising-tips\">best tips for content marketers using paid social promotion<\/a> include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Promote to targeted audiences \u2013 don\u2019t just broadcast.<\/strong> For example, on Facebook you could promote your new guide only to men between the ages of 18 and 29. On Twitter, you can promote your post to a certain hashtag.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/social-media-advertising-trump-tweet-engagement.jpg\" alt=\"Social media advertising Trump tweet engagement\" width=\"900\" height=\"364\" \/><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Optimize for relevance.<\/strong> Most social platforms have some kind of relevancy algorithm \u2013 on Facebook, it\u2019s called <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/14\/facebook-relevance-score\">Relevance Score<\/a>. Basically, how it works is that higher engagement rates keep your ad in the rotation and lower the cost you pay per engagement. If you see that a certain headline or image is performing well with your audience, replicate it!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Set aside some money to promote your posts on social and make sure targeted users see it. In that Buzzsumo case study I mentioned above, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/steverayson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Steve Rayson<\/a> writes: \u201cWe spent $648.00 on Facebook ads that drove over 2,000 clicks and which also resulted in 3 new paying customers.\u201d Not bad ROI there.<\/p>\n<p>Notice his targeting strategy as well: \u201cOur first ad targeted employees of big publishers like BuzzFeed, Refinery29, Quartz, and Mashable.\u201d This got them some big links, which had a nice trickle-down effect, as more exposure tends to beget more links.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 7: Maintenance<\/h2>\n<p>The final ingredient in your cornerstone content is time \u2013 give your beautiful creation a few months to accrue attention, shares and links, while keeping an eye on performance. Most of the traffic will likely come from email and social sources at first, but over time, you want to see traffic coming in from organic search as well.<\/p>\n<p>So let\u2019s fast forward and say you\u2019ve done everything right (is it hard being so perfect?) and you\u2019re really happy with your content\u2019s performance. Is it time to kick back and relax?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/relaxinman.jpg\" alt=\"relaxing\" width=\"500\" height=\"308\" \/><\/div>\n<p><em>Don\u2019t get cocky, outline man<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Not exaaactly. You want your cornerstone content to be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/03\/get-more-traffic-from-evergreen-content\">evergreen<\/a>, so you should check in at least quarterly to make sure everything is working smoothly and look for opportunities to make it even better. Such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keep it impeccably up to date.<\/strong> If there\u2019s suddenly a big new trend in beard-growing, your content should include it. If you recommend specific products, make sure they\u2019re still available, the prices are accurate, and so on.<\/li>\n<li><strong>If your cornerstone content is an app or tool<\/strong>, can you add new features? Can you improve the UX or make it faster?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Try running some CRO tests <\/strong>to see if you can get a little more business value out of it. Test a different exit offer, or a different first email to send out to people who join your list.<\/li>\n<li><strong>If years go by and you\u2019re still seeing return value<\/strong>, consider giving your content a style refresh now and then. You don\u2019t want it to look outdated even if the content is still fresh. Fonts, images, and layouts may need to be revisited for the times.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Nobody puts baby in a corner<\/h2>\n<p>4400 words later, I sincerely hope you are AMPED to create your site\u2019s first cornerstone content piece. It\u2019s going to be a lot of work, but man is it going to feel good when you\u2019re finished.<\/p>\n<p>Still have questions about how this works?
