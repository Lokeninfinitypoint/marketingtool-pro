Improve design elements in email headers<\/h3>\n<p>Marketers who aren\u2019t necessarily graphic designers are often called on to produce visuals for the assets they manage.

But you risk not only false information making it in, but ethically not flagging the content as AI generated is by most considered plagiarism.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Does that really matter to less-ethical marketers who only care about driving traffic? Celia said it should, in light of the recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/2024-google-algorithm-updates\">volatility of Google SERPs<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Well, it might end up doing more harm than good for your site&#8217;s SEO,\u201d Celia warned. \u201cGoogle <a href=\"https:\/\/url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com\/s\/gRF7CjRgzqSRpLDlqSWQUvl?domain=searchenginejournal.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recently announced<\/a> updates to its algorithm that will make it more vigilant at removing low-quality content like much of what AI produces without human refinement.
