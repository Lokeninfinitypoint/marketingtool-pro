Which is what makes <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/04\/facebook-retargeting\">Facebook retargeting<\/a>\u00a0another strategy to try during\/after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Referring to my first point about investing in your existing customers\u2014it really is the same logic.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Run exclusive deals and offers<\/h2>\n<p>As businesses begin to reopen,\u00a0a good way to get people interested in coming in is by offering exclusive <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/13\/sales-promotion-examples\">sales promotions<\/a> or deals. You can announce or even advertise these offers on social media platforms as well as <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/21\/promotional-email-examples\">promotional emails<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/digital20strategies20that20make20the20most20of20COVID-1920promote20exclusive20deals.png\" alt=\"digital strategies that make the most of COVID-19 promote exclusive deals\" width=\"800\" height=\"359\" \/><\/div>\n<p>These kinds of offers will help bring in new customers while also getting old ones interested in coming back. This idea can work for multiple industries (theatres, spas, gyms, etc.) but it works particularly well for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/02\/new-data-google-ads-benchmarks-during-covid-19\">industries that have been hit hard by the coronavirus<\/a>\u2014restaurants and travel, for example.<\/p>\n<p>Discounts, freebies, and similar saving options could be the incentive customers need to invest in you. You could even offer membership deals for customers that choose to invest in you during a certain time period. This will help you earn some money even when times are tough.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Give your communication strategy an overhaul<\/h2>\n<p>As people\u2019s priorities and schedules change, the previous communication strategy you had in action may not be right. It would be wise to rethink the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/04\/best-time-to-send-email-campaign\">newsletters<\/a> you are sending out, the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/15\/quality-content-defined\">content you are creating<\/a>, and the general approach you have towards your customers.<\/p>\n<p>This could mean redoing your content calendar\u00a0altogether or maybe putting some blog posts on the backburner while you focus more on articles that cater to doubts, fears, and questions related to the current situation. This also means that you need to take the time to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/18\/post-covid-19-customers\">get to know your post-COVID-19 customers<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>One way to do this is to send out an email survey with questions about their current priorities, pain points, and desires. Make them easy to answer (multiple choice or choose a point on a scale), but\u00a0keep some questions open-ended because this way you might discover a few golden nuggets of information about your customers.<\/p>\n<p>You can then use this information to rethink your communication strategy and serve your customers better.<\/p>\n<p>You may even give your ads, emails, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/11\/at-home-diy-video\">videos<\/a>, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/05\/webinar-marketing\">webinars<\/a>, and podcast episodes an overhaul so you are keeping the current priorities of your customers in mind.

Focus on a few main paid advertising channels<\/h2>\n<p>As I mentioned above, PPC ads are the way to go right now but focusing on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/24\/google-ads-optimization\">Google Ads<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/29\/linkedin-advertising-during-covid-19\">LinkedIn ads<\/a>, Twitter ads, Facebook ads, and Instagram ads all at once is going to you no good. You need to figure out where your target audience is hanging out and then focus most of your PPC efforts on those channels.<\/p>\n<p>So, for example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are a beauty business, your target audience is likely to be on Instagram.<\/li>\n<li>If you have a more serious business like an <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/28\/ppc-campaigns-addiction-treatment-facilities\">addiction treatment facility<\/a>, you could focus more on Google.<\/li>\n<li>If you have a business-related tool or service like a <a href=\"\/Keywords\">keyword research tool<\/a>,\u00a0LinkedIn would be your go-to.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Use these strategies to survive and thrive in the age of COVID-19<\/h2>\n<p>Having a few solid digital marketing strategies to depend on while the world settles down can not only <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/17\/businesses-likely-to-thrive-post-covid\">help your business get back on its feet <\/a>but also give you a headstart against your competitors.
