What could Dischler reveal that wasn\u2019t previously revealed in the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/05\/google-adwords-livestream\">Google AdWords livestream<\/a> back in May? To my surprise, he confirmed some future functionality I\u2019ve been pondering and even revealed some shocking statistics and future projects the AdWords product team is working on. Yesterday morning at SMX Advanced, Search Engine Land&#8217;s Ginny Marvin and Danny Sullivan did a phenomenal job of asking all the right questions to get Dischler talking. So PPC people listen up, this is exciting stuff!<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"da43e22c-d8e8-4b53-8664-80907b0355d4\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/future-of-adwords.png\" alt=\"Future of AdWords SMX image of the panel\" width=\"404\" height=\"302\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>#1: Tablet Conversions Have Surpassed Desktop<\/h2>\n<p>For real? I\u2019m quite suspicious over this one. Just thinking about the way that I personally interact with my tablet, I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019ve ever made a purchase via the device. Which leads to my next question, what is Dischler <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/13\/tracking-conversions-in-adwords\">defining as a conversion<\/a>? WordStream\u2019s data scientist Mark Irvine and I were both suspicious and decided to find out for ourselves. From a data-set of about 200 clients we found <strong>15% have a higher CVR on tablet than desktop<\/strong>. Common industries within that 15% that convert higher on tablets include healthcare, tech, and real estate. Of course this data would go against Jerry\u2019s claim, so my suspicions still run high.<\/p>\n<p>Dischler also confirmed that Google will continue to group desktop and tablet as one. Sadly, hopeful marketers should not look forward to tablet bidding because it\u2019s not coming anytime soon! Dischler said that Google still finds the behavioral patterns to be so similar on the two devices and therefore splitting them up remains illogical. Again, hard to believe thinking about the way I personally interact on my desktop vs. my tablet, but let\u2019s move on to the next one.<\/p>\n<h2>#2: Google Plans to Scale New Mobile Ad Formats for Multiple Industries<\/h2>\n<p>Now we\u2019re talking! A large chunk of the livestream was focused on mobile ad formats for four verticals: automotive, shopping, finance, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/11\/travel-marketing\">and travel<\/a>, leaving marketers in other industries thinking \u201cwhat about me?\u201d Yes, we feel your pain! Luckily, Google has not forgotten about you!<\/p>\n<p>WordStream founder Larry Kim, who happened to have a front-row seat at the livestream, predicted that Google would release <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/20\/new-mobile-ad-format\">mobile ad formats<\/a> for other industries as well. Yesterday, to hear it from Dischler himself just confirmed our guess. \u201cFor <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/19\/vertical-marketing-guides\">each vertical<\/a> we\u2019d like to create a template that will better lead to an answer,\u201d says Dischler.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"475a38db-8adb-4ae9-8bf2-732324350826\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/future-of-adwords-livestream.jpg\" alt=\"Future of AdWords image of Larry Kim speaking with Jerry Dischler \" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Larry Kim chatting with Google\u2019s VP of Product Management, Jerry Dischler<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen session lengths are compressed as they are on mobile, we need to drive people to answers more quickly,\u201d says Dischler. \u201cOn mobile, people also expect more rich content. So we\u2019re going to build products that work well on mobile first.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Dischler confirmed that text ads are here to stay, but Google plans to \u201cenhance text ads to make them more useful for users, especially mobile users.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At WordStream we\u2019ve found that mobile conversion rates lag far behind CVR\u2019s on desktops and tablets, so Google\u2019s plans to revamp mobile ad formats for advertisers is truly game-changing. \u201cOur goal is to drive people to answers faster,\u201d says Dischler. He went on to speak of their plans to make ads much richer and more interactive on mobile because if the ad looks better it\u2019s likely to perform better.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"836be7fc-0a1e-489c-9a4f-6a864eab7c39\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/future-of-adwords-data.png\" alt=\"Future of AdWords image of an average conversion graph by device showing mobile as the lowest\" width=\"678\" height=\"442\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>#3: Google Will Re-Build and Modernize the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/06\/adwords-account-structure\">AdWords Interface<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Dischler casually snuck this in during the closing Q&amp;A, which sort of made me love him. <em>Oh<\/em>, <em>no big deal<\/em>, <em>just an entire makeover of the platform many of us spend our 40+ hour work weeks slaving away in<\/em>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"56335306-beae-4471-a4ee-6d38fa66c47e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/future-of-adwords-tweet.png\" alt=\"Future of AdWords tweet about the adwords interface redesign\" width=\"581\" height=\"187\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Unfortunately Dischler didn\u2019t dive too deep into what Google\u2019s plans are, but I would expect that a lot of the holes and frustrations that all of us are constantly throwing our heads down about will be addressed (hopefully). To say the least, this news is very exciting for all PPC marketers who are sick and tired of the outdated and not so intuitive AdWords interface.<\/p>\n<h2>#4: Coming Death of the Keyword?<\/h2>\n<p>Keywords are dying! I\u2019ve been preaching this for the last few months due to subtle hints Google continues to drop. From <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/15\/rip-exact-match\">killing off the exact and phrase match type<\/a> to evolving its <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/04\/future-of-online-advertising\">identify based marketing functionality<\/a> on Display, it seems that Google\u2019s moving away from the keyword and towards more of a people-based targeting method. Google also revealed during the livestream that <strong>15% of searches on Google are unique and have never been searched for before<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday, Dischler threw another hint our way when he spoke about the daunting process of keyword targeting. \u201cSelecting 250 million keywords can be painfully time-consuming, but if you can just upload a feed,\u201d says Dischler. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge advantage to structure-based data rather than keywords.\u201d Of course he\u2019s talking about <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/12\/shopping-ads-test\">shopping ads<\/a> where advertisers in the industry don\u2019t need to manage keywords, but can instead just upload their merchant feed, making it much easier to set-up and maintain.<\/p>\n<p>Google recently revealed a compete re-design of dynamic search ads, which is being released in the coming months, and yes, keywords are still part of this redesign, but it will make the process of finding the right keywords much easier. Essentially the new ads with be created by first having Google\u2019s webcrawlers scrape through the content of your site, match unique pages with keywords, and then dynamically create ads that match the most <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/06\/01\/product-pages\">relevant landing page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d suspect that at the very least, Google\u2019s shifting away from the keyword match type targeting that we know.<\/p>\n<h2>#5: Remarketing Functionality Will Grow<\/h2>\n<p>Ginny Marvin asked Dischler what\u2019s next in terms of more custom targeting (since Google knows so much about us it\u2019s frightening). Dischler danced around the question, but did confirm that Google has plans to enhance the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/12\/remarketing-lists-for-search-ads\">functionality of remarketing<\/a>. \u201cThere are two parties Google values as important, users and advertisers. For users the main concern is maintaining trust,\u201d says Dischler. \u201cUser data is held to a high standard. On the other hand advertisers are saying \u2018You\u2019re letting us get some of this custom data, but not all.\u2019 They want more.\u201d To combat this Dischler pushes RLSA\u2019s as a functionality that advertisers should not be missing out on, and finally confirms that, \u201cwe definitely plan to do more in the remarketing space, but we have to be very cautious.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"bdd06a70-4ef6-427c-a9a6-944aa7f9a1f6\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/future-of-adwords-remarketing.jpg\" alt=\"Future of AdWords remarketing meme\" width=\"274\" height=\"242\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>#6: It Will Be Easier for Users to Buy Through the SERPs<\/h2>\n<p>Google has recently revealed that the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-32915175\">buy button is real<\/a>, but Dischler confirmed that Google is not attempting to become a retailer, phew. \u201cThe buy button is really about mobile and driving mobile transactions,\u201d says Dischler. \u201cIn retail, mobile conversion rates are a little lower \u2014 keyboard input is difficult, sessions are shorter, you don\u2019t always have payment credentials available.\u201d Google\u2019s main goal is to focus on the <strong>5% of time that really matters when people are making purchase decisions, and make it really great<\/strong>, according to Dischler.<\/p>\n<p>Other themes discussed during the talk included micro-moments (of course), cross-device targeting, attribution functionality, the accuracy of data, and in-store visits to name a few.<\/p>\n<p>Dischler closed the talk by deflecting a humorous question confirming that Google is not manipulating the ad auction to increase profits. \u201cThere\u2019s no conspiracy or collusion. Search and ad personalization are done totally separately,\u201d says Dischler. Well, that\u2019s a relief!<\/p>\n<p>To conclude, Google plans to continue to build great platforms for the moments that matter \u2013 the micro ones of course.<\/p>\n<p>What are your thoughts on the future of Google?<\/p>\n<p>Are you surprised by any of the things Dischler revealed?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google&#8217;s VP of Product Management, Jerry Dischler, revealed some shocking changes coming to AdWords at SMX Advanced in Seattle.
