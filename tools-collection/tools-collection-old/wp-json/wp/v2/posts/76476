Or, there might be certain tasks that you have not yet incorporated into your strategy because of their scope or complexity.<\/p>\n<p>The below tasks are not only ripe for automation, but they are also an extremely important part of improving the effectiveness of your SEO campaigns and the organic performance of websites.<\/p>\n<p>If you start automating some of these tasks, you will start experiencing the amazing benefits listed above.<\/p>\n<h3>1. SEO auditing<\/h3>\n<p>One of the best tasks that you can start automating right now is your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/28\/technical-seo\">SEO auditing<\/a> and issue tracking.<\/p>\n<p>The technical SEO health of our websites is critically important to ranking in search engine results and in top positions. However, the majority of digital marketers or small businesses only have a basic understanding of technical SEO and don\u2019t always feel comfortable working on the backend of their websites.<\/p>\n<p>Also, running and interpreting SEO audits takes a higher level of technical SEO knowledge. If you do not have the technical know-how on your team\u2013these tools automate the auditing process, identifying technical issues almost immediately and providing a precise roadmap for how to resolve them.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/seo-automation-audit-example.webp\" alt=\"seo automation - seo audit example from contentkings\" width=\"893\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76478\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/seo-automation-audit-example.webp 893w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/seo-automation-audit-example-480x323.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 893px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>An SEO audit report generated in ContentKing<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Tools like SearchAtlas and ContentKing offer 24\/7 website monitoring, meaning if something happens on your website that might impact your SEO performance, you will be notified immediately by email before it has any negative impact on your keyword rankings.<\/p>\n<p>With detailed guides on how to fix those issues, you can simply hand over instructions to your web developer or backend manager. And because issue tracking is automated, you never have to worry about \u201cmissing\u201d a critical issue that will tank your organic rankings or traffic.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Keyword clustering<\/h3>\n<p>The SEO strategy referred to as <a href=\"https:\/\/linkgraph.com\/blog\/keyword-clusters\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keyword clustering<\/a> can help you increase the total number of keywords that a particular page ranks for.<\/p>\n<p>But historically, the process of keyword clustering has required a lot of manual spreadsheet work by SEO and content strategists. Clustering involves ciphering through hundreds to thousands of keywords, looking for those that can be paired together due to topical relevance, search volume, or competitive landscape metrics like Keyword Difficulty.<\/p>\n<p>Now, some SEO software platforms can automate the process of keyword clustering for their users. For example, an <a href=\"https:\/\/searchatlas.com\/content-planner\/\">SEO content planner<\/a> will cluster keywords by ranking potential, relevance, and search volume to help content marketers identify realistic opportunities for ranking in their industries.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/seo-automation-keyword-cluster.webp\" alt=\"seo automation - keyword cluster example\" width=\"936\" height=\"513\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76479\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/seo-automation-keyword-cluster.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/seo-automation-keyword-cluster-480x263.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A Keyword Cluster for \u201cresponsible tourism\u201d in the SearchAtlas content planner tool<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Content Marketing teams can then tackle these clusters one by one, creating relevant content that has the potential to rank for the valuable groups of keywords these tools identify.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have a person in-house who can do comprehensive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">keyword research<\/a> for your brand, or you simply can\u2019t afford to hire that person at this time, these tools do hours of keyword research work in a fraction of the time.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Topic generation<\/h3>\n<p>The process of moving from a keyword to a content idea is one of the best tasks to automate using AI content generator tools.<\/p>\n<p>Coming up with an original blog post idea or article title requires creativity and brainpower. If you\u2019re producing content at a high volume, then this particular SEO task is a regular part of your content planning process.<\/p>\n<p>Blog topic generator tools will provide multiple templates or ideas for your SEO content. You can then edit the titles and ideas to better fit your brand voice, your specific products, services, and target audiences.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/seo-automation-topic-generator.webp\" alt=\"seo automation - copy.ai topic generator\" width=\"936\" height=\"571\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76480\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/seo-automation-topic-generator.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/seo-automation-topic-generator-480x293.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Blog post ideas generated in copy.ai for the keyword \u201cgoogle ads bidding strategies\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Google wants to rank content that is created by humans for humans, so do not simply use ChatGPT outputs as your content. It\u2019s important to look at these tools as providing a first draft or outline that your team can then work from. They are helpful for avoiding writer\u2019s block or for those marketing teams that don\u2019t have in-house content writers or creatives.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re new to content strategy and don\u2019t have any content on your website, topic ideation can be a great task for automation in the early days of your content strategy. It can take some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mightyscribes.com\/how-many-blog-posts-before-traffic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">time before new websites start earning organic traffic<\/a>, but publishing blog posts on a consistent basis is a way to speed up results and start seeing traffic sooner.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Content briefs<\/h3>\n<p>Traditionally, content strategists hand over a content brief to writers that outlines all of the details a piece of content needs to have for the best ranking potential.<\/p>\n<p>Putting together content briefs can be time-consuming. These briefs are often generated after extensive research and provide content writers with:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Target keywords<\/li>\n<li>Suggested word counts<\/li>\n<li>Readability level<\/li>\n<li>Recommended internal links<\/li>\n<li>Focus terms or suggested terms<\/li>\n<li>Common questions<\/li>\n<li>Suggested Headings<\/li>\n<li>Additional elements that are important for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/06\/on-page-seo\">on-page SEO<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/seo-automation-content-brief-example.webp\" alt=\"seo automation - content brief example output\" width=\"936\" height=\"559\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76481\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/seo-automation-content-brief-example.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/seo-automation-content-brief-example-480x287.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Content Brief Generator tool from Dashword\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The process of content brief generation can be automated with one click. These tools prompt users to provide an article title and summary. Then, the software generates a high-quality content brief that can be easily edited and better tailored to the content\u2019s goals and target audience.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of volume, this automation can mean generating more content briefs in less time, helping you get more content assignments to writers. With hundreds of briefs, you\u2019ll always have the next content outline you need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/31\/content-amplification\">keep expanding your organic presence<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>5. SEO reporting<\/h3>\n<p>Creating SEO and content performance reports can be extremely time-consuming. The larger your organic presence, the more complex and comprehensive these reports can become.<\/p>\n<p>But there is really no avoiding SEO reporting, as it is the key to proving the value of SEO efforts and optimizations to key stakeholders at your organization. This is particularly true for SEO freelancers or marketing agencies who provide SEO services to clients.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on the goals of your campaign, there are certain metrics that you may want to highlight over others in your reporting.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/seo-automation-reporting.webp\" alt=\"seo automation - seo report\" width=\"936\" height=\"510\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76482\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/seo-automation-reporting.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/seo-automation-reporting-480x262.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Finding a software platform that generates SEO reports can help you eliminate the time-intensive nature work of this work. Many marketing platforms now include the Google <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/webmaster-tools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Search Console API<\/a>, meaning you can be confident that your website data is an accurate and complete picture of your website\u2019s organic performance.<\/p>\n<div id=\"avoid\"><\/div>\n<h2>SEO tasks to avoid automating<\/h2>\n<p>There is likely an automation tool for almost any task that you are performing for your SEO strategy. That doesn\u2019t mean, though, that you should set your SEO strategy to autopilot and remove the human touch entirely.<\/p>\n<p>The below SEO tasks are those that you should still delegate to humans because they are essential to achieving top-ranking results in Google.<\/p>\n<h3>High-quality content writing<\/h3>\n<p>Google recently made it clear that the use of <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/blog\/2023\/02\/google-search-and-ai-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI-generated content is not against their policies<\/a>. Their focus is on the quality of the content, not on the way that it was produced.<\/p>\n<p>So using content generation tools during your content writing process is certainly a great strategy. But although these tools are impressive, the content quality is still limited. Purely publishing auto-generated content without bringing in the human touch to the process is unlikely to produce the type of high-quality content that it takes to rank in top positions.<\/p>\n<p>High-quality content needs to embody <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/14\/google-e-e-a-t\">Google&#8217;s E-EAT<\/a> philosophy, meaning it includes experience, expertise, authority, and trust.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-eeat.jpg\" alt=\"google eeat graphic\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-74959\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-eeat.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-eeat-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Remember, ChatGPT was trained on data from 2021 and above, meaning it isn\u2019t really capable of bringing something \u201cnew\u201d to the conversation. Google wants to rank content from websites that are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/thought-leadership-content-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it\/459736\/\">thought leaders<\/a> in their industries\u2013that means bringing original ideas and strategies to the conversation.<\/p>\n<p>This is even more reason to look at these text automation tools as a starting point for content writing, not a substitute.<\/p>\n<h3>High-level SEO strategy<\/h3>\n<p>Succeeding in organic search also requires understanding what type of content is already ranking on the first page of Google. Factors like relevance, <a href=\"https:\/\/linkgraph.com\/blog\/what-is-search-intent\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search intent<\/a>, word count, featured snippets, People Also Ask, and more can all impact whether your content has more or less ranking potential.<\/p>\n<p>Some marketing tools make it easier to find all of the information you need to make strategic decisions, but a human eye is still needed to make decisions that are the best for your business and your unique goals. You don\u2019t want to be investing time and resources into content creation for keywords that are out of reach or creating the wrong type of content that doesn\u2019t provide users with what they are actually looking for.<\/p>\n<p>Understanding key SEO metrics like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/12\/domain-authority\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Domain Authority<\/a>, Domain Rating, Keyword Difficulty, and search intent is still an absolute must for those executing your SEO efforts.
