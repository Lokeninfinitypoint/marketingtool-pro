Depending on your industry, it could take minutes or months to close a prospect. In that time, there\u2019s very little you can do to stop a prospect from being swayed by your competition. That very little is called nurture.<\/p>\n<p>Nurture is the catch-all given to whatever systems a business has in place to move a prospect down their conversion funnel, turning a window shopper into a cash-paying consumer.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"05f14696-b1ff-47ea-9b89-0b81c33800bd\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/nurture-funnel-turn-window-shopper-into-customer.png\" alt=\"turn window shoppers into paying customers\" width=\"706\" height=\"309\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Unfortunately, most businesses seem to think <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/30\/lead-nurturing-campaign-emails\">nurturing begins and ends with email<\/a>. And while email is an invaluable channel for interacting with your prospects, it has its limitations.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why today, I\u2019m going to show you <strong>how to use paid search and paid social to make your nurture marketing funnel WAY more effective<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>To scrounge up enough strategies to make this post worth your while, I recently met with our in-house paid acquisition maverick, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/brett-mchale-2b1bb387\">Brett McHale<\/a>, who says that using AdWords and Facebook to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/11\/03\/lead-nurturing\">nurture your prospects<\/a> helps advertisers do three incalculably important things. It\u2026<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Creates brand familiarity<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Provides value<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Handles objections<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>According to Brett: \u201cNurture marketing is all about value. Value of your brand, your offering. Facebook and AdWords help you reach targeted subsets of your audience in a handful of ways. If you can show a prospect that you\u2019re the solution to their problem without stalking them all over the internet, you\u2019re T-ing up one kick-ass customer.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ll get to the full list of ways you can nurture your prospects with PPC in a minute, but first\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>The Problem with Email Nurture\u2026<\/h2>\n<p>Everybody\u2019s doin\u2019 it.<\/p>\n<p>The two primary reasons you need to leverage PPC as a foundational component of your nurture program are <strong>mediocre or bad open rates<\/strong> and <strong>email overload.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a picture of the promotions tab in my Gmail inbox from one morning last week:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"e15e0750-0826-4e8f-bc6b-c4297df47fa3\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/bloated-inbox-email-nurture.png\" alt=\"email nurture bloated inbox\" width=\"485\" height=\"409\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>I\u2019ve never read a single one of these emails. Unless your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/31\/email-subject-lines\">subject line game<\/a> is off the charts, the promotions tab is where nurture goes to die. An elephant graveyard for bad and just-okay email copy.<\/p>\n<p>With PPC, you effectively skip over the middleman. By circumventing your prospects\u2019 inboxes, you\u2019re only competing with advertisers on a SERP, a relevant website on the GDN, or Facebook \/ Instagram. You\u2019re also getting a leg up on your competitors, who are probably only using an automated email funnel to nurture prospects (if they\u2019re doing it at all).<\/p>\n<p>The second problem impacting your email nurture program? Low open rates. Check out <a href=\"https:\/\/mailchimp.com\/resources\/research\/email-marketing-benchmarks\/#section_average_by_industry\">this list<\/a> of average email marketing stats by industry from MailChimp. They\u2019re not so low as to warrant no longer investing in email marketing, but they\u2019re not especially encouraging either. Worse still are the click-through rates. Yikes.<\/p>\n<p>Now, email nurture is still valuable. If a prospect opens an email and you provide value in the form of a free resource, odds are they\u2019re likely to open your next one, too. We do this to great effect at WordStream.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a4d8e275-324d-4189-9fb4-c0ddaca3e0de\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/email-nurture-example-copy-offer.png\" alt=\"email nurture sample copy\" width=\"726\" height=\"724\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>I say that to say this: Email nurture is great, but on its own it simply isn\u2019t enough.

They\u2019ve identified their problem and are in search of a solution. This is Prospect B.<\/p>\n<p>The way you interact with these two types of people matters a great deal. Show Person A an offer they just aren\u2019t ready for and they\u2019ll feel alienated; serve Prospect B something and they\u2019ll deem your product or service beneath them. By choosing the right kind of offering, you establish your brand as trustworthy. Your emails and banner ads can go from mild annoyance to helpful resource.<\/p>\n<p>How the offering is presented, though, is just as important as the offering itself.<\/p>\n<h3>How Does It Help Me Nurture Prospects?<\/h3>\n<p>Choosing the right ad format for your nurture offerings is key. We\u2019ve already established that email can be a bit of a crapshoot because of inbox bloat. The rest of the internet is just as riddled with ads. As such, your nurture creative needs to reach its intended audience in the perfect format, whether that\u2019s a text ad, a video, or something else entirely.<\/p>\n<p>One of our top of funnel nurture offerings at WordStream is a whitepaper called \u201cHow to Compete in AdWords Without Just Raising Bids.\u201d It\u2019s a guide that teaches <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/20\/how-to-use-google-adwords\">AdWords neophytes about best practices<\/a>, a helpful tool for someone learning the ropes. The design for the Facebook ad used to reflects the simplicity of the offer itself.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d0ed6c20-c10f-4a59-b651-8136a33cb920\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-nurture-funnel-offer-compare.png\" alt=\"ppc nurture funnel offer comparisson\" width=\"800\" height=\"326\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>But look at the other ad. It\u2019s a video for the AdWords Performance Grader, a tool advertisers can use to gain an understanding of how their account stacks up to competitors and identifies areas that need to be optimized to enhance performance. The format of the ad, a short video, is dynamic and informative, concretizing the value of the tool in the minds of prospects.<\/p>\n<p>This is a resource that prospects who receive the aforementioned whitepaper would surely find useful, but by reading the whitepaper first, they\u2019ll have a better understanding of the insights the Grader uncovers. The value of the tool (and thus, WordStream) is compounded.<\/p>\n<h2>#3: Align Your Messaging Between Platforms<\/h2>\n<p>To perform most effectively, you nurture efforts must overlap.<\/p>\n<p>Confused? Here\u2019s an example of what I\u2019m talking about.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"89507c5d-ab06-40f6-a6ef-5d56b88e6d30\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/nurture-funnel-align-message-between-channels.png\" alt=\"nurture funnel aligning messaging between adwords and facebook\" width=\"800\" height=\"419\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>In this image, AdWords is Tom Brady, Facebook is Randy Moss.<\/p>\n<p>A prospect sees the text ad, clicks it, and downloads the whitepaper. Next, an audience in Facebook comprised exclusively of people who downloaded that whitepaper, are served <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/27\/facebook-ad-targeting-options-infographic\">a hyper-specific Facebook ad<\/a> that <strong>a)<\/strong> addresses the problem identified in the search ad the prospect clicked and <strong>b)<\/strong> offers a data-driven solution to that problem.<\/p>\n<p>Tom releases the football, Randy beats the coverage, touchdown.<\/p>\n<h3>How Does It Help Me Nurture Prospects?<\/h3>\n<p>By aligning your messaging across platforms, you acknowledge the fact that channels should not exist independent of one another. If you\u2019re paying to advertise to your prospects, you should use Facebook and AdWords in concert. One nurture strategy, two platforms, more leads.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s likely that the people you reach on Facebook are the same people, to some extent or another, that you reach on search. Don\u2019t just berate them with the same messaging. Solve their problems in a way that feels organic.<\/p>\n<h2>#4: Ensure Tracking Code(s) Exist and Fire<\/h2>\n<p>Nurture is great. It\u2019s fantastic. It\u2019s the key to ensuring a steady stream of eager consumers.<\/p>\n<p>But if you aren\u2019t tracking actions on your website, you\u2019re wasting your time. All the cool stuff we\u2019ve talked about so far? Impossible.<\/p>\n<p>Unless you use something like Google Tag Manager, your landing pages (or, for maximum effect, your whole site) need to feature the requisite tracking code. The code also needs to be tracking the right thing.<\/p>\n<p>Few occurrences in the world of digital advertising are as soul-crushing as the moment you realize an incredible-looking metric is just nonsense inflated by improper tracking.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"83ec5378-8adc-4904-ad4f-49768f8565a6\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-conversion-tracking-facebook-pixel.png\" alt=\"adwords conversion tracking facebook GA\" width=\"800\" height=\"324\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a quick look at how the tracking code differs across AdWords, Facebook, and Google Analytics.<\/p>\n<h4>AdWords Tracking Code<\/h4>\n<p>I suggest using GA to track your AdWords conversions, but the tags you can generate in AdWords work just fine. All you need to do here is define the parameters for your conversion and then paste the code onto your landing page.

You can optimize it for almost any type of on-site action.<\/p>\n<p>Put this all over your website, tweaking the constituent components as needed. If on some pages you\u2019re tracking conversions as revenue and on others, email addresses, you\u2019ll want to distinguish the difference here to avoid conflating data.<\/p>\n<p>PROTIP: Download the Facebook pixel Helper from Chrome; it\u2019s a plugin that can let you know when things are working (and when they aren\u2019t).<\/p>\n<h4>Google Analytics UA Code<\/h4>\n<p>You probably already have Google Analytics code on your site.

As such, when you decide to use remarketing, pay attention to frequency capping.<\/p>\n<h3>How Does It Help Me Nurture Prospects?<\/h3>\n<p>Now, \u201cthe right frequency cap\u201d is subjective and largely depends on industry and average buying cycle. For smaller purchases, things people buy impulsively or without much research, showing ads in short succession within a few hours\/days of a site visit is expected. On the other end of the spectrum, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/01\/killer-underused-adwords-features\">big ticket items<\/a>, ones that might take weeks or months of research before a prospect is comfortable pulling the trigger, take more tact.<\/p>\n<p>Reminders over time across search, display, Facebook, and the inbox give prospects ample opportunity to take advantage of your nurture offerings without feeling frustrated.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"b09ab4e0-1a55-41c6-87c2-0277c1eb2271\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adword-reach-metrics-nurture-freq-cap.png\" alt=\"nurture adwords reach metrics freq cap\" width=\"569\" height=\"467\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>To develop an understanding of how often your creative is served to potential customers, look at your reach metrics.

As a result, in the event you don\u2019t do any advertising on AdWords, you can still flesh out an unreal nurture funnel using just Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to improving the experience of the prospects, this strategy also lowers <a href=\"\/cost-per-action\">CPA<\/a> for the advertiser. Because you\u2019re showing the ad with the more advanced offering to a smaller audience made up of prospects who are <em>ready<\/em> for that offering, the chance of conversion is greater.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"b6381230-856c-48db-97a7-12a134718848\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-nurture-custom-audience-downloads.png\" alt=\"facebook nurture custom audiences \" width=\"784\" height=\"267\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>By creating custom audiences, you can leverage data from the Pixel to ensure the most relevant ad and offering are served to a prospect. I mentioned this earlier when discussing finding the right ad format. Now let\u2019s tackle custom audience creation.<\/p>\n<h3>How Does It Help Me Nurture Prospects?<\/h3>\n<p>Creating custom audiences in Facebook allows you to replicate the stages of your nurture funnel within Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>In the example below, I\u2019ve illustrated exactly how this works.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1766c48d-e700-47f7-a011-22b56b421906\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/nurture-facebook-push-prospects-down-funnel.png\" alt=\"nurture facebook prospects down funnel\" width=\"800\" height=\"355\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>A prospect sees an ad for the Performance Grader on Facebook, clicks it, and runs the grader. That prospect is now a member of a new audience; let\u2019s call this group \u201cGrader Run.\u201d Thanks to our custom audience, the prospect will no longer be served ads for the Performance Grader. Instead, they\u2019re driven to a free trial: a logical, value-driven progression towards the end goal of becoming the next great WordStream customer.<\/p>\n<h2>#9: Leverage Exclusionary Audiences<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/28\/unconventional-facebook-ad-strategies\">Exclusionary audiences<\/a> are the backbone of some of the other techniques and tips I\u2019ve touched on today, so it makes sense they make an appearance on the list.<\/p>\n<p>As the name indicates, they\u2019re the audience equivalent of negative keywords.
