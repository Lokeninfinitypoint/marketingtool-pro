I didn\u2019t know what negative keywords were.

Either way, knowing your way around Google Ads can be highly beneficial, even if you don\u2019t go through with getting certified.<\/p>\n<h2>6 Ways You Can Learn Google Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Fortunately, there are plenty of ways to<a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLPPC101.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_PPC101_Download\"> get to grips with Google Ads<\/a>. In today\u2019s post, I\u2019ll outline six of them. Some of these resources focus primarily on the basics, whereas others deal with a mix of beginner, intermediate, and advanced topics, so there\u2019s something for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>Looking for an updated list?

Google\u2019s Essential Google Ads Courses<\/h3>\n<p>It should come as little surprise that Google\u2019s learning resources on Google Ads are among the best out there. Covering a wide range of topics and offering lessons based on three tiers of experience, the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/Google Ads\/answer\/6069823?hl=en\">Essential Google Ads Courses<\/a> should be the first destination on any paid search novice\u2019s path to mastery.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-learn-adwords-google-essentials.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"779\" height=\"495\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-27771\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-learn-adwords-google-essentials.png 779w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-learn-adwords-google-essentials-480x305.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 779px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nThese courses are an excellent primer for the beginner, but those with at least some Google Ads experience may find them more useful as a refresher before moving on to more in-depth material. If you\u2019d rather take a more self-directed path, you can browse lessons and tutorials by topic in the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/Google Ads\/?page=learningcenter.cs#topic=3119071\">Google Ads Learning Center<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/21\/google-skillshop\">Google Skillshop<\/a> also offers training and tutorials for Google Ads.<\/p>\n<h3>2. WordStream\u2019s PPC University<\/h3>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve devoured the official Google learning resources, check out WordStream\u2019s very own <a href=\"\/learn\">PPC University<\/a>.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-learn-adwords-wordstream-ppcu.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"938\" height=\"450\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-27766\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-learn-adwords-wordstream-ppcu.png 938w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-learn-adwords-wordstream-ppcu-480x230.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 938px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nEven if you\u2019ve gone through Google\u2019s Digital Marketing 101 and 102 courses, PPC 101 is still worth checking out. Here you\u2019ll find lessons on core PPC concepts such as click-through rate, cost-per-action, and conversion rate optimization, as well as in-depth guides on ad text, Quality Score, and account structure.<\/p>\n<p>The PPC 102 and Advanced PPC tracks cover a wide range of topics you\u2019ll need to understand to become a paid search professional. In PPC 102, you\u2019ll learn about negative keywords and keyword match types, how to optimize ad text and make use of extensions, landing page optimization, and the importance of A\/B testing, among other topics. If you\u2019re a seasoned Google Ads veteran, check out the more advanced guides on Call Tracking, PPC for lead generation, dayparting, and mobile PPC in <a href=\"\/learn\/advanced-ppc\">the Advanced Track<\/a>.

Udemy\u2019s Google Ads for Beginners<\/h3>\n<p>Udemy is one of the best online learning resources out there, and its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/learn-google-Google Ads-course-for-beginners\/\">Google Ads for Beginners<\/a> course is certainly one of the most comprehensive.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-learn-adwords-udemy.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1022\" height=\"619\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-27767\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-learn-adwords-udemy.png 1022w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-learn-adwords-udemy-980x594.png 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-learn-adwords-udemy-480x291.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1022px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nOffering four hours of video instruction spanning 44 topics, Google Ads for Beginners is a thorough introduction to the Google Ads platform. It isn\u2019t free, but for learners who want to really sink their teeth into a meatier resource, it\u2019s hard to beat.<\/p>\n<p>One of the major benefits of this course is the inclusion of screencast walkthroughs of a live, active Google Ads account. The disconnect between theory and practice is one of the biggest obstacles for beginners to overcome, making this a great addition to an already comprehensive introduction.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>A Google Ads campaign is a lot like cooking a meal.

The Ultimate Guide to Google Ads, Fourth Edition<\/h3>\n<p>For our fourth resource, we\u2019re going to go offline for a while, pick up an actual book, and read words printed on a page. Radical!<\/p>\n<p>Renowned Google Ads expert Perry Marshall\u2019s landmark book, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.perrymarshall.com\/Google Ads\/\">The Ultimate Guide to Google Ads (4th Edition),<\/a> is essential reading for Google Ads newcomers. You won\u2019t find a lot of detailed walkthroughs of specific features or (many) screenshots of the Google Ads interface, but you will find a wealth of strategies and techniques behind successful advertising campaigns. Perry explains the principles behind the advertising part of Google Ads, how to think like a successful advertiser, and the marketing techniques that can take your Google Ads campaigns from \u201cgood\u201d to \u201cgreat.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If the resources above are the <em>how<\/em>, think of this book as the <em>why<\/em>.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Lynda.com\u2019s Google Ads Essential Training<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019m a big fan of Lynda.com\u2019s video tutorials, and this course is no exception.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-learn-adwords-lynda.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"815\" height=\"481\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-27768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-learn-adwords-lynda.png 815w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-learn-adwords-lynda-480x283.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 815px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nAimed primarily at beginners, Lynda.com\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lynda.com\/Google-Google Ads-tutorials\/Google-Google Ads-Essential-Training\/148582-2.html\">Google Ads Essential Training<\/a> is precisely that \u2013 a step-by-step guide on how to get started with Google Ads from beginning to end. Spanning more than three hours of video instruction, this series (like all Lynda titles) is broken into short, easily manageable videos, meaning you don\u2019t have to sit for hours at a time to get what you need out of each lesson.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the very basics, such as setting up an Google Ads account and using the Keyword Planner for keyword research, this course also includes some nice bonus lessons on slightly more advanced topics such as A\/B testing, remarketing campaigns, and getting started with video ads.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Certified Knowledge\u2019s Google Ads Lessons<\/h3>\n<p>Few people know PPC as well as Brad Geddes, once of the paid search world\u2019s most highly sought consultants and speakers. Brad\u2019s company, Certified Knowledge, offers a remarkably in-depth Google Ads training program that anyone who\u2019s serious about the Google Ads mastery will want to check out.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-learn-adwords-certified-knowledge.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"691\" height=\"386\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-27769\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-learn-adwords-certified-knowledge.png 691w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ways-to-learn-adwords-certified-knowledge-480x268.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 691px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nOffering <a href=\"http:\/\/certifiedknowledge.org\/membership-information\/Google Ads-learning-modules\/\">more than 150 video tutorials<\/a>, these training resources are among the most comprehensive of any provider out there. Although the Fundamentals and Introduction to Google Ads lessons are worth looking at, it\u2019s the Intermediate and Advanced tutorials that really shine. Once you\u2019ve gotten a little experience under your belt, dive into these courses to learn everything from advanced bidding strategies and location targeting to Google Ads reporting functionality and even Display Network campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>As Certified Knowledge is an official Google-authorized training provider, you can rest easy in the knowledge that these video tutorials are of a very high quality. They may not be free (see <a href=\"http:\/\/certifiedknowledge.org\/membership-information\/pricing\/\">this page for pricing<\/a>), but for serious Google Ads practitioners and committed learners, it\u2019s a worthwhile investment.<\/p>\n<h2>Want Another Way to Learn Google Ads?
