The bad news is every advertiser has a budget they need to stick to. The good news is you can stay within budget by getting selective with where your money is going. Literally. We\u2019re talking geotargeting.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Geotargeting is a form of <strong>targeting by location<\/strong> that lets your ads only appear to customers in a certain physical place, or set of places, that you specify. That way, your money goes to the right place every time.<\/p>\n<p>In this guide, I&#8217;m going to show you exactly how to do just that in Google Ads. We\u2019ll cover:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why and how to use geotargeting (other than just to save money!)<\/li>\n<li>How to set up a geotargeting campaign in Google Ads<\/li>\n<li>10 tips on how to maximize your local PPC performance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Let\u2019s get started!<\/p>\n<h2>Why &amp; how to use geotargeting for local PPC<\/h2>\n<p>When you first create a campaign in Google Ads, it automatically defaults to all countries and regions. Last I checked, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/18\/beginners-guide-to-target-markets\">no business is a fit for every single human on earth<\/a>, so you need to select at least <em>some<\/em> form of geotargeting\u2014even if it\u2019s as broad as it can get. But there are additional benefits to geotargeting that we also want to parse out.<\/p>\n<h3>Save money<\/h3>\n<p>The most obvious reason for geotargeting is that you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/20\/stop-burning-your-adwords-budget\">avoid wasting ad spend<\/a> on consumers who may qualify for your services but are not located in an area you serve. And this targeting can be as wide or narrow as you need. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>An <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/04\/02\/retail-marketing\">online retailer<\/a> might target the entire US, or only states with major cities.<\/li>\n<li>A chain of nursing homes in New England can target only those states.<\/li>\n<li>A <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-home-service-businesses-can-show-up-for-local-google-searches\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">home service business<\/a> can target the specific neighborhoods they serve.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can also exclude locations dominated by a competitor.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-geotargeting-map-1.jpeg\" alt=\"example of geotargeting a region with exclusions\" width=\"720\" height=\"241\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/agency\/pros-cons-geotargeting-paid-search?toc-variant-a=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Find more ways to save money with our <\/em><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\"><strong><em>free Google Ads Performance Grader<\/em><\/strong><\/a>!<\/p>\n<h3>Deliver super-personalized experiences<\/h3>\n<p>With <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/11\/13\/adwords-geotargeting-local-ppc-guide\">geotargeting for local PPC<\/a>, you can relate your offering to local events or use language that resonates with that community. For example, if you know there\u2019s a concert in your town, you may want to run a special promotion for your restaurant nearby.<\/p>\n<h3>Segment to reach the right person<\/h3>\n<p>Say you\u2019re a landscaper whose ideal customers are wealthy estate owners. With geotargeting, you could target the more affluent areas of a particular region. (<strong><em>Note:<\/em><\/strong><em> there are some industries that may not be able to layer demographic and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/10\/17\/google-ads-location-targeting\">location targeting<\/a> together.)<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Get your timing right<\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to timing, you may think of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/13\/how-to-set-up-ad-scheduling\">ad scheduling<\/a> but geotargeting also has a use here. Commonly referred to as <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-geofencing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">geofencing<\/a>, you can serve particular ads to people upon entering or exiting a geographic boundary. This could be useful if there&#8217;s a week-long conference going on near your business.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/geofencing-starbucks-example-1.png\" alt=\"starbucks geofencing ad example\" width=\"500\" height=\"177\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Test out new markets<\/h3>\n<p>Run lower budget campaigns in new areas to test the waters and if you end up performing well, create more lower-funnel ads. Keep in mind that geotargeting is only available at the campaign level. So, if you\u2019re curious about how you would perform in a new market, split up your locations by campaign.<\/p>\n<h3>Align with consumer trends<\/h3>\n<p>Geotargeting is a win-win. Not only do you save money, but this is what consumers want! According to research:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/linchpinseo.com\/guide-to-geomarketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">80%<\/a> percent of consumers say that they would like to get location-based alerts from businesses.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/linchpinseo.com\/guide-to-geomarketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">70%<\/a> of consumers say that they are willing to share their location if they get something valuable in return.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/optinmonster.com\/how-to-use-geomarketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">61%<\/a> of smartphone owners prefer to buy from sites that customize information for their location.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In short, you&#8217;re taking your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/local-marketing-lab\/ppc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">local PPC<\/a> strategy to the next level to give consumers a personalized, local-friendly experience\u2014all while saving money!<\/p>\n<h2>How to set up location targeting in Google Ads<\/h2>\n<p>To implement geotargeting in Google Ads, select the campaign you wish to target, click on the <strong>Settings<\/strong> tab, then scroll down to the <strong>Locations <\/strong>section.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-geotargeting-setup-location-tab-1.png\" alt=\"google ads geotargeting setup\u2014locations section\" width=\"720\" height=\"300\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Click the <strong>Search<\/strong> bar, start typing in your desired location, and select it when it appears on the drop-down menu of relevant matches.

Here are 10 of my top geotargeting tips to improve your performance across the board.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Double-check your location options<\/h3>\n<p>When setting up your geotargeting, there is one nuance to pay attention to. When you click into the blue <strong>Location options <\/strong>tab, you can target by <strong>Presence<\/strong> (people in or regularly in your targeted locations), <strong>Search interest<\/strong> (people searching for your targeted locations) or <strong>both<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-geotargeting-location-options-presence-interest-1.png\" alt=\"google ads geotargeting setup\u2014three choices in location options\" width=\"500\" height=\"241\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Google is sneaky in that it can default to the top option: showing to people in, regularly in, OR showing interest in your targeting locations.<\/p>\n<p>For some businesses, this is ideal. For example, a senior living facility can show ads to adults who don&#8217;t live in, but frequent a particular area to visit their parents.<\/p>\n<p>But in other cases, this can lead to locations showing up in your locations report that you don&#8217;t want to target.<\/p>\n<p>For example, let&#8217;s say you only want to target Miami residents. If the first option is checked, your ad may show for someone located in Boston who&#8217;s planning a vacation to Miami (frequently looking up attractions in Miami).<\/p>\n<h3>2. Keep an eye on granular location metrics<\/h3>\n<p>See which locations are generating the most traffic by clicking on the Locations tab in the second navigation column. Here you can view standard information such as clicks, impressions, average cost-per-click (CPC), and average position, as it applies to each of your specified locations.<\/p>\n<p>This is important for understanding exactly where you\u2019ll get the highest ROI.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/gooogle-ads-geotargeting-granular-reporting-1.png\" alt=\"google ads geotargeting\u2014screenshot of granular campaign metrics\" width=\"720\" height=\"297\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>3. Seek out and implement location-based negatives<\/h3>\n<p>Use the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/11\/17\/adwords-search-term-report\">Search Terms Report<\/a> to see which keyword searches triggered your ads. If you notice keywords from outside your target locations are triggering your ads, exclude these keywords by clicking the check box next to them, then selecting <strong>Add as a negative keyword<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you run a car dealership in Chicago but your ads are being triggered by searches for \u201cnew cars Boston,\u201d add the word \u201cBoston\u201d to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/11\/08\/removing-negatives\">negative keyword list<\/a> to avoid your ads being triggered by further searches for Boston. To bring up the Search Terms Report, go to the Campaigns tab, click <strong>Keywords<\/strong>, then <strong>Details<\/strong>, and select <strong>All<\/strong> from the drop-down menu to bring up the report for all keywords in the campaign.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Use bid adjustments to lower CPA<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re on a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/30\/switch-automatic-bidding-to-manual\">manual bidding<\/a> strategy, you can apply <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/04\/09\/combined-bid-adjustments\">bid adjustments<\/a> to toss Google more or less money per click when you show to a user with a specific location. In the Locations section, you\u2019ll see a bid adjustment column where you can apply a negative or positive percentage on top of your original keyword bids for the selected area.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-geotargeting-bid-adjustments-1.png\" alt=\"google ads geotargeting\u2014bid adjustments by location\" width=\"500\" height=\"238\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>An example would be if you know you\u2019re more or less likely to get a high return from consumers within a specific city or state, clicks coming from those areas could be of different value to you.<\/p>\n<p>Bid adjustments help you to customize your original keyword bid accordingly. This will help you get the biggest bang for your buck (in other words, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/15\/lower-cost-per-acquisition\">lower your CPA)<\/a> since you\u2019ll be able to avoid pricier clicks from less popular areas your business caters to, while also ensuring you rank for your priority places.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Don\u2019t be afraid to be picky<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s always helpful to remember that PPC spend is coming out of your own (or your client\u2019s) pockets. So, put forth paid efforts with that always in mind. That means if you ship all over the country but really only see <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/03\/increase-sales-online\">sales<\/a> coming from a few select cities, then only geotarget those places\u2014and let your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/best-free-business-listing-sites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">organic listings<\/a> take care of the less valuable stragglers from other parts.<\/p>\n<p>It can be tempting to \u201ccast a wide net,\u201d but when you take a step back to prioritize your top-performing locations you\u2019ll see costs go down without losing out on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/24\/google-ads-conversion-tracking\">conversions<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Don\u2019t forget to <strong>exclude certain locations <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Now, you don\u2019t have to go crazy excluding every location you&#8217;re not geotargeting\u2014that defeats the purpose! But, if you have a specific location that maybe is close by to your target or is a red-flag (or <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/23\/google-ads-disapprovals\">disapproval<\/a>) issue if you ever showed there, then you\u2019ll want to cover your own butt and exclude it ahead of time.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of disapprovals: make sure you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/28\/google-ads-three-strikes-policy-program\">know all the details about Google&#8217;s new three-strikes policy program!<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>7. Use Google Trends to inform your geotargeting strategy<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/01\/google-local-search-trends\">Google search interests <\/a>change constantly. On top of this, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/18\/post-covid-19-customers\">consumer priorities and needs have shifted<\/a> significantly due to the pandemic.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-trends\">Google Trends<\/a> is a tool that can show the interest people have in a certain keyword or topic within a particular geographic area. So, you\u2019ll be able to see what keywords might work best in combination with your geotargeting.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-geotargeting-google-trends-report-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"332\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>8. Include regional terms in your keyword lists<\/h3>\n<p>Think of this as icing on the geotargeting cake. While your geotargeting is already going to take care of who you show to based on location it never hurts to layer on some <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/06\/19\/location-based-marketing\">location-based<\/a> keywords. This will go along with your<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/22\/google-ad-copy-mistakes\"> ad copy <\/a>and (most likely) the searcher\u2019s query.<\/p>\n<p>So, including regional terms could give you a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/19\/whats-a-good-quality-score\">quality score boost<\/a> since your keywords will be even more relevant. For example, try out a term like \u201ccontractors in boston\u201d instead of just \u201cbest contractors\u201d because someone searching locally will most likely be using their location as part of the query.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Include the name of your target location in your ad copy<\/h3>\n<p>This is a best practice with local PPC so your viewers know right off the bat that you cater to their location. A bonus would be if you can squeeze it into a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/12\/19\/adwords-headline-formulas\">headline<\/a> because the matching ad text will appear in bold. This helps the ad stand out on the page as a local-friendly listing.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, odds are the searchers are looking up queries that include your targeting location. And if you\u2019re also using geotargeted keywords as mentioned above this effort will kick up your ad\u2019s relevancy since you\u2019ll be following the best practice of including the keyword in the headline. A boost in relevancy will help your ad to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/02\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps\">rank higher on the SERP.<\/a><\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-geotargeting-example-contractor-search-1.png\" alt=\"geotargeted google ad example\" width=\"720\" height=\"125\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>10. Use location extensions and call extensions<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/09\/19\/adwords-location-extensions-guide\">Location extensions<\/a> let you display your business&#8217;s address with the ad, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/10\/06\/google-adwords-call-extensions\">call extensions <\/a>display a phone number. This is win-win because it\u2019s already a best practice to include ad extensions in your search ad strategy since they will build off your ad as they serve to help you take up more SERP real estate and catch your audience\u2019s eye.<\/p>\n<p>On top of this, people searching locally most likely are looking for immediate information while they\u2019re on-the-go in your targeted location. So, these two local-specific ad extensions will make it easier for potential customers to find and contact you.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-geotargeting-location-extension-example-1.png\" alt=\"google ads geotargeting ad with location extension\" width=\"650\" height=\"147\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>Use Google Ads location targeting to focus your spend where it counts<\/h2>\n<p>Not only can geotargeting save you money with local PPC, but it can also be a tool for personalized and real-time marketing, testing out new markets, and targeting personas in a given neighborhood.
