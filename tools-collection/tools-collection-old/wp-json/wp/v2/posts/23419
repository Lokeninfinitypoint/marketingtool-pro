Include numbers or statistics in your headlines<\/h2>\n<p>Advertisers will do practically anything to get you to click on their ads, but all they really need to do is make your life easier, cut the crap, and get to the point. An excellent way to do this is by including numbers or statistics in your ads, preferably in the headlines.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-ad-copywriting-insurance.png\" alt=\"ppc-ad-copywriting-numbers-in-headline\" width=\"601\" height=\"272\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The two ads above for car insurance quotes in Rhode Island (where I happen to be as I write this) both feature plenty of actual numbers not only in the headline, but in the body copy as well. Although neither of these companies are as well-known or have the brand recognition as brands like Progressive or State Farm, they <em>do<\/em> offer some compelling figures in their ads (even though the way some people drive here in Lil\u2019 Rhody makes me question how these speculative quotes could possibly be so low).<\/p>\n<p>Although this can be a remarkably effective way to make your ads stand out, it should be used carefully. Take a look at this example for a custom T-shirt printing service:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-ad-copywriting-custom-t-shirts.png\" alt=\"ppc-ad-copywriting-numbers-in-headline-bad-example\" width=\"569\" height=\"117\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In theory, this should be a great ad because it mentions upfront\u2014in the very first few characters of the headline\u2014how cheap these custom-printed shirts can be. However, this can also be a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/16\/copywriting-mistakes\">copywriting mistake<\/a> if it raises more questions than it answers. For example, these shirts might be very affordable, but how good can they be for less than $2 per shirt? As a hypothetical prospect, I\u2019m already questioning the quality of the product before I\u2019ve even clicked through, which isn\u2019t the desired effect.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-copywriting-advice-ever-terrible-t-shirt.jpg\" alt=\"Best PPC ad copywriting advice ever terrible pug t shirt\" width=\"628\" height=\"819\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Most prospects have an idea of how much they\u2019re willing to pay for something long before they even consider clicking on an ad, so including figures or statistics in your ads helps them make a decision when evaluating your ad with a competitor\u2019s ad.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Appeal to users\u2019 sense of entitlement<\/h2>\n<p>This may sound like preying on the selfishness of your prospects\u2014because it is. Without inadvertently sounding like a grumpy old man yelling at kids to get off my lawn, we live in an increasingly selfish society in which many people exhibit a blatant sense of entitlement. As unpleasant as this can be, it can prove a valuable opportunity for advertisers savvy enough to take advantage of it.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-ad-copywriting-divorce-lawyer.png\" alt=\"ppc-ad-copywriting-entitlement\" width=\"607\" height=\"111\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The ad above, for a divorce and personal injury lawyer, expertly capitalizes on this sense of entitlement. The phrasing of the headline (\u201cTo Protect Your Best Interests\u201d) immediately appeals to the notion that the prospect deserves something\u2014a shrewd tactic for a situation as emotionally charged as a divorce.<\/p>\n<p>This technique is particularly prevalent in the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/06\/29\/law-firm-marketing\">legal sector<\/a>, as many people who file lawsuits do so in the staunch belief that they\u2019re owed something. In many cases, attorneys and law firms leverage the inherently adversarial nature of legal proceedings to create highly provocative ads that can be very <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/13\/persuasive-ads\">persuasive<\/a>\u2014and appealing to a sense of entitlement is an excellent way to provoke an emotional reaction in your prospects. Speaking of which\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>4. Include emotional triggers in your ads<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/01\/psychology-copywriting-tips-examples\">psychology in your copywriting<\/a>, nothing spurs people into action like a powerful emotional response\u2014especially online. This principle is what makes <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/15\/clickbait\">clickbait<\/a> so effective; people read something, experience a strong emotional reaction to it, and then click through. This technique is one of the most powerful at your disposal when writing PPC ad copy.<\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>There, there, Donna &#8211; don&#8217;t cry<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The emotional responses you can try to provoke will depend on what you\u2019re offering and the desired effect you want this emotional reaction to have on your prospects. Negative emotions, such as anger, disgust, and fear can provoke an incredibly powerful response in the reader, but it can be a challenge to balance this reaction with the rest of your messaging\u2014you don\u2019t want the negative emotional reaction to carry over into perceptions of your products or brand.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/01\/psychology-copywriting-tips-examples\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at an ad for a particularly delicate, potentially emotional service\u2014a site that helps people determine whether their husbands are having affairs:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-ad-copywriting-cheating-husband.png\" alt=\"ppc-ad-copywriting-emotional-triggers\" width=\"580\" height=\"109\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This ad is really interesting, and a great example of how subtle leverage of <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite120WordsforMarketingWithEmotion.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_120WordsPhrases_Download\">emotional triggers in your ads<\/a> can be highly compelling. Firstly, the ad makes its primary benefit clear, namely that simply by entering a name the searcher can find information ranging from dating profiles to criminal records\u2014quite the comprehensive search indeed, and the kind of armchair detective work that an unfaithful husband might not expect.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/08\/positive-vs-negative-ads\">positive emotional triggers<\/a>, such as affirmation and humor, can be highly effective at prompting people to click on your ads\u2014but they can be tricky to implement well due to the subjective nature of these emotions (especially in the case of humor).<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This technique doesn\u2019t have to be particularly overt, and you don\u2019t necessarily need to outrage potential customers to get their attention. In fact, sometimes, a more subtle <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/16\/copywriting-formulas\">copywriting approach<\/a> can be just as effective, as this ad demonstrates:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-ad-copywriting-liposuction.png\" alt=\"ppc-ad-copywriting-positive-emotions\" width=\"606\" height=\"180\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The ad above manages to stimulate an emotional response while using aspirational language to entice prospects to click. This type of ad may have been well-suited to a negative emotional trigger, but the advertiser has cleverly opted to take a more inspirational approach to a sensitive topic\u2014body image\u2014to get its point across.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p><strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;\u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite120WordsforMarketingWithEmotion.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_120WordsPhrases_Download\">The 120 Best Words &amp; Phrases for Marketing with Emotion <\/a>\ud83d\ude0d\u00a0\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<p>Of course, sometimes, taking a more direct approach can be the best way to go, as this ad for a law firm specializing in DUI cases demonstrates with this ad:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-ad-copywriting-dui-lawyer.png\" alt=\"ppc-ad-copywriting-fear\" width=\"601\" height=\"126\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In this example, fear\u2014or, at the very least, uncertainty\u2014is the primary emotional trigger (\u201cSave Your License &amp; Avoid Jail\u201d), and it\u2019s right there in the headline, a very effective tactic.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Related:<\/strong> Get tips for <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/direct-response-copywriting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">direct response copywriting<\/a> from our friends at LocaliQ to drive action from your ads.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Create unique, keyword-rich display URLs<\/h2>\n<p>Many advertisers overlook the potential impact that a display URL can have on the success of their ads. Newcomers to PPC may not even realize that the display URL (the URL that appears in their ads) and the destination URL (the actual URL of the page to which visitors are directed upon clicking an ad) can be different.<\/p>\n<p>The display URL can serve two purposes \u2013 it can be something more interesting and relevant to the copy of your ads, <em>and<\/em> it can (and should) contain your top keywords. Even if your destination URL doesn\u2019t contain the keywords you\u2019re bidding on, your ads can still appear in search results if you include them in your display URL.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-ad-copywriting-security-camera.png\" alt=\"ppc-ad-copywriting-display-url\" width=\"555\" height=\"95\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The example above makes good use of the display URL, which suggests that the prospect will be taken to a product page dedicated to security cameras. It looks better than a generic homepage URL, and gives the advertiser another opportunity to appear alongside the search term.<\/p>\n<p>Before making your ads live, be sure to give some thought to your display URLs and how they can reinforce the messaging of your ads.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Prioritize your best copy<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Last summer, Google responded to the growth in consumer device size and the demand for instantaneous solutions by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/22\/new-expanded-text-ads\">further expanding your text ads<\/a>\u2014adding an extra 30-character headline and an extra 90-character description line.<\/p>\n<p>At the time of wide release, Google reported that these new, up-to-300-character text ads drove 15% more clicks for advertisers. Sounds perfect, right?<\/p>\n<p>Well\u2014almost perfect. As powerful as it is to add more than 100 additional characters to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/29\/google-ads-not-showing\">your text ads<\/a>, that doesn\u2019t translate universally across devices. On smaller devices, like smartphones and mini tablets, the screen size can\u2019t accommodate both a third headline and a second description line.<\/p>\n<p>As such, when writing your text ads, it\u2019s wise to frontload your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/03\/how-to-write-exceptional-ppc-ad-copy\">best ad copy<\/a> into the first two headlines and the first description line. That way, you can be sure you\u2019re always serving compelling messages to users\u2014regardless of their device preferences.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-ad-copywriting-frontload-headline-copy.png\" alt=\"ppc-ad-copywriting-prioritize-best-copy\" width=\"587\" height=\"117\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Here, because I was using my desktop, Google served me all three of KAYAK\u2019s headlines. Nonetheless, the KAYAK copywriters came prepared for smaller screens. Although the inclusion of the branded website in the third headline does help from a recognition standpoint, it\u2019s certainly not essential information. The first two headlines, on the other hand, are much more important to the ad.<\/p>\n<p>And when I search the same query on mobile&#8230;<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-ad-copywriting-mobile-serp.jpg\" alt=\"ppc-ad-copywriting-mobile-ad\" width=\"750\" height=\"935\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&#8230;only two headlines. It&#8217;s a different advertiser altogether, but I think you see my point.<\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Still not sure what your best ad copy is? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3OIc0jcgE-I&amp;t=8s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Check out the most common Google ad copy mistakes to avoid here!<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\" style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/3OIc0jcgE-I?autoplay=0&amp;start=8&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2>7. Preemptively respond to common objections<\/h2>\n<p>Even if you\u2019re operating in a crowded market with many <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/18\/ppc-competitor-analysis\">competitors<\/a>, oftentimes the choice between you and a competing business will come down to one of two objections \u2013 how much it\u2019ll cost, and how much hassle it will be. Fortunately, you can preempt both of these common obstacles with a little forethought and some smart copy.<\/p>\n<p>Take a look at this example ad for the search query \u201caffordable home insurance:\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-ad-copywriting-home-insurance.png\" alt=\"ppc-ad-copywriting-objections\" width=\"591\" height=\"97\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Obviously there are dozens of very large companies offering home insurance, and so differentiating yourself in this particular market could be pretty tricky. However, EverQuote has done a pretty good job of making this ad compelling. Note that the very first copy in the headline\u2014a price\u2014is \u201c$97,&#8221;\u00a0which helps overcome prospects\u2019 fear of being gouged for insurance.<\/p>\n<p>The ad above was actually beaten to position one by the following ad:<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-ad-copywriting-home-insurance-bad-example.png\" alt=\"ppc-ad-copywriting-objections-bad-example\" width=\"606\" height=\"161\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This ad does nothing to alleviate my apprehensions about searching for a home insurance quote. Sure, it mentions that a quote will be free, but I\u2019d expect that from any home insurance provider. It doesn\u2019t tell me how much I\u2019ll <em>actually<\/em> be spending.<\/p>\n<h2>8. Focus on the benefits<\/h2>\n<p>Remember how we discussed that we live in an increasingly selfish society? This should never be far from your mind when writing ad copy, especially when it comes to the body copy itself. Nobody cares about why your company is supposedly awesome. <strong>They only care about how you can make their lives easier.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at some examples of this principle in action. It\u2019s worth noting at this point that one reason I\u2019ve included so many examples from the insurance industry is because of its <a href=\"\/articles\/most-expensive-keywords\">intense competitiveness and high CPCs<\/a>, as well as the wide variance between ad copy from one company to another.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-ad-copywriting-pet-insurance.png\" alt=\"ppc-ad-copywriting-benefits\" width=\"599\" height=\"113\" \/><\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ppc-ad-copywriting-pet-insurance-bad-example.png\" alt=\"ppc-ad-copywriting-benefits-bad-example\" width=\"497\" height=\"86\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The first ad focuses almost exclusively on how their services benefit me as a potential customer. It tells me that their plans work with any licensed veterinarian and include coverage for hereditary health problems my pets might have. It goes on to assure me that my pet will be covered for life and that his or her age doesn\u2019t matter.<\/p>\n<p>The second ad is significantly worse. The headlines are okay; including a call to action with a slight sense of urgency is a fine practice. It\u2019s in the description that things go south for MOAA. The only benefit\u2014if you can even call it that\u2014is that MOAA members choose the coverage they want for their pets.<\/p>\n<p>Um, yeah\u2014that\u2019s the whole point. It\u2019s a given that MOAA members have that liberty. This ad is a complete waste of description space.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s worth noting that the second ad could very well convert like gangbusters\u2014I\u2019m sure there are literally thousands of ads out there that don\u2019t follow <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/search-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PPC<\/a> best practices and still convert very well. That doesn\u2019t mean, however, that advertisers should emulate these ads <em>unless they\u2019ve performed well under rigorous A\/B test conditions<\/em>. As with much of the conventional wisdom out there, real data from real tests is preferable to any \u201cbest practice,\u201d even if it seems counterintuitive. Do what works for <em>your<\/em> business, not someone else\u2019s, and always make decisions based on hard data.<\/p>\n<p>Writing <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/21\/adwords-ads\">great PPC ads<\/a> takes time and practice. However, by following the tips above and avoiding the mistakes of others, you can improve the quality of your ads (and your click-through rates, and your Quality Scores\u2026) faster and see a greater return from your ad spend.<\/p>\n<h3>Summary: How to write effective ad copy for PPC advertising:<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Mirror the user\u2019s objective.<\/li>\n<li>Include numbers or statistics in your headlines.<\/li>\n<li>Appeal to user\u2019s sense of entitlement.<\/li>\n<li>Include emotional triggers in your ads.<\/li>\n<li>Create unique, keyword-rich display URLs.<\/li>\n<li>Prioritize your best copy.<\/li>\n<li>Preemptively respond to common objections.<\/li>\n<li>Focus on the benefit.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Want even more tips to up your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/19\/copywriting-skills\">copywriting skills<\/a>?
