Personally, I rent and over-utilize Uber, but I can imagine that the typical consumer of these valuable items does not simply hop on Google, type in \u201cnew car,\u201d and hit \u201cbuy now.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Along with <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/06\/real-estate-facebook-ads\">real estate<\/a> and automotive, there are a plethora of other industries known for their longer sales cycles, such as most industries within the B2B space, software, consulting services, insurance, finance, and the list goes on. Basically, anything that costs a heavy penny and\/or has a contract tied to it typically falls into the longer sales cycle category.<\/p>\n<p>Marketers are continuously trying to create engaging content, generate buzz, and nurture leads, in an effort to shorten the sales cycle and push more people through it, but with the longer decision-making process the challenges are much higher. Yes, products and services with longer sales cycles typically cost more and lead to more revenue, but marketers need to make sure that they\u2019re not spending more of their budget to gain the sale than the sale itself is actually worth (cough, cough, ROI is critical).<\/p>\n<h2>Hold up, what is a sales cycle?<\/h2>\n<p><em>\u201cA sales cycle is the series of predictable phases required to sell a product or a service. Sales cycles can vary greatly among organizations, products and services, and no one sale will be exactly the same.\u201d<\/em> &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pipedrive.com\/en-US\/features\/sales-cycle-management\">pipedrive<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Most definitions speak of the sales cycle being the time between making the <strong>first touch point<\/strong> and <strong>closing the deal<\/strong>. The sales cycle encompasses marketing efforts to generate and maintain interest, along with the selling process to engage and convert into customers. Here is a super simple sales cycle depiction:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sales-cycle-simple.jpeg\" alt=\"sales-cycle-simple\" width=\"800\" height=\"519\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>It&#8217;s never just that simple (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ratchetandwrench.com\/articles\/8669-how-to-perfect-each-portion-of-the-sales-cycle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a>).<\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-justify\">This, of course is the 30,000 foot view which aims to apply to all businesses.<\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-justify\">But as we know, there are many sales and marketing steps that go into &#8220;Getting the customer&#8221; and &#8220;closing the sale,&#8221; especially for B2B companies.<\/p>\n<p>For this article we\u2019ll be diving into the marketing side of the cycle.<\/p>\n<h2>How long is a sales cycle?<\/h2>\n<p>So what period of time signifies a sales cycle as long as opposed to short? There\u2019s no benchmark time period that can apply to all industries, but I would argue that any sale that typically takes several touch points (for example, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/04\/18\/underused-ppc-strategies\">paid search<\/a>, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/18\/google-display-network-tips\">display<\/a>, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/03\/email-marketing-best-practices\">email marketing<\/a>, organic, white paper download etc.), and spans over several weeks to months is typically considered a longer sales cycle.<\/p>\n<p>Think about B2B projects where a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/11\/business-proposals\">business proposal <\/a>is involved and stakeholders have to carefully analyze the price, ROI, and scope of the project.

But if you must distinguish them, you can think of it like this: The sales cycle is a representation of the process by which a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/04\/nurture-marketing\">prospect becomes a customer<\/a>, while the funnel represents the strategies and offerings you use to move them through that process.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a marketer then you are likely familiar with the concept of the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/07\/marketing-funnel\">marketing funnel<\/a>, a model that dates back to 1898 that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/19\/customer-journey-map-templates\">maps out the customer journey<\/a> starting at the wide opening at the top of the funnel and narrowing down to the bottom. The top of the funnel is largest because it captures all of your potential customers, but as time and engagement unfold, only a certain percentage of prospects within each stage will move on to the next stage of the funnel\u2014hence why the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/01\/bottom-funnel-conversions\">bottom<\/a> is so narrow.<\/p>\n<p>The stages vary per business, but typically include something like\u00a0awareness, consideration\/interest, conversion, and potential further actions.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sales-cycle-marketing-funnel.jpeg\" alt=\"sales-cycle-marketing-funnel\" width=\"600\" height=\"445\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/code95.com\/blog\/marketing-funnel-5-steps\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Several marketing scientists have come up with various theories suggesting the funnel should be revamped into a pyramid or circle. \u201cConsumers are now more informed, connected, and empowered than ever.

Read on, my friend.<\/p>\n<h2>6 marketing tactics to\u00a0speed up your long sales cycle<\/h2>\n<p>After extensive research and in-depth conversations with experienced marketing professionals across B2B industries, I\u2019ve discovered these six\u00a0marketing tactics that will help not only cut down the length of your sales cycle, but also push a larger audience through the cycle to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/03\/increase-sales-online\">increase total sales<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>1.\u00a0Implement a \u201ctop of the funnel\u201d paid search strategy<\/h3>\n<p>Take a moment to reflect on the last time you made an expensive purchase. One of the first things you likely did is conducted some research on Google to see what your options were, did some comparison shopping, and just got a general sense of what companies and offerings were in the space. I do this all the time even with smaller purchases, like a massage appointment or new piece of clothing, but with larger purchases that are more of a financial commitment, the chances of that being the first and last action you take are slim to none. This needs to be kept in mind when implementing your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/12\/paid-search-conquesting\">paid search strategy<\/a> (which is absolutely necessary!).<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/12\/08\/should-i-use-adwords\">doubting why you need to pay for ads on Google<\/a>, then banish these thoughts from your mind and start using the more logical side of your brain. Longer sales cycles go hand in hand with extensive research, and guess where your leads likely start? Google!<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not appearing in the SERPs then you are losing the huge audience that is conducting research to eventually make a purchase; if you are <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/19\/get-on-first-page-google\">showing up in the top positions<\/a> then you\u2019re presented with the opportunity to gain site visitors that you can then nurture and eventually convert into loyal, paying customers.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sales-cycle-paid-ads_0.png\" alt=\"sales cycle paid ads\" width=\"581\" height=\"619\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Showing up at the top of the SERP can get your leads on the path to the bottom of your funnel.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>So how do you distinguish your offers as \u201ctop of the funnel?\u201d Well, you need to conduct thorough keyword research and avoid terms like \u201cbuy now,\u201d \u201capply now,\u201d or \u201csignup today\u201d \u2013 you get the gist. If your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/09\/call-to-action\">calls to action<\/a>\u00a0are too aggressive, then the searchers are going to feel like you\u2019re proposing on the first date. Take a step back and get into the mind-set of the searcher. Instead cater your paid search experience to\u2026<\/p>\n<p><strong>Target keywords for people conducting research<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For instance if you are selling marketing <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/23\/ppc-for-b2b-software-companies\">software<\/a>, target \u201cmarketing automation help\u201d or \u201cmarketing management solution.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Present an ad that highlights why you\u2019re better than your competitors<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019re most likely going to be appearing right alongside them (hopefully in front) so your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/08\/15\/ad-copywriting-tips\">ad copy<\/a> needs to highlight some compelling offers. Do you have free shipping or a money back guarantee policy that your top competitor doesn\u2019t offer? Then create <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/09\/15\/adwords-ad-extensions-guide\">ad extensions<\/a>, such as sitelinks and callout extensions, to highlight these benefits.<\/p>\n<p>Check out the example below from Marketo.\u00a0This ad is great because it highlights several benefits of their software and gives it validation with social proof from their followers on Google+. It\u2019s also not overly aggressive with language that hints at making a purchase; rather the links all direct to educational offers, which brings me to my next point\u2026<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sales-cycle-marketo.png\" alt=\"sales cycle marketo ad displaying on the serps\" width=\"463\" height=\"139\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Create <\/strong><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/19\/landing-page-tool\"><strong>landing pages<\/strong><\/a><strong> that cater to educational content<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This includes a white paper download or e-book rather than presenting your product or offering off the bat. Remember, these people are top of the funnel. If they already knew about your service they probably wouldn\u2019t be searching. Direct them to a page that provides educational content, continue to nurture them, and push them closer to commitment.<\/p>\n<h3>2.\u00a0Align content and offerings with progressions within the long sales cycle<\/h3>\n<p>Have you ever received an offering prompting you to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/11\/call-to-action-examples-for-email-newsletter-signups\">opt into a newsletter<\/a> or sign up for a demo when you weren\u2019t even familiar with the company\u2019s brand? You look cross-eyed at the email and hit your trash icon while simultaneously rolling your eyes. Pushing too hard before the lead is ready will blow up in your face. But how do you ensure potential leads don\u2019t slip through the cracks?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Provide ongoing thought leadership and education<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Do not serve up your offerings right away, but rather establish brand awareness and credibility with quality content. \u201cWe like to stay top of mind from a marketing perspective by providing ongoing <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/12\/01\/12-days-of-experts-series\">thought leadership<\/a>,\u201d says Laura Taylor, WordStream\u2019s Vice President of Acquisition and Experience Design. \u201cPart of a robust marketing strategy is to make sure you have educational content all along the funnel.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/online-marketing-classes-localiq-marketing-lab.png\" alt=\"online marketing classes localiq marketing lab\" width=\"800\" height=\"416\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>LOCALiQ&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/local-marketing-lab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Local Marketing Lab<\/a> is a great example of educational content<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Integrate your thought-leadership content with promotional offerings<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>There needs to be a strategized balance between education content and offers that showcase your product. \u201cIf all you have is thought leadership, but nothing to evaluate your product, and then position it as a solution to solve a problem, then leads become stuck,\u201d says Laura.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnother pitfall would be offering all product promotional materials like buying guides and demos. There needs to be a balance and flow, where your content is being offered along the cycle and leads don\u2019t consistently feel like you\u2019re trying to back them into a corner.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Look at the first action taken and prescribe from there<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>WordStream\u2019s <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/09\/23\/get-more-leads-with-ppc\">Lead Nurturing<\/a> Manager, Callahan McGuinness, explained to me how important the first action taken is because it shows where the lead is within the funnel. For example if they sign up for a trial then the assumption can be made that they\u2019re a bit more knowledgeable because they took the action to sign up and actually explore the software. \u201cThat first action helps you know what to put in front of them and how often,\u201d says Callahan.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Scale back on marketing emails once a lead becomes an SQL (sales qualified lead)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If a lead is getting closer and closer to converting and now assigned to a sales representative to guide them through the final stages, then marketing messages need to tone it down a notch. \u201cNot only is an SQL getting marketing emails, but also emails from sales so once the lead turns into an SQL we scale back significantly so they can build that personal relationship with the rep,\u201d says Callahan. The SQL is then also taken out of new content downloads and webinar invites which are for those in the earlier stages in the funnel.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Drive Action by Making the Experience Personalized &amp; Relating with Each Prospect<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019d assume your inbox is often swamped with marketing emails that you have to scroll to the bottom to find that tiny \u201cunsubscribe\u201d option. Have you ever called a business in hopes of speaking to (gasp) a real-live, breathing human being, but instead are directed from one automated operator to another? We\u2019re all constantly swamped with marketing messages the second we wake up and scroll through our <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/19\/social-media-marketing-plan\">social feeds<\/a>. People are becoming pretty excellent at dismissing them, so how do you make your touch-points during the sales cycle more effective?<\/p>\n<p>Well, how about <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/06\/personalized-marketing\">personalizing<\/a> the experience?<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/personalize-ecommerce-customer-journey-recommendations-2.png\" alt=\"personalize-ecommerce-customer-journey-recommendations\" width=\"800\" height=\"601\" \/><\/div>\n<p>When a company is outrageously promotional, slapping their brand in front of your face, it\u2019s an instant turn-off. In contrast, when the company connects on a more personalized level and gains an actual understanding of your interests, then your engagement level increases. But first you need to gain the trust from your leads so that they\u2019re willing to reveal more information about themselves.<\/p>\n<p>As Laura explains, \u201cWithin a system like Pandora or Spotify you can say \u2018I\u2019m interested in country or rock music\u2019 and you can do a level of granularity, but when someone distinguishes that they like Taylor Swift\u2019s \u2018Blank Spaces\u2019 song, but not Carrie Underwood\u2019s \u2018Something in the Water,\u2019 at that point you\u2019re able to nurture much more granularly.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>How can this be done? Start off with these strategies:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Put a face to your brand<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<p>You need employees that act as brand promoters and represent the face of your company, whether that be your founder or a respected higher-up. \u201cHaving a person or group of people that are the voice of the brand helps people connect more with the company; it\u2019s not just I\u2019m working with WordStream, but rather I\u2019m working with Larry or Elisa, making the experience much more personal,\u201d says Laura.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.evertrue.com\/\">EverTrue<\/a> uses a similar strategy. I recently spoke with Jesse Weiss, Manager of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/10\/22\/demand-generation\">Demand Generation<\/a>, at the Boston-based SaaS <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/12\/startup-marketing\">startup<\/a>, EverTrue, which offers donor software solutions to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/15\/higher-education-marketing\">help higher education<\/a> and non-profits expand their donor network and work towards their fundraising goals. He explained how their CEO &amp; Founder, Brent Grinna, is constantly used to promote and add value to their brand. \u201cHe\u2019s all over the place. He recently went to Brown and Harvard Business School to volunteer for fundraising,\u201d Weiss explained. Even browsing around EverTrue\u2019s site you can see that Brent is used to tell the \u201cEverTrue <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/12\/05\/business-storytelling\">story<\/a>\u201d and his picture as well as other members of the leadership team are highlighted on their \u201cAbout Us\u201d page.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sales20cycle20face20brand.png\" alt=\"face brand sales cycle\" width=\"592\" height=\"395\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Personalize touchpoints<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Every marketing message should relate to that lead and be personalized at some level. For example an email blast should direct each customer by name. It also helps to have emails sent from an actual person or the \u201cface of your brand\u201d rather than a company email alias, but Callahan advises using the strategy sparingly. \u201cEmails sent from Larry (WordStream\u2019s founder and CTO) prove to be much more powerful, but we try not to overuse this strategy because then it won\u2019t be as effective when needed. For example the first touchpoint once a lead signs up for a trial is a good opportunity to leverage this strategy and get the lead excited about our software.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Weiss spoke candidly with me about tactics used to engage targeted <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/26\/prospecting-strategies-ppc-agencies\">prospects<\/a> during their longer sales cycle, which typically spans across six months. He is a huge advocate of personalizing touchpoints to engage leads, for instance, he often uses strategies such as tagging universities in posts via Twitter or Facebook. \u201cPeople love seeing photos they\u2019re tagged in,\u201d stated Weiss. \u201cI\u2019m constantly collaborating internally to create content that caters exclusively to our target prospects.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Another strategy Weiss and his team have implemented is publishing <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/24\/blogging-tips\">blog posts<\/a> that cover a list of universities they\u2019re targeting to convert. \u201cWe\u2019ll force rank universities at certain stages in the funnel and promote the posts through email, LinkedIn sponsored posts, or even having the BDR (business development rep) use that as a way to engage with them.\u201d See the content below that EverTrue promoted on their blog to engage with the listed Universities.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sales20cycle20evertrue.png\" alt=\"evertrue sales cycle\" width=\"762\" height=\"529\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Use relatable language in all of your messaging<\/strong>: I was reading a blog post the other day and legitimately fell asleep with my MacBook on my lap. It was likely because the writing sucked. We know quality content is critical, but what makes content engaging during a sales cycle? At WordStream we\u2019ve found that <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/07\/improve-writing-skills\">writing<\/a> with personality and catering our messaging to relate to our audience is the way to go. \u201cWe always try to sound more conversational so we can seem more relatable as a brand,\u201d says Callahan. \u201cHaving a message that\u2019s thought-provoking and avoiding the urge to sound sales-y, but more solution based. We use softer sales tactics, subtle calls-to-action, and relate to them by saying things like \u2018we feel your pain, we can help you.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>EverTrue uses a similar strategy when it comes to their language usage. \u201cWe try to make our marketing messaging as candid as possible. We\u2019ve always been very open when it comes to product innovation, and we try to spur conversations by tagging schools in our social posts,\u201d says Weiss. \u201cOur main goal is to stimulate a warm conversation between a lead and a BDR, and if we\u2019ve done that then we\u2019ve done our jobs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Create a strategic remarketing strategy<\/strong>: There are so many ways to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/18\/google-display-network-tips\">remarket<\/a> to those who have already visited you site, and the amount of granularity you can use to target a specific audience is incredible. Dig into your options and implement a strategy to cater to specific behaviors, for example you would want to remarket to an audience that that visited a trial or demo page in a different manner then those who simply read a blog post or visited your homepage.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Study Common Behaviors and Make Changes Accordingly<\/h3>\n<p><em>A\/B test, A\/B test, <\/em><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/27\/ab-tests\"><em>A\/B test<\/em><\/a><em>!!! <\/em>This is something that all marketers are constantly preaching, but if you\u2019re always testing then when will you actually arrive on an outcome? The lesson to learn is to test one element at a time, and not over test. If something is working then let it work! Don\u2019t throw a road block in front of it because it could result in a fatal accident. Instead start by gaining insight into common behaviors.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sales-cycle-personalization.png\" alt=\"sales cycle personalization\" width=\"800\" height=\"402\" \/><\/div>\n<p>To constantly be improving the pace and effectiveness of the sales cycle you need to:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Prioritize data analysis<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cData should affect all of your decision making,\u201d Callahan says. \u201cWe look at targets each month, break it out by channel and program, and ask what is and what isn\u2019t working? How many SQL\u2019s did we gain? Which pieces of content resonated?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Data analysis can also be extremely time consuming and challenging, which is why Laura advises to not become paralyzed by the data, but rather make a hypothesis and test. \u201cIn our space it\u2019s not as if visitors come to our website and make an <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/01\/ecommerce-sales-funnel\">ecommerce conversion<\/a>. There are so many in-between\u2019s that it\u2019s difficult to know how conversions occur,\u201d says Laura. \u201cThey might finally convert on a phone call, but every webinar, tweet, and blog that\u2019s layered along the path might be tied to them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Make adjustments based on your analysis<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Among our free offerings at WordStream are the <a href=\"\/wordstream-graders\">WordStream Graders<\/a>. These tools enable you to connect your Google Ads (AdWords)\u00a0or Bing accounts to have our algorithms scrape through your account performance and give you a grade. After doing some data analysis our marketing team found that a chunk of people who start the grader abandon mid-process.<\/p>\n<p>To combat this abandonment a survey was set up to pop up and email the lead who abandoned their Grader to find out why. It was found that security is a huge concern and the prime reason for abandonment. Therefore the Grader landing pages were adjusted in design to use language like \u201csecure\u201d with an image of a lock, and emails were sent out with impressive statistics showing how many advertisers and agencies have graded their accounts. This is just one example of how spending time to conduct studies and analyze data can make a huge impact on the effectiveness of your sales cycle.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sales20cycle20safe20data.png\" alt=\"safe data sales cycle\" width=\"578\" height=\"111\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>5.\u00a0Invest in a Marketing Automation Platform or Team to Nurture Leads<\/h2>\n<p>Utilizing <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/21\/cost-effective-marketing-automation-tools-small-businesses\">marketing automation<\/a> software to score leads and trigger communications is an absolute must if you want to scale and grow your leads as well as speed up your sales cycle. \u201cPay attention to activities your leads take. If they downloaded information about quality score, then we\u2019ll target them for a quality score webinar,\u201d says Laura, who is a huge proponent of marketing automation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUse marketing automation to set up triggers and program responses. Utilize lead scoring and treat it as a living, breathing model that you tweak over time and learn from because you\u2019ll learn that maybe you&#8217;ve handed leads off too soon. Even if they\u2019re showing signs of being qualified behaviorally, they might not be at that stage yet. It would be great if they could magically design triggers to signify a lead is ready to move from one stage to another, but they don\u2019t always raise their hand. It requires data mining.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This is why having a person or team dedicated to nurturing and analysis is critical. Laura describes how data integrity is a huge challenge: \u201cBusinesses start and close, people move from one business to another, people try things with one email address and then use another later on. Since nurturing is data based, it\u2019s much more science then creativity. As much as every marketing software will claim to be able to visualize the flow of the database of leads, it\u2019s still flawed in hygiene.\u201d <strong>This is why you need people behind the automation to be able to take a huge mass of data, learn from it, and act on it<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>At WordStream, Callahan owns nurturing, and is constantly working on the automated and point-in-time campaigns and using the database to help inform her on how to build the triggers.<\/p>\n<p>As a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/12\/startup-marketing\">startup employee<\/a>, Weiss has found this to be a challenge at EverTrue. On a team of only three other marketers, his bandwidth is stretched very thin. While they do use the marketing software from <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/24\/blogging-tips\">HubSpot<\/a>, his focus on customization and experimentation with the software has been limited, but is on his list of future endeavors. \u201cOver the last few months we\u2019ve created a huge volume of content, but now we need to figure out how to fit that into a more automated lead nurturing program,\u201d he says. \u201cIf people get into our system they\u2019ll receive a slew of emails, but they\u2019re older, poorly branded, with little insight into how they\u2019re progressing into any nurture queue.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>6.\u00a0Maintain a Close and Transparent Relationship with Your Sales Team<\/h2>\n<p>Laura, Callahan, and Weiss all agreed that maintaining a positive, open, and transparent relationship with sales is absolutely critical to improve the flow of the sales cycle. Why? The answer is obvious: sales and marketing are like cheese and crackers, one is not complete without the other. To create a fluid, clear, and efficient sales cycle the lines of communication need to be wide open.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBeing aligned with sales is absolutely crucial in order for there to actually be sales,\u201d Callahan says. \u201cCommunication, working together, listening to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/28\/pain-points\">pain points<\/a>, and not making rash decisions\u2026It can be challenging because they have one goal and we have another, but it\u2019s important to find the balance, and it\u2019s rewarding when both teams can.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So how can you ensure a positive and open relationship is maintained? Conduct regular meeting with sales managers, send emails seeking feedback, collaborate on content that goes to leads later in the sales process, fill sales in on content that\u2019s being released, and be patient, open, and listen, learn, and adjust as needed.<\/p>\n<p>What <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/31\/top-marketing-strategies-2018\">marketing strategies<\/a> have you found to speed up a long sales cycle?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Are you a marketer struggling to push leads through a long sales cycle?
