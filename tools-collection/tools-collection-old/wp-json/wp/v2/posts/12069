As businesses change their operations, people stay in their homes more, and the world reacts to a pandemic unfolding in real time\u2014they turn to online search and news for answers to their questions and solutions to their new needs. For some advertisers, these new searchers are driving new audiences to find their way to advertisers&#8217; sites, and some are becoming new customers. For others, the results aren\u2019t as great, and the strategies will need to shift.<\/p>\n<p>At WordStream, we\u2019re looking across tens of thousands of advertisers to understand the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/02\/new-data-google-ads-benchmarks-during-covid-19\">impact of COVID-19 on PPC advertising<\/a>. In this article, we\u2019ll examine several industries that have noticed serious changes to their Google Ads accounts over recent days and weeks as COVID-19 has spread and interrupted normal life and business.<\/p>\n<p>In the United States, <a href=\"https:\/\/trends.google.com\/trends\/story\/US_cu_4Rjdh3ABAABMHM_en\">Google\u2019s searches have shifted<\/a>, but largely remained constant. But in the past week, we\u2019ve noticed Google search ad impressions begin to decrease modestly\u20147% below average. That\u2019s not uncommon, particularly during holiday weeks, but it was certainly not expected by many advertisers.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"8ea320bc-f878-4d49-bc9a-dd80da82e0f0\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/covid-19-data-clicks.png\" alt=\"Google Ads clicks slowing graph\" width=\"606\" height=\"390\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>What is uncommon is how searchers are behaving.

Luckily, it\u2019s clear that they\u2019re finding searchers more easily than ever in this crisis.<\/p>\n<h3>Health and medical<\/h3>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, many of us are turning to search for information on how to protect ourselves and our communities. As users turn to the stores and the SERP to purchase everything from over-the-counter painkillers to vital medication, many advertisers are seeing increased ease in selling their products online, with ad clicks and conversion rates both significantly higher than usual.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f847a873-3fc7-4e80-bffe-09b921b40fe4\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/covid-19-google-ads-results-medical.jpg\" alt=\"Google Ads results for medical advertisers graph\" width=\"816\" height=\"525\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3><em><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLWebAnyInContentTextLinkPPCCOVID19Guide.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_COVID19Guide_Download\">Navigate the changing online advertising landscape with this free small business guide to COVID-19.<\/a><\/em><\/h3>\n<h3>Business management<\/h3>\n<p>Google\u2019s providing <a href=\"https:\/\/smallbusiness.withgoogle.com\/news\/resources-for-smbs-impacted-by-coronavirus\/#!\/\">additional advice and resources to help small businesses manage through these uncertain times<\/a>, particularly with setting up employees to work remotely and crafting continuity plans.

Small gestures can mean even more throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and advertisers who are wise enough to advertise on Google are seeing some great results. Over the past three weeks, since the coronavirus escalated in the US:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Searches for cards and greetings have seen a 15% increase in conversion rate.<\/li>\n<li>Searches for gift baskets have seen a 30% increase in conversion rate.<\/li>\n<li>Searches for floral arrangements have seen a 43% increase in conversion rate.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>7 industries with mixed PPC performance during COVID-19<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019re closely watching some industries with potential to see big changes or shifts in coming weeks.<\/p>\n<h3>Real estate<\/h3>\n<p>Borrowing rates remain low, and the housing market is currently holding. On the SERP, search traffic remains relatively stable, as well\u2014with little change to search volume, CPC, or conversion rates. But some important shifts could have some important industry consequences down the road.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Property development and construction industries both are seeing declining conversion rates (-53% and -7%, respectively) and lower search volume. A slow down in these fields could trigger reduced real estate supply in the future.<\/li>\n<li>Both real estate listings and real estate agent searches have seen some increased cost per click (+15% in the past month). However, real estate listings have seen a -25% decrease in conversion rates while real estate agents and brokers have observed a 30% increase. As consumers become more hesitant to attend an open house, more will rely on a professional agent to schedule an appointment instead.<\/li>\n<li>Moving and relocation services have seen a 11% increase in search volume while maintaining a healthy CTR, CPC, and CVR.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Home improvement<\/h3>\n<p>March is often a seasonal lull for Home Improvement projects naturally, so we shouldn\u2019t be surprised to see that Home Improvement searches have been slowly declining for the past few weeks. The next few weeks will be a litmus test for the industry.<\/p>\n<p>On one hand, Americans spending more time stuck in their homes could inspire new home projects and an excuse to get off the couch. On the other hand, economic uncertainty may discourage discretionary spending.<\/p>\n<p>To date, average conversion rates remain steady but vary wildly.<\/p>\n<h3>Home furniture<\/h3>\n<p>Much like home improvement, things are unexpectedly consistent on these big-ticket items. Search volume, CPCs, and conversion rates have all stayed within +\/-2% over the past weeks.<\/p>\n<p>Smaller ticket items like home appliances and bedding and linens have seen search upticks and light conversion boosts (+7% and +12%, respectively), which may be a good sign for consumer confidence.<\/p>\n<h3>Automotive<\/h3>\n<p>The automotive industry is showing some stress on the SERP\u2014with a noticeable 30% drop in the industry average conversion rate over the past few weeks.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"21c8ea93-8ab6-4253-b861-d41e356138ed\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/covid-19-google-ads-results-automotive.jpg\" alt=\"Google Ads results for automotive\" width=\"682\" height=\"414\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>A 30% drop is never good, but it\u2019s hard to attribute all that to COVID-19.

Although the classroom has changed, there\u2019s yet to be short-term changes to the performance of higher education advertisers. With the college application rush over and the June SAT yet to be cancelled, prospective students haven\u2019t changed their behavior on the SERP.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s modest increase in paid search traffic for new careers and vocational training (+10% and +8%, respectively) in the past weeks, but that\u2019s largely aspirational for the moment, as conversion numbers haven\u2019t shifted noticeably.<\/p>\n<h3>Legal services<\/h3>\n<p>The legal industry is seeing some minor shifts on the SERP, with modest (under 5%) to search volumes and conversion rates. Luckily, this is offset by a similar decline in the cost per click\u2014keeping search conversions and CPAs mostly steady.<\/p>\n<p>However, we\u2019re seeing more of these conversions arrive in the form of phone calls instead of website submissions. And, unfortunately, over 30% of these calls are unanswered.
