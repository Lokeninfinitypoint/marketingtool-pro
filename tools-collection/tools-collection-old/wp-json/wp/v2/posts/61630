But first, a quick refresher on keyword match types.<\/p>\n<h2>Quick overview of keyword match types<\/h2>\n<p>Over the last few years, there have been a number of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/27\/google-ads-match-type-update-2021-explained\">changes to Google Ads keyword matching<\/a>. We got a new one&#8230; functionalities changed&#8230;we lost one&#8230; It\u2019s been a wild ride.<\/p>\n<p>So let\u2019s get caught up with the lay of the land on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-match-types\">Google Ads keyword match types<\/a> as of now.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/google-ads-match-types.png\" alt=\"google ads match types\" width=\"720\" height=\"492\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-61633\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/google-ads-match-types.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/google-ads-match-types-480x328.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The image above is from Google and gives some examples of what each keyword match type would match to.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exact<\/strong> is the most restrictive of the match types, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/11\/exact-match-changes\">even if it\u2019s no longer truly \u201cExact\u201d<\/a> (one of the functionality changes I mentioned earlier).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Phrase<\/strong> is the second-most restrictive, but will match to a number more things than Exact. If you\u2019ve been in this space for a little while, it&#8217;s important for you to know that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/10\/modified-broad-match-going-away\">Phrase now encompasses much of the same matching qualities that Broad Match Modified<\/a> did before it was removed. RIP.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Broad<\/strong>, clearly, has the widest reach of all the types listed here. And boy howdy does it match to some serious doozies out in the real world.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Broad match has its benefits, but it also opens your ads up to show for queries that aren&#8217;t relevant to your targeted keywords, which can result in a lot of wasted spend on clicks that don&#8217;t convert.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\"><em><strong>Speaking of wasted spend, find out if you have any with the Free Google Ads Performance Grader<\/strong> <\/em><\/a>\ud83d\ude0e<\/p>\n<h2>Two strategies to try before using broad match + Smart Bidding<\/h2>\n<p>Like I said, Google has made claims that broad match has improved and that when paired with Smart Bidding, can reduce the need for using other match types\u2014but if you&#8217;re just <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/21\/how-to-run-google-ads\">learning to run Google Ads<\/a>, I recommend starting with these two strategies first.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Start with phrase and exact match<\/h3>\n<p>By far my preferred strategy with search campaigns is to use phrase and exact match keywords to target folks searching for things that are relevant to my clients.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example of an account I have that\u2019s trying to advertise medical payment solutions. These queries were all generated on broad match keywords and they just\u2026.well, they suck. Plain and simple.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/broad-match-search-terms-example.png\" alt=\"search terms report example\" width=\"385\" height=\"523\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61637\" \/><\/p>\n<p>So for this reason, I\u2019d love to see each and every one of you give Phrase and Exact match keywords the old college try before even thinking about dipping into Broad match.<\/p>\n<p>But if you\u2019re not seeing traction with these match types, there&#8217;s another thing you can do.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Use Dynamic Search Ads<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019ve always had a soft spot for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/01\/dynamic-search-ads\">Dynamic Search Ads (DSAs)<\/a>. If you\u2019re not familiar with them, DSA campaigns function off of your website rather than keywords, but are still search campaigns. You simply provide your website or a bulk upload of pages and then Google will create and serve ads to users who are searching for items that are closely related to the content on your webpages.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/google-dynamic-search-ads.png\" alt=\"how google dynamic search ads work\" width=\"720\" height=\"370\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-61638\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/google-dynamic-search-ads.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/google-dynamic-search-ads-480x247.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>While these campaigns still rely on Google to make some keyword decisions for you,<strong> I\u2019ve found that, on average, the queries they match to are far more relevant than those of broad match keywords.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The only issue with DSA is that sometimes it can be hard to find scale with these types of campaigns. So be ready for that to be an outcome.<\/p>\n<h2>If you do opt into broad match + Smart Bidding&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re not finding scale with either the more restrictive match types or DSA, it might be time to bite the bullet and use Google\u2019s pet strategy. But before you do that, there are a few things you should consider or do before launching.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Make sure you have enough conversion data (and with the right conversion actions)<\/h3>\n<p>I haven\u2019t paid as much notice to the Smart Bidding portion of the strategy in this post. Well, this is it\u2019s time to shine.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/19\/google-ads-automated-bidding\">Automated bidding<\/a> is great, but it\u2019s a machine. It\u2019s only going to be able to perform if it has enough data to learn on and infer user interests.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/google-ads-automated-bidding-strategies.png\" alt=\"google ads automated bidding strategies\" width=\"720\" height=\"423\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-58377\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/google-ads-automated-bidding-strategies.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/google-ads-automated-bidding-strategies-480x282.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>If you\u2019re not hitting a minimum of 15 conversions per month on the desired conversion actions you want for this effort, this strategy could be tough to pull off. <\/strong>Ideally, you\u2019ll use other tactics to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/22\/conversion-rate-optimizations\">find more conversions<\/a> before rolling this out.<\/p>\n<p>One such strategy could be to shift what your call to action is or to use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OUz00S0SNB0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">custom conversion<\/a> action sets for a campaign using broad + Smart Bidding. If you\u2019re able to combine a number of conversion actions to reach the minimum, that could be a great way to ensure you\u2019re feeding the bidding strategy and getting the results you need.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Be proactive with negative keywords<\/h3>\n<p>Given that broad match will match to\u2026just about anything, it&#8217;s imperative that you take the time to add in some logical <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/06\/negative-keyword-guide\">negative keywords<\/a> to your campaign before getting started. There are plenty of places you can find these:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/16\/google-ads-search-terms-report-changes\">Search query reports<\/a> from active campaigns<\/li>\n<li>Account-level negative keyword lists<\/li>\n<li>Google Keyword Planner<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/google-ads-match-types-keyword-planner.png\" alt=\"google keyword planner\" width=\"600\" height=\"631\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-61635\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/google-ads-match-types-keyword-planner.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/google-ads-match-types-keyword-planner-480x505.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Just spend the time to add in terms that you KNOW will show up and aren\u2019t a good fit to save yourself the headache of adding them after they\u2019ve already cost you money.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Review search queries on a regular basis<\/h3>\n<p>If you followed the steps above before you launched, then you\u2019re starting off on the right foot, but that doesn\u2019t mean your job is done. There are still plenty of things you can and should do after launch to make sure you\u2019re getting the most of your strategy.<\/p>\n<p>I hope by now I\u2019ve hit home the fact that Broad match is truly broad. Make sure you\u2019re not letting it go completely nuts and set up a regular task to review queries. This could be as often as every day for the first week, then bump back to twice a week for a bit, then once a week, then you can likely do it once every couple of weeks to a month after that. But this job will never be done.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Monitor lead quality<\/h3>\n<p>For ecommerce stores,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/08\/lead-quality\"> PPC lead quality<\/a> won\u2019t apply since a sale is a sale. But for lead generation companies, not all leads are created equal.<\/p>\n<p>Be sure to have the leads generated from this campaign tagged in such a way that you can evaluate their quality later down the line.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s one thing to find a new source of lots of leads, it\u2019s another altogether to find out six months later that all of them were a terrible waste of money.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Set bidding restrictions to start<\/h3>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re using the Maximize Clicks or Maximize Conversions bidding strategy, start off with some general guidelines and maximums to control how much you pay for each click or conversion.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/google-ads-match-types-bidding.png\" alt=\"google ads bidding strategy selection\" width=\"600\" height=\"333\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-61634\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/google-ads-match-types-bidding.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/google-ads-match-types-bidding-480x266.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>These can be set up in the bidding strategy section of each campaign or shared bid strategy. As time goes on and you see good performance, you can likely relax these controls, but start off conservative and ease the reins as time goes on.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Start with conservative budgets<\/h3>\n<p>Just like bidding, you can set a daily cap on your budget for this campaign. Start off small, get some performance (and new negative keywords) under your belt, then expand once you see some positive trends. &#8216;Remember, Google can charge up to twice your daily budget if it thinks it\u2019s going to get conversions, so don\u2019t be surprised if it does so.<\/p>\n<h2>Be smart about using broad + Smart<\/h2>\n<p>You can probably tell by the tone of this post that I\u2019m not the biggest fan of using Google\u2019s favored Broad Match + Automated Bidding tactics in campaigns. Maybe I\u2019m just getting old, or maybe I\u2019ve always been a curmudgeon.<\/p>\n<p>Either way, this post has hopefully given you some ideas of things to do before you get to that strategy, but also tips for how to make it work in your favor if you decide to go down that path (and consider these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistakes\">manual bidding tips<\/a>, too).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Don&#8217;t jump on board until you&#8217;ve considered these tips and tactics!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":114,"featured_media":61682,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[5],"tags":[],"dipi_cpt_category":[],"class_list":["post-61630","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-paid-search-marketing"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v25.8 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Broad Match Plus Smart Bidding: Should You Use It?
