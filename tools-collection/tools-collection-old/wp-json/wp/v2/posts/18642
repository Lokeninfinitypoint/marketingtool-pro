I\u2019ve never been a good test-taker. I took the SAT\u2019s three times before getting an acceptable score to send to colleges. More recently I suffered through the GRE\u2019s when applying to grad school; the AdWords\u00a0Exam was a piece of cake in comparison.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, I\u2019ve been able to pass the AdWords exam multiple times, and if I can do it, you can do it! But first, let\u2019s discuss some of the challenges so you\u2019re not astounded.<\/p>\n<h3>Challenge #1: Information Overload<\/h3>\n<p>There is no denying that the Google AWords\u00a0Fundamentals Exam and the additional exam you need to pass contain a wide range of definitions and concepts that need to be nailed down. With 170 multiple-choice questions this might not come as a huge shock, but it\u2019s important to be aware of the variety of topics covered.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"aebc4f0f-0812-4975-b6fe-088a3da20378\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-get-adwords-certified-2017.jpg\" alt=\"how to get adwords certified\" width=\"520\" height=\"518\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>\u201cThe most challenging part for me was not knowing what was going to be on the exam,\u201d says Zachary Nussbaum, a WordStream Customer Success Associate who recently passed the exam. \u201cFundamentals is so broad, and the questions are all over the place.<\/p>\n<p>He added: \u201cWhile the mobile exam felt a bit more focused, the questions were very detailed and focused on YouTube. The hardest part is just how much there is to know, and knowing where to focus your time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Zach graduated from University of South Carolina with his bachelors in marketing in 2016, but upon joining WordStream, Google AdWords\u00a0was an entirely new world to him.<\/p>\n<p>Nicole Nesbitt agreed with Zach. While Nicole is also a Customer Success Associate, she came aboard with a slightly higher level of knowledge since she had worked in a similar space. Her time in her previous role was more focused on other forms of digital advertising, but she still felt there was so much to learn.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s just so much information, so figuring out how everything pieces together is challenging,\u201d says Nicole.<\/p>\n<h3>Challenge #2: The Wording of the Questions<\/h3>\n<p>Take note: <strong>The questions on the Google AdWords\u00a0exam are worded to trick you!<\/strong> This finding was unanimous across the three WordStreamers I spoke with, and it\u2019s something I remember quite well from the last time I took the exam in 2015.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ve never done well with multiple choice. Well, Google likes to play hardball on their multiple choice questions by intentionally trying to make you second-guess yourself.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"664ee7c5-d09c-4ac4-858e-31dcc23dfbde\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trick-questions.jpg\" alt=\"adwords exam trick questions\" width=\"800\" height=\"319\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>\u201cGoogle AdWords\u00a0exams are meant to trick you!\u201d says Julia Guacelli, another one of WordStream\u2019s newer Customer Success Associates. Like Nicole, Julia came from a similar space, but still had a lot to learn upon joining the team.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe questions are not very well-worded. It\u2019s very much like a standardized test,\u201d says Zach. Zach often found himself debating between two answers.<\/p>\n<p>Nicole agreed as well. \u201cThe questions are asked in a very strategic and analytical way to ensure you understand the meaning behind a definition,\u201d she says. \u201cFor instance, <a href=\"\/keyword-match-types\">match types<\/a> \u2013 I can recite the definition, but actually knowing how to use them is another thing.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Challenge #3: The Time Component<\/h3>\n<p>Lastly, we have the time component, which involves the length of the exam, as well as the fact that you\u2019re being timed!<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBeing timed is nerve-wracking!\u201d says Zach. Luckily, all three WordStreamers agreed that they had plenty of time to complete the tests.<\/p>\n<p>For Julia, it wasn\u2019t so much about being timed, but more about how long the testing period is. \u201cIt\u2019s a long exam so you need stamina to ensure you\u2019re reading the questions right. After you go through 60 questions everything starts blurring together.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ea00e29d-6a41-41f4-9c04-ebce977f79fb\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/tips-for-passing-the-adwords-exam.jpg\" alt=\"tips for getting adwords certified\" width=\"777\" height=\"513\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>OK, now that you\u2019re aware of the challenges that lie ahead, let\u2019s talk about it how you can overcome them with these seven foolproof testing prep tips from our recently Certified Professionals!<\/p>\n<h2>7 Tips to Help You Pass the Google AdWords\u00a0Certification Exam<\/h2>\n<h3>Tip #1: Start by Learning the Basics<\/h3>\n<p>Learning how to advertise on Google is not as simple as you may have originally expected. At least when I began my Google AdWords\u00a0education I assumed setting up ads was a simple money-exchanging process. Boy was I wrong.<\/p>\n<p>There are many components that go into advertising through Google \u2013 the ad auction, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">keyword research<\/a>, match types, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/11\/easy-adwords-bidding-strategies\">bidding<\/a> and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/09\/14\/adwords-budget-guide\">budgeting<\/a>, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/20\/google-adwords-search-versus-display\">the search vs. the display network<\/a>, and the list goes on!<\/p>\n<p>So, where do you even start? Zach recommends starting with the basic, foundational concepts like how the ad auctions works, and how campaigns are structured.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"8a46600f-3a6b-4d5b-b3d8-6fde695ab46a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-much-does-adwords-cost-google-ad-auction1-1.png\" alt=\"How much does AdWords cost Google ad auction\" width=\"897\" height=\"383\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>\u201cI read a lot of WordStream articles to get the basics down on <a href=\"\/articles\/what-is-google-adwords\">how the ad auction works<\/a>, what <a href=\"\/quality-score\">quality score<\/a> is, etc.,\u201d says Zach. \u201cThis helped me have a better understanding of how everything tied together when I got to more detailed concepts like negative keywords and match types.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not sure where to start, check out our\u00a0<a href=\"\/learn?camplink=mainnavbar&amp;campname=PPCU\">PPC University<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\u2734\ufe0f <strong>Free download<\/strong> &gt;&gt; <\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLPPC101.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_PPC101_Download\" class=\"waffle-rich-text-link\">PPC 101: The Beginner&#8217;s Guide to PPC<\/a><\/strong><span><\/div><\/div><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Tip #2: Be an Active Learner<\/h3>\n<p>This piece of advice from Julia really struck a chord \u2013 it is super critical to take notes and be involved in your learning process rather than just watching a YouTube video or reading something online and hoping that everything eventually sinks in. And this isn\u2019t just something that Julia believes, it\u2019s something that\u2019s been proven through extensive research.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen we write something down, research suggests that as far as our brain is concerned, it\u2019s as if we were doing that thing,\u201d says <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lifehack.org\/articles\/featured\/writing-and-remembering-why-we-remember-what-we-write.html\">Lifehack<\/a> author, Dustin Wax. \u201c<strong>Writing seems to act as a kind of mini-rehearsal for doing<\/strong>. This leads to greater memorization, the same way that visualizing the performance of a new skill can actually improve our skill level.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Julia used the study guides and modules provided by <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/partners\/topic\/3204437\">Google AdWords<\/a> to write down notes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI went through all of the modules, and took thorough notes,\u201d she says. \u201cWhile doing practice tests I wrote down questions I got wrong and then I\u2019d go back and re-do them, a lot! It was my job to pass the exam so I drove myself a little crazy with two weeks of active studying,\u201d says Julia.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7bf5e91f-3cc3-4fcc-badf-e3ef2af7714c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-partners-adwords-study-guides.png\" alt=\"adwords exam study guides\" width=\"1183\" height=\"653\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Take advantage of Google\u2019s own study guides<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Julia\u2019s advice to you is, \u201cTake notes when you\u2019re studying. Write things down and become an active learner.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Tip #3: Make Use of iPass Exam<\/h3>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t yet discovered iPass Exam you\u2019re in for a real treat! I used this tool when I first began studying for the exam in 2013, and I was pleased to hear that WordStream\u2019s new Customer Success Associates are using it too.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ipassexam.com\/\">iPass Exam<\/a> is an online program that allows you to take multiple practice tests that mimic the environment and question format provided on the actual Google AdWords\u00a0Fundamentals exam, as well as the other exam flavors. The great thing about iPass is that <strong>it really prepares you for the difficult wording Google AdWords\u00a0uses to trip you up<\/strong>, and it also gives you the opportunity to practice with their endless library of questions.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7a9b491e-f03b-44dc-9662-37c475f10254\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ipass-exam-adwords-certification-practice-tests.png\" alt=\"ipass exam for adwords certification\" width=\"817\" height=\"481\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>\u201cThe questions are very similar to how the actual test is,\u201d says Zach. \u201cThere\u2019s over 300 questions you can practice with, and running through them is great for muscle memory. It\u2019s like doing flashcards.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Tip #4: Lean on Other Outside Resources<\/h3>\n<p>In addition to iPass there are several other resources outside of the AdWords\u00a0study materials that you can utilize to get comfortable with the material.<\/p>\n<p>If reading works best for your learning style, head to the WordStream blog, and sort through the various topics to focus in on your weakest areas. If you learn better in a lecture type format, search YouTube. There\u2019s tons of helpful videos explaining concepts like bidding and budgeting, the display network, etc.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to use outside resources,\u201d says Julia. \u201cObviously Google knows what it\u2019s doing, but the WordStream blog was way more helpful for me. Sometimes even just YouTube videos would help me really nail down a concept.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Tip #5: Study Between Meetings<\/h3>\n<p>Use your time wisely, and spread out your study sessions. Many people can\u2019t concentrate for 5 hours straight so use the time in between tasks to read up on <a href=\"\/google-remarketing\">remarketing<\/a> or run through a few iPass questions.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRepetition is key,\u201d says Nicole. \u201cIt takes awhile for it to click to the next level, but the more you practice and revisit your study material, the better you\u2019ll do.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Zach studied at every opportunity he had during his working hours. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t in a meeting, and had a free hour, I\u2019d spend time just going through the iPass questions.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Tip #6: Ensure You\u2019re Learning Applicable Concepts as You Study<\/h3>\n<p>Have you ever memorized an entire stack of vocabulary words, but still failed a test miserably? That\u2019s likely because you weren\u2019t looking at the bigger picture. Since you\u2019re taking this exam to improve your online advertising skill-set, going beyond just memorization is critical.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMake sure while you go through the process you know the fundamentals that will actually translate to your business,\u201d advises Zach. \u201cFocus on learning rather then just trying to pass the test.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6f2719f5-099d-4968-9621-d8461c75f7fa\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-certification-exam-study-guide.jpg\" alt=\"how to study for the adwords exam\" width=\"688\" height=\"510\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>\u201cThink of things in the broader context,\u201d says Julia. \u201cFor instance, this is how locations targeting fits into everything else.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Zach also made an important point that if you\u2019re able to chose which test you\u2019re taking in addition to Fundamentals, <strong>choose one that\u2019s specific to your business rather than the one that you think is the easiest<\/strong>. For example, if you work at an e-commerce company, you should take the Shopping exam.<\/p>\n<h3>Tip #7: Be Patient<\/h3>\n<p>Last, but not least, don\u2019t stress, and be patient with yourself. This advice is applicable for the studying portion of the process, as well as when you\u2019re actually taking the Google AdWords\u00a0exams.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTake time to take a step back when you\u2019re taking the exam,\u201d says Julia. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of information to digest, but you\u2019ll have plenty of time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Nicole provided similar advice. \u201cDon\u2019t get overwhelmed. Just take it one step at a time, and you\u2019ll do great.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Should You Even Get Certified?<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you\u2019ve read all the challenges and tips, you might be wondering if all of this trouble is worth the return. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/01\/google-adwords-exam\">Does AdWords certification even matter?<\/a> Well, our Customer Success Associates had mixed feelings, but here are a few common takeaways.<\/p>\n<h3>Getting Certified Won\u2019t Make You an Expert, but You Will Begin the Learning Process<\/h3>\n<p>Passing the AdWords certification doesn\u2019t make you the future paid search expert of 2018. Rather, it\u2019s just the beginning of a continuous learning process that will evolve over time.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTaking the exam is a good jumping-off point to learning about AdWords if you\u2019re completely new to it,\u201d says Julia.<\/p>\n<p>Nicole felt that becoming officially \u201ccertified\u201d is not what is actually important, but rather the process of studying and taking the exam is what made it valuable for her.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI don&#8217;t think the actual certification makes a difference, but the process is worth it because it walks you through everything and gets you learning,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no draw-back to getting certified, and in the end it will help you. Even if you only pick up a few small things, that\u2019s more than you had if you didn\u2019t take it.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>If You\u2019re Working with Clients, It\u2019s Worth Getting Certified<\/h3>\n<p>Do you spend your days selling to or advising clients on their marketing strategies? Maybe you work at a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/15\/state-of-the-internet-marketing-agency\">digital marketing agency<\/a>? Then you should become certified.<\/p>\n<p>While the certification status may mean nothing to you, it will help instill trust for the clients you\u2019re working with.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5bd413db-c348-42dd-b0bd-e995b8b5db5d\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-certification-test-cert1.png\" alt=\"adwords certification\" width=\"889\" height=\"571\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>\u201cFor our position becoming certified is worth it because we work with a lot of small business owners, and informing them we\u2019re certified makes them instantly comfortable,\u201d says Zach. It shows that you know your stuff and take Google AdWords\u00a0seriously.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHaving the certification adds value, and gives the client security.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>What if you\u2019re a busy business owner who\u2019s juggling multiple responsibilities and trying to keep the business running smoothly? Or perhaps you\u2019re working on a marketing team to run their in-house Google AdWords\u00a0account, but you\u2019re not directly interacting with clients. In that case, it might be more useful to get actual experience then spend hours upon hours attempting to pass the exam.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re a small business owner, don\u2019t waste your time,\u201d says Zach. \u201cJust because you pass the test doesn\u2019t mean you know everything.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Julia couldn\u2019t agree more. She pointed out that the test is not equivalent to real-word experience, \u201cbut from a client perspective, yes it makes them comfortable to know they\u2019re working with an expert.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>The Best Way to Learn Google AdWords\u00a0Is Through Experience<\/h3>\n<p>Another unanimous takeaway was that <strong>learning by doing<\/strong> is the best way to become a true AdWords\u00a0expert.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOnce I actually started working with clients is when the real learning happened for me,\u201d says Nicole. \u201cStudying for the exam, and teaching myself, helped me practice my skills and teach others. I can now relate to my clients when they\u2019re hung up on something.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Zach, who started a few months after Nicole, is still aware that there\u2019s so much to learn. \u201cWhile the process of having to learn it all and doing iPass did help force me to learn it, I passed and still feel like I have a lot to learn,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, Zach also advised that <a href=\"\/blog?field_taxonomy_tid=93\">stuff is always changing with AdWords<\/a>, and you need to keep up with the industry in order to be successful, so the learning never stops!<\/p>\n<p>Whether or not you decide to become Google AdWords\u00a0certified, hopefully this guide provided some useful tidbits of advice to get you up to speed on Google advertising from our WordStream experts.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Need a little help preparing for the AdWords certification exam?
