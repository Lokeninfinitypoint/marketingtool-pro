The largest stimulus bill in American history, the CARES act put into motion a momentous effort to provide financial relief for millions of Americans who have been economically impacted by the coronavirus pandemic\u2014in particular, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/business\/2020\/03\/26\/unemployment-claims-coronavirus-3-million\/\">3.3 million Americans who\u2019ve filed for unemployment since March 14<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">, and the small businesses who employ so many of them. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Though the CARES Act is packed with provisions for small businesses (including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2020\/03\/26\/821457551\/whats-inside-the-senate-s-2-trillion-coronavirus-aid-package#small-businesses\">emergency government grants and existing loan payment coverage<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">), the $350 billion <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/funding-programs\/loans\/paycheck-protection-program-ppp\">Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)<\/a><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> might be the most promising portion of the legislation. With its low interest rate and forgiveness potential, the Paycheck Protection Program aims to sustain small businesses through this pandemic without burdening them with significant debt to pay off when the crisis has passed\u2014and, in the process, its goal is to keep people in their jobs and stem the tide of unemployment nationwide.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d1563274-a145-4993-b106-c8ef520b1854\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/cares-act-image.jpg\" alt=\"CARES act visualizaton\" width=\"787\" height=\"591\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The rollout of the program hit many bumps along the way, and the original funding allotment rapidly ran dry. Now, Congress has passed another $310 billion round of funding late on Thursday, April 24 (<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/23\/ppp-house-interim-bill-covid-relief\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>TechCrunch<\/u><\/a>). We don\u2019t yet know when the Small Business Association will reopen applications. But given how quickly the original funding dried up, if you want to access this resource to support your business, you will be ready to apply as soon as the loan application itself opens.<\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Let\u2019s dive into what information we have right now so that you can be ready to get the ball rolling for your business if and when the time comes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><span lang=\"EN\">Please note: We are not legal experts. If you have specific questions about your business or loan application, please speak with your attorney and\/or bank for clarification.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>What is the Paycheck Protection Program?<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The Paycheck Protection Program is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Small Business Association (SBA)<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> loan program specifically designed to help small businesses continue to make payroll at their staff\u2019s current pay rate, as well as cover key expenses that keep the lights on (think rent and utilities). Any loan funds used for these express purposes during the loan\u2019s eight-week period will be eligible to be forgiven: in other words, if a small business uses the loan as it\u2019s intended, they will likely not have to pay back a penny. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">By driving cash into threatened small businesses, the Paycheck Protection Program directly addresses what 70% of small businesses cite as their primary business challenge: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/23\/managing-cash-flow\">cash flow management<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/allbusiness\/2019\/04\/21\/cash-flow-challenges-facing-small-business-owners\/#786e270c3656\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Forbes<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">). About half of small businesses don\u2019t have enough cash on-hand to survive more than 27 days without incoming revenue, and about 25% can only make it 13 days or less with no revenue (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.jpmorganchase.com\/corporate\/institute\/document\/jpmc-institute-small-business-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JP Morgan<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">). With a PPP loan to cover about two months\u2019 worth of most costly expenses (payroll and rent), small businesses will be able to stretch out their existing cash reserves much longer. Hopefully long enough for this crisis to end and for businesses to re-open. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In the meantime, with this loan, small businesses should be able to hold onto their existing team, preserve their retail or office space, and maintain their current utilities providers. This can provide small business owners and employees the opportunity to collaborate to find a way to pivot the business to find alternate revenue sources during COVID-19; and once the crisis ends, small business will still have their fully-trained team on-hand to ramp back up to their usual business model and capacity. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If laying off all your employees is like taking the wheels off a bike so it can no longer run, think of the PPP as enabling small businesses to put on training wheels. You can keep going, though perhaps not as quickly. If you hit a bump, you might not fall totally over. But the most important thing is that you keep moving. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSReg19050712LiveSeriesCOVID19NeedInfoADV?cid=Web_WS_Blog_PPC_LiveSeriesCOVID1919050712_Reg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Questions about the PPP?

I\u2019ll answer common questions that small business owners likely have about the PPP, including how to determine if you\u2019re eligible, how to apply, how the PPP compares to SBA\u2019s EIDL loans, and more.<\/p>\n<h3>How do I know if I\u2019m eligible?<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">You should be eligible to apply if: <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">You\u2019re a small business, 501(c)(3) nonprofit, or a 501(c)(19) Veterans Organization based in the United States.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">You have fewer than 500 employees.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">You\u2019re self-employed or a sole priorietor. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Your business has been adversely impacted by COVID-19, and the current uncertainty makes it difficult to run your business.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">You need this loan to keep your business afloat.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Your business was fully operational on February 15, 2020, with employees on payroll.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>How much can I borrow through PPP?<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">If you\u2019re a small business: You can receive a loan for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uschamber.com\/sites\/default\/files\/023595_comm_corona_virus_smallbiz_loan_final_revised.pdf\">up to 2.5x your average monthly payroll costs for the previous 12 months (up to $10 million total)<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">.\u00a0Note: A small business cannot claim any independent contractors\u2019 usual pay in their \u201cpayroll costs,\u201d as independent contractors are eligible to apply for their own loan (<a href=\"https:\/\/content.sba.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/2020-04\/PPP--IFRN%20FINAL.pdf\">SBA<\/a>) (updated 4\/3).<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">If you\u2019re a sole proprietor or are self-employed (e.g., you run your own one-person marketing agency): Although you don\u2019t have payroll costs in the same way, the loan amount you\u2019re eligible for is still calculated based on your payroll costs for the past 12 months; you full loan amount may be up to $100,000\u00a0(the maximum amount small businesses are allowed to claim as payroll costs per employee).

The loan will be due in 2 years, and there\u2019s no penalty for pre-paying (<a href=\"https:\/\/home.treasury.gov\/system\/files\/136\/PPP%20Borrower%20Information%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf\">US\u00a0Treasury<\/a>).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Updated 6\/10:\u00a0<\/strong>The loan period has been extended for up to <a href=\"https:\/\/home.treasury.gov\/news\/press-releases\/sm1026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">twenty-four weeks<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>What can I use the loan money for?<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The loan is designed to help keep businesses running and people employed.\u00a0Based on the latest guidance from the <a href=\"https:\/\/content.sba.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/2020-04\/PPP--IFRN%20FINAL.pdf\">SBA<\/a>, you should plan to use at least 75% of the loan monies to pay your staff\u2019s salaries during the eight-week loan period, if you plan to apply for loan forgiveness. If you\u2019ve had to lay people off, their pay will not be included in the calculation of the loan amount. But if you hire them back after submitting your application, we believe you can use your loan monies to pay them. If you lay off additional employees after applying for the loan, or if you decrease your employees\u2019 pay, the amount you will be eligible to have forgiven will be impacted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The remainder of the loan amount (up to 25%) can be used on:<\/p>\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\n<li>Rent<\/li>\n<li>Interest on their mortgage principle<\/li>\n<li>Utility payments<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you stick to the above expenses (75% for payroll, no more than 25% for rent, mortgage interest, or utilities), you should be able to have 100% of their loan forgiven (updated 4\/3).
