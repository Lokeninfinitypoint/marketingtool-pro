Personalization is how we marketers can get our messages through those thought filters to create a connection with even the most distracted buyer.<\/p>\n<p>Marketing personalization has evolved far beyond addressing customers by name in an email (although that still helps). There are now sophisticated ways to make sure you\u2019re delivering highly relevant ads and content to precisely the right audience at exactly the right time.<\/p>\n<p>The best part is that these strategies are available to every type of business, from large enterprises to local mom-and-pop shops.

Here are a few of the ways personalizing your marking can help you grow.<\/p>\n<h3>Buyers like it<\/h3>\n<p>First and foremost, personalized marketing makes sense because your customers prefer it. <a href=\"https:\/\/wisernotify.com\/blog\/personalization-stats\/#:~:text=71%25%20of%20buyers%20want%20companies,sales%20and%20increase%20brand%20affinity.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">71%<\/a> of buyers say they want companies to deliver personalized interactions. And two-thirds of customers say they expect brands to understand their needs.<\/p>\n<p>That all makes sense. Most people would rather not have their laptop and smartphone screens filled with irrelevant promotions for things they\u2019ll never want to buy.<\/p>\n<h3>Builds trust<\/h3>\n<p>Who would you trust more, a salesperson who asks questions and explains <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/20\/product-positioning\">product benefits<\/a> specific to you? Or one who keeps listing fancy features that don\u2019t solve your exact problem?<\/p>\n<p>Most of us would say the first one, and that\u2019s how you can build trust as a marketer with personalization.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example. I recently searched online for washable rugs. Washability was my primary concern (my dog and I trek a lot of mud in the house). I searched that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">keyword<\/a> on Google and looked at product pages that offered that feature.<\/p>\n<p>I started seeing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/22\/best-instagram-ads\">Instagram ads<\/a> from rug companies, but this one stood out.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/personalized-marketing-wordstream-tumble.webp\" alt=\"Personalized marketing - Instagram ad from Tumble rugs.\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1984\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90140 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/personalized-marketing-wordstream-tumble.webp 1080w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/personalized-marketing-wordstream-tumble-980x1800.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/personalized-marketing-wordstream-tumble-480x882.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1080px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It was the only ad to focus on washability. Now, I can\u2019t say for sure that Tumble serves different ads to people who visit different pages on its website. But if they do, this is the perfect execution of personalized marketing. I believe they have a product that solves my main challenge.<\/p>\n<h3>Grabs attention<\/h3>\n<p>You may have heard about <a href=\"https:\/\/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/articles\/PMC1647299\/#:~:text=We%20found%20greater%20activation%20in,name%20than%20when%20hearing%20the\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">studies<\/a> done to show what happens when we read or hear our own name. Essentially, parts of our brain responsible for impulse control and decision-making (among other things) light up. That\u2019s why you can create an instant connection with someone who\u2019s scrolling through their inbox by adding their name to an email.<\/p>\n<p>There are many other ways to stimulate that connection and get people to stop scrolling. Include an image of their favorite hobby, mention their job title in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/31\/email-subject-lines\">subject line<\/a>, or call out a product they\u2019ve been researching. All of these stand out in a crowded field and snap us out of our brain fog.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83e\udde0 <strong>Want to learn more ways to use marketing psychology to influence customers and win business?<\/strong> Get our free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite26BrilliantWaysToUsePsychology.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_TextLink_guide_26waysPsychGuide_Download\">26 Brilliant Ways to Use Psychology in Your Copywriting (with Examples)<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Lowers your cost of advertising<\/h3>\n<p>We talk a lot about marketing as a whole, but personalization can also lower your cost of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/online-advertising-costs\">pay-per-click (PPC) advertising<\/a> in three ways. First, you need to collect customer data in order to personalize ads. That data also helps you tighten your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/21\/google-ads-audience-targeting-cheat-sheet\">ad targeting<\/a>. So, instead of targeting an expensive keyword like \u201crunning shoes,\u201d you can target something less competitive (and less expensive) like \u201ctrail running shoes for women.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Second, personalized ads are more relevant to the people who will see them. Google uses ad relevance to assign your ads a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/19\/whats-a-good-quality-score\">Quality Score<\/a>. The more relevant your ad, the better your quality score, and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/17\/lower-cost-per-click\">lower your ad\u2019s cost-per-click (CPC)<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Third, those super-relevant ads are also good for increasing your click-through rate and decreasing wasted clicks. People are more likely to click an ad when it feels like it\u2019s for them. And they\u2019ll avoid the ones that aren\u2019t. Both of those actions add up to a higher return on your ad investment.<\/p>\n<h3>Increases loyalty<\/h3>\n<p>I love it when a barista at my local coffee shop remembers my name. It\u2019s a little warm and fuzzy feeling that keeps me coming back.<\/p>\n<p>Those personal touches work in digital marketing, too. Sending things like <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/types-of-marketing-emails\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">birthday emails<\/a>, personalized promotions, and reminders when a consumable product may be running out all endears us to a brand.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/personalized-marketing-wordstream-regal-615x1024.webp\" alt=\"Personalized marketing - Birthday email from Regal\" width=\"615\" height=\"1024\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90141 size-large\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>They remembered!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 <strong>Ready for more marketing ideas?<\/strong> Download <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/online-marketing-tips?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_130marketingtips_Download\">130+ of the Best Online Marketing Tips for Generating More Traffic, Leads, and Sales<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"guidelines-for-personalized-marketing\"><\/div>\n<h2>What are the guidelines for personalized marketing?<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s a responsibility that comes with marketing personalization. After all, you\u2019re gathering and handling customer data. Plus, you often have to tread a fine line between making marketing more relevant and looking like a creepy stalker. These guidelines will help keep you on the right path.<\/p>\n<h3>Gather data responsibly<\/h3>\n<p>Personalization relies on customer data to work. Whether it\u2019s personal info you\u2019ve gathered from a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/31\/google-lead-form-extensions\">lead generation form<\/a> or behavioral information based on where someone clicks on your website\u2014you have to gather and manage that data responsibly.<\/p>\n<p>In general, you\u2019ll need to keep up with privacy concerns, regulations, and changing data collection options. Here are a few tips for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/customer-data\">ethically collecting and storing customer data<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Include an unsubscribe button:<\/strong> Always give people an easy way to unsubscribe from emails and back out of data collection.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Create and publish a privacy policy:<\/strong> Make it clear how you gather customer data and what you intend to do with it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Protect customer data:<\/strong> Take steps to make sure your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/11\/22\/customer-data-privacy\">customers\u2019 data stays safe<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Be transparent:<\/strong> Communicate clearly with your customers if there\u2019s a data breach or a change in your privacy policy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Avoid retargeting too aggressively<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/retargeting-ad-ideas\">Retargeting<\/a> is an important part of personalized marketing since it puts promotions in front of people who have shown interest in a specific product. But if you take it too far, you\u2019ll annoy the audience you want to convert.<\/p>\n<p>Specifically, put a reasonable time frame on your retargeting ads. For small impulse items, a day or two should be enough. For larger purchases where buyers take longer to make a decision, like real estate, you might cap it at a few weeks or a month. Retargeting a potential lead for several months is unlikely to net anything but frustration.<\/p>\n<h3>Don\u2019t over-personalize<\/h3>\n<p>Personalized marketing has a lot of benefits, but if you lean too heavily on it, you\u2019ll stifle customer discovery and drown out your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/10\/27\/brand-messaging\">brand messaging<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what I mean. Say someone shows interest in your yoga classes, and all your ads and emails only highlight that service. You may inadvertently keep them from learning about your other offerings, like reiki sessions and activewear shop. Some of your marketing should be very personalized, but much of it should not.<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-create-a-personalized-marketing-strategy\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to create a personalized marketing strategy<\/h2>\n<p>Once you get into personalizing some of your marketing campaigns, you\u2019ll find an endless list of ways to do it. Use these steps as your guide to get started.<\/p>\n<h3>Set your goals<\/h3>\n<p>Just like any journey, you need a destination before you can choose a route. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/03\/best-marketing-strategies\">Your goals<\/a> will dictate everything from what data you gather to which channels you choose.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s okay to start with a broad goal like \u201cincrease the effectiveness of our email marketing\u201d or \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/social-media-lead-generation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">get more leads from social media<\/a>.\u201d The next few steps will help refine the rest.<\/p>\n<h3>Gather data<\/h3>\n<p>Gathering clean, trustworthy data is the crux of a successful personalized marketing strategy. You\u2019ll need to decide which data is important and how you\u2019ll collect it.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if getting more from your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/email-marketing-strategy-template\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">email marketing strategy<\/a> is important, then you\u2019ll need to gather email addresses to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-build-an-email-list\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">grow your subscriber list<\/a> and track some behavioral (buying habits) and personal (first name, birthday) data to personalize your emails.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/personalized-marketing-wordstream-data-png.webp\" alt=\"Personalized marketing - Graphic of data types.\" width=\"936\" height=\"532\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90160 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/personalized-marketing-wordstream-data-png.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/personalized-marketing-wordstream-data-480x273.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The next question is, \u201cHow do we gather that data?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A few options for this example would include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/15\/lead-magnet-ideas\">lead magnets<\/a> and pop-ups on your website<\/li>\n<li>Sponsoring a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/giveaway-ideas\">giveaway<\/a> or contest<\/li>\n<li>Launching a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/14\/referral-program-ideas\">customer referral<\/a> campaign<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/personalized-marketing-wordstream-lead-magnet-png.webp\" alt=\"Personalized marketing - email popup from True Classic.\" width=\"504\" height=\"429\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90142 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/personalized-marketing-wordstream-lead-magnet-png.webp 504w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/personalized-marketing-wordstream-lead-magnet-480x409.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 504px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Generate customer and segments<\/h3>\n<p>Much of your personalized marketing will target subgroups of your customers (as opposed to a single person). <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/04\/customer-segmentation-models\">Customer segments<\/a> help you identify and target those subgroups.<\/p>\n<p>To create a customer segment, first decide which characteristics the people in that subgroup need to share. It could include age, income, interests, behaviors, and many more.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve identified the right common characteristics, place all leads and customers who share them into that group. That\u2019s who you\u2019ll target with your personalized messages.<\/p>\n<h3>Decide which channels you\u2019ll personalize<\/h3>\n<p>Each marketing channel presents its own benefits and challenges for personalization.<\/p>\n<p>Email gives you a lot of control and hyper-personalization options, but it\u2019s harder to get people to give up their email addresses. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/social-media-marketing\">Social media marketing<\/a> gives you access to larger audiences faster, but you\u2019ll rarely be able to match the one-on-one personalization of email.<\/p>\n<p>Think carefully about your goals and what data you\u2019ll realistically be able to gather, then match them to the right channel.<\/p>\n<h3>Map out your personalized content<\/h3>\n<p>The next step is to lay out what <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/email-marketing-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">email content<\/a> or ads you\u2019ll create, who will see them, and when you\u2019ll share them.<\/p>\n<p>This is where your goals and channel really come into play. Let&#8217;s say you sell kitchen goods. Your goal is to increase repeat purchases and loyalty from existing customers. And email is your chosen channel.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019re content map could look like this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/09\/how-to-write-a-blog-post\">Write a blog post<\/a> with cake recipes and create an ad for a stand mixer.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Who:<\/strong> People who show interest in baking cakes.<\/li>\n<li><strong>When:<\/strong> When someone buys a cake pan or when an email subscriber looks at baking-related product pages.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/personalized-marketing-wordstream-contest-png.webp\" alt=\"Personalized marketing - Contest lead magnet.\" width=\"964\" height=\"707\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90144 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/personalized-marketing-wordstream-contest-png.webp 964w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/personalized-marketing-wordstream-contest-480x352.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 964px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Williams Sonoma held a sweepstakes to gather data for future marketing personalization.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Review, edit, repeat<\/h3>\n<p>Just like any marketing campaign, you\u2019ll get a lot more out of it when you review the results and iterate to improve them.<\/p>\n<p>What you review will depend on all of the other factors (goal, channel, etc.). The key here is to set specific timeframes for your analysis. In the early days, you may want to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/10\/content-audit\">audit results<\/a> multiple times per week.

Several rug brands remembered it, too. Here\u2019s a retargeting ad I saw while on a completely unrelated website.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/personalized-marketing-wordstream-retargeting-png.webp\" alt=\"Personalized marketing - Retargeting ad from rug company.\" width=\"774\" height=\"163\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90145 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/personalized-marketing-wordstream-retargeting-png.webp 774w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/personalized-marketing-wordstream-retargeting-480x101.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 774px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When retargeting, it\u2019s really important to showcase something your target customers will want to see. These may be products they showed interest in, such as in this example. It could also be a bit of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/03\/copywriting-examples\">clever copy<\/a> that speaks directly to the problem they\u2019re trying to solve.<\/p>\n<h3>Personalized marketing emails<\/h3>\n<p>Check out this <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/email-marketing-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">example<\/a> of a simple but effective email personalization tactic from a clothing brand.
