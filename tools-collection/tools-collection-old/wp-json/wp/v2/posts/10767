That saidd,\u00a0you may want to add some stand-up to your Netflix routine.<\/p>\n<h3>16. Constant Contact uses animation to demonstrate tech saavy<\/h3>\n<p>This ad from Constant Contact uses simple animation to make their ad seem smarter and more modern.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best20display20ads20of202020-constantcontact.gif\" alt=\"best display ads of 2020-constantcontact\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Since the ad is about smart email marketing automation, the added movement feels like a necessary addition.\u00a0The rich media works almost like a promise in itself, that the ad is as smart as the service.<\/p>\n<h3>17. Bulldog Skincare proves interstitial ads don\u2019t have to be torture<\/h3>\n<p>Interstitials are the most controversial display ad format by far. Although you get unprecedented size to advertise your message, it comes at a price.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best20display20ads20of202020-bulldog20example.png\" alt=\"best display ads of 2020-bulldog example\" width=\"500\" height=\"306\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The user is forced to see the ad and often clicks (which you pay for) accidentally while trying to close the ad. But with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/30\/design-principles\">right banner ad design <\/a>and targeting, they can still be an effective medium.<\/p>\n<p>Bulldog Skincare uses a humorous image and headline to take the edge off the interruption.<\/p>\n<h2>Key takeaways from these great display ads<\/h2>\n<p>The above ad examples have a wide variety of characteristics\u2014often mutliple per ad\u2014that support a wide range of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/15\/marketing-objectives\">marketing goals and intentions<\/a>. To help you ensure you extract all\u00a0the key takeaways, we&#8217;ve compiled a list of 20 strategies employed by these ads:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Appeal to current trends.<\/li>\n<li>Keep it simple; less is often more with display ads.<\/li>\n<li>Use vibrant colors or high-contrast to grab attention.<\/li>\n<li>Replace words or even letters with emojis.<\/li>\n<li>Stick to one point of focus for each ad.<\/li>\n<li>Match your ad creative to the add size, rather than squeezing one ad into a new format.<\/li>\n<li>Succinctly communicate your value proposition.<\/li>\n<li>Know what matters to your target audience.<\/li>\n<li>Add animation or a video to the landing page associated with your ad.<\/li>\n<li>Try an ad that focuses on your brand rather than a specific product.<\/li>\n<li>Repurpose content for compelling visuals and a brand boost.<\/li>\n<li>Test unique ideas against a conventional version.<\/li>\n<li>Personalize your CTA to resonate more with your audience.<\/li>\n<li>Try compelling and uniquely displayed copy as your ad creative.<\/li>\n<li>With strategically placed copy and creative, your CTA may not even have to be a button.<\/li>\n<li>Advertise an experience, not a product.<\/li>\n<li>Animate your ads to convey more information.<\/li>\n<li>Find unique ways to spruce up icons and stock photos.<\/li>\n<li>Try adding humor to your ads.<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t be afraid of interstitial ads.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Test and optimize to find the best display ad for your business<\/h2>\n<p>When you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, display advertising is an easy way to waste your ad spend.\u00a0But if you\u2019re inspired by greatness (like the ads in this post) and follow tried and tested principles, you have a shot at success.\u00a0But remember that your first idea is rarely the winner. Come up with a few different ideas, mix and match, and test the final ads against each other for the best results. Ongoing testing and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/24\/google-ads-optimization\">optimization of your Google Ads<\/a> is a\u00a0reliable recipe for
