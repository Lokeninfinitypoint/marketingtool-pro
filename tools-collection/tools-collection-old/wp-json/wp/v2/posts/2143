One that pushes you to think from a new perspectives? One without an endless string of snooze-worthy PowerPoint slides?<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps gaining actionable items to implement and grow your business?<\/p>\n<p>Nope, you guessed wrong.<\/p>\n<p>According to the self-proclaimed poster boy of content marketing, <a href=\"http:\/\/joepulizzi.com\/\">Joe Pulizzi<\/a>, a great presentation is one you go into with low expectations. For instance, if you expect to go home with one actionable item, but instead go home with two (i.e. it exceeds your expectations).<\/p>\n<p>As marketers and business owners, you\u2019ve probably attended your fair share of unfortunate presentations. As an avid public speaker, Pulizzi\u2019s goal is the make sure this is not the case. Last week I found myself slurping down a lukewarm cup of coffee in the cozy wine cellar of the well-known Boston steak house, Mooo. Surrounded by an intimate group of Boston marketers, I listened to Pulizzi\u2019s insight on creating and distributing outstanding content. Pulizzi is the founder of the <a href=\"http:\/\/contentmarketinginstitute.com\/\">Content Marketing Institute<\/a> and author of <a href=\"http:\/\/joepulizzi.com\/books\/\">Epic Content Marketing<\/a>. With over 58,000 followers on Twitter, Joe is clearly doing something right. I pushed my coffee aside and attentively listened as he reviewed the five elements to consider in regards to epic content.<\/p>\n<p>So let\u2019s recap and unravel these content marketing tips that Pulizzi decided to share.<\/p>\n<p>[<strong>RELATED:<\/strong> <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/12\/05\/business-storytelling\">6 Storytelling Tips to Tell Your Business Story Like a TED Pro<\/a>]<\/p>\n<h2>Content Marketing Tip #1: Sales, Savings and Sunshine<\/h2>\n<p>Sunshine, huh? Pulizzi said that sunshine stands for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/02\/happy-juice-marketing-content\">happy customers<\/a> &#8211; now you\u2019re speaking my language!<\/p>\n<p>Pulizzi emphasized the importance of setting content goals, while not forgetting about the \u201cwhy?\u201d For example, why are we advertising on Facebook? Who on this channel are we looking to go after? What stage of the funnel are they in? How can we convince them to convert? Or how can we retain our current customers? Asking these critical questions, setting goals, and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/04\/content-strategy-for-the-web\">implementing a content strategy<\/a> are essential steps in creating effective content in Pulizzi\u2019s mind.<\/p>\n<p>Pulizzi ran through a few real-world examples. My favorite was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.copyblogger.com\/\">Copyblogger<\/a>, a company which I hadn\u2019t heard of prior but has apparently built their business on content, with 90% of their revenue coming from their blog subscribers. This is pretty impressive, and poking around their site, I can see why. Their blog is attractive, well-written with personality and straightforward language, and there are attractive call-to-actions to subscribe to the blog in some essential parts of their website. So how do they make money exactly? Copyblogger makes money by selling an online marketing platform, so they are essentially a B2B software company, not unlike us here at WordStream. But how is Copyblogger relevant to Pulizzi\u2019s element?<\/p>\n<p>Well, they set out with the goal of capturing blog subscribers, working them down the funnel, and converting them into leads, and clearly their content has been quite successful in doing so.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f290c826-07f6-45e3-a5e0-0630fd9df6a3\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-marketing-tips-copyblogger-1.png\" alt=\"Content marketing tips Copyblogger\" width=\"910\" height=\"623\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Content Marketing Tip #2: Create a Marketing Mission Statement<\/h2>\n<p><em>Thanks for the mind-blowing insight Joe<\/em>&#8230;of course <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/11\/content-marketing-mission-statement\">you need a mission statement<\/a>. This content marketing tip stuck out as a bit obvious, but Pulizzi did hit on some crucial parts of what this statement needs to include.<\/p>\n<p>The most important thing is <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/18\/beginners-guide-to-target-markets\">your audience<\/a>! Pulizzi told us about a humorous time when a customer told him she has 18 personas\u2026really? 18? That is <em>way<\/em> too many! Your audience needs to be summed up by one or two short descriptions. Who are you targeting? Mothers? Entrepreneurs? Architects? Beer-bellied fraternity bros? Whoever it is, figure it out and incorporate them right into your mission statement so your audience knows that you are talking to them.<\/p>\n<p>Your mission statement should also address what will be delivered to your audience, and what the outcome will be. Most important, your mission statement should serve as a guideline to direct all content.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s dissect the following mission statements to see how they incorporate Pulizzi\u2019s principles:<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c98b932f-a8e4-46be-affd-bce4fbb48321\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-marketing-tips-home-made-simple-1.png\" alt=\"Content Marketing Tips Home Made Simple mission statement\" width=\"510\" height=\"436\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Home Made Simple:<\/h3>\n<p><em>&#8220;Enabling women to have more quality time with their family<\/em>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Audience?

Running and growing their businesses<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Personally, I think Inc\u2019s mission statement is strong, but could be simplified. What is important to note is that this statement does not highlight what Inc. or Home Made Simple are selling, but instead focuses on what each company stands for. Your company&#8217;s mission statement should be on every content creator\u2019s mind when writing, but also shared and embraced throughout the entire company (we already know this though, right?).<\/p>\n<h2>Content Marketing Tip #3: Don\u2019t Build a Content Ship on Rented Land<\/h2>\n<p>This Pulizzi point is really focused on subscribers as the most important means of evaluating if your strategy is working or not.<\/p>\n<p>Pulizzi has found this to be the most important metric to analyze, and is baffled by why people hone in on traffic to the site over these loyal content consumers. In reality, even if your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/14\/increase-traffic-to-my-website\">traffic to the site<\/a> is high, it does not mean those visitors are returning anytime soon. A large chunk of them likely took an accidental turn off the wrong exit (think about how many sites you visit and never return to), but subscribers are the people you can actually communicate directly with and influence.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have your subscriber base do some analysis to find what is so different between those who subscribe and those who don\u2019t. For example, subscribers to thinkMoney trade 5X more than their other customers. Getting the right content to the right people is key!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"8f40f746-4a0c-4d5d-887a-2902f0310d17\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-marketing-tips-hubspot-1.png\" alt=\"Content marketing tips HubSpot subscription box\" width=\"392\" height=\"501\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Content Marketing Tip #4: Leverage Influencers That Build an Audience<\/h2>\n<p>This was my favorite Pulizzi point, and something that WordStream founder Larry Kim has drilled into my head time and time again.<\/p>\n<p>Think of your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/26\/influencer-marketing\">influencers<\/a> as the people, blogs, and sites where you target consumers are hanging out. What you need to do is jump in and steal that audience from these influencers and competitors. This sounds a bit scary, right? Well, there are several ways to get your content in front of your target audience without looking like a jerk.<\/p>\n<p>Follow these steps to expand your content reach:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Create an influencer hit list<\/strong>: Pulizzi provided this tip, and it makes sense. You need to know who you are targeting in order to be successful. For example, if you are selling running gear you would ideally want to be picked up by Active.com or RunnersWorld. Put yourself in the shoes of your target buyer and think about where they likely consume content online. Still struggling to build your list? Check out <a href=\"http:\/\/littlebird\">LittleBird<\/a>, software that helps locate the people and content that matter most to your business.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Utilize social media to build relationships with influencers<\/strong>: The great thing about social networks like Twitter and Facebook is that virtually everyone who is anyone is on them (including your audience and influencers).Make online friends with some of your top industry influencers by tweeting out their content, liking their stuff, telling them how great they are, basically just some good, old schmoozing. If you do it enough they will eventually notice, likely follow you, and hopefully notice your awesome content and link out to it or incorporate it into their own content. This will lead to their audience finding you, and becoming a customer (in an ideal world)!Here\u2019s an example below of an article WordStream\u2019s Customer Success Manager, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/erinsagin\">Erin Sagin<\/a>, tweeted linking to an influencer who guest blogged for <a href=\"http:\/\/unbounce.com\/ppc\/common-ppc-mistakes-send-crappy-leads-to-your-landing-page\/\">Unbounce<\/a> where a lot of our current customers (and future customers, we hope) hang out. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0solid advice, especially tip #4!

The path might not be that direct, but it is an easy way to spread your content to a relevant audience.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Content Marketing Tip #5: Open Up Your Wallet<\/h2>\n<p>Alright Pulizzi, not all of us are rolling in dough. But, being in the paid search industry, I have to agree that throwing down some greenbacks is important when it comes to reaching your audience. The world (especially the web) is cluttered with content and marketers can no longer rely on just well-written blog posts or SEO <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/25\/content-marketing-best-practices\">best practices<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s use Facebook as an example. I can still remember the day when building a presence on Facebook just required creating a company page, posting on a regular basis, and promoting through your site or other channels to gain followers. Now, if you are not paying Facebook to advertise, the likelihood of someone stumbling upon your page is pretty much non-existent. Even if you are paying your reach can be fairly limited. Pulizzi highlighted the importance of distribution, which he stated should be 50% of your content marketing strategy.<\/p>\n<p>So where should you spend your money? This of course depends on where your audience is hanging out, but here are a few place to start:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Google AdWords:<\/strong> I\u2019d be willing to wager that your audience searches on Google like the rest of the world, so getting started with paid search is probably a good idea. The issue is staying relevant and targeting your industry niche. Make sure to do your research and actually learn PPC, or you may as well toss your budget into a dumpster. Check out <a href=\"\/learn?camplink=globalnavbar&amp;campname=PPCU\">WordStream\u2019s PPC University<\/a> to get started.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Social media:<\/strong> Each platform is different. For example, Pinterest might not be the best option for an accounting firm, but it would probably knock it out of the park for a cooking or home decor magazine. Check out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.socialmediaexaminer.com\/getting-started\/\">Social Media Examiner\u2019s<\/a> resource guide to determine where to start.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bing:<\/strong> Shockingly enough, <a href=\"\/bing-ads\">Bing Ads<\/a> are responsible for approximately 30% of search engine share, according to recent <a href=\"http:\/\/www.comscore.com\/Insights\/Market-Rankings\/comScore-Releases-August-2014-US-Search-Engine-Rankings\">comScore data<\/a> (this includes searches through Microsoft and Yahoo sites). There are several advantages to advertising on Bing, including typically less competition and therefore less spend, but I always recommend creating a strong account structure in AdWords and running a few successful campaigns before hoping on the Bing bandwagon. Bing is not going to work for every industry, but it can work wonders and is worth trying if you need to widen your reach.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>At the end of Pulizzi\u2019s presentation, I felt like he did an above adequate job of sharing some helpful marketing wisdom in just an hour, but I hope expanding on his points and adding a touch of my opinion and recommendations will help you push your content marketing to the next level.<\/p>\n<p>Have you tried any of these content marketing tips?
