Whether it be all the heavy lifting that goes into an account buildout or hefty clean-up for an account takeover, it\u2019s often clear to clients that they\u2019re getting their money\u2019s worth during the first couple of months.<\/p>\n<p>But then you hit the dreaded plateau that account managers are far too familiar with. Once an account is in good, working condition, it\u2019s nearly impossible to improve at the same rate you were at the outset.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, PPCers know that this is nothing to be alarmed about, but clients rarely share this sentiment. So, how on earth do marketing agencies retain clients for the long haul? The trick is to work on client retention long before you run the first ad and keep at it throughout the relationship.<\/p>\n<p>These 10 tips will help you keep clients around longer so you\u2019re not always refilling the sales pipeline just to stay even.<\/p>\n<h2>What is client retention and how do I measure it?<\/h2>\n<p>Client retention can refer to the actions you take to keep a client on good terms and working with your agency.<\/p>\n<p>Customer retention is also a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/07\/agency-profitability-metrics#:~:text=The%20six%20metrics%20I%E2%80%99m%20going%20to%20cover%20include%3A,you%20identify%20what%20your%20agency%20should%20aim%20for.\">business metric<\/a> that measures the rate at which your agency keeps customers over a given time.<\/p>\n<p>To calculate customer retention, divide the total number of customers at the end of the selected period by the total number of customers at the beginning of the selected period. Don\u2019t forget to account for new customers acquired during the period. We don\u2019t want to count them.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Client-retention-retetion-rate-equation-1.jpg\" alt=\"Customer retention - graphic of the customer retention rate calculation\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-74651 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Client-retention-retetion-rate-equation-1.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Client-retention-retetion-rate-equation-1-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Client retention rate is a great metric to review every month or every quarter. Some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/12\/customer-churn\">customer churn<\/a> happens, but if there\u2019s a decrease in your retention rate, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/08\/reduce-churn\">there\u2019s a problem to address<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Why is client retention so important for your agency?<\/h2>\n<p>If you think of revenue like water, churn is what leaks out of the bucket\u2019s holes and retention is your efforts to stifle the leaks. If your retention efforts fail, you\u2019ll need to pour new sales in the top just to keep from emptying the bucket. And <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/06\/26\/grow-my-agency\">agency growth<\/a> will be nearly impossible.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/client-retention-meme-aquisition.jpg\" alt=\"Client retention - meme showing importance of customer retention\" width=\"522\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-74633 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/client-retention-meme-aquisition.jpg 522w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/client-retention-meme-aquisition-480x551.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 522px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Beyond the soggy sales analogy, poor client retention also hurts your reputation. Unhappy clients often go out into the wild to write poor <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">reviews<\/a> or spread their unhappiness by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/26\/word-of-mouth-marketing\">word of mouth<\/a>. Either way, any one lost customer can cost you many new ones in the future.<\/p>\n<p>And finally, a lack of customer retention can cause your costs to skyrocket. Why? Because closing and onboarding a new client is much more labor intensive than keeping an existing one. So your bottom-line revenue will decrease even if you close enough new deals to maintain your top line.<\/p>\n<h2>10 tips to boost client retention<\/h2>\n<p>Client retention is a full-cycle activity. It starts before you sign a client and continues throughout their engagement with your agency.<\/p>\n<h3>Tip #1: Qualify new clients thoroughly<\/h3>\n<p>Not every deal is a deal worth closing, especially if it turns into a problematic client that churns quickly. So, the first tip to improve client retention is to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/25\/lead-qualification\">qualify prospects<\/a> and filter out the ones with a low chance of success.<\/p>\n<p>To qualify <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/26\/prospecting-strategies-ppc-agencies#:~:text=7%20Prospecting%20Strategies%20for%20PPC%20Agencies%201%201.,partnerships%20...%207%207.%20Keep%20case%20studies%20\">prospects<\/a>, you\u2019ll create a set of characteristics that describe your agency\u2019s ideal client. A few characteristics to consider include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Industry<\/li>\n<li>Company size<\/li>\n<li>Previous experience with paid ads<\/li>\n<li>Advertising budget<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Add to this list by reviewing clients that weren\u2019t successful in the past and looking for common attributes they shared. Maybe you learn that a specific type of B2C client has a high failure rate and should be referred to other agencies in the future.<\/p>\n<h3>Tip #2: Set proper expectations<\/h3>\n<p>If you manage <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/ppc\">PPC marketing<\/a> for any length of time, you know that exponential growth isn\u2019t sustainable forever. Make sure your next client understands the natural ebb and flow of results from paid advertising.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/client-retention-example-report-2.jpg\" alt=\"Client retention - screenshot of a PPC report\" width=\"927\" height=\"506\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-74678 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/client-retention-example-report-2.jpg 927w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/client-retention-example-report-2-480x262.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 927px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>One way to do this is to create an anonymized graph showing typical results over time from your average client. Highlight points along the maturity graph that show the expected bump in initial growth followed by the more stable long-term growth.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond results, you can also set expectations for things like communication frequency, ad content, and ad cost changes. Whatever you feel a previous client has been surprised by could become a point to explain to a new client.<\/p>\n<h3>Tip #3: Provide an excellent onboarding experience<\/h3>\n<p>During client onboarding, you set the stage for the rest of the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/21\/build-client-relationships\"> client-agency relationship<\/a>. If you create the right atmosphere early on, you\u2019ll have a happy client that\u2019s excited to work with you. You\u2019ll also be able to weather future challenges if something goes wrong.<\/p>\n<p>A key function of successful onboarding is the kickoff call. Here are a few actions to take during that call:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduce the client to the person(s) that will manage their ads and communication<\/li>\n<li>Confirm the expectations set during the sales process<\/li>\n<li>Gather or confirm access to accounts, contact details, and communication channels<\/li>\n<li>Review the process or workflow<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>An onboarding questionnaire is also a good option. That\u2019ll give you something to refer to as you start doing the work.<\/p>\n<h3>Tip #4: Understand your clients\u2019 business goals<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s impossible to deliver great results for your clients without having a firm grasp of your client\u2019s business and company goals. That\u2019ll not only help you get better results, but it\u2019ll help you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/30\/ppc-client-business-questions\">answer questions<\/a> in a more relevant way.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/client-retention-meme-dilbert.jpg\" alt=\"Client retention - Dilbert cartoon\" width=\"916\" height=\"339\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-74635 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/client-retention-meme-dilbert.jpg 916w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/client-retention-meme-dilbert-480x178.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 916px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Plus, when you know your client\u2019s company better, you\u2019ll be able to position digital marketing results in the context of their greater business objectives. Your work will carry more weight with their team, and you\u2019ll be better able to retain the client.<\/p>\n<p>You can learn formally, like through a questionnaire, or informally during regular chats. Ask about their competitors, growth, history, and leadership. Then follow them on social media to see what topics consume their focus.<\/p>\n<h3>Tip #5: Get to know your clients personally<\/h3>\n<p>People who manage digital marketing accounts for a living are chameleons of sorts. We\u2019re mathematicians when it comes to bidding strategy, creative writers when it comes to ad copy, and we even channel our inner developer when it comes to setting up tracking codes.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, how often do we think of ourselves as customer service agents? Far too many practitioners overlook this component of the role, which is a hazardous mistake.<\/p>\n<p>Taking the time to get to really know your clients can go a long way. Rather than dreading check-in calls, they\u2019ll look forward to chatting with you and giving you updates on their business. Even more importantly, these personal connections can help to ensure clients stick with you if account performance goes south. They\u2019ll be more likely to be more patient as you work to turn things around and more forgiving about account snafus.<\/p>\n<p>Start small. Get to know your clients\u2019 birthdays and hobbies. Favorite sports teams and foods are other simple topics to discuss. Add that information to their file and review it before calls.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>Use the right words and phrases to connect with your clients.

Through these conversations, they will reveal what\u2019s important to them, giving you the opportunity to pivot your strategy to meet their needs.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/client-retention-meme-communicate.jpg\" alt=\"Client retention - meme featuring the most interesting man in the world.\" width=\"538\" height=\"595\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-74636 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/client-retention-meme-communicate.jpg 538w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/client-retention-meme-communicate-480x531.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 538px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>These meetings are also a perfect opportunity to introduce new strategies and experiments to your clients. If you can establish a sense of trust with the client ahead of time, they\u2019re more likely to be open to trying things when you present new ideas. When you have their buy-in, even if the new approach doesn\u2019t produce the results you had hoped for, they\u2019ll be patient as you work to get performance back on track.<\/p>\n<p>When possible, try to communicate information proactively. Especially if there are changes to things like reports or workflows. Or if you think there may be a temporary blip in results, like a seasonal dip. A little fair warning will head off a negative surprise.<\/p>\n<h3>Tip #7: Open the black box and educate your clients<\/h3>\n<p>Now, most people that hire you don\u2019t want or need to be digital marketing experts (they wouldn\u2019t need you if they did). But there\u2019s plenty of space to explain how a keyword auction works in simple terms.<\/p>\n<p>Why take the time to show your clients behind the advertising curtain? For starters, it\u2019ll make it easier to explain <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/09\/20\/ppc-metrics-ultimate-guide\">analytics<\/a>. With a little foundational context, your clients will be more understanding when January\u2019s leads don\u2019t match July\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p>You also build trust and add value when you\u2019re transparent about your methods. They\u2019ll get a little taste of how much <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/learn\">PPC knowledge<\/a> or marketing expertise goes into your job. That\u2019ll make it easier to retain them as a client if they consider doing it themselves.<\/p>\n<h3>Tip #8: Collect client feedback<\/h3>\n<p>Rather than anxiously wondering whether <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/26\/prospecting-strategies-ppc-agencies\">your clients<\/a> are happy with your services, be straightforward and ask them directly. Not only is this a great opportunity for you to get their feedback on your company\u2019s performance, but it also demonstrates your commitment to giving them a positive experience.<\/p>\n<p>Happy or not, they will appreciate having their voices heard. If they\u2019re happy campers (congrats!), you can rest assured that they\u2019re stable for the time being. If they\u2019re displeased with your services, getting it out in the open is key. Once you know that there is a problem, you can discuss the root of their frustrations and make plans to change things.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/client-retention-net-promoter-score.jpg\" alt=\"client retention for agencies - graphic showing how net promoter score is calculated\" width=\"936\" height=\"501\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-74645\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/client-retention-net-promoter-score.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/client-retention-net-promoter-score-480x257.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a myriad of ways to attain this data. Net Promoter Score (NPS) Surveys are a popular method to ascertain clients\u2019 happiness. NPS is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/10\/customer-loyalty\">customer loyalty<\/a> metric where customers are asked a single question\u2014\u201cHow likely is it that you would recommend [Your Agency] to a friend or colleague?\u201d Their response falls on a scale of one to ten.<\/p>\n<p>Many find that these scores directly correlate with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2010\/05\/25\/lifetime-value-vs-cpa#:~:text=The%20long-term%20value%20of%20a%20customer%20is%20often,you%20can%20really%20afford%20from%20a%20CPA%20basis.\">customer lifetime values<\/a>. If a client responds with a 9 or 10, they\u2019re considered to be a promoter. 7\u2019s and 8\u2019s are neutral, meaning they\u2019re not a high churn risk but definitely need extra attention to get them into the \u201csafe\u201d zone. Anything below a 7 qualifies the customer as a detractor and it\u2019s important to immediately develop an action plan to get them back on the right track.<\/p>\n<p>While it\u2019s useful to capture this data, the best thing about these surveys is they spark conversations about how the client is feeling and what you can do to better serve them.<\/p>\n<h3>Tip #9: Prove your success with regular reporting<\/h3>\n<p>One of the best ways to retain a client is to prove your progress with cold, hard numbers.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/07\/ppc-reporting\">reporting<\/a> is a common client retention tactic for most agencies. In fact, you probably have this baked into the contract for your services. The problem is, far too many miss the mark with their reports.<\/p>\n<p>The challenge is making reports that are client focused. Your clients are not likely to be well-versed in digital marketing terminology. Even if they\u2019ve picked up the basic lingo, they may not understand how each metric interacts with one another. So, your reports should help them connect the dots.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/client-retention-example-report.jpg\" alt=\"Client retention - Screenshot of a LocaliQ analytics dashboard\" width=\"451\" height=\"596\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-74638 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/client-retention-example-report.jpg 451w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/client-retention-example-report-227x300.jpg 227w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A good report should be both easily consumable and relevant to the client. Understand the KPIs that matter to them first. Then tie the data in your reports to their objectives.<\/p>\n<h3>Tip #10: Know your competitors<\/h3>\n<p>There are many digital marketing agencies out there. You can\u2019t know each one by heart. But you can regularly review a handful of ads, websites, and offerings to see how you stack up.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say there\u2019s a new trend to bill in a different way for clients in your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/28\/niche-marketing\">niche market<\/a>. You could lose new clients if you\u2019re not addressing it in your own client plans.<\/p>\n<p>A simple way to see what your clients are up to is to conduct a simple Google search.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/client-retention-example-search-ads.jpg\" alt=\"Client retention - screenshot of Google ads on a search page\" width=\"936\" height=\"496\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-74639 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/client-retention-example-search-ads.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/client-retention-example-search-ads-480x254.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll quickly see how your competitors define their services and if they\u2019re promoting a special price. Then poke around a couple of their websites and even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/09\/competitor-keywords\">deconstruct their keyword strategy<\/a> in Ahrefs, Spyfu, or SEMRush.<\/p>\n<h2>Client retention should be a constant<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s a certain excitement that comes from signing a new client. That\u2019s why so many agencies put a lot of energy into customer acquisition\u2014even though it\u2019s resource intensive.<\/p>\n<p>While retaining a customer might not deliver the same high, it certainly delivers an outsized benefit to your agency.
