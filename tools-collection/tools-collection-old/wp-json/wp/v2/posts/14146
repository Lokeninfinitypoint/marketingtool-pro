That&#8217;s the principle that Google was built on.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/image-seo-1_0.png\" alt=\"Image SEO\" width=\"800\" height=\"587\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Page A has more links from pages of similar quality than Page B; thus, it has more ranking authority. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>The quality and quantity of a page\u2019s inbound links are known as \u201coff-page\u201d SEO. But there are also a wide range of on-page SEO factors, including image SEO. And that&#8217;s the focus on our article today.<\/p>\n<h2>What is image SEO?<\/h2>\n<p>Image SEO is the process of optimizing the images on your website so they are easy for search engines to &#8220;read&#8221; and find, consequently improving the visibility and rankings of your content in Google and other search engines. Image SEO includes elements like image type, size, and load time and your usage and optimization of alt text and keywords in image file names.<\/p>\n<p>Image SEO is one of the more often overlooked elements of on-page SEO, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not important. In fact, if you\u2019re not careful, poor image SEO can do a heck of a job of sinking your page\u2019s ability to gain links, rise in the index, and, ultimately, drive valuable organic traffic.<\/p>\n<p>The good news: You can make a huge impact on your image SEO with just a few steps:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use a compressor to reduce image sizes<\/li>\n<li>Serve images in recommended, next gen formats<\/li>\n<li>Scale your images to work with your website<\/li>\n<li>Create original, linkable image assets<\/li>\n<li>Optimize your image titles, captions, and alt text<\/li>\n<li>Make your images shareable<\/li>\n<li>Try lazy loading for images<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s discuss these in a little more detail. Here are our top seven must-implement image SEO tips to make sure your images are fully optimized for search.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Use a compressor to reduce image sizes<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-increase-website-speed\">Site speed<\/a> has the single biggest of impact of image SEO on a page\u2019s overall ability to rank and gain traffic. It\u2019s huge\u2014site speed not only impacts a user\u2019s ability to move from page to page along your conversion path; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/01\/22\/google-speed-update\">it\u2019s also an active ranking factor<\/a>. If your pages are slow, Google is not going to look upon them favorably. \u00a0That\u2019s where image compression comes in.<\/p>\n<p>You may or not be familiar with <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/speed\/pagespeed\/insights\/\">PageSpeed Insights<\/a>. It is super handy. Enter any URL on your website, and Google gives you an in-depth assessment of the elements that are hindering that page\u2019s speed. Run a few of these tests, and you\u2019ll start to notice a common theme.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/image-seo.jpg\" alt=\"Image SEO Compressor\" width=\"874\" height=\"398\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Improperly sized images are often the primary inhibitor of page speed. And because image SEO and page speed are inextricably linked, image compression is a crucial aspect of image SEO.<\/p>\n<p>Simply expand the requisite tab in your PageSpeed Insights reports and you will see the images that represent the biggest offenders on your page. You\u2019ll also see how much space you stand to save if you compress them. You can use a tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/tinypng.com\/\">TinyPNG<\/a> to quickly compress images one at a time\u2014or, depending on your CMS, you can use various plugins\/tools specifically geared for your site (think Smush for WordPress) to bulk compress all the images on your site.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Upload images in next gen formats<\/h2>\n<p>Another common recommendation you\u2019ll see cropping up in your PageSpeed Insights report? \u201cServe images in next-gen formats.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/image-seo-next-gen.jpg\" alt=\"Image SEO Next Gen\" width=\"874\" height=\"398\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The formats we\u2019re talking about here are JPEG 2000, JPG XR, and WebP. If you\u2019ve never heard of any of them, don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re not in the know\u2014they\u2019re not as ubiquitous as JPG or PNG. But while JPG and PNG are still the dominant image formats, next-gen formats like JPEG 2000 truly are superior. Encoding your images in these formats instead of the old formats helps ensure faster load times and less data usage on mobile.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to start serving images in next-gen formats, there are plenty of <a href=\"https:\/\/mygeodata.cloud\/converter\/jpeg-to-jpeg2000\">free online converters<\/a> that will help you do so.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Scale your images to work with your website<\/h2>\n<p>Proper image size (and we\u2019re talking dimensions here, not file size) is going to vary depending on your CMS, as well as the format of the page on which you\u2019re uploading the image. Look up dimension best practices for your CMS (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.shopify.com\/guides\/product-photography\/saving-images\">Shopify<\/a>, for instance, recommends using 2048 x 2048 pixels for square product photos) <em>before <\/em>uploading your images. An image that looks like it fits nicely with your content \u2026<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/image-seo-blog.png\" alt=\"Image SEO Blog\" width=\"746\" height=\"474\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u2026 might actually have been automatically resized by your CMS to fit. This resizing corrects the dimension for display\u2014this will <em>not <\/em>reduce the file size. And generally speaking, <strong>images with more pixels will have greater file sizes. <\/strong>That means that the surest way to make sure that you\u2019re using the correct images sizes is to get a handle on your site\u2019s optimal image size and then crop images before you upload them. If that sounds like an arduous process\u2014well, it can be if you\u2019re getting images from around the web. But if you\u2019re downloading stock images, or outsourcing product images to a designer, you\u2019ll do well to find a standard size that\u2019s geared for your specific site.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Create original image content<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/22\/stock-photos-for-ads\">Stock photos<\/a> are easy for sizing\u2014most of the images you\u2019ll download from Adobe Stock or Shutterstock or other vendors are going to come in sizes that are friendly to most sites. But <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/22\/best-practices-stock-photos\">stock photos<\/a> aren\u2019t always as effective as original, branded creative. Curated graphs based upon in-house data or high-quality shots of your product in action, on the other hand\u2014these are the kinds of images that get shared on social media and searched for with <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/websearch\/answer\/1325808?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en\">reverse image searches<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/image-seo-benchmarks.jpg\" alt=\"Image SEO Bing\" width=\"583\" height=\"580\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Most importantly: <strong>Unique, compelling images are necessary to make your page original and valuable for your user. <\/strong>And time and time again, when the experts at Google are asked for a prescription for strong SEO, or for a response to a particular shift in Google\u2019s algorithm that has caused a drop in rankings, they say this: Create pages that are above all <em>valuable <\/em>for your audience. That means using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/01\/content-marketing-images\">images<\/a> that will help users get the best experience possible from your pages.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Use titles, captions, and alt text liberally<\/h2>\n<p>When Google is determining which image to return for an image query, it has access to a limited amount of information. Less information, at any rate, than it has access to when it is indexing whole pages. For image SEO, that means you need to be giving Google all the information you can about your image in the space you\u2019re allotted. There are three primary places to do this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Alt text: <\/strong>Alt text is helpful from a user experience standpoint for people using screenreaders or if your server gets tripped up and can\u2019t load the image (the alt text will still show on the page).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/AltTextinChrome.jpg\" alt=\"Alt Text Image SEO\" width=\"324\" height=\"328\" \/><\/div>\n<p>But in terms of <em>ranking<\/em>, alt text is the primary means by which Google <strong>understands what your image is<\/strong>\u2014so, naturally, it\u2019s huge. As a best practice, include the page\u2019s target keyword and any ancillary keywords that might apply to a specific image, and omit anything language that is not descriptive (articles, etc.)<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Titles: <\/strong>There has been much debate over whether image titles are necessary in conjunction with alt text. But they <em>are <\/em>ranking factors, insofar as Google <em>does <\/em>use them when determining the order in which to provide images in image search.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Captions: <\/strong>Here\u2019s what <a>Google\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/114016?hl=en\">has to say<\/a> about captions: \u201cGoogle extracts information about the subject matter of the image from the content of the page, including\u00a0captions\u00a0and image titles.\u201d So, essentially, placing your image near <strong>relevant <\/strong>text is going to help Google determine what that image is. Using captions are a bulletproof way to make sure <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/01\/23\/google-image-search-traffic\">your image is described adequately and in context<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>6. Ensure seamless social sharing<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s talk about Open Graph tags and\/or Twitter Cards. These are tags within your page\u2019s HTML that ensure when someone shares that page on Facebook or Twitter, images and descriptive snippets are displayed correctly. Naturally, this is huge if you want your images to gain steam on social media and drive traffic and strong social signals <em>back <\/em>to your site.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/image-seo-open-graph.png\" alt=\"Image SEO Open Graph\" width=\"660\" height=\"208\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You can search for these elements in your source code if you\u2019re not sure if they\u2019re there. You can also try mock posting your page on either Twitter or Facebook to make sure the post is populating correctly. It\u2019s the difference between showing your friends and followers a one-off link, and showing them a big, clickable image card with a description about your page.<\/p>\n<p>Implementing Open Graph tags will again depend on your CMS. If you\u2019re using BigCommerce, for instance, you\u2019ll find open graph fields in all of your product listings on the back end (inconveniently, you won\u2019t find one on your home page).<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/image-seo-og.png\" alt=\"Image SEO BigCommerce\" width=\"545\" height=\"325\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If you\u2019re using WordPress, you\u2019ll find these fields in Yoast (a really super SEO plugin for WordPress users). It\u2019s a good idea to go through your most traffic-heavy and business-valuable pages and make sure they\u2019re all equally shareable on social.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Give lazy loading a try<\/h2>\n<p>Aside from having a catchy name, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/08\/lazy-loading-seo\">lazy loading<\/a> can go a long ways in increasing page speed by <strong>not loading below the fold images until your users scrolls down to them. <\/strong>Take it from <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/web\/fundamentals\/performance\/lazy-loading-guidance\/images-and-video\/\">Google<\/a>: <em>Lazy loading can significantly speed up loading on long pages that include many images below the fold by loading them either as needed or when the primary content has finished loading and rendering. <\/em>That\u2019s about as good an endorsement as you can get.<\/p>\n<p>Google <em>also <\/em>endorses lazy loading in its very own PageSpeed Insights. You may run into this recommendation when you\u2019re running page speed analysis on your own site.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/lazy-loading-pagespeed-insights.jpg\" alt=\"Lazy Loading Image SEO\" width=\"893\" height=\"140\" \/><\/div>\n<p>That is Google telling you that, in this scenario, lazy loading can be an asset. If you\u2019re a WordPress user, there are a few lazy-loading plugins worth checking out. For all other users, check out Google\u2019s guidelines on the subject <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/web\/fundamentals\/performance\/lazy-loading-guidance\/images-and-video\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Image SEO: don&#8217;t skimp on it!<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve given you seven low-hanging image SEO action items to implement on your site. Keep in mind that you don\u2019t to use all of these, but you should certainly do all you can to use as many of these tips as you can with the time and expertise you have at your disposal. For instance, you may be uncomfortable hard coding Open Graph tags, but everyone can add search-friendly alt text or use a free tool to compress images effectively. Decide what\u2019s most important and most feasible for your strategy and go from there!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Image SEO is an important on-page SEO factor that can help make your site more visible in organic search.
