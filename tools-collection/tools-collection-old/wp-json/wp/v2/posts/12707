A not-so-gratifying ending to HBO\u2019s <em>Game of Thrones <\/em>inspired dozens of memes and weeks of animated office chatter. 17-year-old Billie Eilish attracted the biggest crowd <em>ever<\/em> in the 65-year history of the renowned Reading Festival. The day before Halloween, the Washington Nationals pulled off an incredible Game 7 comeback to secure the first World Series title in franchise history.<\/p>\n<p>Alas, we\u2019re not here to talk about TV, music, or sports. We\u2019re here, of course, to talk about online advertising. More specifically, we\u2019re here to break down <strong>the 11 biggest updates and innovations brought to Google Ads this year. <\/strong>With everything from the retirement of an OG search metric to the introduction of brand new audiences, 2019 has given us no shortage of topics to discuss. Without further ado, let\u2019s jump in.<\/p>\n<h2>1. The retirement of average position<\/h2>\n<p>February brought the first of two Google Ads bombshells announced in 2019: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/27\/google-sunsets-average-position\">the retirement of average position<\/a>. One of the original search advertising metrics, average position\u2014which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/14\/goodbye-average-position\">officially bit the dust<\/a> at the end of September\u2014was a basic indicator of auction performance.<\/p>\n<p>Your bid and your Quality Score determine your Ad Rank, right? And your Ad Rank, in turn, determines where your ad lands in the paid search results\u2014it determines your ad\u2019s <strong>position<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"fadd1edc-a1fc-4a81-8362-e5b388226460\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-position-bid-illustration.png\" alt=\"Advertise on Google AdWords bidding \" width=\"544\" height=\"244\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Here\u2019s the catch: Ad position refers to <strong>order<\/strong>, not <strong>location<\/strong>. Just because you win the auction and obtain the first position, doesn\u2019t mean your ad is shown at the top of the SERP; it could be shown <em>underneath <\/em>the organic results. Average position, evidently, fails to tell the whole story.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, Google decided to retire the metric in favor of the newer, more precise ones that were rolled out at the end of 2018: top impression rate, top impression share, etc. Reactions from PPC professionals ran the gamut, but the consensus seemed to be this: As <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/19\/google-ads-automated-bidding\">automated bid solutions<\/a> become more and more prominent, manual bid-to-position strategies become less and less useful.<\/p>\n<h2>2. The evolution of phrase match &amp; broad match modifier<\/h2>\n<p>Bombshell #2: At the end of July, Google announced that phrase match and broad match modifier keywords are now <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/31\/phrase-match-broad-match-modifier-close-variants\">eligible to show for same-meaning close variants<\/a> such as synonyms and paraphrases. Prior to this announcement, the only close variants that could trigger a phrase match or broad match modifier keyword were plurals and misspellings.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"741b65a5-10b8-4bd7-84c7-f45c93cd981a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/phrase-match-broad-match-modifier-close-variants-query-examples_0.png\" alt=\"phrase-match-broad-match-modifier-close-variants-example-queries\" width=\"716\" height=\"122\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Via Google.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In case you\u2019re prone to getting mixed up by things like match types and close variants, here\u2019s a quick breakdown:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>phrase match keyword<\/strong> matches to queries that include the entirety of the keyword <em>in its specified order<\/em>. For example, \u201cwomen\u2019s hair salon\u201d is eligible to match to queries like \u201cboston women\u2019s hair salon\u201d and \u201cbest women\u2019s hair salon.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>A <strong>broad match modifier keyword<\/strong> matches to queries that include each term specified in the keyword <em>in any order<\/em>. For example, +women +hair +salon is eligible to match to queries like \u201chair salon for women\u201d and \u201cbest hair salon for women in boston.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Prior to the update, an ad targeting the phrase match keyword \u201cwomen\u2019s hair salon\u201d could show for queries like \u201cwomen\u2019s hair salons\u201d and \u201cwomen\u2019s hir salon.\u201d <em>Following <\/em>the update, that same keyword can now show for queries like \u201cwomen\u2019s hair dresser\u201d and \u201cwomen\u2019s hair parlor.\u201d Why? Because they\u2019re both <strong>same-meaning close variants. <\/strong>The same goes for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/03\/22\/modified-broad-match-for-beginners\">broad match modifier<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s defense? The intent <em>behind <\/em>a query matters more than the semantics <em>within <\/em>a query. Plus, it\u2019s impossible to predict every single variant of each keyword you\u2019re targeting. As long as you keep a close eye on your search term report, add negatives as necessary, and use your ad copy to speak to your prospects\u2019 needs, you should be fine.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Brand new audiences for search advertising<\/h2>\n<p>With the two bombshells out of the way, let\u2019s shift gears and talk about the unambiguously <em>good <\/em>news that Google announced in the middle of October: the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/18\/new-google-search-audience-targeting-options\">search network debut<\/a> of <strong>affinity audiences <\/strong>and <strong>seasonal event segments for in-market audiences<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h3>Affinity audiences<\/h3>\n<p>As those of you familiar with display advertising already know, an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/23\/custom-affinity-audiences\">affinity audience<\/a> is a group of consumers who have all demonstrated an interest in (or affinity for) a particular topic. On the back end, Google is able to create these audiences by looking at factors like search history and frequently visited web pages.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"26dece5d-8e7f-4af8-b4ac-4d981d01d5ee\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-updates-new-search-audiences.jpg\" alt=\"affinity audiences for search\" width=\"709\" height=\"597\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>By layering affinity audiences on top of your keywords, you\u2019ll be able to refine your search campaigns and focus on the prospects who are <em>truly <\/em>interested in what you\u2019re selling. For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re a marketer at a company that sells all-natural cosmetics. Traditionally, you\u2019d reach relevant consumers by targeting keywords like \u201corganic makeup.\u201d Going forward, you\u2019ll be able to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/04\/adwords-roi\">increase ROI<\/a> by layering the Beauty &amp; Wellness affinity audience <em>on top <\/em>of those keywords. Pretty neat, huh?<\/p>\n<h3>Seasonal event segments for in-market audiences<\/h3>\n<p>Over the past couple years, few tools have helped search advertisers boost their conversion rates like <strong>in-market audiences<\/strong>. With an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/31\/in-market-audiences-for-search\">in-market audience<\/a>, you can limit the reach of your ads <em>exclusively <\/em>to the users who are actively searching for a product or service like yours.<\/p>\n<p>If I spend months on end searching queries like \u201cused honda sedan\u201d and visiting websites like Cars.com, it\u2019s safe to assume that Google will place me in the Autos &amp; Vehicles in-market audience. As a result, car dealers and insurance providers can easily connect with consumers like me\u2014consumers who are clearly interested in purchasing a car or something car-related.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"0c11ae9c-7128-46bf-8655-591606ee6335\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-updates-new-search-audiences-event-segments.jpg\" alt=\"event segments for in-market audiences\" width=\"800\" height=\"531\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Just in time for the holiday season, <strong>seasonal event segments <\/strong>will allow you to connect with consumers who are actively researching a product or service <em>in preparation <\/em>for a specific occasion. Because you know <em>why <\/em>the consumers grouped in a particular segment are looking for a business like yours, you\u2019ll be able to refine your messaging like never before.<\/p>\n<h2>4. A long-awaited audience expansion tool<\/h2>\n<p>Speaking of audiences, let\u2019s move on to what I thought was the most exciting announcement from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/14\/google-marketing-live\">Google Marketing Live 2019<\/a>: the <strong>audience expansion tool. <\/strong>Much like a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/facebook-lookalike-audiences\">Facebook lookalike audience<\/a>, the audience expansion tool allows you to grow your display campaigns by reaching new prospects who behave similarly to the users you\u2019re already targeting\u2014i.e., boost impressions, clicks, and conversions without touching your budget.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"556406ab-3144-4917-be9b-73f92843c066\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-updates-audience-expansion-tool.jpg\" alt=\"audience expansion tool\" width=\"761\" height=\"224\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>If, somehow, you\u2019re not already sold, consider the alternative: Throwing more money at your existing audience and hoping it does the trick. Although this strategy absolutely works from time to time, it\u2019s not exactly sustainable. And while I\u2019m not an advocate for putting blind trust in machine learning, Facebook has proved that the lookalike concept works\u2014and works <em>well.<\/em> At the very least, that should encourage you to take the audience expansion tool for a spin.<\/p>\n<h2>5. The retirement of accelerated delivery<\/h2>\n<p>Although I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to call this story a <em>bombshell<\/em>, the second major Google Ads retirement of 2019 definitely sparked some conversation. Back in August, Google announced that, as of October 7, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/21\/google-sunsets-accelerated-delivery\">accelerated delivery is no longer available<\/a> for search and Shopping campaigns. (It remains available for display and video campaigns.) Since that sunset date, search and Shopping advertisers have had no choice but to opt for standard delivery.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Standard delivery: <\/strong>Google spreads the delivery of your ads over the course of the entire day (or over the course of the schedule you\u2019ve set).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Accelerated delivery: <\/strong>Google enters your ads into every auction for which they\u2019re eligible until your daily budget runs out.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3850c8cd-f3aa-47c2-b3e4-40a6f2951023\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-updates-accelerated-delivery.jpg\" alt=\"Google Ads accelerated delivery\" width=\"800\" height=\"383\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The following was Google\u2019s logic (which, for the record, I agree with): For a small or midsize business working with a limited daily budget, accelerated delivery is <strong>not <\/strong>cost-effective. Because auction prices fluctuate throughout the day, it\u2019s often best for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/06\/small-marketing-budget\">small-budget advertisers<\/a> to opt for standard delivery and capitalize on as many low-cost opportunities as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of your budget, however, there were valid use cases for accelerated delivery. If your Quality Score for a given keyword were lagging behind, for example, accelerated delivery could function as a gas pedal of sorts\u2014a way to get in front of prospects nonetheless. If you\u2019ve found yourself missing accelerated delivery, we recommend using positive bid adjustments for early times of day to (at least partially) make up for its absence.<\/p>\n<h2>6. The introduction of lead form ad extensions<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/13\/google-ads-mobile-benchmarks\">Numbers don\u2019t lie<\/a>: Thanks to small screens and low levels of patience (among other things), getting users to convert from their smartphones and tablets is no easy task.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4f41193f-2a98-4312-8dab-68423e63ced1\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google_mobile_benchmarks_CVR_small.png\" alt=\"Google Ads Mobile Benchmarks Average CVR\" width=\"900\" height=\"1000\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Good news for all you lead gen advertisers out there: In an effort to help you drive more conversions from your mobile search ads, Google recently unveiled the brand new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/31\/google-lead-form-extensions\">lead form ad extension<\/a>. With a lead form ad extension\u2014which is <em>not<\/em>, as of now, available for desktop advertisements\u2014you can collect your prospects\u2019 contact information without asking them to leave the SERP. To put it more succinctly: Begone, friction!<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"86ba50d8-cfba-4e81-803c-30e539725119\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-lead-form-extensions.gif\" alt=\"Google lead form extensions\" width=\"720\" height=\"1400\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>By allowing users on smartphones and tablets to fill out your form without navigating your (potentially slow) mobile website, the lead form ad extension promises to do wonders for your mobile <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/19\/conversion-rate-benchmarks\">conversion rates<\/a>. Best of all: If a user is signed into their Google account at the time they see your ad, clicking on the extension will bring them to a Google-hosted form that\u2019s already pre-populated with their contact information. At the time of this writing, the beta version is rolling out to search advertisers everywhere.<\/p>\n<h2>7. The arrival of campaign-level conversions<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s return to Google Marketing Live for a moment. Although this year\u2019s conference was jam-packed with innovations related to Smart Bidding\u2014Google\u2019s suite of automated solutions that use machine learning to optimize your bids for specific conversion goals\u2014one of them, in my opinion, stood out from the rest: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/15\/campaign-level-conversions\">campaign-level conversions<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As many of you already know, <a href=\"https:\/\/hq.wordstream.com\/s\/article\/what-is-conversion-tracking\">conversion tracking<\/a> is an essential part of any successful Google Ads account. By setting up conversion tracking, you let Google know which user actions are most valuable to your business. As your account drives more and more activity and Google begins to collect substantial conversion data, their algorithms become better equipped to optimize toward your account goals.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"bf9d049f-4043-47a1-983c-5d9bebe20510\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/campaign-level-conversions-tracking-google-ads.jpg\" alt=\"conversion tracking in Google Ads\" width=\"780\" height=\"214\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>I repeat: Their algorithms become better equipped to optimize toward your <strong>account<\/strong> goals. Prior to Google Marketing Live, there was no way to designate which specific conversion goal is most valuable to a <em>particular campaign<\/em>. Let\u2019s say you built a brand new search campaign with the intent of increasing free trials. If someone were to click on one of the ads within that campaign and convert in a way <em>other <\/em>than a free trial (e.g., a newsletter sign-up), their action would still be counted as a conversion\u2014even though counting it is actually detrimental to that campaign.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a90b2f52-71b5-4a52-9a0e-2f2cd10fef8f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/campaign-level-conversion-setting.jpg\" alt=\"new campaign-level conversion setting\" width=\"785\" height=\"104\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Now, with campaign-level conversions, you can tell Google, \u201cHey! This campaign right here? I only care about free trials. That\u2019s the only conversion goal you should track and optimize for. The other goals I\u2019ve specified in my account <em>do not matter <\/em>for this campaign.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s some automation I can get behind.<\/p>\n<h2>8. A bumper ad creator for everyone<\/h2>\n<p>While we\u2019ve got Google Marketing Live on the mind, let\u2019s take a minute to talk about the <strong>bumper machine<\/strong>\u2014a tool unveiled at the conference that allows anyone with a video shorter than 90 seconds to create a series of YouTube-ready bumper ads.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you\u2019re unfamiliar with the term \u201cbumper ad,\u201d it\u2019s practically guaranteed that you\u2019ve encountered one at some point or another: They\u2019re the six-second ads that play before YouTube videos. According to data presented by Google at this year\u2019s conference, a series of three bumper ads leaves a greater impression on consumers than a single 30-second ad does.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"videos\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_video\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"38739bac-d2f2-4392-b5a8-60716e084097\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/FMqmH3BdMBU?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The problem? Few small businesses have the resources to produce sleek, professional videos. Even if a business <em>does <\/em>have video assets, they\u2019re typically in the range of one or two minutes long. Unless you\u2019re a wizard of some sort, it\u2019s impossible to turn a 90-second video into an engaging, logical bumper ad.<\/p>\n<p>It <em>was<\/em> impossible, I should say. With the bumper machine\u2014free to all advertisers\u2014anyone with a relatively short video can create a series of six-second YouTube ads <em>just like that<\/em>. Considering <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brandwatch.com\/blog\/youtube-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how much time everyone spends on YouTube<\/a> nowadays, how can you pass that up?<\/p>\n<h2>9. User-generated images in Shopping reviews<\/h2>\n<p>I\u2019m no retail expert, but I\u2019m fairly confident I know <em>one <\/em>of the major reasons why people still like to shop in brick-and-mortar stores: <strong>the ability to touch and try on different products<\/strong>. When I go to H&amp;M and try on a pair of pants, I\u2019m instantly able to picture myself wearing them in different settings\u2014at the bar with my friends, walking down the street with <em>Tha Carter III <\/em>blasting in my ears, and so on. By allowing customers to get a sense of how their products will impact day-to-day life, brick-and-mortar retailers have a big advantage over ecommerce businesses.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why Google\u2019s bringing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/16\/user-generated-images-google-shopping-reviews\">user-generated images<\/a>\u2014i.e., authentic pictures taken by your happy, loyal customers\u2014to Google Shopping reviews.

Videos in responsive display ads<\/h2>\n<p>Since their debut earlier this decade, there\u2019s been no denying the power of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/23\/responsive-display-ads\">responsive display ads<\/a>\u2014the dynamic, eye-grabbing units that Google automatically optimizes according to web page content and user screen size. For anyone who doesn\u2019t know, here\u2019s how they work: You write some copy and submit a few visual assets; then, Google\u2019s algorithms determine which copy\/imagery combination is most suitable depending on the factors mentioned above.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"98c83a1d-d744-4fbd-a57e-72f199f8cf7f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-updates-responsive-display-ads.jpg\" alt=\"responsive display ads\" width=\"603\" height=\"596\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Prior to this spring, \u201cvisual assets\u201d meant still images and GIFs.

Here\u2019s three reasons why taking advantage of this update is a stellar idea:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>More impressions: <\/strong>Google <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/24\/responsive-vs-legacy-display\">prefers responsive display ads<\/a> over standard banner ads.<\/li>\n<li><strong>More clicks: <\/strong>Responsive display ads\u2014especially those that feature video content\u2014are more engaging than standard banner ads.<\/li>\n<li><strong>More accessibility: <\/strong>Unlike standard banner ads\u2014which take time, resources, and expertise to continually optimize\u2014responsive display ads are semi-automated.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>11. Gallery ads<\/h2>\n<p>Last but certainly not least, we\u2019ve got <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/16\/gallery-ads\">gallery ads<\/a>\u2014the brand new mobile ad type unveiled at Google Marketing Live and currently available as a beta among select advertisers. Here\u2019s the example Google distributed on the day of the announcement:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4a51f85a-d370-4f24-83a4-2244f174f2fe\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/gallery-ads-devour-example-1.png\" alt=\"devour-foods-gallery-ad\" width=\"662\" height=\"640\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>As you can see, a gallery ad\u2014which, when triggered, appears at the top of the SERP\u2014features a swipeable carousel of up to eight unique images. Above the carousel is a clickable headline and a display URL, and below each image is a brief caption. Once you have access to gallery ads, you\u2019ll be able to submit three unique headlines for each ad, thus giving you the power to test out different combinations of value props and CTAs.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s early tests indicated that gallery ads drive 25% more engagement (as measured by clicks and swipes) than standard text ads do. Here\u2019s my theory: Although words alone are good at communicating value, words and images <em>paired together <\/em>are even better. To see what I mean, take a look at this typical text ad from one of Devour\u2019s competitors.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7e2ea1ac-f144-4dec-815b-0a642c837250\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/gallery-ads-standard-text-ad-example.png\" alt=\"gallery-ads-text-ad\" width=\"593\" height=\"160\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>A bad ad? Not at all. Nonetheless, you\u2019ve got to ask yourself a question: If you were in the market for ready-made frozen dinners, which would be more likely to persuade you\u2014Devour\u2019s gallery ad, or Marie Callender\u2019s text ad? I don\u2019t know how your brain works, but if you\u2019re like me, the ad with the carousel of mouth-watering images is going to win every single time. Science backs me up: The human brain processes images <a href=\"http:\/\/www.t-sciences.com\/news\/humans-process-visual-data-better\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">60,000<\/a> times faster than text, and consumers are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/3035856\/why-were-more-likely-to-remember-content-with-images-and-video-infogr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more likely<\/a> to retain content that incorporates visual imagery.<\/p>\n<p>My advice? Adopt gallery ads as soon as you possibly can.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google made a lot of changes in 2019\u2014but for advertisers, some of the updates and innovations were more important than others.
