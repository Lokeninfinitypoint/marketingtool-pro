In this article, we&#8217;re covering everything you need to know about LSAs to make the most of them for your business.<\/p>\n<h3>Contents<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#definition\">What are Google Local Services Ads?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#industries\">What businesses can run Google LSAs?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#benefits\">Google Local Services Ads benefits<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#howto\">How to get started with Google LSAs<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#tips\">Tips for effective Local Services Ads<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"definition\"><\/div>\n<h2>What are Google Local Services Ads?<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/local-services-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Local Services Ads<\/a> allow service-based businesses to run ads meant to generate leads directly on the search results page. Rather than linking to a landing page like traditional Google Ads, LSAs are meant to drive calls, form fills, messages, or appointment bookings directly from the ad. Specific industries such as locksmiths, plumbers, garage door professionals, electricians, lawyers, real estate agents, and many more can take advantage of this Google Ads type.<\/p>\n<p>When a searcher enters a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/01\/google-local-search-trends\">local search<\/a> query, they may see several trusted professionals in their area positioned right above the traditional paid search ads; these ads show a business number, hours, ratings, and reviews.<\/p>\n<p>For example, an LSA might look like this:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-248583 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/google-local-services-ad-verified-badge-ad-example-png-e1760120783229.webp\" alt=\"google local services ad - screenshot of lsa with verified badge example\" width=\"512\" height=\"684\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Upon clicking on a local advertiser\u2019s listing, Google prompts them to confirm the job they\u2019re looking for as well as their service area. If you fit the job and serve that area, you\u2019ll be matched to the searcher, and they\u2019ll be able to review your qualifications, ratings, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/16\/get-more-google-reviews\">Google reviews<\/a> before contacting you.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re <em>not<\/em> a good fit for their job or you don\u2019t serve their region, then Google will save you the costs and burdens and will connect them to a more appropriate Local Services Ad.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s Local Services Ads display on desktop, tablet, and mobile searches; they also have reach beyond traditional search ads.<\/p>\n<p>Local Services Ads are featured in the Google Assistant\u2019s response to relevant <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/14\/google-voice-search\">voice search<\/a> queries!

Let&#8217;s review some of the benefits of this specific ad type.<\/p>\n<h3>Advertisers pay per lead\u2013not click!<\/h3>\n<p>PPC advertisers know the pain of paying for a click that isn\u2019t a good fit or doesn\u2019t convert\u2014especially for businesses with high average costs per click, like attorneys and dentists. Google\u2019s Local Services Ads help connect the right job to the right advertiser and prevent the job mismatch that often happens when a user searches for broad terms for a very specific job or for an area outside your service zone.<\/p>\n<p>Businesses running Local Services Ads are <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adwords\/answer\/7195435?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6224863&amp;visit_id=1-636637313008159834-1013385142&amp;rd=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">only charged for valid leads<\/a>, and depending on the job and the market, these can end up being even lower than the average cost per lead for search ads in your industry. If you receive a lead that is either fraudulent, spam, or a poor match, you can even dispute the charge for credit.<\/p>\n<p>Plus,\u00a0the Google Local Services Ads average cost per lead is about $60\u2014which is significantly lower than the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/search-advertising-benchmarks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search ad benchmark average cost per lead<\/a> of $70.11.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/2025-GA-Benchmarks-CPL-871x1024.webp\" alt=\"2025 google ads benchmarks - cost per lead\" width=\"871\" height=\"1024\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91516 size-large\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong><span data-contrast=\"auto\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" lang=\"EN-US\" class=\"TextRun SCXW153089153 BCX0\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW153089153 BCX0\">\ud83d\udca1<\/span><\/span>Find out how your search costs can compare to your current LSA costs<\/strong> using our latest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/google-ads-industry-benchmarks?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2025GoogleAdsBenchmarks_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search ads industry benchmarks<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h3>Gain trust with the Google Verified badge<\/h3>\n<p>When eligible, the Google Verified badge will automatically appear on your LSAs, adding an extra dose of credibility. Before October 20, 2025, LSAs used to have multiple different badges (like the Google Guarantee) depending on their industry and <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/localservices\/answer\/6226575?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">level of verification<\/a>. However, that has since changed, and all LSAs will now have <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/business\/community-guide\/366556199\/upcoming-changes-to-local-services-ads-google-guarantee-badges?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the new Google Verified badge<\/a> instead.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-248569 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/google-local-service-ads-google-verified-badge.webp\" alt=\"google local service ads - google verified badge\" width=\"523\" height=\"600\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This Google Verified badge is meant to provide a more consolidated, cohesive, and transparent LSA experience for both users and advertisers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-248584 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/google-verified-badge-example-png.webp\" alt=\"google local services ads - verified badge\" width=\"390\" height=\"86\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Expand the reach of your paid search ads<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll notice that Google Local Services Ads sit above the paid search ads and the organic listings.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-local-services-ads-on-serp.jpg\" alt=\"google local services ads - example of serp with LSAs\" width=\"900\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-94917 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-local-services-ads-on-serp.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-local-services-ads-on-serp-480x427.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s because <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/local-marketing-lab\/ppc\/#section5\">Google Local Services Ads<\/a> aren\u2019t meant to replace your traditional search ads or even your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/listings\/\">organic local listings<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Some searchers still turn to Google and expect to visit your website before deciding if you\u2019re the best provider for their business. Even if they don\u2019t convert via LSAs, their prime position on the SERP and user reviews <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/08\/attribution-models\">may change how people convert later on<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Be included in voice search responses<\/h3>\n<p>Your customers are less likely to open a new tab and type a search query when they\u2019re wrist-deep in their clogged drains! With over 20% of all searches coming from voice search, Local Services Ads are one of the few ways you can make sure that you\u2019re found on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blog.google\/products\/assistant\/how-google-home-and-google-assistant-helped-you-get-more-done-in-2017\/\">400 million devices<\/a> powered by Google Assistant.<\/p>\n<h3>No ads or keywords to manage<\/h3>\n<p>Paid search advertisers know that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords\">keyword research<\/a> and ad testing can be never-ending tasks. Luckily, Google\u2019s Local Services Ads require neither! Local Services Ads will automatically trigger when a customer searches for one of the thousands of relevant search terms, be it as broad as \u201cPlumber\u201d or as specific as \u201cleaky faucet under sink.\u201d The ad format will automatically be created using information from your business profile.<\/p>\n<div id=\"howto\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to get started with Google Local Services Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Ready to try out Google LSAs? Here&#8217;s how to get started.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Confirm your eligibility<\/h3>\n<p>Google\u2019s Local Services Ads are only available for certain industries (which we outlined earlier). To find out if you can connect with your customers through Local Services Ads, first confirm your business type and location <a href=\"https:\/\/ads.google.com\/localservices\/signup\/eligibility?pli=1\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re eligible, you\u2019ll be guided through creating an account to manage your Local Services Ads. Local Services Ads are managed separately from the ads you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/21\/google-skillshop\">create in Google Ads<\/a>, so you\u2019ll need to create a new account.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Create your business profile<\/h3>\n<p>Your Google Local Services Ads profile is different from your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/08\/what-is-google-my-business\">Google Business Profile account,<\/a> which is connected to your local listing on Google (and if you haven&#8217;t already, make a note to create and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/03\/google-my-business-optimization\">optimize<\/a> this account as well). Your Local Services Ads business profile will determine which jobs are matched to your business. Be honest about what kind of services you can perform as well as which areas you want leads in, as you\u2019re agreeing to potentially pay for any match leads from your Local Services Ads.<\/p>\n<p>From your business profile, you can edit:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your weekly budget<\/li>\n<li>Your business hours<\/li>\n<li>Your service areas<\/li>\n<li>Your job types<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/business-profile-example.png\" alt=\"business-profile-example\" width=\"814\" height=\"640\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You also have the option to add highlights to your business profile, which will potentially serve alongside your Local Services Ads on the SERP and on your business details page. Use these to highlight attributes (\u201cLocally owned &amp; operated\u201d) and special offers (\u201cMilitary discount available\u201d) to distinguish yourself from others in your industry. Although these highlights are optional, Google recommends including 2-5 highlights in your business profile.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Add your license and insurance details<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re a licensed and insured professional, you\u2019ll need to submit proof. Be sure your paperwork is up to date, and then provide your general liability insurance details as well as your related professional licenses.<\/p>\n<p>If your city or state requires additional licenses, you can add them here as well to ensure you\u2019re compliant in those regions.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Complete a background check<\/h3>\n<p>Before Google starts sending people into its users\u2019 homes, offices, and cars, it wants to be sure its users are safe and can always trust the Local Services Advertisers covered under the Google Verified badge. For this reason, Google requires businesses and their fieldworkers to pass a <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adwords\/answer\/6226575?ref_topic=6224863&amp;hl=en&amp;visit_id=1-636571767460960195-2392301597&amp;rd=1\">background check<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>There is no cost for these background checks, and you can manage them <a href=\"https:\/\/pinkerton.screenmenow.com\/Default.aspx?c=ALLI_04073\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Manage your leads<\/h3>\n<p>Once your business profile is complete, you can launch your Local Services Ads and start collecting new leads. You can view and manage your incoming leads in your <a href=\"https:\/\/ads.google.com\/localservices\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LSAs dashboard<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>From this dashboard, you can navigate to the \u201cLeads\u201d tab via the drop-down in the top right corner of the platform<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/managing-your-leads.png\" alt=\"managing-your-leads\" width=\"800\" height=\"700\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Remember that leads aren\u2019t necessarily booked jobs! Be sure to follow up with your inbound leads. After selecting an individual lead, you can review the details of the lead, including the job type and location, as well as listen to the recording of the call.<\/p>\n<p>After reviewing these leads, you have these three options to follow up with an interested lead:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reply <\/strong>to the customer by sending your message as an email or text message to the customer.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Call <\/strong>the customer based on the phone number they listed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Decline <\/strong>the job request. If you decline the request, it will be removed and the customer will be notified. You can send a response with more information about why the request was declined. Once declined, requests can be recovered if something changes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>After reviewing your leads, you can also mark a lead as booked to track your upcoming jobs. Use this feature to schedule your upcoming jobs, send confirmation emails, and gather customer reviews. Reporting on these booked deals will also help you determine your Local Services Ads\u2019 <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-roi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">overall ROI<\/a> and profitability.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Manage your LSA budget<\/h3>\n<p>From your business profile, you can adjust your Local Services Ads budget. You can manage how much you\u2019d like to spend on your Local Services Ads by raising or lowering your average weekly budget. Like in Google Ads, Google may <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-budget\">spend slightly less or more than your assigned weekly budget<\/a> in any given week, but it will never exceed your monthly maximum budget.<\/p>\n<p>Given that you\u2019re charged per lead\u2014rather than click\u2014with Google Local Services Ads, increasing or decreasing your budget will directly impact the number of <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/april-promotion-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">leads<\/a> you generate. If you\u2019re just starting off with Local Services Ads, it\u2019s recommended that you budget for at least 20 leads per week to get the most out of your new ads.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/managing-your-budget.png\" alt=\"managing-your-budget\" width=\"817\" height=\"609\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Keep in mind that your Local Services Ads budget is separate from your Google Ads budget, so if you\u2019re running both, you\u2019ll want to ensure you\u2019re prepared for the combined costs of your campaigns.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Consider your LSA rankings<\/h3>\n<p>Even with Local Services Ads, there\u2019s still a limited amount of space on the SERP!<\/p>\n<p>Up to three Local Services Ads will appear on Desktop, two on Mobile, and only one via Google Assistant. Just like with your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/ppc\">PPC campaigns<\/a>, to ensure your listing shows, you\u2019ll need to have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/ad-ranking\">high Ad Rank<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>However, unlike your search ads, you don&#8217;t have to worry about your ad\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/quality-score\">Quality Score <\/a>(formulated by a combination of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/average-ctr\">ad\u2019s CTR<\/a>, ad relevance, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/great-landing-pages\">landing page<\/a>). Instead, Google calculates your Local Services Ads\u2019 Ad Rank by considering factors including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your review score and the number of reviews you receive<\/li>\n<li>Your responsiveness to customer inquiries and requests<\/li>\n<li>Your business hours<\/li>\n<li>Whether or not Google&#8217;s received serious or repeated complaints about your business<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"tips\" div=\"\">\n<h2>Tips for effective Local Services Ads<\/h2>\n<p>These four Google Local Services Ads tips can make a big difference in ROI.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Be mindful of the locations you target<\/h3>\n<p>Each Local Services Ads profile should be viewed as a campaign. Just like you wouldn\u2019t ask a campaign to service more than one major market, it\u2019s unrealistic to ask a Local Services Ads to target more than three major markets.<\/p>\n<p>In an ideal structure, you\u2019d have each LSA profile focusing on one major market (corresponding to one Google Business Profile).<\/p>\n<p>However, if you only have one GBP and serve multiple locations, <strong>be sure the locations you choose to target are in close proximity to your main prospect hubs<\/strong> (i.e, where you\u2019ll have a higher likelihood of benefiting from the proximity ranking factor).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/google-local-services-ads-service-areas.png\" alt=\"google local services ads - service area selection\" width=\"720\" height=\"604\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-60042\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/google-local-services-ads-service-areas.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/google-local-services-ads-service-areas-480x403.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>2. Avoid unnecessary disapprovals<\/h3>\n<p>The most common reasons for LSAs to stop serving are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/23\/google-ads-disapprovals\">disapprovals<\/a>, and two common disapprovals are for the image to get flagged or certifications to go out of date. For example, when you\u2019re setting up your profile, you\u2019ll be asked to input the expiration date of your certifications. However, some certifications don\u2019t need to be renewed\u2014or if they do, they\u2019re not an annual renewal. Be sure to set the expiration date far enough in advance that you won\u2019t need to think about it for 5-10 years.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Keep your Google reviews up<\/h3>\n<p><span>Keep in mind that reviews on your regular Google Business Profile appear on your LSA profile and impact your ad ranking, but not the other way around. And any reviews you get from your LSAs will go away if you stop advertising, and you won\u2019t be able to respond to reviews that come through your review link.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>You can learn <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/16\/get-more-google-reviews\">how to get more Google reviews here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Set realistic hours<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/19\/conversion-rate-benchmarks\">Conversion rates<\/a> for LSAs and response times have a strong correlation: the faster you are to respond to leads, the greater the chance you will win the business.<\/p>\n<p>Local Services Ads do not factor response times into ranking, but they do learn what kind of users result in successful calls\/form-fills.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/google-local-services-ads-hours.png\" alt=\"google local services ads - business hours view\" width=\"557\" height=\"623\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-60043\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/google-local-services-ads-hours.png 557w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/google-local-services-ads-hours-480x537.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 557px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Make sure your LSA is set to only run when you have the team to respond. <\/strong>If you can\u2019t support leads 24\/7, do not let the campaign run 24\/7.
