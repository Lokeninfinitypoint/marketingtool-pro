Maximize Conversions<\/h3>\n<p>Maximize Conversions is a fully automated bidding strategy, meaning there are no individual keyword bids set by advertisers that Google factors in. It simply chooses a CPC bid based on the goal of the bidding strategy.<\/p>\n<p>The Maximum Conversions bid strategy is designed to get as many conversions as possible while spending your daily budget. Max Conversions also gives you the option to add a target CPA to help guide its bidding.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-automated-bidding-maximize-conversions.jpg\" alt=\"Maximize Conversions\" width=\"1246\" height=\"240\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Although this bid strategy is relatively straightforward, it warrants an abundance of caution. Here are some tips to keep in mind and precautions to take.<\/p>\n<h4>Each campaign needs its own daily budget<\/h4>\n<p>It\u2019s important that each campaign using Maximize Conversions has its own daily budget assigned, as opposed to being part of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-shared-budgets\">shared budget<\/a>, as this strategy will always try to spend the full daily allotted budget per campaign. If included in a shared budget, Maximize Conversions will spend the daily budget of the entire shared group, not just its own allotment.<\/p>\n<h4>You need conversion tracking in place<\/h4>\n<p>Do not run this strategy without having conversion tracking in place. Google\u2019s goal is to maximize the number of conversions being tracked, so if no tracking is enabled, the algorithm is more likely to make bad decisions to find a person willing to convert.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-36587 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-conversion-tracking.png\" alt=\"google ads conversion tracking setup\" width=\"720\" height=\"233\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-conversion-tracking.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-conversion-tracking-480x155.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Keep an eye on CPC<\/h4>\n<p>Remember, Google\u2019s algorithm is going to bid whatever it needs to bid to get you the most conversions possible. You may see your spend or average CPC creep up as Google is bidding more aggressively to meet your conversion goals.<\/p>\n<p>However, while Max Conversions has a history of potentially spending more aggressively, the increased <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/conversion-rate-optimization-marketing\">conversion rate<\/a> balances you back out. Your spend or average CPC may be higher, but you\u2019ll have more conversions coming in\u2014resulting in an overall lower CPA and higher ROI. Plus, with the new option to add a target cost per action (CPA), these risks can be kept in control.<\/p>\n<p>In short, if your goal is to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/performance-max-lead-generation\">get more leads for cheaper<\/a>, Max Conversions might just work for you. However, if you\u2019re tight on budget, try a target CPA with Max Conversions or go for another strategy instead!<\/p>\n<p><strong><span data-contrast=\"auto\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" lang=\"EN-US\" class=\"TextRun SCXW31673628 BCX0\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW31673628 BCX0\">\ud83d\udcb8 <\/span><\/span>Are you wasting any spend in Google Ads? <\/strong>Find out instantly with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Free Google Ads<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Grader<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"maximize-clicks\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Maximize Clicks<\/h3>\n<p>This strategy is very similar to Maximize Conversions but instead focuses on clicks. With Maximize Clicks, Google will work to get as many clicks as possible while spending your daily budget.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-automated-bidding-maximize-clicks.jpg\" alt=\"Maximize Clicks\" width=\"1248\" height=\"372\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This strategy can be great if you\u2019re trying to drive more volume to your site for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/14\/use-branding-to-improve-advertising\" data-cke-saved-href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/14\/use-branding-to-improve-advertising\">branding<\/a> and list building, or if you have very strong <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/19\/conversion-rate-benchmarks\" data-cke-saved-href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/19\/conversion-rate-benchmarks\">conversion performance<\/a> and want to find more volume.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some other tips to keep in mind.<\/p>\n<h4>Set a max CPC<\/h4>\n<p>Always set a max CPC and keep an eye on your average max CPC as well. Google will work to get as many clicks as possible for your campaign, but as with Maximize Conversions, it will also work hard to spend your entire daily budget each day, even if clicks are far more expensive than normal.<\/p>\n<h4>Regularly check on CPC performance<\/h4>\n<p>Regularly check in on the CPC performance this bid strategy is generating (and any other goal metrics you have in place) to ensure it\u2019s still meeting your goals. If not, then adjust your settings or potentially look to a new bid strategy.<\/p>\n<div id=\"maximize-conversion-value\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Maximize Conversion Value<\/h3>\n<p>Max Conversion Value is the older sibling of the Max Conversions strategy because it\u2019s slightly more advanced.<\/p>\n<p>While the two strategies are fundamentally the same, Max Conversion Value looks to bring in conversions that will give you the highest return.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-36586 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/google-ads-automated-bidding-strategies-pros-cons-maximize-conversion-value.png\" alt=\"google ads automated bidding strategies pros and cons: maximize conversion value setup\" width=\"720\" height=\"154\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/google-ads-automated-bidding-strategies-pros-cons-maximize-conversion-value.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/google-ads-automated-bidding-strategies-pros-cons-maximize-conversion-value-480x103.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In other words, it doesn\u2019t necessarily look at how<em> many <\/em>conversions it\u2019s bringing in, but the<em> value<\/em> within each conversion. It\u2019s a strategy that looks at quality over quantity.<\/p>\n<p>Similar to how Max Conversions allows you to set a Target CPA, Max Conversion Value gives you the option to set a Target ROAS to help guide its bidding.<\/p>\n<p>There are two points of caution for this bidding strategy.<\/p>\n<h4>Track conversions<\/h4>\n<p>Just like with Max Conversions, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/24\/google-ads-conversion-tracking\" data-cke-saved-href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/24\/google-ads-conversion-tracking\">properly setting up conversion tracking<\/a> is vital to the success of this strategy.<\/p>\n<h4>Assign values<\/h4>\n<p>Be sure <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/10\/how-to-determine-conversion-value\">each action is assigned a value<\/a>, or else the algorithm will be confused.<\/p>\n<p>After all, a conversion worth $1000 to your business deserves a higher bid than one worth only $5. If your tracking is not properly set for value-based bidding, this won\u2019t work.<\/p>\n<div id=\"target-cpa\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Target CPA (tCPA)<\/h3>\n<p>Target CPA stands for target cost per action (or conversion). It used to be a separate bidding strategy but is now only available as an option within the Max Conversions strategy (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/31\/google-retiring-tcpa-troas\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/31\/google-retiring-tcpa-troas\">learn more here<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>With tCPA, you set a target cost per action (conversion) and then Google adjusts bids to generate as many conversions as possible at that CPA.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-36585 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-target-cpa.png\" alt=\"google ads automated bidding strategies: target CPA setup\" width=\"600\" height=\"227\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-target-cpa.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-target-cpa-480x182.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Advertisers are able to set bid minimums and maximums to ensure Google doesn\u2019t adjust bids through the floor or ceiling, but only for\u00a0<span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/6263072\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">portfolio-<\/a>level<\/span>\u00a0use.

Without it, this bidding strategy is useless\u2014it will never know if it\u2019s driving conversions or not.<\/p>\n<p>But that\u2019s not all. Just because you have conversion tracking turned on doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re off to the races just yet.<\/p>\n<h4>Provide minimum conversion data<\/h4>\n<p>To drive conversion performance, Google needs to have a certain amount of conversion data to be able to make smart decisions. If you don\u2019t have enough conversion volume, then the algorithm can\u2019t make smart decisions, and tCPA isn\u2019t the right bidding option for you.<\/p>\n<p>At the campaign level, Google says the minimum is 15 conversions in the last 30 days, but we\u2019ve found this to be on the low side. Ideally, you should have at least 30 conversions, if not 50, in the past 30 days before testing tCPA bidding.<\/p>\n<p>If your campaigns don\u2019t reach this level individually, they might at a portfolio level. If they still don\u2019t, tCPA likely shouldn\u2019t be on your list of eligible bid strategies.<\/p>\n<h4>Set a realistic target<\/h4>\n<p>Lastly, when getting started with tCPA, it\u2019s important to set realistic initial goals. If your campaign has had an average CPA of $40 over the past six months, it\u2019s not in your best interest to set a target CPA of $20, as it will limit Google right away in the auctions it can enter in and learn.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to use tCPA bidding, plan on the first two weeks to a month being a learning phase. Set your target CPA slightly higher than what your average CPA has been recently, or use the Google-suggested CPA target to let Google find a groove, then slowly bring it down over time to your target CPA.<\/p>\n<div id=\"target-roas\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Target ROAS (tROAS)<\/h3>\n<p>Target ROAS is nearly the same as Target CPA, but with return on ad spend (ROAS) instead. And just as tCPA has been reorganized under Max Conversions, tROAS has been reorganized under Max Conversion Value (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/31\/google-retiring-tcpa-troas\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/31\/google-retiring-tcpa-troas\">learn more here<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>With this strategy, Google Ads will predict future conversion and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/25\/conversion-value\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/25\/conversion-value\">conversion value<\/a> performance based on your historical data to enter auctions, and then adjust bids in real time to maximize conversion value while trying to achieve the target ROAS goal you\u2019ve set at the ad group, campaign, or portfolio level.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-36583 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/google-ads-automated-bidding-target-ROAS.png\" alt=\"google ads automated bidding: target roas setup\" width=\"720\" height=\"261\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/google-ads-automated-bidding-target-ROAS.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/google-ads-automated-bidding-target-ROAS-480x174.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As with tCPA, individual conversions may have higher or lower ROAS than your goal, and Google will work to balance those out over time to achieve your ROAS target.<\/p>\n<p>With tROAS, advertisers can set bid limits (minimums and maximums) at the campaign or portfolio level to help keep the Google algorithm from straying too far, but Google cautions against this as it can limit the machine&#8217;s decision-making.<\/p>\n<p>All the same cautions for tCPA apply to tROAS.<\/p>\n<h4>Set up accurate conversion tracking<\/h4>\n<p>Ensure you have accurate conversion tracking in place including conversion values and that you have enough conversion performance in the recent past to leverage this strategy.<\/p>\n<h4>Don&#8217;t set your target ROAS too high<\/h4>\n<p>Also, be careful not set your target ROAS at a restrictively high level right off the bat. Start off with a goal slightly lower than what your performance has been recently, then slowly raise the target over time to achieve a more profitable ROAS.<\/p>\n<div id=\"target-impression-share\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. Target Impression Share<\/h3>\n<p>With Target Impression Share, advertisers set a goal impression share percentage in the same way you would set a target CPA for that bidding strategy.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-automated-bidding-target-impression-share.jpg\" alt=\"Target Impression Share\" width=\"1072\" height=\"558\" \/><br \/>\nThere are three placement options you have to bid for with Target Impression Share:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Absolute Top of Page<\/li>\n<li>Top of Page<\/li>\n<li>Anywhere on the Page<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Each of these will tell the Google algorithm different things about your preferences, and it will adjust bids accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>Advertisers are also able to set a max CPC bid with Target Impression Share bidding to help guard against overspend, but Google cautions against setting it too low and throttling performance.<\/p>\n<p>Like any other bidding strategy, this one has the potential to increase your bids beyond the profitability level if you\u2019re not careful. This strategy is focused on awareness and reach (though it can be used for performance), but there are still limits to what makes sense monetarily for your campaigns.<\/p>\n<h4>Keep an eye on CPC<\/h4>\n<p>Always set a max CPC bid to ensure you don\u2019t pay too much for any individual click. Although Google cautions against it, don\u2019t worry about setting this bid too low to start. Try setting it at a percentage increase over your current bid of 20%-50%. If that works well, then leave that cap. If you\u2019re not seeing the volume you\u2019d like, increase the max CPC.<\/p>\n<h4>Have realistic expectations<\/h4>\n<p>Very few auctions will actually see 100% coverage anymore. So although you set a target to 100%, don\u2019t be surprised or frustrated if you show up closer to 95% as a top achievable number.<\/p>\n<p>Always keep an eye on CPCs and performance outcomes to ensure this bidding strategy is achieving your goals before continuing with this strategy.<\/p>\n<div id=\"viewable-cpm\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. Viewable CPM<\/h3>\n<p>Viewable CPM (vCPM) refers to cost per thousand viewable impressions. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/6026409?hl=en\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/6026409?hl=en\">Google<\/a><em>, <\/em>an ad is counted as viewable when 50% of your ad shows on screen for one second or longer for Display ads, and two seconds or longer for video ads.<\/p>\n<p>This is a Display-only bid strategy designed to let advertisers bid for impressions when your ad is shown in a viewable space.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-36582 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/google-ads-automated-bidding-strategies-viewable-cpm.png\" alt=\"google ads automated bidding strategies pros and cons: viewable CPM setup\" width=\"600\" height=\"153\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/google-ads-automated-bidding-strategies-viewable-cpm.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/google-ads-automated-bidding-strategies-viewable-cpm-480x122.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>vCPM bidding is great if you\u2019re working on expanding your brand coverage and simply want to get your message in front of a large group of people.<\/p>\n<p>There are a couple of things to watch out for with vCPM bidding: frequency and placements.<\/p>\n<h4>Be mindful of frequency<\/h4>\n<p>With this strategy, Google will look to maximize the number of viewable impressions your ad receives. When using this strategy with a finite audience, your chances of hitting a high frequency count for each user go up.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve all had the ads that seem to stalk us as we peruse the internet, so be sure that although you\u2019re trying to maximize ad views, you\u2019re not doing it at the expense of a small audience who now feel overwhelmed by your brand.<\/p>\n<h4>Keep an eye on placements<\/h4>\n<p>Additionally, not all viewable impressions are created equal. Just like any other display campaign, it\u2019s important to keep an eye on your placements report to ensure you\u2019re not showing up on unwanted sites.<\/p>\n<div id=\"cost-per-view\"><\/div>\n<h3>8. Cost Per View (CPV)<\/h3>\n<p>Bidding on individual views is only available for video ads. With Cost Per View, you set a campaign-level bid limit that implies the maximum you\u2019re willing to pay for each view or interaction with your video (whichever comes first).<\/p>\n<p>In this case, you\u2019d only be charged for a view if someone watched your video for more than 30 seconds (or the entire video if it\u2019s shorter than 30 seconds). Otherwise, if the viewer instead clicks on a link the video shares or takes part in other calls to action (app download, etc.), you will be charged for that interaction.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-36581 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/google-ads-cpv-automated-bidding-strategy.png\" alt=\"google ads automated bidding strategies: cost per view setup\" width=\"600\" height=\"349\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/google-ads-cpv-automated-bidding-strategy.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/google-ads-cpv-automated-bidding-strategy-480x279.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The nice thing about CPV bidding is it also allows you to \u201cbid up\u201d when you show alongside popular YouTube videos that may be more likely to bring you in a return.<\/p>\n<h4>Set up the right targeting<\/h4>\n<p>Beware if you have loose targeting on your video campaigns! If you\u2019re bringing in TONS of views at a cheaper cost, it most likely won\u2019t make sense for you to use CPV.<\/p>\n<h4>Only spend when it counts<\/h4>\n<p>Since you\u2019re bidding on individual views, you only want to spend when it really counts. So if you have looser targeting this will be tougher to gauge. Additionally, video views and average costs per view tend to be relatively cheap.<\/p>\n<p>This makes CPV a great strategy for a hyper-focused video campaign in a highly competitive space, but not the best for those just starting out in video ads.<\/p>\n<div id=\"manual\"><\/div>\n<h3>A note on Manual Cost Per Click (CPC)<\/h3>\n<p>Although Manual CPC is not an automated bidding strategy, it&#8217;s still worth mentioning in our bid strategy roundup as it&#8217;s the easiest bid strategy to grasp on the Google Ads platform. Advertisers set their bids manually at the keyword level, and the bids stay where they are until the advertiser changes them.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-36589 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-manual-cpc.png\" alt=\"pros and cons of every automated bidding strategy in google ads: manual cpc setup\" width=\"720\" height=\"207\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-manual-cpc.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-manual-cpc-480x138.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Despite the friendly warning from Google, this is the best place to start for folks starting out in PPC or using their spare time to manage their account but has its drawbacks.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the friendly warning from Google, this is a recommended place to start for folks starting out in PPC or using their spare time to manage their account.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistakes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Manual bidding<\/a> has two drawbacks:<\/p>\n<h4>It takes a lot of time<\/h4>\n<p>When it comes down to it, manual bidding requires a time investment to look at performance, judge if the keyword bid needs to change, decide what that change needs to be, and then actually make that change.<\/p>\n<h4>You could be underinformed<\/h4>\n<p>When we review our <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2011\/05\/10\/common-ppc-metrics\" data-cke-saved-href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2011\/05\/10\/common-ppc-metrics\">performance metrics<\/a>, we\u2019re at the whim of the metrics Google allows us to see for our campaigns.
