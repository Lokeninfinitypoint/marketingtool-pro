(Via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/binaryape\/3914974557\/\">BinaryApe<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve been banging the drum about <a href=\"\/long-tail-keywords\">long-tail keywords<\/a> for a long (ahem) time. Recently, I explained <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/08\/28\/why-are-popular-keywords-so-hard-to-rank-for\">why it\u2019s so hard to rank for competitive keyword phrases with a new website<\/a>. The answer? Keep trying, and target more specific, less competitive long-tail keywords in the meantime. We also talked about <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/10\/03\/keyword-content-marketing-faq#Head%20or%20Long%20Tail\">whether you should target head terms or long-tail keywords<\/a> in my <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/10\/03\/keyword-content-marketing-faq\">Content Marketing FAQ<\/a>. The answer? BOTH! As you\u2019re building out your site content, your keyword taxonomy should naturally include both broad and narrow terms.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully by now, whatever the size, type, or age of your business, you understand that long-tail keywords should be a part of your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/01\/17\/seo-content-beginners-guide\">SEO content strategy<\/a>. The long-tail keywords you find could be used as the title and main topic for a highly targeted blog post or article (or video, or infographic, or any other type of content), or you could use them as variations to better optimize a longer guide or article targeting one primary keyword \u2013 for example, by using the long-tail keywords in your subheads and image file names. And if you&#8217;re running <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/28\/niche-marketing\">niche marketing campaigns<\/a>, super-specific long-tail keywords will be your best friend.<\/p>\n<p>So where should you go to find those traffic- and lead-driving long-tail keywords? Here are nine tips to get you started.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Use Google Suggest<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/03\/27\/google-search-suggestions\">Google Suggestions<\/a> are an awesome source of long-tail keyword variations. Just start typing your primary keyword into the Google search box and see what variations Google suggests:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-suggestions-long-tail-keyword-ideas-2-1.png\" alt=\"Long-Tail Keywords for Blogs\" width=\"648\" height=\"172\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If it turns up in a Google suggestion, you know that it\u2019s a phrase people are searching for. These suggestions won\u2019t necessarily inspire your faith in humanity (we all remember the \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2010\/08\/16\/i-am-extremely-terrified-_n_684236.html\">I am extremely terrified of Chinese people<\/a>\u201d debacle \u2026), but they might inspire good content.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Use Google\u2019s Related Searches<\/h2>\n<p>Same principle as the Google Suggestions that appear while you\u2019re typing your query, but these suggested related searches appear at the bottom of the SERP, below the first page of organic results:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-related-searches-long-tail-terms-1.png\" alt=\"Related Long-Tail Terms\" width=\"451\" height=\"195\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You may get slightly more suggestions here (in this case, eight keywords versus just four above), and they may also be slightly more personalized (Google knows I live in Colorado, hence the \u201cDenver\u201d and \u201cFort Collins\u201d modifiers).<\/p>\n<h2>3. Use More and Different Keyword Research Tools<\/h2>\n<p>If you only use one keyword tool every time you do keyword research, you\u2019re selling yourself short and probably missing out on tons of long-tail keyword variations. The Google Keyword Tool is a great basic tool and a good place to start, but if you\u2019re looking for more long-tail keywords, try these other options too:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>WordStream\u2019s <\/strong><a href=\"\/keywords\"><strong>Free Keyword Tool<\/strong><\/a> \u2013 Sorry to toot our own horn, but you really will get more long-tail suggestions and find more <a href=\"\/keyword-niche-finder\">keyword niches<\/a> with our keyword tool than most other tools out there.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/trends\/\"><strong>Google Trends<\/strong><\/a> \u2013 Find out what people are searching on right now (like \u201c<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/11\/05\/who-will-win-the-election-tomorrow-obama-landslide\">Who will win the 2012 election?<\/a>\u201d).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Social Media Tools <\/strong>\u2013 For example <a href=\"https:\/\/ads.youtube.com\/keyword_tool\/\">YouTube\u2019s keyword tool<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/search\">Twitter Search<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The more keyword tools you consult, the more long-tail keyword variations you\u2019re likely to find.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Mine Your Analytics<\/h2>\n<p>Your analytics will tell you <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/06\/26\/dealing-with-google-analytics-not-provided\">many, if not all<\/a>, of the keyword phrases that lead visitors to your website. By digging through these keyword referrers, you\u2019ll be able to find a bunch of long-tail queries that are driving traffic for you. These keywords may be relevant to your business but not yet highly targeted by a single page on your site. For example, a few years ago we found that a lot of people were searching on the phrase \u201c<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2010\/04\/26\/good-click-through-rate\">what\u2019s a good click through rate<\/a>\u201d to wind up at our site, but we didn\u2019t have a page with that title, so we wrote one, and now it drives tons of traffic.<\/p>\n<p>To find your own private store of long-tail keywords, go into your analytics and locate your organic keyword referrals (in Google Analytics, the path is Traffic Sources -&gt; Sources -&gt; Search -&gt; Organic). You can simply scan all the terms for good, relevant long-tail keywords you can turn into content, or you can set the time frame to something pretty large (depending on your traffic flow, try a 3-, 6-, or 12-month period) so you\u2019ll have a lot of data to look at, then search for patterns. For example, you might search for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/3-ways-to-find-questions-to-answer-in-your-content\/47689\/\">question keywords<\/a> (i.e. terms that begin with \u201cwhat,\u201d \u201cwhy,\u201d etc.).<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-analytics-long-tail-keyword-strings-1.png\" alt=\"Google Analytics Long-Tail Research \" width=\"638\" height=\"325\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>5. Mine Your Search Query Reports<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re running a PPC campaign in AdWords, don\u2019t forget to use your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2011\/11\/17\/adwords-search-term-report\">Search Query Report<\/a> the same way you\u2019d use your analytics, just one of many ways that <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/08\/27\/using-adwords-data-for-seo\">PPC data can inform your SEO<\/a>. Your Search Query Report shows you the search queries that drove people to click on your ads, rather than your organic search results. As an added bonus, you get fuller access to this data than you do your organic referrers in Google Analytics. It may also be easier to see which keywords are driving conversions, not just traffic. High-converting long-tail keywords are especially worth chasing.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Browse eHow<\/h2>\n<p>Sites like eHow are pretty much entirely fueled by keyword research, primarily long-tail keyword research. Demand Media, the company that owns eHow, Cracked.com and other sites, uses powerful algorithms to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2009\/10\/23\/future-of-content-creation\">find long-tail keywords it can then rank for with hyper-targeted content<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>You might not have Demand Media\u2019s data sources or insanely profitable content algorithms on your side, but you can still learn from this methodology. Browse these sites for keyword ideas. If eHow is targeting a keyword phrase, you can bet it has search volume and that advertisers are interested in buying placement on those pages. Another good bet? Whatever they have produced to target those keywords is probably pretty lame. The content eHow churns out is produced on the cheap by freelancers and tends to be thin content, the kind of stuff that <a href=\"\/articles\/google-ads\">post-Panda Google<\/a> no longer favors. If you can create strong content with real value that is also hyper-targeted, you have a good chance of outranking the content farms.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/post-panda-long-tail-keyword-optimization-1.png\" alt=\"Post-Panda Keyword Research\" width=\"648\" height=\"451\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>7. Browse Q&amp;A Sites<\/h2>\n<p>Like Demand Media properties, Q&amp;A sites can be a good source of long-tail keyword ideas. I\u2019m talking about sites like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quora (here are some <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2011\/03\/24\/quora-seo\">tips for using Quora to find content ideas<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Yahoo Answers<\/li>\n<li>Answers.com<\/li>\n<li>Askville by Amazon<\/li>\n<li>LinkedIn Answers<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Questions make great long-tail keywords \u2013 it couldn\u2019t be more obvious that these people are looking for answers and information.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/askville-long-tail-keyword-research-1.png\" alt=\"long-tail question keywords\" width=\"696\" height=\"329\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Of course you\u2019ll want to do a little keyword research to find the version of each question that has the right <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/07\/low-search-volume-keywords\">search volume<\/a> and competition level. Not every question you find on a Q&amp;A site is going to be a worthwhile keyword to attack.<\/p>\n<h2>8. Browse Wikipedia<\/h2>\n<p>Is Wikipedia the most optimized site on the Internet? It\u2019s definitely up there. You can learn a lot by copying Wikipedia\u2019s on-page optimization. When doing research around a base term, try checking the Wikipedia page. For example, look at the table of contents (this for the \u201cQuantum Mechanics\u201d page):<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/wikipedia-long-tail-keyword-optimization-example-1.png\" alt=\"Wikipedia long-tail keywords\" width=\"379\" height=\"462\" \/><\/div>\n<p>A lot of these headings translate into long-tail keywords (\u201chistory of quantum mechanics,\u201d \u201cmathematical formulations of quantum mechanics,\u201d \u201capplications of quantum mechanics,\u201d etc.). You can also do a page search (Control-F) on the page for your primary keyword and see what other variations appear throughout the text. In addition, the \u201cSee Also\u201d section at the bottom of many Wikipedia articles can be helpful for finding clusters of related terms.<\/p>\n<h2>9. Steal From Competitors<\/h2>\n<p>For informational queries, Wikipedia is often your competitor. But always check out the competition when you\u2019re chasing a keyword term. Start with head and mid-tail terms that you\u2019re trying to rank for, and see what types of keyword variations are used on the pages that are ranking in the top 5-10 spots. For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re chasing the keyword \u201choliday crafts.\u201d Scope the page that ranks #1 for that keyword on Google and see what keywords it\u2019s using (keywords everywhere!):<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/stealing-long-tail-keyword-ideas-from-competitors-1.png\" alt=\"Competitive long-tail keywords\" width=\"627\" height=\"761\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>Share Your Long-Tail Keyword Research Tips<\/h2>\n<p>Have you discovered other sneaky ways to find long-tail keyword terms?
