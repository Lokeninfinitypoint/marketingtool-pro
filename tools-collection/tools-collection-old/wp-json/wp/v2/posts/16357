Provoke brand searches with Facebook, close the deal with Google<\/h2>\n<p>A well-targeted campaign on Facebook will not only get you excellent results by reaching and converting a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/29\/facebook-ad-targeting-strategies\">cold audience<\/a>, it can also increase the number of people searching for your brand name on Google. When this happens, you get a golden opportunity to \u201cclose the deal\u201d when they are trying to inquire about your brand and learn some more, after seeing your ad on Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>You will be surprised by the number of people who will go directly to Google and search for your brand name after seeing an ad on Facebook, instead of directly clicking it.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"309b3b43-6d75-4899-851f-d37d17c3c1e8\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/cross-network-ads-effect-on-google-brand-searches1-3.png\" alt=\"cross networks ads branding\" width=\"762\" height=\"585\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>WordStream found that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/13\/cross-network-advertising-brand-search-lift\">advertising on Facebook led to a 34% increase in brand searches<\/a> on Google.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s actually a very simple explanation for this. Many of the people that see your Facebook ads may have some interest in the offer, but they want to know more about your company and what you sell. Therefore, instead of clicking the ad, they will leave Facebook and search for your brand name to get the information they want.<\/p>\n<p>All you have to do is use your brand name as a keyword in your search campaigns, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/16\/landing-page-message-match\">match the messaging<\/a> to your current Facebook ads. Doing so will lead your cold audience on Facebook to find exactly what they were looking for on Google. It strengthens your marketing message and shows reliability.<\/p>\n<p>I guess that by now you might be asking yourself, \u201cWhy should I use my brand name as a keyword when my website is already ranked first on Google for it?\u201d Well, the answer to that is very simple. Targeting your brand name as a keyword allows you to better test your messaging in terms of CTR and conversions, and match it to what you\u2019re saying about yourself in your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/26\/facebook-ads-checklist\">Facebook ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example from a live test, doing exactly what\u2019s described above. This is a Facebook ad targeting a completely cold audience, containing people who are most likely never heard of this\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/crazylister.com\/\">brand<\/a><\/u>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"b06e9b07-7e91-4e2d-a678-5e7674aab3cf\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/crazylister-facebook-ad.jpg\" alt=\"facebook ads plus google ads\" width=\"1086\" height=\"1076\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>And here\u2019s a matching ad on Google, with matching messaging, just waiting for those Facebook users to come in.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4c088208-ef64-414a-8fcc-696d6e0bc253\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/crazylister-google-ad-facebook-message-match.jpg\" alt=\"using google ads to support facebook campaigns\" width=\"671\" height=\"97\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>So to summarize, easily reach a broad, cold audience on Facebook, and close the deal in Google when they\u2019re searching for your brand name.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Target your Facebook ad headlines as keywords<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This one is actually pretty simple, and takes what we explained about using your brand name as a keyword to the next level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As mentioned above, a successful ad campaign on Facebook can easily reach many prospects and generate a lot of brand searches on Google, but when done right, it\u2019s not only the brand name people will be searching for, it\u2019s also your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/02\/ppc-ad-headlines\">ad headlines<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">A catchy headline can be more memorable than a brand name and generate more direct searches.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">While it may sound surprising it actually makes a lot of sense. A good headline like \u201cTurn invoices into cash,\u201d as seen in the image below, can be much more memorable than the actual brand name, and make the people who saw it search for it when they\u2019re looking for more information.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"74652c4c-65a7-4b7f-ac4c-d854008b413d\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-plus-google-ads-headlines.jpg\" alt=\"facebook ad catchy headline\" width=\"1222\" height=\"1140\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>This ad by Fundbox really made people actually go on Google and search for the terms:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cturn invoices into cash\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cturn invoices into cash company\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cinvoice to cash\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And many more related search terms.<\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The title is so catchy, and right to the point, it provoked many searches and led to a lot of easy conversions. All Fundbox did here was directly \u201canswer\u201d the search term and show great reliability to the users who were just looking for some more information about that interesting ad they saw on Facebook.<\/span><br \/>\n<a id=\"retargeting\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>3. Retarget your searching users with what they were searching for<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">So in sections 1 and 2, we did a kind of retargeting on Google, to the cold audience from Facebook. It was done regardless of whether the ad was clicked on or not. By using actual retargeting, we can take the connection between Facebook and Google even further, and make it much more powerful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If you are managing campaigns on Facebook and Google, you are probably already aware of the importance of retargeting (If not, you should get aware to it ASAP). But actually, there\u2019s much more to retargeting than just displaying the same ads to all your past visitors, and one of the best ways to use retargeting is cross-platform.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/20\/cross-platform-keyword-research-tools\">Cross-platform<\/a> retargeting means to retarget the users who got to your site from Google on Facebook, and the other way around. But, there\u2019s a clever way to do it even more efficiently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">You can use Facebook to retarget the people who got to your website from a search ad, with exactly what they were searching for.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This one may sound a bit tricky, but it\u2019s actually quite simple. Here\u2019s a great example of this tactic in action:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">For example, the ad below was displayed to people who were searching for \u201ceBay templates\u201d on Google.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2f761005-68aa-4d8b-9204-6c1bc1455b56\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-plus-facebook-retargeting-ads.jpg\" alt=\"facebook retargeting using google data\" width=\"513\" height=\"499\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">It\u2019s actually very easy to do (assuming you are using unique landing pages, and don\u2019t send everyone to your homepage). To make sure you\u2019re displaying the right \u201canswer\u201d ad to the right people, you will need to segment your custom audiences on Facebook. Simply go to the audience tab, and create a custom audience that matches exactly the right landing page which the ad on Google leads to. So, here\u2019s how it works in our example:<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"735df965-a39f-4449-8794-992e925e4f17\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/custom-audience-for-facebook-retargeting-with-google-ads.jpg\" alt=\"custom audience facebook retargeting\" width=\"819\" height=\"895\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>All I did was segment my audience by people who reached the site through the source \u201cAdWords\u201d, to the landing page about templates.<\/p>\n<p>And there you go. You can now use Facebook retargeting to reach the people who clicked on your search ads, with exactly what they were searching for.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Find more people similar to your searching users<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The power of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/facebook-lookalike-audiences\">lookalikes targeting on Facebook<\/a> is absolutely insane, and I won\u2019t go on and on about it in this post, because that\u2019s a bigger subject. So, if you are not familiar with it, I suggest you get right to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">If you are familiar and using lookalike audiences in your Facebook campaigns, here\u2019s a nice trick you can use: <strong>Create lookalikes audiences based on what your site visitors were searching for.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1eba7e6a-b0be-4acf-85b8-f8ef8f5f0575\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-lookalike-audience-sizes-2.png\" alt=\"Facebook Ad Tips Lookalikes Audiences\" width=\"725\" height=\"478\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">You probably know the best practice about lookalikes, which is to use your top users or customers as a seed and base your lookalike audiences on that. Well, that\u2019s definitely true, but there\u2019s more you can do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In many cases, you will probably find yourself struggling with creating a high-quality seed since you need a high number of very homogenous audience members. In other cases, you\u2019ll see good results with your top lookalikes, but wish to expand further (which is mostly the case, especially for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/05\/how-to-compete-with-big-budgets-adwords\">advertisers with big budgets<\/a>).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">So what to do? Create a lookalike audience based on your site visitors from search campaigns. By doing so, you\u2019ll be able to reach more people who are similar to the people who were searching for what you are offering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">You may be wondering, why target people that are similar to my searching users, but maybe did not convert? Easy: Just because you did not convert the people who clicked your ads on Google, doesn\u2019t mean you will not convert their lookalikes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">But be careful with it. Some of the people in this lookalike audience might also be a part of your regular lookalikes audience, so you need to make sure you will not target them twice in two different ad sets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Make sure to exclude your lookalikes based on customers from your search-based lookalike audiences.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Final words<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Looking at the bigger picture and changing my approach from \u201cGoogle vs. Facebook\u201d to \u201cGoogle plus Facebook\u201d has definitely improved my overall results. From my experience, it helps you see the bigger picture and strategize better.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Still thinking in terms of Google versus Facebook?
