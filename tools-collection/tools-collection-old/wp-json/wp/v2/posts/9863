That couldn\u2019t be further from the truth! <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In reality, your brand encompasses all the things that make you stand out from competitors as different. Everything from your visual identity to your messaging to customer experience. Not to mention the way people perceive your business, including all of the thoughts and emotions they associate with your brand.\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/effective-brand-strategy-brand-1.png\" alt=\"elements of an effective brand strategy\" width=\"800\" height=\"451\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/swimcreative.com\/three-keys-to-a-modern-brand-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Because branding is so extensive, developing a strategy that works takes both time and careful planning. To help with that planning, consider some guidelines for creating an effective brand strategy for your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">How to develop your brand strategy<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Developing a long-term plan for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/04\/25\/event-marketing\">building your brand<\/a> can seem like an overwhelming task. Where do you start? There are 10 steps that can give you a solid foundation on which to build.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">1. Pick your niche(s)<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Catering to a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/28\/niche-marketing\">niche market<\/a>\u00a0may involve offering specialized services, serving specific audiences, or limiting your focus to certain products that best serve the needs of your customers. Why can \u201cniching down\u201d be a smart strategic move? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Benefits include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">More time and energy to focus on creating the best possible <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/29\/how-to-promote-a-product\">products, services<\/a>, and experiences for your customers.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Reduced waste of resources (including money).<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">The ability to charge a premium for your specialized expertise.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Differentiation from competitors who appeal to different or more general audiences (perhaps with different or more general offerings also).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Rather than spreading your resources thin trying to be all things to everyone, you can allocate them where they\u2019ll do the most good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">That\u2019s not to say that you <em>must<\/em> focus on one narrow audience, service or product, though. Businesses can successfully cater to several different niches. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">To lay the foundation for <em>your<\/em> brand strategy, determine where it would be most worthwhile for you to focus. Considering what you enjoy most and excel at will give you a good start and put you on the path to a dialed-in brand image that supports your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/04\/best-marketing-strategies-2021\">marketing strategy<\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/effective-brand-strategy-what-is-a-niche-1.png\" alt=\"Effective brand strategy chart defining &quot;what is a niche&quot;\" width=\"680\" height=\"680\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">2. Define your business and marketing goals<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The whole point of a strategy is to reach a goal (or goals). So, in developing your brand strategy, you can\u2019t forget to consider your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-plan-goals-objectives-for-small-businesses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">short and long-term goals<\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Think of where you want your business to be next month, next year, and in a few years from now. Would you like to increase your customer base by a certain percentage? Is establishing a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-run-customer-loyalty-programs\/\">customer loyalty program<\/a> in the cards for you? Do you eventually want to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/grand-opening\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">open another location<\/a>? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In any case,\u00a0keep your core <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/15\/marketing-objectives\">objectives<\/a> front and center as you decide what brand strategy will harmonize with your marketing efforts and get you to your goal.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">3. Conduct brand research<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Building a brand strategy in a bubble is a bad idea. It\u2019s important to understand how your competitors and other businesses your audience engages with are branding themselves. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Of course, you don\u2019t want to be a copycat. However, you <em>can<\/em> learn a ton from what\u2019s working for them, how your audience responds to certain tactics, and even what your competitors <em>aren\u2019t<\/em> doing in their branding. Looking at existing brands can give you both creative inspiration and strategic insights to help you set yourself apart from the crowd.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">4. Spotlight what makes you different<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Even if what you offer isn\u2019t truly unique or one-of-a-kind, you can still stand out as different. How? Your brand messaging is one key. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/effective-brand-strategy-starbucks-dd_0-1.png\" alt=\"brand strategy-starbucks dunkin donuts cups\" width=\"720\" height=\"391\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bostonglobe.com\/metro\/regionals\/north\/2013\/06\/01\/dunkin-donuts-and-starbucks-battle-out-for-coffee-supremacy-greater-boston\/QK33ZCIAGcTNO04aVH6vJN\/story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Take, for example, the commercial coffee chains Starbucks and Dunkin\u2019 Donuts. Both sell similar products, but their brand strategies convey different messages to very distinct audiences. And both brands are successful. The same can be true in your case.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">You can customize your brand strategy and differentiate your business with: <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/12\/07\/company-mission-statements\">Mission<\/a> and vision statements that are personal to you<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Core values that are at the heart of what you do and that are shared by your customers<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">A crystal clear description of the unique way you solve a common problem<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">A crystal clear description of the way you solve an <em>uncommon<\/em> but notable problem<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">A focus on an uncommon or unique characteristic of your target audience<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">The unique customer experience you create for your customers<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Let\u2019s say you own a pizzeria. Yes, there are lots of other pizzerias out there. However, yours is unique in that you serve authentic Italian brick-oven pizza in a setting that takes your customers straight into the heart of Sicily. Your purpose isn\u2019t just to make tasty pizzas; it\u2019s to deliver an authentic Italian experience that locals can\u2019t find elsewhere in the area. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/effective-brand-strategy-pizzeria_0-1.png\" alt=\"whole pizza\" width=\"702\" height=\"528\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_pizza_varieties_by_country#Italy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Now substitute your actual business type in place of the pizzeria. The main question remains the same. What can you offer customers that they can\u2019t get from <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/18\/ppc-competitor-analysis\">your competitors<\/a>?<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">5. Think of your business as a person<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Every person has a unique personality. So does every business. In both cases, though, not every personality is memorable. To prevent having a forgettable brand, it can help to envision your business as a person (real or imagined). <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Ask yourself: If my business were a person, what kind of person would it be? What traits and characteristics would make it appealing, influential, or memorable? How would others describe their voice, tone, and style?\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This exercise can help you visualize the attributes of your business you want to highlight in your brand strategy and the best way to go about doing that. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">6. Craft an exceptional customer experience<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/19\/customer-marketing-strategies\">Customer experience<\/a> is the great equalizer of businesses. Sure, a competitor might offer the same products or services at a cheaper price, but if they treat their customers poorly or fail to address small but significant details, it won\u2019t matter. People are willing to spend a little more money or time for a better experience. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Plus, satisfied customers can become mini-marketers for your business, spreading the word about their positive experience, writing <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">customer reviews<\/a>, and recommending you to others like them.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/effective-brand-strategy-customer-experience-1.png\" alt=\"smiley faces indicating customer experience with a brand\" width=\"784\" height=\"504\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hotjar.com\/customer-experience\/\">Image source<\/a><\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">So think beyond how you can deliver a <em>decent<\/em> experience or even just a slightly better one than your competitors do. Deliver the <em>ideal<\/em> experience for your customers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">What additional bases can you cover to show your customers that you truly stand for what you say you do? What aspects of your brand can you translate into action when it comes to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/21\/client-communication-during-covid-19\">communicating<\/a> with, serving, and supporting your customers? Additionally, how can you<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/16\/get-more-google-reviews\"> make it easy for your customers to share their positive experiences with you<\/a>, especially online? <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">7. Get involved with your community<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Embracing your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/tips-to-help-your-business-build-a-sense-of-community\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">local community<\/a> can do wonders for your business. People love to support local businesses and often make the conscious choice to frequent them over large chains. Plus, in contrast to larger companies, you make it possible for people to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/12\/23\/humanize-brand\">put a face to your brand<\/a>, making it more appealing and human.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Personally connecting with customers has a twofold advantage. One, it\u2019s an excellent way to build relationships, establish a great reputation, and turn <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/10\/customer-loyalty\">loyal customers<\/a> into brand advocates who willingly share their positive experiences with your business. Two, the more you engage with your customers, the better you\u2019ll understand their needs. The insights you gather will allow you to provide more tailored solutions, which means happier customers! <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/effective-brand-strategy-microphone-1.png\" alt=\"microphone as symbol of brand voice\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.business2community.com\/small-business\/marketing-small-business-local-community-events-02021150\">Image source<\/a><\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">What are some ways you can get involved in your community? You could connect with other small business owners, attend local events, feature your best customers on your<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/19\/social-media-for-small-business\"> social media pages<\/a>, or even sponsor children\u2019s sports teams from nearby schools. All of these strategies will bring you closer to your customers while incentivizing them to support your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">8. Create and maintain a high-quality blog<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">A well-maintained business blog can bring many benefits including <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/17\/website-visibility\">increased online visibility<\/a> and an increase in sales. Yet, it can also be a surefire way to develop your brand. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As mentioned, branding is all about making your business easily identifiable in a crowd and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/09\/how-to-write-a-blog-post\">blogging<\/a> happens to be an excellent way to communicate the unique personality and intent of your company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Just be sure to choose topics that are relevant to your audience and make your posts easy to read, adding images to hold attention and improve user experience. And don\u2019t be afraid to add some personality to the information you\u2019re relaying. Think about how you would personally converse with a customer about your business or a specific piece of advice, and try to maintain that conversational style when writing your posts.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">9. Develop your visual identity strategically<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Strategy is just as key when deciding on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/22\/visual-marketing-tools\">visual<\/a> branding as it is when crafting your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/31\/brand-personality-messaging\">messaging<\/a>. For example, choosing brand colors is not solely a matter of personal preference. Color psychology should be a guiding factor. After all, research has shown that between 62% and 90% of snap <span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/5bfc8dbab40b9d7dd9054f41\/1543532666986-BMMODURVW298JMOT89H4\/170803-infographic-psychology-of-colors-small.jpg?content-type=image%2Fjpeg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">judgments made by customers are based on color<\/a><span lang=\"EN\">. Why? <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Different colors elicit different emotions and responses, which you can use to influence the way people view and interact with your brand. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/effective-brand-strategy-color-branding-1.png\" alt=\"chart of colors and what they can represent for a brand\" width=\"750\" height=\"482\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/neilpatel.com\/blog\/the-psychology-of-color-how-to-use-colors-to-increase-conversion-rate\/\">Image source<\/a><\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">For example, consider the \u201cvibes\u201d associated with some colors:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Blue can convey dependability and trust, among many other things, making it the most popular and meaningful color by far.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Purple is another favorite and it\u2019s associated with royalty, creativity, and optimism.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Red brings to mind passion, excitement, and boldness, along with several opposites including danger <em>(so be careful with this one!)<\/em><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Green often represents concepts such as <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/28\/growth-strategy\">growth<\/a>, health, and safety.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Yellow is associated with warmth, brightness, and optimism.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Black and white can both be used to convey class, confidence, and simplicity.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">And this is just a taste of the many positive and not-so-positive connotations associated with various colors and shades. There are many nuances to keep in mind so, from your logo to your website design and beyond, be sure to choose your brand colors wisely. Only if you do will your visual branding support your larger brand strategy and bring you more business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">10. Unify your social media accounts <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Besides your website, your social media accounts are among the most easily accessible representatives of your business online. In other words, your accounts provide a prime opportunity to distinguish your brand from the start of a potential customer\u2019s engagement with you.\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/effective-brand-strategy-social-media-1.png\" alt=\"twitter, instagram, facebook logos \" width=\"624\" height=\"350\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sproutsocial.com\/insights\/social-media-ideas\/\">Image source<\/a><\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Whether you use Twitter, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/02\/facebook-marketing-for-small-business\">Facebook<\/a>, Instagram, or other platforms, maintain a cohesive voice and visuals. This will ensure that your followers and potential customers are being met with the same consistency and reliability they\u2019d expect if they were to do business with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">Why put the work into your brand strategy?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Your brand starts with you but, ultimately, it ends with the perception people have of your business and the actions they do or don\u2019t take as a result. (Actions like filling out a form\u2014which is a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/12\/first-party-data\">first-party data collection<\/a> tool that will become increasingly important in a cookieless world.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">By shaping every aspect of your brand purposefully, you can have a positive impact on the perception and response of your audience, not to mention <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/14\/use-branding-to-improve-advertising\">supercharge your advertising<\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Whether your business is large or small, old or new, prioritizing your brand strategy will pay off in more ways than one. Do you want stronger relationships with your audience, a better reputation, more exposure, and increased revenue? If so, put the work into this invaluable part of your small business plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">Ten steps to an effective brand strategy [recap]<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">We covered a lot in this post, so here is a list of the ten tactics we provided\u00a0to help you develop a winning brand strategy:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Pick your niche(s)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Define your business and marketing goals<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Conduct brand research<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Spotlight what makes you different<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Think of your business as a person<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Craft an exceptional customer experience<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Get involved with your community<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Create and maintain a high-quality blog<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Develop your visual identity strategically<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Unify your social media accounts <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"views-element-container contextual-region\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ready to grow your brand and develop stronger customer relationships, a better reputation, and more?
