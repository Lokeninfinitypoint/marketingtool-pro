You are not the only one. Many marketers face the same issue. After all, tracking content marketing KPIs (key performance indicators) can be tricky.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content20marketing20KPIs.png\" alt=\"content marketing KPIs\" width=\"500\" height=\"528\" \/><\/div>\n<p>That\u2019s because while content is a driver of business growth, content KPIs aren\u2019t indirectly linked to your revenue. And also because content can be used to facilitate an array of marketing goals at each stage in your funnel. So depending on your campaign goal, there are different KPIs that will be most relevant for measuring success.<\/p>\n<p>In this post, we\u2019re going to take a look at KPIs that are suitable for four different content marketing goals:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase brand awareness<\/li>\n<li>Increase conversions<\/li>\n<li>Generate more leads<\/li>\n<li>Boost engagement<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But before we get into the details, it\u2019s important to understand why tracking KPIs is essential for all marketers.<\/p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s the importance of tracking KPIs?<\/h2>\n<p>The biggest benefit of tracking <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/23\/content-marketing-trends\">content marketing <\/a>KPIs is that it gives you an idea of whether your content gives you your desired results. It helps you know whether your target audience sees your content, engages with it, and resonates with it.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content20marketing20KPIs20importance20of20measuring.png\" alt=\"content marketing KPIs importance of measuring\" width=\"800\" height=\"306\" \/><\/div>\n<p>What&#8217;s more?\u00a0Tracking KPIs helps you understand if you are using the right content distribution channel and if your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/15\/quality-content-defined\">audience finds it valuable<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Measuring the right KPIs can help you analyze which tactics are working and which aren\u2019t. You can then make relevant changes and adjust your tactics to improve your campaign ROI.<\/h4>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Now that you know why you need to track KPIs, let&#8217;s look at how you can choose relevant ones.<\/p>\n<h2>How to choose relevant content marketing KPIs for your campaigns<\/h2>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https:\/\/contentmarketinginstitute.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/2020_B2B_Research_Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2020 Content Marketing Institute<\/a>\u00a0B2B study, the most tracked metrics for content performance are email engagement, website traffic, and website engagement.\u00a0While all these metrics are important to track, they may not necessarily be relevant to your campaign goals.<\/p>\n<p>So, how do you find the right ones for your campaigns?\u00a0You need to have a clear idea of what you want to achieve from your campaign. Once you set specific <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-plan-goals-objectives-for-small-businesses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content marketing goals<\/a>, you can match those goals with the right metrics and KPIs.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>You need to have a clear idea of what you want to achieve from your campaign. Once you set specific content marketing goals, you can match those goals with the right metrics and KPIs.<\/h4>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Outline your goals and tie them to the KPIs related to them. To give you a better idea, we&#8217;re going to go over the KPIs for the four common campaign goals mentioned above:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/10\/brand-awareness\">Increase\u00a0brand awareness<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/02\/22\/quick-lead-generation\">Generate\u00a0more leads<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/31\/increase-conversions\">Increase conversions<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/13\/ugc-instagram\">Boost\u00a0engagement<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Content marketing KPIs to use for increasing brand awareness<\/h2>\n<p>Does your target audience know you exist? We\u2019re not talking only about the logo or the tagline. Do they know what your brand represents and what products or services you offer?\u00a0That\u2019s what brand awareness is all about.\u00a0The more people that recognize and trust your brand, the more they are likely to buy your products.<\/p>\n<p>So, how do you create awareness using content marketing?\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/shanebarker.com\/blog\/how-to-write-content\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Write engaging content<\/a> that tells your target audience what your brand is about and what you stand for.

The more social shares you get, the large your audience base will be. Tools like BuzzSumo rank the top-performing content on any topic based on their social shares and engagement.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Audience engagement:<\/strong> genuine audience engagement such as comments and interactions on your content can help you understand how consumers feel about your brand.
