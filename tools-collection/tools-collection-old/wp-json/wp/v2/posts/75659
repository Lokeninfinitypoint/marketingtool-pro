These ads appear on Bing when a user searches directly for a relevant professional, brand, or issue that they\u2019re looking for help with. Unlike traditional search ads, Professional Service Ads will feature an image and professional details about the advertiser.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/professional-service-ads-example.jpg\" alt=\"microsoft professional service ads example in serp\" width=\"936\" height=\"551\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/professional-service-ads-example.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/professional-service-ads-example-480x283.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>These new Professional Service Ads can show up atop the Bing SERP, within Bing Maps, and within the Bing Local Answer pack as well.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/professional-service-ads-placements.jpg\" alt=\"microsoft professional service ads placements\" width=\"936\" height=\"554\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75668\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/professional-service-ads-placements.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/professional-service-ads-placements-480x284.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Professional Service Ads are designed with advertisers of all sizes in mind.

They both appear at the top of the SERP and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/02\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps\">local map pack<\/a> for relevant local searches and feature a photo, reviews, and the location of nearby advertisers. However, advertisers will notice some major differences between Google\u2019s Local Services ads and Microsoft\u2019s Professional Service Ads.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Professional Service Ads have a simpler setup than LSAs<\/h3>\n<p>Google\u2019s Local Service Ads are a powerful tool but can be painful to set up. Not only do you have to create your own Local Service Ads business profile outside of Google Ads, but depending on your industry, you may have to submit additional license and insurance information and your team may need to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/google-guarantee\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">complete a series of background checks<\/a> from one of Google\u2019s partners before your Local Service Ad ever shows.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-guarantee-promise-screenshot.jpg\" alt=\"the google guarantee process is one difference between google local services ads and microsoft professional ads\" width=\"936\" height=\"431\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75670\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-guarantee-promise-screenshot.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/google-guarantee-promise-screenshot-480x221.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Microsoft\u2019s Professional Services Ads are designed to be set up quickly and easily. You can create and manage these ads directly within your existing Microsoft Advertising account alongside your other search and audience campaigns. Professional Service Ads take data directly from a feed to serve and do not require a lengthy onboarding or <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/google-guarantee\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">verification proces<\/a>s like Google\u2019s LSAs.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Professional Service Ads have more flexible management and optimization<\/h3>\n<p>Google\u2019s Local Service Ads have a lot of reach and advertisers can freely control and update important parts of their ads, such as their weekly budget or job type. But LSA advertisers lack some of the freedom to optimize or update their Local Service Ads like they would any other Google Ads campaign. Google <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/03\/google-search-terms-report-changes\">doesn\u2019t show any search terms<\/a> from their Local Service Ads and doesn\u2019t allow negative keywords either. Optimizations like bid adjustments or even daily budgets are also not available for Local Service Ads.<\/p>\n<p>Creating a Google Local Services Ad offers limited room for differentiation. Local Services Ads allow advertisers to <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/localservices\/answer\/7549347?visit_id=638179642389787244-659734732&amp;hl=en&amp;rd=1\">highlight limited information<\/a> from a checklist of options within their business bio. Google also has very strict <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/localservices\/answer\/9091766\">policies for your photos and headshots<\/a> which can leave even the most unique business serving nearly identical Local Service Ads to their competitors.<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft\u2019s Professional Services ads offer similar levels of control and optimization as their other search campaigns\u2013which include the ability to set and control daily budgets, bid adjustments, review search terms, and add negative keywords.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, the business data feeds used for Microsoft\u2019s Professional Service Ads allow advertisers to provide much more customized details to optimize their ads for specific job types, highlight different messages, or test more dynamic images to show alongside their ads.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Differences in pricing<\/h3>\n<p>Google\u2019s Local Service Ads are unique from the rest of their search ads. Instead of being charged per every click, advertisers are charged per each lead that comes directly from their LSAs.<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft\u2019s Professional Service Ads are priced per ad click, like most of their other campaigns.<\/p>\n<div id=\"howto\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to get started with Microsoft Professional Service Ads<\/h2>\n<p>To get started, you\u2019ll first need to <a href=\"https:\/\/help.ads.microsoft.com\/#apex\/ads\/en\/60135\/-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">create a data feed for Microsoft\u2019s Professional Service Ads<\/a>. For individual practitioners, this can be a simple spreadsheet that you upload once into Microsoft Advertising to get started. Larger organizations may need a more dynamic approach to creating and managing a feed as their team of professionals, services, and specialties continue to change.<\/p>\n<p>This data feed is just a structured way to pass along details about your business to Microsoft so that it can better target your ad and make it easier for prospective clients to contact you. While it may seem overwhelmingly technical at first glance, most of the information within your feed is simple to provide, mundane, and trivial for most professionals.<\/p>\n<h3>Create a Professional Service Ads feed<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>I recommend starting by downloading <a href=\"https:\/\/ui.ads.microsoft.com\/campaign\/vnext\/feeds\/dynamicdata?aid=141371798&amp;cid=251051268&amp;uid=98339929\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this template<\/a> from Microsoft. This includes all the required and optional attributes for these campaigns properly formatted and includes sample values for each attribute.<\/li>\n<li>Start off first by filling in the required attributes, listed below.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Attribute<\/strong><\/td>\n<td><strong>Description<\/strong><\/td>\n<td><strong>Example<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Description<\/td>\n<td>A short description of the company or professional.<\/td>\n<td>Luxury real estate company<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Final URL <\/strong><\/td>\n<td>The same domain as your website. Must begin with http:\/\/ or https:\/\/.<\/p>\n<p>This will not be shown in the ad.<\/td>\n<td>http:\/\/www.contoso.com\/seattle\/id<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>ID <\/strong><\/td>\n<td>Unique ID of the item comprised of any sequence of letters and digits.<\/p>\n<p>This will not be shown in the ad.<\/td>\n<td>AB1234<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Name <\/strong><\/td>\n<td>The name of the company or professional.<\/p>\n<p>If it&#8217;s a professional, put first name + last name.<\/td>\n<td>David Johnson<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Profession <\/strong><\/td>\n<td>The type of profession.<\/p>\n<p>This will not be shown in the ad. Instead, we&#8217;ll use this to match ads with terms people search for.<\/p>\n<p><em>Note:<\/em> You must choose one of the following examples for your ad to serve.<\/td>\n<td>Doctor &amp; clinic<\/p>\n<p>Financial advisor<\/p>\n<p>Insurance service<\/p>\n<p>Real estate service<\/p>\n<p>Tax service<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Target ad group<\/td>\n<td>The name of the targeted Professional services ad group.<\/p>\n<p>This will not be shown in the ad.<\/td>\n<td>Real-Estate-Placement-AdGroup<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Target campaign <\/strong><\/td>\n<td>The name of the targeted Professional services ads campaign.<\/p>\n<p>This will not be shown in the ad.<\/td>\n<td>Real_Estate<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Provide as much relevant information on the optional attributes as possible. The more information you provide, the more detail that Microsoft has to optimize your Professional Service Ads targeting and trigger your ad for relevant searches.<\/li>\n<li>Name your \u201ctarget campaign(s)\u201d and \u201ctarget ad group(s).\u201d These are required attributes that will need to match the name of the campaigns and ad groups you build later on. While most businesses may be able to run just one campaign with one ad group to launch their Professional Service Ads, if you ever want to structure your account to have multiple different campaigns or ad groups, you will need to update these attributes in your feed.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>You can update your feeds at any time to add new teammates, services, details, or adjust your account structure.<\/p>\n<h3>Upload a Professional Services Ad feed<\/h3>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve prepped your data feeds, save them as a CSV, TSV, XLSX, or ZIP file and log in to your Microsoft Advertising account.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>From the top menu in Microsoft Advertising, select &#8220;Tools&#8221; &gt; &#8220;Business data.&#8221;<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/professional-service-ads-upload-data-feed.jpg\" alt=\"microsoft professional service ads - add data feed\" width=\"936\" height=\"420\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75673\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/professional-service-ads-upload-data-feed.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/professional-service-ads-upload-data-feed-480x215.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/li>\n<li>Here, from the left-hand menu, select \u201cDynamic Data Feeds.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Click on the blue \u201cUpload\u201d drop-down and select \u201cProfessional Services.\u201d<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/professional-service-ads-dynamic-data-feeds.jpg\" alt=\"microsoft professional service ads - dynamic data feed\" width=\"424\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75674\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/professional-service-ads-dynamic-data-feeds.jpg 424w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/professional-service-ads-dynamic-data-feeds-212x300.jpg 212w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px\" \/><\/li>\n<li>Name your data feed and select the file to upload. At this time, you can preview your feed to troubleshoot any issues and then upload the feed to Microsoft Advertising.<\/li>\n<li>(Optional) If you anticipate that you\u2019ll be constantly updating this feed because your company has a large, dynamic team or because you will be making regular changes to your availability, you can schedule Microsoft to import a dynamic feed from a URL. Click on the recently uploaded feed and select \u201cSchedules\u201d to set a regular schedule for Microsoft to reimport this feed.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Create a Professional Service Ad campaign<\/h3>\n<p>Once your Professional Service Feed is created and uploaded, creating a Professional Service campaign is very similar to your other Microsoft Advertising campaigns, with a few notable quirks.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/11\/21\/ppc-keyword-research-guide\">search campaign<\/a> and name it <em>exactly<\/em> as you\u2019ve named it within the \u201cTarget Campaign\u201d attribute within your feed. If this doesn\u2019t match that attribute exactly, it will not serve any Professional Service Ads.<\/li>\n<li>Follow the usual steps to set your campaign\u2019s budget, location targeting, and other campaign settings. You can add a disclaimer to your ad during this process. Do <strong>not<\/strong> enable <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/10\/dynamic-search-ads\">dynamic search ads<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Create your ad group and name it exactly as you\u2019ve named it within the \u201cTarget Ad Group\u201d attribute within your feed. Again, if this doesn\u2019t match exactly, it will not serve any Professional Service Ads.<\/li>\n<li>You\u2019ll need to create a \u201cplaceholder\u201d keyword for this ad group. Professional Service Ads don\u2019t use keywords to target their ads, but in order for the ad group to function, there needs to be an active keyword. I recommend creating a long-tailed exact-match keyword with no expected search volume to prevent this placeholder from serving ads.<\/li>\n<li>You\u2019ll also need to create a \u201cplaceholder\u201d Responsive Search Ad for the ad group. Similarly, this Responsive Search Ad will never show, but its Final URL will be featured as the Display URL within your Professional Search Ads. The headlines and descriptions, however, will not be included.<\/li>\n<li>Hit save and launch your new Professional Services Ads!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div id=\"bestpractices\"><\/div>\n<h2>Professional Service Ads best practices<\/h2>\n<p>Ready to get started with Professional Service Ads? Use these best practices to make sure your campaigns are successful.<\/p>\n<h3><strong><\/strong>1. Run Professional Service Ads along with traditional search campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>Professional Service Ads should be treated as a great compliment to your search ads, not as a replacement. By running both simultaneously, you can have multiple ads appear on the same SERP and draw more attention to your practice. Since Professional Service Ads compete in a separate ad auction from text ads, you shouldn\u2019t expect your search ads to have any change in performance by running Professional Service Ads.<\/p>\n<h3><strong><\/strong>2. Start with the right budget<\/h3>\n<p>Microsoft recommends that national brands looking to promote their services across the entirety of the United States should start with between $100-500 daily budget for their Professional Service Ads. Local businesses need much less budget to target their market. Microsoft recommends that local businesses start with 20% of their current PPC budget on Professional Service Ads for the markets they target.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\ud83d\uded1 Worried you&#8217;re wasting spend in Google Ads?

Pay attention to bidding<\/h3>\n<p>Bidding is managed at the ad group level. To get started, Microsoft recommends using manual or enhanced <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/15\/google-ads-benchmarks\">CPC<\/a> bidding and setting the bid between $3-5 CPC. You can freely adjust this based on the performance of your ads.<\/p>\n<h3><strong><\/strong>4. Review your search terms<\/h3>\n<p>Unlike Google\u2019s Local Search Ads, these Professional Service Ads will collect data on the search terms they triggered for as well as their associated costs and conversions. Without keywords in your Professional Service Ad campaigns, Microsoft may trigger your ads for some unexpected search terms, so plan to review your traffic regularly and add negative keywords as you see fit.<\/p>\n<h3><strong><\/strong>5. Include audiences<\/h3>\n<p>These Professional Service Ads allow you to refine your targeting with demographics and audiences, like your other search campaigns. You can use remarketing, in-market, custom audiences, or even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/24\/bing-ads-linkedin-profile-targeting\">LinkedIn profile targeting<\/a> in Microsoft Advertising to target, exclude, or adjust your bids for more valuable prospects.<\/p>\n<h2>Maximize Professional Service Ads performance<\/h2>\n<p>This new ad type to Microsoft Advertising is an interesting one for many industries.
