Gemini was added to leverage the power of mobile and native advertising together; their native ads are optimized for tablet and mobile devices.<\/p>\n<p>Yahoo Gemini powers native ads that put sponsored brand content in front of Yahoo&#8217;s 400 million monthly users in contextually relevant ways.<\/p>\n<h2>But First\u2026Why Native Ads?<\/h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not yet familiar with the format, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/06\/04\/native-advertising\">native advertising<\/a> is the increasingly popular method of reaching audiences with contextual messaging that appears alongside \u2013 or in-stream with \u2013 editorial content. Some describe it as a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/media-network-outbrain-partner-zone\/native-advertising-quality-scalability\">subset<\/a> of content marketing; others as content&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/yahoo.tumblr.com\/post\/77199231544\/introducing-yahoo-gemini\">sponsored twin<\/a>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/yahoo-gemini-native-ads-1.png\" alt=\"yahoo gemini native ad network\" width=\"511\" height=\"451\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Whatever your definition, native advertising has proven incredibly effective, especially against more traditional web advertising formats. A <a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/jeffbercovici\/2013\/05\/03\/study-shows-native-ads-outperform-banners-mostly\/\">Sharethrough study<\/a>, for example, found that people were 25% more likely to look at native ads than banner ads and viewed them 53% more frequently. Participants in that study were also more likely to share native ads with their contacts and demonstrated greater purchase intent after viewing them, compared to other types of ads. In the U.S., almost three-quarters of publishers already <a href=\"http:\/\/www.emarketer.com\/Article\/How-Native-Ad-Campaigns-Shaping-Up\/1010064\">offer native advertising<\/a> on their sites.<\/p>\n<p>In their presentation <a href=\"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/dh\/ap\/us\/ccs\/b2b\/Yahoo_Gemini_Webinar_Series_-_Part_3_-_Yahoo_Gemini_Vision_and_Impact.pdf\">Yahoo Gemini Vision &amp; Impact<\/a>, Yahoo shares a number of other stats on native advertising:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Perceived effectiveness is fueling marketer investment in native ads, up from $1.4B in 2012 to $3.1B in 2014.<\/li>\n<li>Only 4% of marketers say they&#8217;re completely satisfied with their mobile ad campaigns.<\/li>\n<li>95% of digital advertising pros buy mobile ads.<\/li>\n<li>Investment in native ads is expected to rise to $5B a year by 2017.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Despite their omnipresence and enthusiasm among advertisers, 85% of consumers have <a href=\"http:\/\/aytm.com\/blog\/daily-survey-results\/native-advertising-survey\/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=native-advertising-survey\">never even heard<\/a> of native ads.\u00a0 The FTC has been clear in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/news-events\/press-releases\/2013\/12\/ftc-announces-agenda-panelists-native-advertising-workshop\">their position<\/a> on clearly marketing native advertisements as such, yet only 79% of advertisers understand that native content must be identified as advertisements. Clearly, it&#8217;s a format with opportunity, yet there is much to be learned.<\/p>\n<h2>What Is Yahoo Gemini?<\/h2>\n<p>Yahoo&#8217;s Gemini offering helps advertisers reach mobile consumers in a contextually relevant, effective way: through native ads tailored for mobile. It&#8217;s a marketplace worth considering; Yahoo has more than <a href=\"http:\/\/moneymorning.com\/2014\/04\/15\/how-to-play-yahoo-nasdaq-yhoo-stock-after-earnings\/\">430 million<\/a> monthly mobile users who average <a href=\"https:\/\/advertising.yahoo.com\/Advertisers\/Mobile\/index.htm\">104 minutes per month<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Where Google consolidated desktop and tablet paid search with the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/08\/how-to-write-an-introduction\">introduction<\/a> of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/07\/10\/enhanced-campaigns-faq\">Enhanced Campaigns<\/a>, Yahoo is offering advertisers the ability to manage mobile and tablet ads from a separate interface with Gemini. This is an opportunity to get more granular with your search strategy.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/yahoo-gemini-1.jpg\" alt=\"yahoo gemini\" width=\"526\" height=\"419\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Image from <a href=\"https:\/\/help.yahoo.com\/adv\/index?page=content&amp;id=SOL2151&amp;actp=search&amp;viewlocale=en_US&amp;searchid=1398653136753&amp;locale=en_US&amp;y=PROD_YAM\">Yahoo<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Gemini advertisers have targeting options including geotargeting, broad and exact match, and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/04\/negative-keyword-list\">negative keywords<\/a>. They plan to offer sitelink, location and call extensions; phrase match; day parting; and device, language, radius and operating system targeting in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, Yahoo is in the process of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adotas.com\/2014\/03\/spotlight-on-search-yahoo-gemini-vs-google-enhanced-campaigns\/\">rolling the ads out<\/a> to greater audience segments. In March, just 1% of mobile search traffic would see Gemini ads, though they planned to increase in April and beyond. Yahoo plans to have all accounts migrated and set up in Gemini by April 30.<\/p>\n<p>Yahoo&#8217;s native ads appear on the Yahoo homepage and in the following Yahoo products: Mail, Mobile Search, News, Sports, Finance, Celebrity, Movies, TV, Music, Travel, Homes, Autos and My Yahoo. Ads automatically adapt to the device type, whether computer, mobile or tablet.<\/p>\n<h2>How Does Gemini Work With Bing Ads?<\/h2>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t. Currently, Bing Ads campaigns are incompatible with Gemini, which is proprietary to Yahoo and built on a separate codebase.<\/p>\n<p>Bing offered this explanation of the impact of Yahoo Gemini on Bing Ads:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Bing Ads provides search ads on all devices, including mobile devices, across Bing and Yahoo search results pages, as well as our network of partner sites. Only a portion of search ads on Yahoo\u2019s mobile search pages will be provided by Yahoo Gemini instead of Bing Ads. Bing Ads remains the only platform for purchasing mobile search ads on Bing and its network of partner sites and also delivers search ads on the highest performing\u00a0mobile search placements (i.e., topmost on page) for web searches on Yahoo\u2019s mobile\u00a0search pages.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In case that wasn&#8217;t clear, <a href=\"http:\/\/advertise.bingads.microsoft.com\/en-us\/mobile-gemini-faq\">Bing&#8217;s FAQ page on Gemini<\/a> also says,<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Bing Ads is the only unified platform for advertisers to manage paid search advertising across all devices including PC, tablet and mobile devices, in order to achieve scale across the entire Yahoo Bing Network.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adotas.com\/2014\/03\/spotlight-on-search-yahoo-gemini-vs-google-enhanced-campaigns\/\">Adotas<\/a>, Gemini ads will appear on more partner sites over time, while Yahoo will work to create parity between Yahoo Search Ads and Bing Ads.<\/p>\n<h2>How Do You Create Ads &amp; Campaigns in Yahoo Gemini?<\/h2>\n<p><strong>1.<\/strong> <strong>Start by signing in<\/strong> to the <a href=\"https:\/\/admanager.yahoo.com\">Yahoo Ad Manager<\/a>.

Set up payments. <\/strong>Before you can start your first ad campaign, you need to fund your account.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to add a minimum of $25.00 to your Yahoo advertiser account.

This report will show you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The number of times your ads were shown to users.<\/li>\n<li>The number of times users have clicked on your ads.<\/li>\n<li>The install-click rate is the number of installs divided by the number of clicks you received. It indicates how often users install your app after they clicked through the ads. Try comparing it to the install-impression rate to see how effective you ads are overall.<\/li>\n<li>The amount you have spent for the user actions that you have achieved. Please note that this should be used as guidance only as the amount you are charged may differ.<\/li>\n<li>The average cost per click is the average amount you have paid for each click. Compare trends by selecting between the two drop-downs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In the Reporting tab, information is stored for 90 days and includes impressions, clicks and CTRs broken down by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Campaigns<\/li>\n<li>Ad Groups &#8211; Migrated Mobile Search Only<\/li>\n<li>Ads<\/li>\n<li>Keywords &#8211; Mobile Search Only<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Note, these reports are not real-time; there is an 8-hour lag between impressions and reporting in the interface.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Scheduling &amp; Exporting Reports<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You can set up automatic reports using the Schedule button in the Reporting tab.
