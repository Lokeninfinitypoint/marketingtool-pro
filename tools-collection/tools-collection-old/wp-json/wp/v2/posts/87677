Increased and improved control over Google search campaign placements<\/h3>\n<p>There have been a few <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-chrome-sale\">Google search<\/a> updates to the user experience and placements, like conducting a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/ads-commerce\/google-lens-ai-overviews-ads-marketers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Shopping search with Google Lens<\/a> and showing ads in the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/ads-commerce\/google-lens-ai-overviews-ads-marketers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google AI Overview<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/google-ads-news-search.webp\" alt=\"google ads news - search and shopping\" width=\"231\" height=\"433\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87715 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/google-ads-news-search.webp 231w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/google-ads-news-search-160x300.webp 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/google-ads-news-search-example.webp\" alt=\"google ads news - search example\" width=\"239\" height=\"434\" class=\"wp-image-87710 size-full aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/google-ads-news-search-example.webp 239w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/google-ads-news-search-example-165x300.webp 165w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But for us die-hard marketers, there were a few updates that feel a bit more technical and like bigger wins for campaign management.<\/p>\n<p>First, we have brand inclusions that help keep your branded search campaigns focused on the right brands and only those brands. The catch? Your campaign has to be opted into the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/13389795?sjid=14648858289959188207-NA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">campaign-level broad match<\/a> setting. Personally, I\u2019m not a big fan of this for non-brand campaigns, but if you\u2019re using brand inclusions to focus and you still have access to negative keywords (which you do), then this is a good option for branded search campaigns.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/google-ads-news-brand-list.webp\" alt=\"google ads news - example brand list\" width=\"803\" height=\"311\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87716 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/google-ads-news-brand-list.webp 803w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/google-ads-news-brand-list-480x186.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 803px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Those same <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/18\/google-ads-restrictions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">brand lists<\/a> can also be leveraged as exclusions for Dynamic Search Ad campaigns, helping you control your DSA campaigns from hitting on branded search queries, which is great, especially if you\u2019re leveraging the brand campaign strategy above.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of search queries, Google announced a slight easing to the controls that block advertisers from seeing all of the search terms in their reports. <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/15070437?sjid=14648858289959188207-NA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Misspellings will now be grouped under their correctly spelled query<\/a> to unlock a little more insight. Google expects this will increase the percentage of search terms that are visible by about 9% in the average account. It might not be a huge number, but anything that gets us more insights is more than welcome.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/google-ads-news-negative-keywords-1.webp\" alt=\"google ads news - negative keywords \" width=\"786\" height=\"311\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87721 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/google-ads-news-negative-keywords-1.webp 786w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/google-ads-news-negative-keywords-1-480x190.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 786px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Lastly, Google didn\u2019t stop with the misspelling changes in search terms. <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/15070437?sjid=14648858289959188207-NA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Negative keywords now include misspellings<\/a>. Again, this news is more than welcome from a marketer who has been adding tens and hundreds of negative keywords simply because they were spelled incorrectly differently than any previous query. With the new logic, we now will only need to add the correctly spelled version of the negative keyword we want and Google will also block the misspelled version of those terms (see more ways to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/losing-money-in-google-ads\">maximize your Google Ads budget<\/a>).<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-news-performance-max\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. More transparency for Google Ads Performance Max campaign insights<\/h3>\n<p>Google Ads has rolled out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-performance-max-updates-2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Performance Max campaign updates<\/a> frequently over the last year, but for me, the biggest impacts were all based on better insights and controls for PMAX campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>First, there are a bunch of new insights about different aspects of your PMAX campaigns to help you understand what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not. Whether you need to know <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/10725056?sjid=3315338027764566410-NC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">which assets are performing best<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/13685469?sjid=3315338027764566410-NC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">understand how your budget is pacing<\/a>, look into which <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/11372871?sjid=3315338027764566410-NC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">audience segments<\/a> are responding well, or <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/7103314?sjid=3315338027764566410-NC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">determine if you\u2019re losing impression share<\/a> on search and shopping to competitors, there\u2019s a new insights section for each of those.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/google-ads-news-audience-insights.webp\" alt=\"google ads news - audience insights\" width=\"901\" height=\"471\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87712 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/google-ads-news-audience-insights.webp 901w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/google-ads-news-audience-insights-480x251.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 901px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Additionally, we now have better insights into the black box that used to be (and still kind of is to some degree) Performance Max ad service.<\/p>\n<p>With the content suitability center, advertisers can now see placements of ad services on YouTube and the Search Partner Network. What\u2019s more, we can now use account-level placement exclusions to block our ads from showing on certain placements as well.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/google-ads-news-inventory-expansion.webp\" alt=\"google ads news - performance max inventory expansion graphic\" width=\"830\" height=\"450\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87722 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/google-ads-news-inventory-expansion.webp 830w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/google-ads-news-inventory-expansion-480x260.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 830px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-news-demand-gen\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Changes to Demand Gen audience size and placement controls<\/h3>\n<p>There were a handful of updates to Demand Gen campaigns, but here are the two that stood out to me.<\/p>\n<p>First, the minimum audience size for lookalike audiences was lowered from 1,000 to 100 users. I\u2019m often frustrated with how Google\u2019s controls make it harder for smaller businesses to advertise on the platform and this was a very direct step in the right direction. Now the barrier to entry is lower for SMBs, which is a win in my book, even if<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/22\/demand-gen-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Demand Gen<\/a> isn\u2019t the campaign type I would start with.<\/p>\n<p>The second update for Demand Gen was another tick in the advertiser control column on the scoreboard. With <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/14552284?sjid=14648858289959188207-NA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">creative preferences<\/a>, advertisers can control which placements their videos will show up in rather than having all videos show in all placements. That means that if you have assets that don\u2019t look quite right in one placement, you can prevent them from showing there and prioritize other assets instead.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/google-ads-news-media-formats.webp\" alt=\"google ads news - media formats\" width=\"591\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87713 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/google-ads-news-media-formats.webp 591w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/google-ads-news-media-formats-480x487.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 591px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udcb8<strong> Ready to save big in Google Ads next year?<\/strong> Download our free guide to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/ways-to-save-money-in-google-ads?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_SaveMoneyinGoogleAds_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">6 easy ways to save money in Google Ads<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-news-display\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. AI enhancements for Google Display Ads<\/h3>\n<p>Display got a good amount of AI inserted for creatives. With the new solutions, advertisers will be able to animate static images, expand and adjust the aspect ratios of existing images, as well as enhance resolution and sharpness. Overall, these are some pretty great options in a world where hard creative is hard to come by.<\/p>\n<p>Also,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/23\/google-display-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Google Display Ads<\/a> have expanded their network and will now have inventory on X (formerly known as Twitter), so if your audience is there and you want to reach them without using the actual X Ads interface, you can do so via GDN.<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-first-party-data-news\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. More options available for first-party data usage<\/h3>\n<p>First-party data has been a hot topic ever since Google vowed to get rid of third-party cookies in January 2020. Since then many deadlines have been pushed and pushed, ultimately resulting in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-privacy-sandbox-update\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google reversing course in 2024<\/a> and stating that third-party cookies are here to stay (for the time being).<\/p>\n<p>But even with that reversal, marketers (and Google) have picked up on how valuable this data is and how it can enrich your marketing.<\/p>\n<p>With that, Google had two changes this year to help enhance your first-party data. First, they simplified <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads-data-manager\/answer\/13761872?sjid=14648858289959188207-NA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads Data Manager<\/a> to centralize all data integrations in one location and also control all access to third-party platforms like Salesforce, Marketo, HubSpot, and more.<\/p>\n<p>For anyone trying to enrich their data with first-party insights, this is a much simpler interface to work with that helps minimize the steps from one part of the platform to another.<\/p>\n<p>The second update is a bit more technical. Confidential matching enables advertisers to leverage their first-party data with Google\u2019s measurement and audience solutions. The details can be found <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads-data-manager\/answer\/14577185?sjid=14648858289959188207-NA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>, but essentially, your first-party information will remain secure despite also being leveraged in your Google Ads account. A win-win.<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-updates\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. New tools for image and video asset generation across campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>The last set of updates also isn\u2019t for a specific type of campaign but does impact quite a few campaign types that you have around the Google Ads system.<\/p>\n<p>Generating new creatives for your campaigns just got a lot easier with new tools for asset and image generation directly within the Google Ads interface.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also now easier to take existing assets like images and videos and edit them to change the image, enhance your videos, and highlight products in a different way than they\u2019re being shown in your Merchant Center Feed.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/google-ads-news-video-enhancements.webp\" alt=\"google ads news - creative enhancements\" width=\"417\" height=\"337\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87714 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/google-ads-news-video-enhancements.webp 417w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/google-ads-news-video-enhancements-300x242.webp 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Lastly, you don\u2019t have to rely solely on Google Ads for asset creation and collaboration. They\u2019ve partnered with third-party design platforms like <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-use-canva\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Canva<\/a>, Smartly, Pencil, and Typeface to integrate directly with Google Ads and make the upload process that much easier (here are some tips to write <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-copy\">Google Ads copy<\/a>, too).<\/p>\n<h2>What this Google Ads news means for your business next year<\/h2>\n<p>Google is constantly making new updates to the Google Ads platform. While we still see lots of AI and automated solutions coming down the pipe, I\u2019m encouraged to see more controls for advertisers as well. As I mentioned earlier, this isn\u2019t all of the updates from 2024, but hopefully, this list of updates gets you paying attention to the new options we have and excited to try out some of the new solutions from the Google Ads platform.
