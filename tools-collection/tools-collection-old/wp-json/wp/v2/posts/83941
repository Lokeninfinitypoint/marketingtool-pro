Inventory filters<\/h3>\n<p>The first and broadest-reaching control is Inventory Filters. These filters allow you to select the type of organic content you\u2019re willing to show next to in a given placement based on the sensitivity of the topic.<\/p>\n<p>There are three levels of sensitivity for content.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-inventory-filters.webp\" alt=\"facebook ads brand suitability and safety - inventory filter definition screenshot\" width=\"833\" height=\"287\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83957 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-inventory-filters.webp 833w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-inventory-filters-480x165.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 833px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Limited inventory<\/strong> is the most restricted and your ads will not show next to any sensitive content, but as Facebook warns, this could lower your reach and increase costs as you\u2019re serving your ads to a smaller number of users.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Moderate inventory<\/strong> is what advertisers are opted into by default for in-content placements, or Facebook in-stream videos, ads on Facebook Reels, and ads on Instagram Reels and Meta Audience Network.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Expanded inventory<\/strong> has the widest reach and your ads will show across all content that adheres to the content monetization policies. This is the default targeting for all feed placements like Facebook Feed, Facebook Reels, Instagram mobile feeds, and Instagram Reels.<\/p>\n<p>So the question then is, \u201cwhat do each of these filter levels mean?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>By default, content like all full nudity, excessive violence, terrorist acts, or misinformation, which is identified by third-party fact-checkers doesn\u2019t meet the Facebook and Instagram Community Standards &amp; Guidelines and won\u2019t be eligible for monetization, so your ads won\u2019t show next to that content.<\/p>\n<p>But beyond those initial standards, there are different categorizations by each placement on the Facebook network. While it might get a bit convoluted, you can check out the types of content that will show in each placement in these tables below:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/791334188545832?id=1769156093197771\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Feed Ads<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/468154293719742?id=1769156093197771\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In-Content Placements<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/2122368217844346?id=1769156093197771\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Audience Network<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>What\u2019s likely more useful for today is knowing how to apply these levels of control. There are two options for this.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-brand-safety-and-suitability.webp\" alt=\"facebook ads brand safety and suitability menu screenshot\" width=\"612\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83953 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-brand-safety-and-suitability.webp 612w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-brand-safety-and-suitability-480x471.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 612px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>First is at the account level. Head over to your left-hand navigation and click on <strong>Brand safety and suitability<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-brand-suitability-audience-networks.webp\" alt=\"facebook ads brand safety and suitability - inventory filters menu screenshot\" width=\"758\" height=\"607\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83958 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-brand-suitability-audience-networks.webp 758w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-brand-suitability-audience-networks-480x384.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 758px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>From there, you\u2019ll have a few buttons to click to get the screen above, including clicking the <strong>Change <\/strong>link next to the <strong>Inventory filter<\/strong> section at the top, then opening the two drop-down arrows next to the Facebook in-stream videos, Ads on Facebook Reels and Ads on Instagram Reels and Audience Network sections.<\/p>\n<p>After that, it\u2019s pretty straightforward. You can choose the inventory level you want for each section by checking the box next to the option you prefer. Then, if you want a different setting for the Audience Network, you just have to uncheck the box next to the \u201c<strong>Keep the same setting for the Audience Network<\/strong>\u201d message and adjust that as well.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-brand-safety-exclusions.jpg\" alt=\"facebook ads brand safety - advantage placements exclusions\" width=\"657\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83947 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-brand-safety-exclusions.jpg 657w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-brand-safety-exclusions-480x438.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 657px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The second option is to adjust this inventory filter at the ad set level. For that, you simply need to navigate to the campaign and ad set you want to adjust, then scroll down to the <strong>Placement<\/strong> controls, open the arrow at the bottom for \u201c<strong>More<\/strong>,\u201d then click the edit pencil next to the <strong>Inventory filters<\/strong> and adjust to your desired settings.<\/p>\n<div id=\"placement-controls\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Placement controls<\/h3>\n<p>While we\u2019re here, let\u2019s discuss the placement controls you have available in Facebook Ads as well. Although it\u2019s not focused explicitly on \u201cbrand safety,&#8221; advertisers do have control over which placements their ads show around the Meta Ads Network.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-placement-controls.webp\" alt=\"facebook ads - placement controls\" width=\"893\" height=\"377\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83959 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-placement-controls.webp 893w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-placement-controls-480x203.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 893px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you were to edit your placements and shift to <strong>manual placements<\/strong>, you then have a whole list of all the placements for Facebook that you can opt into or out of.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-placement-selection.webp\" alt=\"facebook ads - placement opt outs\" width=\"675\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83949 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-placement-selection.webp 675w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-placement-selection-480x427.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 675px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There are check boxes for the four major networks at the top: Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and Audience Network. Then below, you can select individual placements within each grouping to further customize your ad placements.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 Be sure you&#8217;re targeting the right audience with our free guide to<a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteFBAdTargeting.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_FacebookAdTargetingStrategiesForPrivacy_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> privacy-first Facebook Ads strategies<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"block-lists\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Block lists<\/h3>\n<p>Taking your controls for placements one step further, Facebook allows advertisers to use Block Lists to prevent your ads from showing alongside specific placements around the Facebook network.<\/p>\n<p>These aren\u2019t to be confused with the placement targeting we just talked about. This goes one step further and allows you to prevent your ads from showing on specific monetizing partners content.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-delivery-reports.webp\" alt=\"facebook ads brand safety and suitability - delivery report\" width=\"272\" height=\"461\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83960 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-delivery-reports.webp 272w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-delivery-reports-177x300.webp 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 272px) 100vw, 272px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>First, let\u2019s start by talking about how you would find out where your ads have shown. In the Brand Safety and Suitability manager, head down to Delivery Reports.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-placement-type.webp\" alt=\"facebook ads brand safety and suitability - placement delivery report screenshot\" width=\"898\" height=\"297\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83952 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-placement-type.webp 898w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-placement-type-480x159.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 898px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There, you\u2019ll then choose which placement type you\u2019d like to see a delivery report for.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-publisher-report.webp\" alt=\"facebook ads brand safety and suitability - publisher selection\" width=\"878\" height=\"523\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83951 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-publisher-report.webp 878w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-publisher-report-480x286.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 878px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If I choose Facebook in-stream videos, I\u2019ll get a report that looks like this. Each of these is a specific page one of our ads showed up on. Each of the other reports will show you something similar.<\/p>\n<p>From here, you can click on each of the listings to see what the page looks like and determine if you\u2019re okay with your ads showing on that page or not.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re fine with a page, you can leave it be. But if you want to prevent your ads from showing on a specific site, but you want to continue in the Facebook in-stream video placement, you can add individual placements to a <strong>Block List<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-publisher-block-list.webp\" alt=\"facebook ads brand safety and suitability - add to block list option screenshot\" width=\"757\" height=\"550\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83950 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-publisher-block-list.webp 757w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-publisher-block-list-480x349.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 757px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can do that by checking the box next to the placement you want to exclude, and then clicking<strong> Add to a Block List<\/strong> from this page.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-brand-safety-and-suitability-block-list.webp\" alt=\"facebook ads brand safety and suitability - block list creation\" width=\"859\" height=\"421\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83954 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-brand-safety-and-suitability-block-list.webp 859w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-brand-safety-and-suitability-block-list-480x235.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 859px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Or you could head to the main <strong>Block List<\/strong> area in the <strong>Brand Safety and Suitability<\/strong> section, click \u201cCreate New\u201d and then you\u2019ll see a screen that looks like this where you can upload a block list full of the placement URLs you want to exclude. Either method is fine, but I personally find the option with the placement reports much easier to manage and update.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-brand-safety-and-suitability-ad-set-settings.webp\" alt=\"facebook brand safety and suitability - ad set settings\" width=\"736\" height=\"492\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83955 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-brand-safety-and-suitability-ad-set-settings.webp 736w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-brand-safety-and-suitability-ad-set-settings-480x321.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 736px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Lastly, block lists can be applied at the campaign\/ad set level if you have only a specific set of ads that needs to be in guarded locations. Just like the previous section controls earlier, head to the <strong>placement controls<\/strong> at the ad set level and under the<strong> more<\/strong> option, you\u2019ll have the ability to add a block list to your ad set.<\/p>\n<div id=\"facebook-ads-content-exclusions\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Content type exclusions<\/h3>\n<p>Obviously, the last screenshot gives away the last two types of controls we\u2019re going to talk about. These can both be applied at either the account or campaign\/ad set level under placements, but the next control is going to be back in the main <strong>Brand Safety and Suitability<\/strong> section. Content type exclusions allow you to exclude your ads from showing next to content based on the type of content.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-content-exclusions.webp\" alt=\"facebook ads brand safety and suitability - content exclusion screenshot\" width=\"839\" height=\"397\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83956 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-content-exclusions.webp 839w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-content-exclusions-480x227.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 839px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The controls are pretty straightforward. You can exclude Live videos, In-stream non-partner publishers, and Reels from non-partner publishers. The benefit of doing this is simply additional control over your ad placements. For In-stream and Reels placements, you\u2019ll notice the distinction of \u201cnon-partner\u201d publishers, meaning folks who have not signed up for monetization and therefore aren\u2019t subject to some of the same community standards.<\/p>\n<p>Live videos are also highly unpredictable, so excluding them from your campaigns may help alleviate any concerns about that type of content.<\/p>\n<div id=\"facebook-ads-topic-exclusions\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Topic exclusions<\/h3>\n<p>The last option we\u2019re going to talk about is almost a no-brainer given the climate in public discourse over the last half-decade or so, but<strong> Topic<\/strong> exclusions allow you to stop your Facebook in-stream video ads from appearing in on-demand videos about certain topics.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-topic-exclusions.webp\" alt=\"facebook ads brand safety and suitability - topic exclusion screenshot\" width=\"900\" height=\"322\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83948 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-topic-exclusions.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/facebook-ads-topic-exclusions-480x172.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Just like content exclusions, this can be applied at the account or campaign\/ad set level and is just a short list that only allows for checking or unchecking certain boxes. Whether it\u2019s Gaming, News, Politics, or Religion, there\u2019s a simple checkbox at the account level that you can opt into and keep your content from showing next to those discussions.<\/p>\n<h2>Use Facebook brand suitability controls<\/h2>\n<p>Just as Facebook says throughout the Brand Safety and Suitability controls section in the accounts, while they apply brand suitability controls as effectively as possible, they can&#8217;t guarantee that all content and publishers will be compliant or aligned with your unique brand suitability standards. That\u2019s where these controls come into play.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you need to appease a very picky client or are running into issues with unsavory content, the brand safety and suitability controls within Facebook Ads can give you some pretty easy ways to ensure your ads (or your client\u2019s ads) only show next to brand-safe content and don\u2019t put the company in a bad light.
