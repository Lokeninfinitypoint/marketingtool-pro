Alternatively\u2014and I do this constantly\u2014if you\u2019re walking down the street and see some posters and do a double-take? Bravo, copywriter.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-copy-tubi.jpg\" alt=\"Tubi advertisement\" width=\"294\" height=\"341\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>The most recent stop-and-stare that made me do a double-take. Snaps for tubi.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Copywriting is hard\u2014take it from someone who is desperately trying to get better at it! It can make or break an advertising campaign. That\u2019s why I compiled these 21 tips to help you write more compelling and successful marketing copy.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s get started!<\/p>\n<h2>1. Define your target audience<\/h2>\n<p>First things first, decide who you\u2019re selling to. Get specific. If the prospects for your offering run the gamut, choose a subsection to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/15\/audience-targeting\">target an audience<\/a> more specifically. College students will react differently to marketing copy than family-focused suburban residents, for instance.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Choose an objective<\/h2>\n<p>What do you want this marketing copy to compel someone to do? Do you want them to go to a website to make a purchase? Do you want them to sign up for more information? Or go into a physical location?\u00a0Decide what you want out of your advertisement or marketing copy before you even start writing.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-copy-mailchimp.jpg\" alt=\"marketing copy example from Mailchimp\" width=\"624\" height=\"304\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>This <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/mailchimp.com\/\"><em>Mailchimp<\/em><\/a><em> copy encourages the visitor to choose their plan and sign up now.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>3. Create urgency<\/h2>\n<p>When you\u2019re writing compelling copy, an easy tactic is to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/05\/how-to-increase-urgency\">increase urgency<\/a>. Anything from \u201cdon\u2019t miss out!\u201d to \u201corder now to have flowers delivered by Mother\u2019s Day.\u201d\u00a0You\u2019ll hear a lot of these on the radio, and let\u2019s not forget that those commercials and other <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/12\/video-scripts\">video scripts<\/a> need compelling marketing copy, too.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Back it up with data<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to copy, stats are incredibly compelling. People love to know if 57% of their peers hate this kind of avocados\u2014they must know, WHAT KIND?! It\u2019s very clickbaity, but sometimes you gotta do what gets the clicks.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-copy-billie.jpg\" alt=\"marketing copy from Billie homepage\" width=\"624\" height=\"167\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This is actually from Billie\u2019s homepage, which touts razors made specifically for the way women shave. It\u2019s a fact: We\u2019ve got more surface area, and all razors are not created equally.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Leverage customer reviews<\/h2>\n<p>This has been suggested before as a great <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/20\/copywriting-techniques\">copywriting technique<\/a> for persuasive ad copy\u2014which sounds a lot like compelling copy, right?! This is one of my favorite moves when it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/15\/copywriting-tips\">copywriting tips<\/a>, because it takes so little effort. You can use existing reviews from your customer base to compel more people to convert.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-copy-semrush.jpg\" alt=\"marketing copy example from SEMrush\" width=\"624\" height=\"168\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>6. Keep it simple<\/h2>\n<p>Make it scannable; this is important. We are constantly getting hit with tons of information at all times\u2014and as someone who loves to read (I watch TV with the subtitles on), even I miss 50% of the words around me. A big paragraph isn\u2019t welcoming to the eye. Break out your copy into bite-sized pieces to make it more digestible for your audience. If you&#8217;re having trouble distilling things down, using a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/16\/copywriting-formulas\">copywriting formula<\/a> may help.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Use active voice<\/h2>\n<p>Using active is something I\u2019m trying to be more conscious of. Let\u2019s try that again.<\/p>\n<p>I try to use active voice.<\/p>\n<p>Way more concise and powerful, right? It\u2019s punchy and less is way more.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"videos\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_video\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"56997339-0f0f-4657-bd51-9411397a849c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/active-vs-passive-voice.png\" alt=\"active vs passive voice\" width=\"635\" height=\"244\" class=\"size-full wp-image-67644 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/active-vs-passive-voice.png 635w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/active-vs-passive-voice-480x184.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 635px, 100vw\" \/><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/writingcenter.uagc.edu\/active-vs-passive-voice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p>Speaking of action \ud83c\udfac &#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Free guide! <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download\" class=\"waffle-rich-text-link\">The 36 Best Call to Action Phrases (Ever)<\/a><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h2>8.

We have all the goodness of back-to-school here.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>You tell me, which one makes you want to head to your closest office supply store?<\/p>\n<h2>9. Focus on your customers<\/h2>\n<p>While you can brag about your business, a different tactic is to focus on your customer when you\u2019re writing compelling copy. This is an important <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/19\/copywriting-skills\">copywriting skill<\/a> you can&#8217;t afford to overlook. Talk about what problems you\u2019ll solve for them, how you\u2019ll take away stressors, or make life easier.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-copy-postmates.jpg\" alt=\"customer-focused marketing copy from Postmates\" width=\"624\" height=\"384\" \/><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/05\/conversational-tone\"><em>More conversational copywriting examples here.<\/em><\/a><\/div>\n<p>This <a href=\"https:\/\/postmates.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Postmates<\/a> OOH campaign (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/26\/out-of-home-advertising\">OOH meaning out of home<\/a>) focused on all the reasons why people love to order food online, instead of talking to a human. They get it.<\/p>\n<h2>10. Grab attention<\/h2>\n<p>There are a lot of different ways to grab attention through design, but you can also stop people in their tracks with some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/03\/copywriting-examples\">eye-catching marketing copywriting<\/a> (see tubi reference). Lean into the shock-and-awe factor with this tactic.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-copy-volvo.jpg\" alt=\"marketing copy Corvette example\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Sorry, Volvo, but this copy does it for me\u2014shock and awe and admiration.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of shock and awe, use\u00a0words that evoke emotion in your copywriting.\u00a0We&#8217;ve got two great resources for this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/13\/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing\">120 Words and Phrases for Marketing With Emotion<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/03\/emotional-marketing-copy\">273 (MORE!) Words to Use for Emotional Marketing Copy<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>11. Build interest<\/h2>\n<p>Copy should always be interesting, plain and simple. Don\u2019t put useless words on the paper, people! And there are many different ways to make it interesting. That said, write a <em>lot <\/em>of copy and cross out all the words you find uninteresting or detracting from your story. Create intrigue.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-copy-zappos.jpg\" alt=\"marketing copy Zappos example\" width=\"429\" height=\"334\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Timothy Goodman had a collection with Zappos, specifically hightops. Instead of splashing images of shoes all over their ads, the copy told a better story. It makes my inner angsty teen want to go straight to the store to check them out.<\/p>\n<h2>12. Don\u2019t pander<\/h2>\n<p>People know when they\u2019re being sold. No one likes the sickly sweet sales person who compliments every pair of shoes you try even though you KNOW they make you look like you have clown feet.<\/p>\n<h2>13. Empathize with agitation<\/h2>\n<p>Online marketing is hard.<\/p>\n<p>WordStream makes it easy.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-copy-wordstream.png\" alt=\"WordStream logo with tagline\" width=\"625\" height=\"625\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Simple, to the point, we\u2019re here to help you with online advertising because we <em>know<\/em> it\u2019s complicated and confusing\u2014especially for non-marketers. If you can distill the way you\u2019re solving problems and making life easier for your customers, that\u2019s a copywriting win.<\/p>\n<h2>14. Provide a solution<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s one thing to be empathetic, but don\u2019t stop short of showing how your business can solve a problem. You don\u2019t need to be too wordy to get there because hard problems sometimes require simple solutions. You have your customers\u2019 backs.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-copy-the-hustle.jpg\" alt=\"marketing copy example from The Hustle\" width=\"272\" height=\"287\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The Hustle\u2019s email exists to make your life easier, like most daily morning newsletters. I love the use of the dictionary definition here.<\/p>\n<h2>15. Use analogies<\/h2>\n<p>I often use analogies to explain complicated ideas simply\u2014it&#8217;s my go-to tactic.\u00a0If your offering is something that the average person wouldn\u2019t know much about, relate it to something they would know about.\u00a0Alternatively, you can use analogies to increase empathy.\u00a0There\u2019s a reason people still say, \u201ceasy as pie.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-copy-heinz.jpg\" alt=\"marketing copy example from Heinz\" width=\"437\" height=\"596\" \/><\/div>\n<p>PSA: There is nothing easy about baking a pie.<\/p>\n<h2>16. Be funny<\/h2>\n<p>People are far more likely to remember what a joke you made than a brand slogan. And who doesn\u2019t love to make their audience laugh? Jokes are so important!<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-copy-car-ad.jpg\" alt=\"marketing copy example w\/joke\" width=\"233\" height=\"320\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This ad is a personal favorite, especially because I drove around in a minivan throughout college; it did carry the most people to and from the bars (you\u2019re welcome, Villanova students).<\/p>\n<h2>17. Choose a CTA<\/h2>\n<p>Earlier, I said that you need to set a goal before writing your marketing copy. Sometimes, it\u2019s helpful to go one step further and choose a CTA to set the tone for your copy, too.<\/p>\n<p>Take this example from Spotify.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-copy-cta.jpg\" alt=\"CTA example\" width=\"369\" height=\"156\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This is copy on Spotify\u2019s website. It\u2019s direct and urgent: Your fans are waiting for you. We\u2019ll help you. Let\u2019s do this.\u00a0This whole section has one cohesive message, driven by the CTA.<\/p>\n<h2>18. Be wary of profanity<\/h2>\n<p>This is simple: Refrain from using obscene language in your copy unless you&#8217;re certain it will resonate with your audience. Partly because you\u2019ll have difficulty getting through any digital filters, print makes it something you can\u2019t take back, and it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll offend more people than you end up enticing for your product.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/copywriting-examples-kfc.jpg\" alt=\"KFC &quot;FCK&quot; ad\" width=\"480\" height=\"615\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This PSA went out from KFC after they catastrophically ran out of chicken in their fried chicken establishments. A kind sentiment that worked out\u2014this time. But I\u2019d pass on the \u201cFCK.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>19. Be clear<\/h2>\n<p>One of my own pet peeves is when I see a well-designed ad with compelling marketing copy &#8230; but I just cannot figure out what they\u2019re actually trying to sell me.\u00a0Worse, they\u2019ll use words like \u201cGet X for as low as $5.99!\u201d (you\u2019ll pay more), \u201cReceive up to 10 free sessions!\u201d (you\u2019ll get less), or just not caption anything at all.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-copy-wayfair.jpg\" alt=\"marketing copy example with Wayfair\" width=\"285\" height=\"416\" \/><\/div>\n<p>I had to include the Twitter commentary in this example. It\u2019s too good.<\/p>\n<h2>20. Don\u2019t be bland<\/h2>\n<p>It is so important to let the personality of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/31\/brand-voice\">brand<\/a> shine through in copywriting. An easy way to do that is to think about the most common thing leadership (or management or any employees) say the most to describe your business. A word of warning to the CEOs out there: Let your copywriters have a longer leash to show off the business\u2019s flair. No one wants to be bored by your brand.<\/p>\n<h2>21. Trust your gut<\/h2>\n<p>You know and love your brand. When it comes to marketing, you already have words and phrases living in your brain that are good representations of that brand. Trust that. You\u2019ll know when you write something that doesn\u2019t sound\u2014well, good. You\u2019ll also know something is on point when you write it\u2014something will just click.<\/p>\n<h3>22. Use psychology<\/h3>\n<p>There are a number of psychological phenomenons out there that impact the way we behave as consumers. And sometimes, all it takes is an understanding of these effects to be able to make small tweaks with be results.
