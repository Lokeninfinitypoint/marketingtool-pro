As I\u2019ve learned first-hand over the course of this year, writing dozens of video scripts for all our in-house video projects, the amount of effort you put into pre-production (read: script-writing) is directly correlated to the quality of the end product. The better the script, the better the end product.<\/p>\n<p>Need a little help with your video script writing skills? Here are my six best tips for writing effective video scripts.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">1. Identify your target viewer<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When you first get the green light to create video marketing content, you\u2019ll probably feel tempted to start cranking out scripts right away. Here\u2019s why that\u2019s a mistake: Without a crystal clear picture of the person you\u2019ll be targeting with your videos, <strong>your content will lack focus<\/strong>. So the first step towards writing effective video scripts is identifying your target viewer.<\/p>\n<p>Because you\u2019ll be using your video content to attract and engage people qualified to become your customers, your target viewer should look practically identical to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/23\/buyer-personas\">buyer persona<\/a>\u2014the imaginary, thoughtfully crafted character who represents your company\u2019s ideal customer. If you\u2019ve already created a buyer persona, that\u2019s great! Go ahead and use that person as your target viewer. If you haven\u2019t sketched out your buyer persona yet, here are the basics.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/video-scripts-identify-target-viewer.jpg\" alt=\"video-scripts-identify-target-audience\" width=\"350\" height=\"175\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The purpose of creating a buyer persona\u2014who, although not technically real, is very much based on the characteristics and needs of real people\u2014is to make your product or service more marketable. After all, if you don\u2019t know who your product or service is for, <strong>your marketing messages will be ineffective<\/strong>\u2014especially the messages communicated through your videos. Here\u2019s the information you\u2019ll need to create your buyer persona (and your target viewer):<\/p>\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\n<li><strong>Demographics:<\/strong> What\u2019s their age, gender, occupation, relationship status, parental status, education level, and income bracket?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Behaviors and interests:<\/strong> What do they do on a regular basis? How do they like to spend their free time? What matters most to them?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Goals:<\/strong> What are they trying to accomplish? What\u2019s their definition of success?<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/28\/pain-points\">Pain points<\/a>:<\/strong> What\u2019s keeping them from achieving that success? What problems need to be solved in order for them to succeed?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Only when you\u2019ve answered these questions will you be able to write focused, effective video scripts that attract and engage the right people.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">2. Write like you speak<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ll sit down to write your first video script with a somewhat reasonable yet entirely false thought floating around your head: <em>Writing a script is basically the same as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/09\/how-to-write-a-blog-post\">writing a blog post<\/a>, right?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Nope. Although the goals behind video marketing and blogging are essentially the same\u2014to build your brand, engage your prospects, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/01\/lead-generation-ideas\">generate leads<\/a>, and so on\u2014the actual, finished products they yield are drastically different. Simply put, what sounds natural in someone\u2019s head as they\u2019re reading a blog post does <strong>not<\/strong> necessarily sound natural as they\u2019re watching a video.<\/p>\n<p>The more natural the speakers in your videos sound, the clearer your message will be. Therefore, when you sit down to write a script, <strong>you need to write like you speak<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/video-scripts-write-like-you-speak.png\" alt=\"video-scripts-use-plain-english\" width=\"431\" height=\"191\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>Shout-out to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.plainenglish.co.uk\/the-a-z-of-alternative-words.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Plain English Campaign<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Like most skills, this will develop with practice; the more video scripts you write, the more easily you\u2019ll be able to write with a cadence that sounds natural when spoken aloud. When you\u2019re just starting out with script-writing, however, you need to check yourself <strong>proactively<\/strong> and <strong>regularly<\/strong>. Otherwise, you\u2019ll start the shooting process too soon and find that the script you were so proud to have written sounds really, really awkward.<\/p>\n<p>My advice? Read every single sentence back to yourself\u2014out loud. If it sounds weird to you, it\u2019ll most likely sound weird to your audience. Keep at it until you\u2019ve managed to communicate your ideas in a way that comes across clearly through spoken word.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">3. Keep your paragraphs short<\/h2>\n<p>Whether or not you have a teleprompter\u2014we highly recommend them for those who have the budget\u2014this tip is important. By dividing your script into a series of short, bite-sized paragraphs (we\u2019re talking four or five sentences <em>at a maximum<\/em>), you set yourself up for a much easier shooting process when the time comes to bring your script to life.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/video-scripts-teleprompter.png\" alt=\"video-scripts-affordable-teleprompters\" width=\"750\" height=\"275\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>Plenty of simple teleprompters are suitable for smartphones and tablets!<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you don\u2019t have the budget for a teleprompter, dividing your script into small chunks isn\u2019t so much a choice as it is a requirement. The more information you ask your speakers to memorize for each take, the more takes you can expect to do. Provided that you don\u2019t have infinite time to produce your video content\u2014and that your speakers don\u2019t have infinite energy\u2014you\u2019ll want to make <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/05\/marketing-videos\">the shooting process<\/a> as efficient as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you\u2019re fortunate enough to have a teleprompter, limiting your paragraphs to three or four sentences each is still a good idea. True\u2014reading from a teleprompter is far easier than reciting from memory, thus increasing the amount of information your speakers can successfully communicate in a single take. Nevertheless, <strong>mistakes happen<\/strong>. People stumble over their words. The more you ask someone to read during a single take, the more opportunities there are for them to mess up; the more they mess up, the more frustrated they get. In turn, greater frustration leads to worse performance and lower efficiency.<\/p>\n<p>Bottom line: Short paragraphs make for easy shooting days.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">4. Structure your information logically<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Earlier, I argued that you need to write like you speak in order to clarify the information you\u2019re sharing and improve viewer comprehension. After all, if <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/04\/nurture-marketing\">your prospects<\/a> walk away from your videos having learned nothing, what was the point of investing your time and money in the creation of that content?<\/p>\n<p>The ROI of your video marketing efforts is tied directly to how much your prospects learn. Contrary to what you may assume, making educational video content isn\u2019t a matter of simply sharing as much information as you possibly can. From a viewer comprehension perspective, just as important as the information you share is <strong>how you organize that information<\/strong>. Even the most insightful content is practically useless if it\u2019s illogically organized.<\/p>\n<p>Through writing both video scripts and blog posts, here\u2019s what I\u2019ve found to be the best approach. Once you\u2019ve settled on the overarching topic of the video you\u2019re creating, structure the script such that it <strong>starts with the most general information<\/strong> and <strong>gets progressively more specific and complex<\/strong>. Before you get into the nitty-gritty of whatever subject matter you\u2019re tackling, make sure to give your viewers the solid foundation they need to fully comprehend everything that\u2019s to come.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/video-scripts-logical-structure.jpg\" alt=\"video-scripts-organize-content-logically\" width=\"776\" height=\"429\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Think of Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs. Start with the essentials and go from there.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s use an example. Say you\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/17\/fitness-marketing\">a marketer at a gym<\/a>. You want to use educational video content to build the gym\u2019s brand and connect with people interested in physical fitness\u2014that is, people who make good candidates for gym memberships. For your first video, you want to talk to your viewers about protein shakes. If you were to dive straight into specific ingredients, measurements, and nutrition facts, that would be pretty jarring, right? To create a much more helpful and holistic learning experience for your viewers, you\u2019d want to begin by talking about the pros and cons of protein shakes, when they should and shouldn\u2019t be used, and so on. Only after you\u2019ve laid that foundation should you get into the specifics.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">5. Keep visual aids top-of-mind<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When it comes to video content, most people want to see more than a static talking head. After all, a video that shows nothing but a person speaking for several minutes straight gets pretty darn boring. Plus, you shouldn\u2019t ignore the fact that many people are <strong>visual learners<\/strong>. Without some form of images or graphics to accompany your speakers, your video content won\u2019t be as effective as it needs to be to leave lasting impressions on your prospects. In turn, you won\u2019t drive the ROI you\u2019re looking for.<\/p>\n<p>All that being said, you can\u2019t shoehorn graphics into your videos purely for the sake of doing so; you should never include something that doesn\u2019t legitimately enhance the viewer\u2019s learning experience. To ensure that your use of graphics is seamless and effective, I recommend <strong>consciously creating opportunities for visual aids while writing your scripts<\/strong>. In other words, don\u2019t write an entire script and subsequently comb through it in search of opportunities for visual aids. Instead, try to write with a cadence that naturally lends itself to the use of aids.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/video-scripts-visual-aids.jpg\" alt=\"video-scripts-keep-visual-aids-top-of-mind\" width=\"792\" height=\"422\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>The genius of Moz\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/category\/whiteboard-friday\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Whiteboard Friday series<\/a> lay in the use of visual aids.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As an example, let\u2019s return to the hypothetical in which you\u2019re creating <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/16\/real-estate-video-marketing\">video marketing content<\/a> for a gym. Technically, when scripting the introductory section of the video about protein shakes, you could simply say \u201cProtein shakes are divisive among the fitness community\u201d and leave it at that. Alternatively, you could say \u201cRegularly drinking protein shakes comes with a number of costs and benefits.\u201d I\u2019d argue that the latter is substantially better because it gives you an opportunity to naturally insert a visual aid\u2014a T-chart, most likely.<\/p>\n<p>One last point: Finishing a script and subsequently combing through it to find places to insert graphics is a pain in the neck. If nothing else, take my advice to save yourself a headache.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">6. Create opportunities for shareable clips<\/h2>\n<p>My final tip for writing video scripts is related to the promotion of your finished products. Think about it: Once you have a polished video that\u2019s ready for publication on your website and YouTube channel, what better way to drum up interest than by sharing short, enticing clips on social platforms like Twitter and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/09\/instagram-marketing-strategy\">Instagram<\/a>?<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/video-scripts-oberlo-infographic.png\" alt=\"video-scripts-social-media-video-content\" width=\"720\" height=\"465\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>Via <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oberlo.com\/blog\/video-marketing-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Oberlo<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As is the case with visual aids, you should have social media clips at the top of your mind as you\u2019re writing your video scripts. If you script an entire video without thinking about its promotion on social media, you\u2019ll force yourself to find shareable clips <em>after<\/em> the video\u2019s been shot and edited\u2014so you\u2019ll run the risk of working with sub-par source material. This, in turn, could lead to not-so-enticing clips and a lack of engagement with your promotional posts.<\/p>\n<p>If you consciously create shareable moments when writing your script instead, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/03\/video-marketing-ideas\">promoting the final video<\/a> will become a whole lot easier and a whole lot more effective. Let\u2019s return to the example of the protein shake video one more time. Sure\u2014you <em>could<\/em> end the video by simply listing the ingredients required to make your personal favorite protein shake. However, a <strong>far more shareable<\/strong> piece of content would be a clip of you <em>actually making<\/em> that shake.<\/p>\n<p>As you\u2019re writing your script, regularly stop to ask yourself a question: <em>\u201cWill anything I\u2019ve scripted so far make for a compelling social media post?\u201d<\/em> If the answer is no, make a concerted effort to change that. You (and your boss) will be happy you did.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Don\u2019t mail it in when writing video scripts!<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I get it: Writing scripts erases some of the luster of video marketing. There\u2019s something really exciting about immediately getting behind (or in front of) a camera and simply <strong>creating<\/strong>. Sitting down at a laptop and thinking rationally about what\u2019s going to enable the best user experience possible \u2026 not so much.<\/p>\n<p>And yet, it has to be done. Whether you\u2019re adopting video marketing as a channel so you can spread brand awareness or drive sales, you have to think really carefully about what you want to say and how you want to say it. Considering the amount of time, resources, and expertise it takes to create high-quality video marketing content, you really can\u2019t afford to wing it.<\/p>\n<p>Thoughtful, meticulous video scripts are the key to delivering the best results you possibly can. Using these six tips, you should be able to do just that.<\/p>\n<p>And if you&#8217;re looking for a low-budget way to produce quality marketing videos from home, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/11\/at-home-diy-video\">we&#8217;ve got just the post for that<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Writing high-quality video scripts is an essential skill for content marketers.
