You won\u2019t need to label your AI content (but it better be good)<\/h3>\n<p>One concern that\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/28\/ai-for-marketing\">plagued AI<\/a> content from the start is transparency. Meaning, if you create an asset using generative AI, do you have to label it as such?<\/p>\n<p>The simple answer is: Not yet.<\/p>\n<p>It might get a little confusing, especially after seeing the backlash when <a href=\"https:\/\/futurism.com\/sports-illustrated-ai-generated-writers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sports Illustrated got busted<\/a> for allegedly publishing AI-created content. But the real sin of those pieces wasn\u2019t the content, it was the fake, AI-generated writer bios used to trick readers.<\/p>\n<p>There are no current laws stating that AI-assisted content needs a label. And Google is on the \u201cno need to label\u201d bandwagon, too.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-suzuki.webp\" alt=\"Content marketing trends - Tweet from Kenichi Suzuki\" width=\"936\" height=\"421\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-79113 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-suzuki.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-suzuki-480x216.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Search expert <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/suzukik\/status\/1669617765102280704?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Kenichi Suzuki<\/em><\/a><em> confirmed that Google cares about content quality, not who (or what) wrote it.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This could change. We\u2019re about to run into our first presidential election cycle with widespread access to user-friendly AI tools. People are <a href=\"https:\/\/today.yougov.com\/technology\/articles\/46058-majorities-americans-are-concerned-about-spread-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">already a little nervous<\/a> about the mass potential for deep fakes and misdirection that could lead to.

But it won\u2019t likely happen by the end of 2024.<\/p>\n<p>No matter what the rules are, though, never pump out AI content without a human editor. Google says <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/blog\/2023\/02\/google-search-and-ai-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI content is A-Okay<\/a>, but it still cares about things like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/14\/google-e-e-a-t\">authority and experience<\/a> (things that are hard to get from AI content alone).<\/p>\n<p>You definitely don\u2019t want to end up on the wrong end of Google taking your traffic away.<\/p>\n<h4>How to prepare for this trend:<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider if your specific audience would prefer you label content as AI-generated.<\/li>\n<li>Use AI as a tool to assist content creators, not replace them.<\/li>\n<li>Create a playbook or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/10\/content-style-guide\">style guide<\/a> that sets standards for all of your content, no matter where it comes from.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/12\/20\/content-marketing-roi\">Monitor the analytics<\/a> of your human-only and AI-assisted content to see if either net better results.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"Search-shifts-to-social-media-platforms\"><\/div>\n<h3>4.

But it is clear that audiences are rewarding marketers who connect with them more authentically. So no matter which content marketing trends you focus on, or which strategies you use, do so with a focus on making marketing more personalized, relevant, and\u2014even in the age of AI\u2014human.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Need more 2024 marketing trends?
