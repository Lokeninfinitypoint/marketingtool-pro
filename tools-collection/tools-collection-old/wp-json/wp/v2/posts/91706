You can do that in two ways:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Site search operator:<\/strong> You can quickly see if your site has pages indexed by using a site search operator. Go to Google and type in site:yoursite dot com and see what results are showing. You should see results like this:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/site-search-site-indexed-example.webp\" alt=\"example of google site search for indexed website\" width=\"833\" height=\"396\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91770\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/site-search-site-indexed-example.webp 833w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/site-search-site-indexed-example-480x228.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 833px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And not results like this:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/example-site-search-site-not-indexed.webp\" alt=\"example of site not indexed in google search results\" width=\"836\" height=\"605\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91771\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/example-site-search-site-not-indexed.webp 836w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/example-site-search-site-not-indexed-480x347.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 836px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you have Google Search Console set up, you can receive even more robust reporting on which pages on your site are indexed and their current status.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Google Search Console:<\/strong> Once you see the breakdown of not only the pages on your site that aren\u2019t indexed, but also the reason, you can start to address issues:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-search-console-pages-report.webp\" alt=\"google search console pages report\" width=\"1222\" height=\"444\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91772\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-search-console-pages-report.webp 1222w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-search-console-pages-report-980x356.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-search-console-pages-report-480x174.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1222px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In this screenshot, we see a few different problems:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Broken links (a page may have been deleted or have another issue) and server errors.<\/li>\n<li>Pages that have been redirected or excluded by a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/meta-tags#:~:text=index\/-,noindex,-%E2%80%93%20This%20tells%20the\">noindex tag<\/a> (more on this shortly).<\/li>\n<li>Pages have been crawled, but are not indexed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Pages that have been crawled and not indexed or \u201cdiscovered but not crawled\u201d are often the result of Google not deeming your site sufficiently authoritative and\/or not deeming those pages valuable and unique (more on addressing these issues later as well).<\/p>\n<h4>Check for technical issues<\/h4>\n<p>If you\u2019ve found that your site isn\u2019t getting indexed, there are a few particularly common issues that could lead to pages on a site not being indexed.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Meta noindex tags<\/strong><strong>: <\/strong>Often times when a developer is building a staging version of your site they\u2019ll add <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/docs\/crawling-indexing\/block-indexing\">meta noindex tags<\/a> to the entire site, to keep Google from crawling and indexing the site before it\u2019s pushed live. It\u2019s also not uncommon for the dev team to fail to remove those tags. If you see a large volume or spike of pages not indexed for this reason in Search Console, this is something to investigate.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/no-index-html-code-example.webp\" alt=\"no index in html code\" width=\"1074\" height=\"244\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91773\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/no-index-html-code-example.webp 1074w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/no-index-html-code-example-980x223.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/no-index-html-code-example-480x109.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1074px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>You can look at the source code of a page and search for the noindex tag.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/no-index-directives.webp\" alt=\"noindex directive found in screaming frog tool\" width=\"883\" height=\"212\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91774\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/no-index-directives.webp 883w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/no-index-directives-480x115.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 883px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>You can also use a tool like Screaming Frog to crawl your site and identify pages that are noindexed.<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Robots directives: <\/strong>Your site\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/docs\/crawling-indexing\/robots\/intro#:~:text=A%20robots.txt%20file%20tells,web%20page%20out%20of%20Google.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">robots.txt file<\/a> could also be blocking search engines from crawling (and ultimately indexing) your site.

If you purchased this domain and there are existing links pointed at it, those may be causing you an issue. Third-party tools like Semrush and Ahrefs allow you to see the links pointed to your domain&#8211;looking at these to determine if this may be the cause of an issue is again a good place to start.<\/p>\n<h2>Monitoring and addressing SEO issues moving forward<\/h2>\n<p>Getting zero SEO traffic can be frustrating, but as we&#8217;ve seen, there are often clear, identifiable reasons for this problem. The key is to work through a systematic diagnosis process:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Verify your reporting tools are correctly set up and not filtering out organic traffic.<\/li>\n<li>Confirm your pages are being indexed by Google.<\/li>\n<li>Address any technical barriers like noindex tags, robots directives, or canonical issues.<\/li>\n<li>Build a foundation of quality links if your site lacks authority.<\/li>\n<li>Ensure you&#8217;re targeting realistic keywords with actual search volume.<\/li>\n<li>Investigate potential penalties or domain history problems.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>It\u2019s also important to keep in mind that even after fixing these foundational issues, it may take time for Google to recrawl your site and for rankings to improve.<\/p>\n<p>Set up regular monitoring through Search Console and GA4 to catch any new issues early and consider implementing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/28\/technical-seo\">technical SEO audits<\/a> to ensure your site remains healthy from an SEO perspective.<\/p>\n<p>And if you&#8217;re stuck troubleshooting a particularly challenging SEO issue, you may want to consider <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/marketing-services?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Demo_Blog_Demo\">consulting with a professional<\/a> who can do additional troubleshooting and provide more targeted guidance based on your specific situation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lack of site traffic got you down?
