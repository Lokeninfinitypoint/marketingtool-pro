Target a more specific audience<\/h3>\n<p>Update! You may actually need to go broader, now that privacy measures are shrinking audience sizes. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/13\/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-world\">Get all the Facebook ad targeting tips you need here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Per Ben Cook, marketing director of social media agency JC Social Media, advertisers should be as precise with their criteria as possible when specifying audiences.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBy narrowing your target audience, you can drastically reduce the competition from other brands running ads to a similar audience,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember you are in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/31\/facebook-ads-bidding-strategies\">bidding<\/a> war with hundreds of other brands \u2013 only bid on who you really want to reach.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Cook said this means marketers increase the odds that their promoted content will resonate closely with target individuals.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt means you can tailor ads to appeal to people in a specific demographic, geographical area and set of interests, giving you the best chance of gaining clicks and generating traction,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/lower-facebook-ad-costs-with-targeting-parameters.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook ad costs targeting parameters\" width=\"478\" height=\"680\" \/><\/div>\n<p>That was the case with children\u2019s book brand Clever Tykes, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jcsocialmedia.com\/super-niche-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">which worked with JC Social Media<\/a> to target mothers of children ages six to nine and who were also self-employed or business owners, rather than simply targeting parents with children ages six to nine. (Cook co-founded Clever Tykes.)<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen targeting a broader audience, we achieved good reach metrics, but click-through rates and conversion rates were low,\u201d Cook said. \u201cIt was only once we refined the targeted audience to those who were perfect for the brand did conversions improve. When the content, tone of voice, and actual product resonated with the target audience, all of the key metrics improved.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s likely in part because the inventory is low and ad cost is high when you go after an audience that many other advertisers want, said Timothy Masek, senior growth strategist at growth marketing agency Ladder Digital.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf instead you target a segment where there are fewer advertisers competing for ad space \u2013 for example, in international markets \u2013 then your ad cost will be cheaper,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>Masek also noted that Facebook charges more or less depending on the relevancy of your ads.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/components-facebook-ad-relevance-score1-1.png\" alt=\"Facebook ad costs relevance score concept\" width=\"758\" height=\"498\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cIn an effort to reward advertisers for adding value to the Facebook user, Facebook will decrease your [ad] cost if your content is relevant to your target segment,\u201d he said. \u201cThis relevance is quantified by <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/30\/facebook-relevance-score\">Facebook&#8217;s quality score<\/a>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Free guide<\/strong><span>\u00a0&gt;&gt;\u00a0<\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLFBFundamentals.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FacebookFundamentals_Download\">7 Fundamental Facebook Advertising Tips<\/a><\/strong><span>\u00a0every advertiser should know.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>2. Use bid caps<\/h3>\n<p>Katy Lowe, social media executive at digital marketing agency Passion Digital, on the other hand, said the more granular you go with audience targeting, the more expensive results tend to be, as Facebook is offering a tool to reach your most valuable audience, and it\u2019s in its own interest to charge more.<\/p>\n<p>Lowe said Passion Digital manages this for its clients by using rules and bid caps, especially for app installs, based on the lifetime value of an individual lead or sale.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/facebook-advertising?cid=Web_blog_InContentTextLink_FB_grader\">Find more ways to lower your Facebook ad costs (in minutes!) with our Free Facebook Ads Performance Grader.<\/a>\u00a0<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>3. Look for audience overlap<\/h3>\n<p>In addition, Phillip Reinhardt, CEO and cofounder of digital marketing agency PBJ Marketing, said to use the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/1679591828938781\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook Audience Overlap tool<\/a> to see if audiences are overlapping significantly \u2013 and, if they are, to choose the audience that is most relevant to your marketing goals.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf they have some overlaps, mutually exclude those audiences to avoid bidding against yourself,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>This is what PBJ Marketing did for the University of Maryland\u2019s Master of Professional Studies in Technology Entrepreneurship program, which seeks part-time students and was targeting entrepreneurs and startup founders in the US.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAfter creating two separate audiences for people living in the United States interested in \u2018Entrepreneurship\u2019 and \u2018Startup Company,\u2019 we quickly ran an audience overlap check on Facebook,\u201d Reinhardt said.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ad-costs-audience-overlap-tool.png\" alt=\"Facebook ad costs audience overlap tool\" width=\"800\" height=\"403\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cAs we can see, nearly 50% of the \u2018Startup Company\u2019 audience is\u00a0also interested in \u2018Entrepreneurship,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIf we set up a campaign targeting these two audiences in separate ad sets without any audience exclusion and pay \u2013 let us suppose \u2013 $0.10 per click, we could\u00a0waste up to $220,050 in the ad auction by bidding against ourselves.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Instead, he excluded the interest in entrepreneurship in the startup company audience and vice versa, and ran the overlap tool again and got 0%.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/excluding-audience-overlap-facebook.png\" alt=\"Facebook ad costs audience overlap excluded results\" width=\"800\" height=\"461\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This is important because if there is a high percentage of overlap, you are essentially bidding against yourself in the Facebook auction in order to serve ads to the same people.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou are not only advertising to the same person more than once, but you\u2019re also paying more to serve ads to that person because of internal competition,\u201d Reinhardt said.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, having low \u2013 or no \u2013 overlap also allows you to better <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/11\/facebook-ab-testing\">A\/B test<\/a> the different audiences you are using and customize your bids based on each audience&#8217;s ROI.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor low-intention audiences, we bid lower,\u201d Reinhardt said. \u201cFor remarketing audiences or converters, we bid higher. This way, we can make sure we are not wasting money on people who are not as interested in us.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As for those who are interested in both, Reinhardt said to create a dedicated audience that satisfies both criteria:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ads-detailed-targeting.png\" alt=\"Facebook ad costs detailed targeting options\" width=\"800\" height=\"490\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cNow if we run the audience overview tool one last time for all three audiences, we will have a perfectly segmented group of audiences,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/lowering-facebook-costs-audience-segments.png\" alt=\"Facebook ad costs selected audiences overlap tool\" width=\"800\" height=\"513\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>4. Set up your Facebook Pixel<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Note!<\/strong> The Facebook Pixel is losing its power post-iOS 14 and with the deprecation of cookies. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/06\/facebook-conversions-api\">Learn how (and why) to set up the Facebook Conversions API here.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Morgan McGregor, photography and online content specialist at social media marketing firm Hyped, said her biggest tip is to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/11\/facebook-conversion-tracking\">set up your Facebook Pixel<\/a>, which is a few lines of code you insert into your website to track conversions and access data about your clients.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt can not only track who your clients and visitors are right down to their Facebook page, but it also collects data such as: What are they interested in? Where do they live? How many kids do they have? How much money do they earn? What things have they bought recently? What is their average purchase price? Are they going on holiday soon?\u201d McGregor said.<\/p>\n<p>It can get very detailed, which means marketers are able to target people who are in a position to start purchasing their products.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou can not only retarget people who have gone on your website, you can even target down to what actions they&#8217;ve taken, such as people who added to their cart but never completed their purchases,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Setting up a Facebook Pixel also means brands can track which ads are performing best and yield more sales, which means they can really start putting money where it counts.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt also allows you to create dynamic sales funnels [for Top Of Funnel, Middle Of Funnel and Bottom Of Funnel] that can last forever and bring you sales while you sleep \u2013 that&#8217;s the lifestyle we all dream of,\u201d McGregor added.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-dynamic-sales-funnels.png\" alt=\"Facebook ad costs dynamic sales funnels\" width=\"939\" height=\"100\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>5. Test different creative<\/h3>\n<p>Cook also recommended testing your Facebook creative to see which executions resonate most.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFacebook ad sets enable you to run multiple ads concurrently with the same budget,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if you know your audience inside out, tiny nuances in the image chosen, the copy and the call to action can make a large difference in the results over time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He continued: \u201cBy using different combinations of text and images, you\u2019ll be able to spot trends in the adverts&#8217; performances. Take the best elements from the better performing ads and drop the worst. This data-driven ad crafting is the best way to get the best value from your ads budget.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Facebook Ads coach Monica Louie said she typically starts with testing <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/26\/how-to-create-facebook-ads\">the image in the Facebook ad<\/a>, followed by headline and ad copy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt&#8217;s fascinating how just changing the image can have a dramatic effect on the costs,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of these are done in this specific order to keep costs down and increase conversions.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Even small improvements in click-through rate and conversion rate can make a huge difference to ROI in the long term. The following ad sets are from a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/25\/b2b-facebook-advertising\">B2B client<\/a> whose CPC JC Social Media reduced by using this testing method.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/high-facebook-cost-per-link-click.png\" alt=\"Facebook ad costs per link chart\" width=\"832\" height=\"375\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/07\/18\/adwords-cost-per-click-too-high\"><em>High cost per click<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/low-cost-per-link-click-facebook-ads.png\" alt=\"Facebook ad costs low cost per click\" width=\"809\" height=\"376\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Low cost per click<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>6. Tap into retargeting segments<\/h3>\n<p>Messmer highly recommended segmenting website visitors by engagement levels to create better retargeting segments in Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe use a custom retargeting algorithm that automatically sorts your website visitors into low, medium and high engagement groups, and that audience pushes to any ad network,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-retargeting-segments.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook ad costs retargeting audience segments\" width=\"795\" height=\"707\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Jason\u00a0Parks, president of digital marketing agency The Media Captain, also said he runs dynamic retargeting and retargeting advertisements to generate sales at a cheap cost per acquisition on Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>Check out WordStream\u2019s <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/11\/16\/facebook-remarketing\">complete guide to Facebook remarketing here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Target fans separately<\/h3>\n<p>In addition, Reinhardt said to segment consumers who are connected to your Facebook page and save them as an independent fan audience and build dedicated campaigns for them. Meanwhile, also exclude existing Facebook fans in other audiences. The same could be done for website visitors and converters.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s because Facebook fans are typically the best-performing audiences in terms of engagement rate and conversion rate, he said.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-fan-stats-3.jpg\" alt=\"facebook fan statistics\" width=\"752\" height=\"443\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cWe want to ensure that all the Facebook fans are reached and the best way to do it is to create a separate audience for Facebook fans,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>For example, for a nonprofit client, Reinhardt said he ran a fundraising campaign and the segmented Facebook fan audience had a cost per conversion of $1.16 and a ROAS of $56.58. The interest targeting excluding Facebook fans audience PBJ Marketing used, on the other hand, had a cost per conversion of $98.45 and a ROAS of $2.22.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDuring the final stages of the fundraising campaign, we quickly lowered the daily budget and bids for the interest targeting and prioritized on high return audiences,\u201d he said. \u201cA perfectly segmented account allows us to clearly identify where the opportunity is and spend our client&#8217;s money on the best audiences.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>8. Refresh your creative<\/h3>\n<p>Miller said to refresh your Facebook ad creative every two weeks to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/30\/ad-fatigue\">avoid ad fatigue<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Jomel Alos, online PR lead and content marketing strategist at digital marketing company Spiralytics, agreed.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the most common problems we see with our clients before they hire us is their failure to refresh their ad visuals,\u201d Alos said. \u201cOnce they see that an ad is performing they don&#8217;t monitor its frequency anymore, which results in ad fatigue, or the point when the audience is already too familiar with the ad.\u201d This causes ad performance to drop off precipitously and makes it difficult to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/08\/how-to-scale-facebook-ads\">scale your Facebook ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Alos <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.spiralytics.com\/case-study-how-facebook-ad-fatigue-can-destroy-your-campaign-metrics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pointed to a case study<\/a> with what he called a healthy campaign with consistent CPC\/CTR\/CR and CPL for the first six days. On day seven, however, CPC and CPL started to increase, as everyone targeted had seen the ad four times on average. And as fewer users click on your ad, Facebook starts to lose money and must decide whether to stop showing your ad or to charge you more, Spiralytics noted in a blog post.<\/p>\n<p>To prevent this, advertisers should report on ad-level conversion metrics daily. And, Spiralytics said, after a few ads run, you\u2019ll get a feel for your range of impressions\/person for where the ad will fatigue, and you can indicate this metric in your reports and pause ads as they approach the fatigue point.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Take advantage of video<\/h3>\n<p>Damon Gochneaur, founder and managing partner of digital marketing firm Aspiro Agency, said his #1 tip for reducing the cost of advertising on Facebook is to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/25\/facebook-video-ads\">use video anywhere you can<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cVideo is on average 10% of the cost of carousel or single image ads,\u201d he said. \u201cWe pay on average anywhere from $0.15 to $0.50 per click on video campaigns, with single image ads in the $2.00 and higher CPC, for the same audience.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Lowe agreed: Facebook values <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/30\/facebook-video-views\">video content in ads <\/a>because it gives videos bigger impression share and therefore cheaper CPC.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor smaller clients without budgets to produce dedicated video ads for campaigns, we often use Facebook\u2019s own in-platform tools to create slideshows of product or service imagery, which can be downloaded as video content in the ideal spec for Facebook video ads,\u201d she added.<\/p>\n<h2>More ways to lower your Facebook ads costs<\/h2>\n<p>Ad platforms are constantly changing, so it&#8217;s important to stay on your toes!
