Whether you\u2019re a small business owner, a marketing team member, or an agency, riding that rollercoaster of highs and lows is no small challenge. What\u2019s even harder is setting ambitious yet realistic expectations of what is achievable.<\/p>\n<p>This is why a growth strategy is of the utmost importance to businesses. In this guide, I\u2019m going to cover what a growth strategy is, how it differs from a marketing strategy, and why it works\u2014with plenty of examples. I\u2019ll also walk you through the five-step process for creating a growth strategy\u00a0for your own business. The five steps are:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Set your high-level goals<\/li>\n<li>Identify your inputs and outputs<\/li>\n<li>Run growth experiments<\/li>\n<li>Validate your growth experiments<\/li>\n<li>Foster extreme accountability<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>By the end of this guide, you\u2019ll be able to identify what goals to set and what\u2019s needed from your team to hit those goals.\u00a0Ready to drive consistent, predictable, maybe even explosive growth for your business?\u00a0Read on.<\/p>\n<h2>What exactly <em>is<\/em> a growth strategy?<\/h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of confusion in the marketing world about what a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/12\/growth-marketing\">growth marketing strategy<\/a> and how it&#8217;s different from a marketing strategy.<\/p>\n<p>First things first, a growth strategy is not a marketing plan.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Nor does it mean <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/ppc\">buying PPC ads<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/seo\">driving traffic via SEO<\/a>, or <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2009\/10\/08\/cro-conversion-rate-optimization\">running CRO tests<\/a> on your website.

There is so much that goes into a business and defines its success, where do you even start?

It\u2019s much easier when you know the final destination.<\/p>\n<p>If you could predict how much revenue your new business would make in the long term before you even got started, wouldn\u2019t that help you figure out the best growth strategy to get there?<\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The bottom line is, it\u2019s more helpful to start at the end and then work backwards (versus the opposite).<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">It\u2019s more helpful to start at the end and then work backwards.<\/span><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So let\u2019s head on over to the end of your growth strategy.

So for\u00a0step one, start mapping out a long-term goal such as your 10-year goal.\u00a0To do this, ask yourself the following questions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where do you see yourself and your company by that time?<\/li>\n<li>How much should you grow your business?<\/li>\n<li>How much revenue do you expect your company to generate?<\/li>\n<li>How many employees do you see yourself having?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Let\u2019s revisit the growth strategy example I shared earlier.

Why? Because it\u2019s a clear indication of their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/www.bigcommerce.com\/blog\/find-product-niche-start-selling-online\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1600287145039000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH8ZpyircnPTecvlI9UvqJIgD_MzA\">product\u2019s value.<\/a> The more nights booked, the higher the chances are that customers are having a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/16\/get-more-google-reviews\">positive experience<\/a> with Airbnb and the more likely they are to return to book their next stay.\u00a0Keep in mind, your chosen North Star metric should have a direct correlation to your company\u2019s revenue and retention goals.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Your chosen North Star metric should have a direct correlation to your company\u2019s revenue and retention goals.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Here are a some more examples of North Star metrics:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Customer lifetime value <\/strong>(for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/12\/18\/ecommerce-marketing-strategies\">ecommerce<\/a> businesses)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Monthly recurring revenue <\/strong>(for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/04\/saas-startup-growth\">B2B SaaS <\/a>businesses)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Total watch time <\/strong>(for media businesses)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve chosen your metric, the next step is to figure how you\u2019re currently performing for that metric. Let\u2019s assume you started a new streaming service like Netflix. You\u2019ve selected \u201ctotal watch time\u201d as your North Star metric. You\u2019ve selected this metric because per your analysis, a higher watch time correlates to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/13\/marketing-agencies-retention-strategies-covid-19\">higher retention <\/a>(resulting in more revenue).<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s assume users spend around 30 mins per day watching shows on your service. This is how you\u2019re currently performing for your North Star metric. It&#8217;s your baseline.\u00a0One of the high-level goals you\u2019ve set is to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/08\/reduce-churn\">increase retention<\/a> by 30% in the next 12 months. To hit this goal, doesn\u2019t it make sense to focus on improving total watch time per user?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Bottom line: figure out how you\u2019re currently performing for your North Star metric and how much that number will need to change to impact your high-level goals.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>Set up your OKRs<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/plan.io\/blog\/what-are-okrs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OKRs<\/a> stand for Objective Key Results.

This is often a wake-up call for the latter.<\/p>\n<h2>Get ready for consistent, predictable growth<\/h2>\n<p>To conclude, there\u2019s no magic hack or silver bullet that\u2019s going to unlock explosive growth for your business overnight.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s about driving consistent growth, which comes down to a strong understanding of data, relentless focus on influencing the right metrics, and experimenting with <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/07\/best-marketing-strategies\">different marketing tactics<\/a> to hit your goals.<\/p>\n<p>Or as my favourite entrepreneur Biz Stone once said, \u201cTiming, perseverance, and ten years of trying will make you look like an overnight success.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>About the author<\/h3>\n<p>Aditya Sheth is a growth marketer at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.venngage.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Venngage<\/a>\u2014an online all-in-one design platform.
