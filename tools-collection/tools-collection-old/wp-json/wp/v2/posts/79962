But those gains are sometimes short-lived as Google can cut off the traffic to low-value content in an instant.<\/p>\n<p>The better strategy is to use AI as a writing partner to bounce ideas off of. Ask it to rewrite something you\u2019re struggling with. Or get a list of headlines that might offer a word or structure you hadn\u2019t thought of.<\/p>\n<h3>Factcheck and edit<\/h3>\n<p>Not all AI tools have the latest content to learn from. Much of the verbiage they choose sounds bland. And sometimes they provide false information.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/best-ai-copywriting-tools-google-false.webp\" alt=\"AI copywriting tools - Chatgpt response with incorrect data\" width=\"613\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-79981 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/best-ai-copywriting-tools-google-false.webp 613w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/best-ai-copywriting-tools-google-false-480x470.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 613px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/indranil_leo\/status\/1608548534386565120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1608548534386565120%7Ctwgr%5E40bef6128b6180cfabce993a97bfb7f8f1977adb%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wordstream.com%2Fblog%2Fws%2F2023%2F06%2F28%2Fai-for-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s critical that you closely review and edit any AI-generated content.

To stand out against a sea of AI sameness, you\u2019ll need to interject some original statistics, unique stories, and a voice that doesn\u2019t sound like the exact tone everyone else will get from their AI tools.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, the increased importance of original data and experiences was one of the top<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/content-marketing-trends-2024\"> content marketing trends<\/a> we noticed.<\/p>\n<div id=\"AI-copywriting-tools-FAQs\"><\/div>\n<h2>FAQs about AI copywriting tools<\/h2>\n<p>We covered a lot of ground. But there are a few questions we see a lot and are worth answering on their own.<\/p>\n<h3>Which is the best tool for AI copywriting?<\/h3>\n<p>This is a bit like asking which is the best hammer. Each tool has features and use cases that fit different needs and users. To find yours, start with the descriptions we gave above, and trial a few to see which suits your needs best.<\/p>\n<h3>Is AI copywriting legal?<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s currently legal to use content created by AI as long as it doesn\u2019t directly copy another copyrighted work verbatim. There are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2023\/12\/27\/business\/media\/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lawsuits<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/2024\/01\/02\/copyright-law-violation-artificial-intelligence-courts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">legality discussions<\/a> in the works that could change how AI content is regulated, though. For now, it\u2019s best to use a plagiarism checker to make sure your AI tool hasn\u2019t drafted a nearly exact copy of something that already exists.<\/p>\n<h3>Can Google detect AI copywriting?<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/blog\/2023\/02\/google-search-and-ai-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google suggests<\/a> that its systems can identify AI content. However, as long as the search engine deems the copy to be high quality (and meeting its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/14\/google-e-e-a-t\">E-E-A-T standards<\/a>), it\u2019s allowed and will not be punished on search engine results pages.<\/p>\n<h2>Find your ideal AI copywriting tool<\/h2>\n<p>AI copywriting tools take on lots of forms for many different functions. The key to finding the right one to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/copywriting-101\">improve your copy<\/a> is structured experimentation.<\/p>\n<p>Start by laying out the most challenging and friction-filled parts of your job.
