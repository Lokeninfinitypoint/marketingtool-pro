Actually, there are two types of loyalty: transactional loyalty and emotional loyalty. With transactional loyalty, customers stick with you for rational reasons: you&#8217;re the closest to them, you offer the lowest prices,\u00a0or\u00a0there simply aren&#8217;t any nearby alternatives. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">With emotional loyalty, on the other hand, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/10\/customer-loyalty\">customers stick with you<\/a> because they <em>feel<\/em>\u00a0connected to you. And they are more likely to stick with you even if a competing business offers a lower price or better offer. Not only that, but customer loyalty reduces costs and drives revenue. Here\u2019s the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.markinblog.com\/customer-loyalty-retention-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">data<\/a><span lang=\"EN\"> to prove it:<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Loyal customers spend <strong>67%<\/strong> more than new ones.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">82%<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN\"> of companies agree that customer retention is cheaper than acquisition.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">It costs up to <strong>7x<\/strong> more to acquire a new customer than to retain an old one.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">But while\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-run-customer-loyalty-programs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">customer loyalty programs<\/a>\u00a0can bring major benefits to your business, they are quite transactional.

But as mentioned above, businesses exist to solve a problem. And consumers want their problem solved in order to escape from the negative emotions it causes\u2014stress, anxiety, overwhelm, exasperation, fear, and anger. Those last two are what we\u2019ll focus on next.<\/p>\n<p>Fear\u00a0can be a powerful motivator for taking action. Consumers can be fearful of missing out, losing something, falling short, and the list goes on.<\/p>\n<p>Did someone say FOMO?<\/p>\n<p>Yes. And it\u2019s a big one. According to one <a href=\"https:\/\/optinmonster.com\/fomo-statistics\/\">study<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>60% of millennial consumers said they make a reactive purchase after experiencing FOMO, most often within 24 hours.<\/li>\n<li>40% of millennials overspend or go into debt to keep up with their friends.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You\u2019re not looking to put your customers into debt, of course. But we can see that fear <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/23\/influence-buyers-marketing-psychology\">influences purchasing decisions<\/a>, and not just for millennials.<\/p>\n<p>So how do you use it in your marketing?\u00a0Your goal with eliciting fear isn\u2019t to completely scare your target customers, but rather to spur them to action that will be to their benefit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here are
