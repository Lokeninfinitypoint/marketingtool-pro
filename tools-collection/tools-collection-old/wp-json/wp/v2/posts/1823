On average, Americans work more hours than just about any other industrialized nation in the world. They spend more hours at the office, take fewer vacations, and even go to work when they\u2019re sick.<\/p>\n<p>For many, this isn\u2019t a choice \u2013 it\u2019s just what they have to do to survive. For some, however, the cult of productivity has become an all-powerful idol, and one that businesses all over the country fervently worship.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7f916f24-9022-4182-b102-c94e55675749\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/productivity-for-content-marketers-all-work-no-play-1.png\" alt=\"Productivity for content marketers all work and no play The Shining\" width=\"1139\" height=\"568\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Work-related stress has become a badge of honor. Employees regularly boast of how early they come in, how late they stay, and how little vacation time they\u2019ve used. Even in casual conversation, many Americans simply can\u2019t help mentioning how hard they\u2019re working.<\/p>\n<p>Admit it \u2013 if you\u2019re reading this at work, you\u2019d probably rather be somewhere else, and that\u2019s exactly how it should be. There\u2019s more to life than work. This school of thought doesn\u2019t mean you have a bad work ethic, it means that you see work as what it is \u2013 a means to an end.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a content marketer, you\u2019re likely familiar with the pressures of life in the trenches, but in today\u2019s post, I\u2019m going to show you another way \u2013 several, actually \u2013 of doing things. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I like my job, but as the old saying goes, I\u2019d rather be fishing.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"397a6b2b-05e9-4230-91c9-96abeade5c35\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/productivity-for-content-marketers-rather-be-fishing-1.jpg\" alt=\"Productivity for content marketers I'd rather be fishing\" width=\"650\" height=\"366\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><em>The very definition of a \u201cno-brainer.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Here are some tips (and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/08\/24\/online-marketing-tools\">marketing tools<\/a>) that can help you get more done in the office so you can spend more time out of it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MORE:<\/strong> <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/16\/content-marketing-challenges\">11 Content Marketing Challenges (&amp; How to Overcome Them)<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Productivity Tip #1: Eliminate Distractions<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s amazing how much you can get done if you stop procrastinating and actually sit down to work. I can usually <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/09\/how-to-write-a-blog-post\">write a 2,000-word blog post<\/a> in a day. However, when you factor in constant distractions such as email, meetings, and the insidious temptation of internet browsing, writing a blog post can quickly become a task that spans several days, if not a week.<\/p>\n<p>If you need to sit down and write something, sit down and write something. Don\u2019t check your email. Keep meetings to a bare minimum. Resist the temptation to tweet about how productive you\u2019re being. Just sit down and get it done.<\/p>\n<h3>The Tool to Help You Do It: RescueTime<\/h3>\n<p>If you really can\u2019t stop checking the headlines or sneaking a peek at Twitter when you should be writing, give RescueTime a shot.<\/p>\n<p>This software program tracks your computer usage and shows you exactly how you\u2019re spending your time. It also offers optional features such as site blocking for specified periods of time, alerts, goal tracking, and other <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/26\/productivity-tools\">productivity tools<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"fb49b2da-b93d-42f0-bfa5-d5f7f7c6534a\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/productivity-for-content-marketers-rescuetime-1.png\" alt=\"Productivity for content marketers RescueTime\" width=\"999\" height=\"739\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><em>Image via <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rescuetime.com\/\"><em>rescuetime.com<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Before we go any further, it\u2019s important to note that I\u2019m not recommending you use RescueTime (or any similar programs) so you can become one of those insufferable people who need to account for every waking second of their day. As I said in the introduction, I want to show you how to get things done while you\u2019re at work, not find new ways for you to stay late and get even <em>more<\/em> done.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t lose sleep about how many minutes of work you \u201clost,\u201d or what you <em>could<\/em> have accomplished in a given period of time \u2013 use RescueTime as a tool to get some work done so you can go out and enjoy your life when 5 p.m. rolls around.<\/p>\n<h2>Productivity Tip #2: Simplify Your Writing Environment<\/h2>\n<p>Wendell Berry is one of my all-time heroes. In addition to being an incredibly prolific and talented writer (with more than fifty books and counting to his name), Berry is a farmer and a passionate advocate for agriculture who still makes time to tend the fields of his farm in rural Kentucky every single day.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"e0d6a627-50e4-49fd-bab9-447f5670ba01\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/productivity-for-content-marketers-wendell-berry-1.jpg\" alt=\"Productivity for content marketers Wendell Berry\" width=\"700\" height=\"350\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>One thing Berry does not have in his Kentucky farmhouse, however, is a computer.<\/p>\n<p>Although using a typewriter is impractical for content marketers, there\u2019s a lot to be said for simplifying your writing environment. If you write using Google Drive, you\u2019re only a tab away from a world of enticing distractions, whereas navigating the needless complexities of Microsoft Word can feel more like a punishment than anything else. However, you still need to actually write if you\u2019re going to publish new content, so what can you do? Strip away everything that stands between you and your copy.<\/p>\n<h3>The Tool to Help You Do It: OmmWriter<\/h3>\n<p>Admittedly, when I first heard about OmmWriter, I was skeptical. However, after just a few days, I was sold. I personally don\u2019t use this free program for every writing project, but when I need to make some serious headway, OmmWriter is awesome.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6975f6f2-239b-42ff-b053-3e3d153f1daa\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/productivity-for-content-marketers-ommwriter-1.png\" alt=\"Productivity for content marketers OmmWriter screenshot\" width=\"602\" height=\"377\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>OmmWriter is a minimalist writing program that offers you the Zen-like peace of a completely unobtrusive interface. In fact, much of OmmWriter\u2019s UI actually fades from view while you write, leaving you with just a calming background, a cursor, and an optional ambient soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>I find OmmWriter to be a great tool when drafting. I\u2019ll often do the lion\u2019s share of a rough draft in OmmWriter before taking it into another program for polishing and restructuring. It doesn\u2019t support image insertion, hyperlinking, or other features you\u2019d expect from a word processor, but it excels at removing obstacles between you and that all-important first draft.<\/p>\n<h2>Productivity Tip #3: Be Ruthlessly Organized<\/h2>\n<p>Nothing wastes more time \u2013 and thus pushes your deadline beyond the point of reason \u2013 faster than disorganization.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"9379f4bf-c5c2-4f01-8f8c-44cd36ef245c\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/productivity-for-content-marketers-disorganized-warehouse-1.jpg\" alt=\"Productivity for content marketers disorganized warehouse\" width=\"946\" height=\"709\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><em>It\u2019s GOT to be in here somewhere\u2026<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The longer you have to spend looking for research, links to relevant articles, or anything else, the longer it\u2019s going to take you to finish your post\/white paper\/whatever. More time equals more work. This is great if you get paid by the hour, but if you\u2019re salaried (or a freelancer), this is death. If you\u2019re going to rock it as a content writer, you need to be great <em>and<\/em> fast.<\/p>\n<h3>The Tool to Help You Do It: Evernote Web Clipper<\/h3>\n<p>No blog post about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/23\/productivity-tools-small-business-owners-marketers-2021\">productivity<\/a> would be complete without a mention of Evernote. Specifically, I\u2019d like to recommend the Web Clipper tool, which makes Evernote even more awesome.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"9f21cba9-174b-4092-901f-dc998e99a397\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/productivity-for-content-marketers-evernote-web-clipper-1.png\" alt=\"Productivity for content marketers Evernote Web Clipper\" width=\"905\" height=\"770\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>For longer or more in-depth writing projects, Evernote\u2019s Web Clipper is a blessing. It allows you to save literally anything you can find on the web \u2013 images, text, video, multimedia, .gifs of cats \u2013 into easily accessible bulletin boards for later review.<\/p>\n<p>Web Clipper can be synchronized across multiple devices, so no more emailing links to yourself or hunting for that graph you saw but forgot to save. If you find and clip something on your desktop, you can access it from your phone and vice versa. You can also add a Web Clipper button to your web browser, allowing you to quickly and easily save everything you need for your next smash-hit content project.<\/p>\n<h2>Productivity Tip #4: Get in the Zone \u2013 and Stay There<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019ve probably experienced \u201cthe zone\u201d \u2013 that peculiar state of hyperconcentration in which time seems to slow down and you get more done than you actually thought possible. It\u2019s a magical place, and one that lame self-help productivity \u201cgurus\u201d are always talking about. However, finding the zone is one thing; staying in it is another thing entirely.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"0369416b-21d3-4e36-ae17-b1d7a6519fe6\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/productivity-for-content-marketers-getting-in-the-zone-1.jpg\" alt=\"Productivity for content marketers The Zone\" width=\"560\" height=\"356\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><em>There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man\u2026<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Getting \u2013 and staying \u2013 in the zone requires a certain atmosphere, namely one in which you can concentrate and eliminate the bustle of the environment around you. Unfortunately, with most modern offices being open plan (despite <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/business\/currency\/the-open-office-trap\">the seriously negative impact<\/a> such environments can have on workers\u2019 mental health), it\u2019s hard to eliminate external distractions.<\/p>\n<h3>The Tool(s) to Help You Do It: Rainy Mood<\/h3>\n<p>First, get yourself a decent set of headphones, then fire up your laptop\/word processor and keep <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rainymood.com\/\">Rainy Mood<\/a> open in another (minimized) tab.<\/p>\n<p>Rainy Mood is a website that plays a looped audio track of a heavy rain storm. This might not sound that exciting, but it\u2019s remarkable how the simple sound of rain and the occasional rumble of thunder can drown out office noise. You can also set music to play in the background if the rain alone isn\u2019t enough to block out the sounds of noisy coworkers \u2013 yeah, <em>those<\/em> guys.<\/p>\n<h3>Coffitivity<\/h3>\n<p>Not a fan of Rainy Mood? Prefer the background bustle of latte machines and the low murmur of conversation? Then check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coffitivity.com\/\">Coffitivity<\/a>, a similar site to Rainy Mood that offers you the (possibly) soothing ambient noise of a coffee shop.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"14f2bfaa-1608-499b-8f66-5f85dbd49015\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/productivity-for-content-marketers-coffitivity-1.png\" alt=\"Productivity for content marketers Coffitivity\" width=\"1158\" height=\"568\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Coffitivity has several settings to cater to different preferences. For example, you can specify the site to play the low-key hum of an early morning coffee shop, or the more boisterous background of a university coffee shop at lunch time. If you want to enjoy the atmosphere of your favorite coffee place without having to worry about your laptop being stolen while you go to the bathroom, Coffitivity might just be the answer.<\/p>\n<h2>Productivity Tip #5: Conquer Your To-Do List<\/h2>\n<p>Admit it \u2013 you\u2019re terrible at multitasking.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t worry, we all are. Several <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/templates\/story\/story.php?storyId=95256794\">studies<\/a> suggest that humans simply aren\u2019t built for doing multiple things at once. Rather than beat yourself up over your limitations, embrace it and get on with your life by using a to-do list program.<\/p>\n<h3>The Tool(s) to Help You Do It: Todoist<\/h3>\n<p>Despite its terrible name, Todoist is one of the best list management applications on the market.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ba63f6a6-9e34-414c-b27f-56652f0fe8c5\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/productivity-for-content-marketers-todoist-1.png\" alt=\"Productivity for content marketers Todoist\" width=\"878\" height=\"748\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Available in both free and premium versions (Todoist premium has an annual subscription fee of $29), Todoist offers several excellent tools for keeping track of what you\u2019ve got going on. It\u2019s a cross-platform tool that integrates with virtually all the programs you need it to (even Mozilla\u2019s aging email client Thunderbird), and can sync across multiple devices. Overall, a rock-solid to-do management app that can help you get more done in the office.<\/p>\n<h3>Any.do<\/h3>\n<p>Although Todoist is robust and fully featured, it might have a little too much going on for the minimalists out there. If you\u2019d rather use a free app without all the bells and whistles, check out Any.do.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"14095b50-6fd8-407f-a948-e50949eff705\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/productivity-for-content-marketers-anydo-1.png\" alt=\"Productivity for content marketers Any.do\" width=\"673\" height=\"538\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>I use Any.do all the time, and it meets my needs perfectly.
