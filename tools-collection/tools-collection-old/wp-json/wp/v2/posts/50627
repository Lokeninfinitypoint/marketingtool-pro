Automation is getting better<\/h3>\n<p>Many are up in arms about this just being another step in Google\u2019s push for automation, but take these perspectives into consideration.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Automation isn&#8217;t evil<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In the same LinkedIn post mentioned above, Navah Hopkins writes:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAm I concerned? Not really! Google Ads has done a really good job of improving the ad format and allowing us to simulate the brand integrity of ETAs while benefitting from built-in A\/B testing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sometimes RSAs perform better<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>And Susie feels the same way. \u201cIn my experience, I\u2019ve often seen RSA actually have performed better than the ETAs. Not always, but usually. Maybe that\u2019s because Google has been secretly favoring them and ranking them higher all along. Who knows. But this definitely matches Google\u2019s overall push for automation and trust in its algorithm. I\u2019ll give them credit that their machine learning has gotten better over the years (which is probably why they\u2019re deciding to do this now). But they still have a long way to go.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>But not always<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>However, not all advertisers have had this experience.<\/p>\n<p>In Search Engine Land&#8217;s coverage on the issue, <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/what-does-crypto-have-to-do-with-seo-and-ppc-thursdays-daily-brief-374216\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Carolyn Lyden <\/a>shares a different point of view:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8216;RSAs underperform ETAs almost universally in my experience,&#8217;\u00a0said Collin Slattery, Founder Taikun Digital. \u201cRSAs almost always under-perform ETAs, across millions in spend and over a year of testing.

But, honestly, changing the headline in your ETA isn\u2019t going to make or break your account regardless.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Create evergreen ETAs<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In her <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/google-plans-to-sunset-expanded-text-ads-heres-what-advertisers-can-do\/418105\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Search Engine Journal coverage<\/a> on the matter, Amy Bishop has similar advice:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I would absolutely suggest testing ETAs hard in the next few months while you can still create them. Be sure to add some evergreen ETAs that you can use in the future, as well. You may even want to set up some additional ads so that you can continue testing even after you\u2019re unable to add new ETAs.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>2.
