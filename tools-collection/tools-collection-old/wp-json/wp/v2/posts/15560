Ideally, you\u2019ll make a good impression\u2014thus making it more likely that your prospects will go with your product or service <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/30\/commercial-intent-keywords\">when they\u2019re ready to buy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/outbound-marketing\"><em>Outbound<\/em> marketing<\/a>, on the other hand, refers to the marketing strategy behind traditional paid media: TV ads, billboards, those insane Vitamin Water posters that make your morning commute worthwhile. The commonality across these ad types is the direct advertisement of a product or service.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/inbound-marketing-examples-vitamin-water.jpg\" alt=\"inbound-marketing-examples-brandon-vitamin-water\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Outbound marketing brings your offering to your prospects. Inbound marketing brings your prospects to <em>you<\/em>.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Why should I use inbound marketing?<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Short answer: because it allows you to build trust with high-quality leads who <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/26\/intent-marketing\">demonstrate an active interest<\/a> in your product or service.<\/p>\n<p>This is particularly important if <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/26\/sales-cycle\">your business has a relatively long sales cycle<\/a>. If your prospects generally take their time to research different offerings and weigh the pros and cons of each, building brand awareness and trust is <em>big<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a B2B marketer selling social media management software.

If you can get people talking about your brand, you\u2019ll see conversions in no time.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Example #3: A whitepaper<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The definition and purpose of a whitepaper depends on who you ask. The industry you\u2019re in and the goals you pursue certainly influence the final product.<\/p>\n<p>For our purposes, we\u2019ll define a whitepaper as an in-depth, well-researched piece of educational content that adopts a somewhat more formal tone than your average blog post.<\/p>\n<p>Whereas a blog post is your weekly homework assignment, a whitepaper is your term paper.<\/p>\n<p>As a rule, assume that the prospects who download your whitepaper are expecting higher degrees of rigor, depth, originality, and value.<\/p>\n<p>It should look good, too. Presentation is half the battle.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/inbound-marketing-examples-whitepaper.jpg\" alt=\"inbound-marketing-examples-koozai\" width=\"444\" height=\"313\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>Via <a href=\"https:\/\/www.koozai.com\/resources\/whitepapers\/video-marketing-guide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Koozai<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The key advantage of a whitepaper over a blog post or an <a href=\"https:\/\/venngage.com\/blog\/what-is-an-infographic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">infographic<\/a> is that\u2014in addition to providing value to the people who qualify for your product or service\u2014you can require contact information in exchange.<\/p>\n<p>That way, after readers have downloaded your content, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/13\/targeted-email-marketing-strategies\">use email marketing<\/a> to nurture them closer to conversion.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Example #4: An ebook<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I won\u2019t front\u2014the benefits of an ebook are pretty similar to those of a whitepaper.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s another opportunity to develop your brand as an authoritative resource of actionable, insightful information.

Remember: You\u2019re writing a <em>book<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>That implies a pretty serious level of sophistication. You should reserve this content format for your truly hard-hitting material.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/inbound-marketing-examples-ebook.png\" alt=\"inbound-marketing-examples-unbounce\" width=\"650\" height=\"886\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>Via <a href=\"https:\/\/unbounce.com\/content-marketing\/top-10-free-marketing-ebooks-of-2015\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Unbounce<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Example #5: A case study (or customer spotlight)<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Imagine that you\u2019re a business owner in the market for a social media management software like the one I mentioned before.<\/p>\n<p>While you\u2019re browsing the blog of one of the companies you\u2019re considering, you come across <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/15\/mediabeast-customer-spotlight\">a case study<\/a>. It tells the story of a company\u2014eerily similar to yours\u2014that bought the software a year ago and has seen positive returns ever since.<\/p>\n<p>This software has made a <em>huge<\/em> difference for the featured customer.<\/p>\n<p>Naturally, you think to yourself: \u201cWell, that means it can work for me, too, right?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s the power of a case study. It demonstrates to the people on the fence that your product or service has done wonders for people just like them. Talk about a nudge, huh?<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Example #6: A webinar<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It\u2019s not always easy to inject personality into your written content.<\/p>\n<p>True, the relative informality of the blog post allows you to crack jokes; however, when it comes to the highly polished world of whitepapers and ebooks, you may find yourself wishing you could add something a little more \u2026 human.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s where <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/03\/marketing-webinars\">the webinar<\/a> comes in.<\/p>\n<p>A webinar is an internet seminar\u2014lecture-style content presented to an exclusive web audience. With this format, a member (or a few members) of your content team has the opportunity to provide that valuable information we\u2019ve been talking about and <em>do it in a highly engaging and personable way<\/em>.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/inbound-marketing-examples-ignite-visibility.jpg\" alt=\"inbound-marketing-examples-webinar\" width=\"913\" height=\"645\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>Via <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_tw6_F-aHDs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IgniteVisibility<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The presence of a real, sentient person\u2014even if it\u2019s just his or her voice\u2014creates the feeling that your brand is in direct conversation with your prospects. Whereas it\u2019s easy for your prospects to abstract away the talented people who create your blog posts, whitepapers, and ebooks, that\u2019s not the case with a webinar.<\/p>\n<p>And, once again, the ability to request information from your prospects as an entrance fee makes the webinar a particularly good <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/24\/landing-pages-for-lead-generation\">lead generation<\/a> tactic.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Example #7: A podcast<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Make all the jokes you want about pretentious millennials. Nowadays, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/goal-talk\">podcasting<\/a> is sexy.<\/p>\n<p>(I may regret that sentence in a few years. That\u2019s the price I pay for being a content cowboy.)<\/p>\n<p>Much like the webinar, the podcast format allows you to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/12\/23\/humanize-brand\">attach some personality to your brand<\/a>. That way, when your prospects are making their final decisions, they\u2019ll remember you as both a valuable and <em>relatable<\/em> resource.<\/p>\n<p>Podcasting doesn\u2019t need to be labor-intensive, either. If you\u2019ve got a laptop, a couple mics, and at least one coworker who sounds nothing like Steve Buscemi, you\u2019re in business.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/inbound-marketing-examples-podcasters.jpg\" alt=\"inbound-marketing-examples-marketing-over-coffee\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>The co-hosts of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marketingovercoffee.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Marketing Over Coffee<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One 30-minute episode a week is all it takes to become the engaging brand potential customers turn to during their Monday morning commutes.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Example #8: A video series<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I\u2019ll spare you the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/08\/video-marketing-statistics\">video marketing statistics<\/a> you\u2019ve been hearing all year and leave it at this:<\/p>\n<p>Video content is huge.

It\u2019s what people want to see when they\u2019re scrolling through Facebook and Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>You already know why it works, too: It brings your brand to life.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/inbound-marketing-examples-wordstream-weekly.jpg\" alt=\"inbound-marketing-examples-gordon-video\" width=\"521\" height=\"500\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>A screenshot of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCrvBaHMLtSQ55IWAZiRQuQQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WordStream Weekly<\/a> episode.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whereas it pays to make your written content long-form, video is best when it\u2019s bite-size. There are exceptions to every rule, but social media users are <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/how-long-should-videos-be-on-instagram-twitter-facebook-youtube\">generally uninterested<\/a> in videos that go longer than a minute or two.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, video is a great opportunity to repurpose content in a more digestible format. A prospect may not have had the time to attend your webinar, but he can probably spare two minutes while scrolling through LinkedIn to get the basic ideas.<\/p>\n<p>Yeah, you\u2019d prefer he attend the webinar and fill out a form, but building a reputation as a great video company ain\u2019t bad, either.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Example #9: Search engine optimization<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What better way to finish this guide than with the inbound marketing strategy that makes the previous eight all the more effective?<\/p>\n<p>SEO is an umbrella term in and of itself, referring to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/30\/seo-basics\">the suite of practices<\/a> you can (and should) use to make your content more visible in the search engine results pages.<\/p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t matter how sleek your ebook looks or how crisp your podcast sounds unless your prospects can <em>actually find you<\/em> in the organic search results. That means getting your content on page one\u2014ideally in the middle or at the top.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/inbound-marketing-examples-ctr-organic-positions.png\" alt=\"inbound-marketing-examples-organic-click-through-rates\" width=\"429\" height=\"256\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>Via <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smartinsights.com\/search-engine-optimisation-seo\/seo-analytics\/comparison-of-google-clickthrough-rates-by-position\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Smart Insights<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Otherwise, you\u2019re not driving anybody to your website.<\/p>\n<p>On-page SEO encompasses all the stuff you can do directly on your website to make your content more visible on the SERP. At a macro level, that means making high-quality, human-oriented content that truly answers searchers\u2019 questions and solves their problems. At a micro level, that means <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/seo-keyword\">optimizing content for particular keywords<\/a> to ensure that it\u2019s considered relevant when people search certain queries you want to address.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/13\/off-page-seo\">Off-page SEO<\/a> encompasses all the stuff that takes place away from your site. Essentially, the goal is to acquire links to your content from reputable websites. Each link indicates to search engines that your content is good and, therefore, worthy of moving up the organic ranks.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m grossly oversimplifying, but you get the gist: SEO is a massive part of inbound marketing because people don\u2019t visit the websites they don\u2019t know exist.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">And if you don\u2019t know, now you know.<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There you have it, folks\u2014nine different ways to get the people most qualified for your product or service on your website and familiar with your awesome brand.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, not all of these tactics are going to be right for you. In fact, you may find that only one or two are good fits for your broader marketing strategy.<\/p>\n<p>And that\u2019s cool! By no means do you need to become the Wizard of Inbound (band name) to see success. As with everything else in marketing, it will be a process of tests, trials, and errors.<\/p>\n<p>Once you find the balance that works best for you, the leads will be lining up at your door.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Inbound marketing is the art of driving prospects to your website and securing conversions from there.
