Take a B2C approach<\/h3>\n<p>The lines are being blurred between B2B marketing and B2C. This is due\u00a0to the increasingly competitive nature of the digital space as well as the growing\u00a0percentage of millennials in the B2B buyer population. In fact, according to<a href=\"https:\/\/ebook.foleon.com\/2021-insights-report\/cover\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Foleon&#8217;s 2021 B2B Buyer Insights Report<\/a>, 80% of B2B buyers now expect a B2C experience.<\/p>\n<p>In order to stand out above the noise, and to millennials, B2C approaches are necessary, like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personalization (in more than just emails).<\/li>\n<li>Emotional marketing (<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/13\/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing\">more on that here<\/a>).<\/li>\n<li>Ease of access (to educational content and self-service).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>3. Cater to a longer buying cycle<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s always been known that B2B marketing typically has a longer <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/26\/sales-cycle\">buying cycle <\/a>than B2C. But according to a study conducted by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/business-functions\/marketing-and-sales\/our-insights\/these-eight-charts-show-how-covid-19-has-changed-b2b-sales-forever\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McKinsey<\/a> at the end of 2020, the buying cycle has gotten even longer for B2B businesses since the pandemic.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/b2b-marketing-strategies-sales-cycle-increases-1.png\" alt=\"b2b marketing strategies b2b sales cycle increase since COVID\" width=\"800\" height=\"457\" \/><\/div>\n<p>With budgets being tightened, B2B buyers are taking more care to research products and services, and to more thoroughly calculate ROI beforehand.

Since knowing your audience is the fundamental first step for all types of marketing (see, I told you I&#8217;d talk about these things), first-party-data-friendly marketing campaigns are essential. Ways to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/12\/first-party-data\">collect first-party data<\/a> include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>PPC <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/24\/facebook-lead-ads\">lead gen campaigns<\/a> and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/11\/call-to-action-examples-for-email-newsletter-signups\">email list building<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Google Ads alternatives (like <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/25\/bings-ads-vs-google-adwords\">Microsoft<\/a> or <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/23\/selling-on-amazon\">Amazon<\/a>).<\/li>\n<li>Using A\/B content testing to collect your own psychographic data (headlines, tone, related content suggestions).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/b2b-marketing-strategies-first-party-data-custom-questions-1.png\" alt=\"b2b marketing strategies to collect first party data through custom questions in google ads\" width=\"800\" height=\"530\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>You can even create custom questions in Facebook ads to collect first-party data.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>5. Supplement your automation with AI<\/h3>\n<p>Marketing automation and artificial intelligence (<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/benefits-of-artificial-intelligence-in-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI<\/a>) are not one and the same. Marketing automation software is geared toward helping humans to carry out simple and repetitive tasks. This still requires configuring workflows around various scenarios and using the data to make manual optimizations.\u00a0AI, however, uses data to mimic human intelligence and reasoning to make predictions, suggest optimizations, and dynamically apply them.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketingaiinstitute.com\/blog\/automation-and-ai-what-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Combining automation and artificial intelligence<\/a> gives you the best of both worlds: you get the efficiency and time-saving benefits of automation, along with the ability to recommend and make adjustments to the automation using data-driven\u00a0insights.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some examples of how AI can augment automation:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tools that write subject lines or portions of emails within your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/01\/automated-email-marketing\">email automation platform<\/a> that are highly personalized.<\/li>\n<li>Smart Bidding strategies or the Insights Page in Google Ads<\/li>\n<li>Using past data for more accurate lead scoring in a CRM.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Now that we&#8217;ve gone over the overarching themes, let&#8217;s talk about ways to apply them in the most popular B2B marketing channels: SEO, PPC, social media, email.<\/p>\n<h2>The best B2B marketing strategies using SEO<\/h2>\n<p>SEO helps you to get found in searches the buyers within your target businesses are performing. Here are three strategies to employ for better B2B SEO:<\/p>\n<h3>6. Have an SEO keyword funnel<\/h3>\n<p>Since B2B buyers are doing such heavy research these days, and are not yet ready to buy during this process, having organic content that <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/19\/get-on-first-page-google\">ranks<\/a> at every stage of their journey is huge. This way, you\u2019re not only supporting their research, but you\u2019re also staying top of mind, displaying your expertise, and building trust throughout their whole process.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/seo-for-b2b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Backlinko\u2019s guide to B2B SEO<\/a>\u00a0provides excellent coverage for this strategy.\u00a0The\u00a0example they use is that of a logistics services company.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/b2b-marketing-strategies-keyword-funnel-seo-1.png\" alt=\"b2b marketing strategies seo keyword funnel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"567\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Here\u2019s what we can gather from this visual:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Top-of-funnel keywords<\/strong> are very tactical, such as with how-tos to help buyers carry out their role effectively (and to help you facilitate the identification of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/28\/pain-points\">pain points<\/a>).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Middle-of-funnel keywords<\/strong> can start to use more strategy-focused and comparison keywords as the buyer gets more educated.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bottom-of-funnel keywords<\/strong> are focused and targeted at exactly what the buyer (now) knows they want (thanks to your education along the way).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There is so much more to keywords for B2B marketing (intent and location modifiers) but this is an oversimplified version to help you get the gist.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Create career development content<\/h3>\n<p>Even though you are a business selling to another business, the buyer is still an individual person with a specific role in their company. And solutions aren\u2019t the only things they are searching for online. They\u2019re also looking at ways to educate themselves, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/17\/digital-marketing-skills\">build their skill sets<\/a>, and advance their career. Create\u00a0career development content to\u00a0establish your expertise while building connections with could-be customers and tapping into a whole new set of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">relevant keywords<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/b2b-marketing-strategies-career-development-content_0-1.png\" alt=\"b2b marketing strategies with career development content \" width=\"795\" height=\"185\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>How do I know this works?<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/17\/digital-marketing-skills\"> I&#8217;ve done it<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>8. Stay on top of algorithm updates<\/h3>\n<p>Technical SEO is nothing new, but it has grown in importance with new algorithm updates in the past year. For example,<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>With 100% <strong><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/15\/mobile-first-indexing\">mobile-first indexing<\/a>,<\/strong> you need to make sure Googlebot can access and render your mobile content and check your structured data among other things.<\/li>\n<li>With the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/19\/core-web-vitals-google-page-experience-update\"><strong>page experience update<\/strong><\/a>, you need to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/02\/improve-core-web-vitals\">improve your Core Web Vitals<\/a> by reducing javascript commands, compressing images, implementing <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/08\/lazy-loading-seo\">lazy loading<\/a>, and more.<\/li>\n<li>With<strong> Google\u2019s BERT update<\/strong>, targeting a keyword according to the intent of the person searching for it is essential.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">And what piece of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/30\/seo-basics\">content about SEO<\/a> would be complete without the overarching reminder: to produce quality content regularly that conveys <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/12\/google-e-a-t\">EAT<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The best B2B marketing strategies using PPC<\/h2>\n<p>PPC comes in many different forms: search ads, social media ads, display ads, app store ads, podcast ads, and more. All of these can be lucrative B2B marketing strategies. For this post, I\u2019m going to highlight three specific\u00a0strategies you can apply to improve your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/07\/18\/b2b-ppc-guide\">B2B PPC<\/a> efforts.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Use emotion in your ads<\/h3>\n<p>I can&#8217;t tell you how many articles there are out there that say B2C marketing is focused on emotion and B2C is focused on logic. (We&#8217;ve even been guilty of it.)<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/b2b-marketing-strategies-now-use-emotion-1.jpeg\" alt=\"b2b marketing strategies now use emotion\" width=\"747\" height=\"473\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>I never thought I&#8217;d use that stale meme pic, but the cosmos aligned.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>But <a href=\"https:\/\/scholar.harvard.edu\/files\/jenniferlerner\/files\/annual_review_manuscript_june_16_final.final_.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">science<\/a>\u00a0says that all decisions\u2014even B2B <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/23\/influence-buyers-marketing-psychology\">buying decisions<\/a>\u2014have an emotional basis. Even though businesses spend more time carefully considering options and even have decision-making committees, these committees are still made up of individuals.<\/p>\n<p>B2B businesses can (and absolutely should) inject emotion into their marketing campaigns. I promise I won&#8217;t talk about the Dove Beauty Sketches or the Subaru Emotional Outback campaign. From a B2B perspective you can be much more subtle, like in the example below:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/b2b-marketing-strategies-use-emotion-in-ads-1.png\" alt=\"emotional ppc ad as a b2b marketing strategy\" width=\"746\" height=\"566\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>This word choice triggers a bit of anger and indignance.

Combine broad match keywords with audience targeting in Google Ads<\/h3>\n<p>This isn\u2019t exactly a new strategy, but it\u2019s more important given the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/10\/modified-broad-match-going-away\">farewell we said to our friend modified broad<\/a> earlier this year.<\/p>\n<p>Without this keyword match type (and without the helpful information that used to be available to us in the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/03\/google-search-terms-report-changes\">search terms report<\/a>), you can\u2019t exactly be sure that you\u2019re targeting the exact right search query in your PPC campaigns. But you can be sure that you\u2019re targeting the right person.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/b2b-marketing-strategies-broad-match-with-audience-1.jpg\" alt=\"broad match with audience as a ppc b2b marketing strategy\" width=\"692\" height=\"374\" \/><\/div>\n<p>By targeting <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/29\/succeed-with-google-ads-broad-match\">broad match keywords<\/a> with <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/19\/google-custom-audiences\">audience targeting<\/a> you can capture a broad audience of the right people. And since B2B marketing largely targets the decision-makers in the company, this is especially helpful.<\/p>\n<h3>11. Use LinkedIn Website Demographics for more targeted ads<\/h3>\n<p>Back in 2018 when Microsoft bought LinkedIn, they rolled out the ability to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/24\/bing-ads-linkedin-profile-targeting\">use LinkedIn profile targeting for Microsoft Ads<\/a>. But one tool that doesn\u2019t seem to get a lot of attention is the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/02\/linkedin-website-demographics\">LinkedIn Website Demographics<\/a> tool. With this feature, you can look at traffic coming to your site based on company, company size, job function, job characteristics, industry, geography, and more. Use this data to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Segment audiences: <\/strong>See which departments and roles are\u00a0clicking on your ads.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Further segment by website pixel:<\/strong> Instead of viewing data for all of your website visitors, you can refine by the conversion behaviors they take on your site.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Compare audiences<\/strong>: Compare the above pixel data for different job functions. For example, if business development professionals make up a large portion of your ad traffic but are not converting, you may want to make tweaks to your ad. If you\u2019re getting decent traffic but no conversions, you may want to eliminate this audience segment altogether.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/b2b-marketing-strategies-linkedin-website-demographics-1.png\" alt=\"linkedin website demographics insights to inform ppc b2b marketing strategies\" width=\"1944\" height=\"1046\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Insights from Linkedin Website Demographics can help you in your other B2B marketing efforts since you can have a better idea of who\u2019s doing the research and who\u2019s making the decisions within your target businesses.<\/p>\n<h2>The best B2B marketing strategies using your website<\/h2>\n<p>With PPC and SEO driving traffic to your website, it\u2019s important to make sure your website provides the right experience for your buyers that aligns with expectations of 2021.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/localiq-grader?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium\"><b><i>How strong is your website and online presence?

Build community and relationships onTwitter<\/h3>\n<p>Surprisingly enough, Twitter and Facebook are tied as the second-most popular social media platform used by B2B content marketers. It&#8217;s a good place to have conversational interactions with prospects and customers, take note of trending topics in your clients&#8217; industries, and interact with influencers.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/b2b-marketing-strategies-twitter-1.png\" alt=\"b2b marketing strategies social media channels used for organic b2b marketing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"469\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/contentmarketinginstitute.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/b2b-2021-research-final.pdf\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here are some B2B Twitter marketing tips:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Start and participate in conversations.<\/strong> One of the main social media use cases for millennial B2B buyers is that of following discussions based on their topic of interest. Instead of hoping to be mentioned in popular conversations, why not start a weekly chat yourself!? (Take inspiration from #ppcchat).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use it for brand awareness and community building<\/strong>: The bad news is that the average lifespan of a tweet is <a href=\"https:\/\/komarketing.com\/blog\/how-to-use-twitter-for-b2b-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">20 minutes<\/a>. The good news is that unlike Facebook and Instagram, posting too much will not counteract your efforts. Post frequently on the platform to provide educational content, connect with your community, and even <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/25\/twitter-link-building\">build backlinks<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use lists. <\/strong>Create custom feeds for your business through lists. This way you can cut through the noise and stay more closely connected to followers that matter. You may want to build separate lists for clients, influencers, and industry news providers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>The best B2B marketing strategies using email<\/h2>\n<p>Email is the preferred form of communication for <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/email-marketing-stats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">73%<\/a> of millennials.

Needless to say, it&#8217;s a must-have B2B marketing strategy. Here are my three<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/16\/b2b-email-marketing\"> tips for B2B email marketing<\/a>:<\/p>\n<h3>17. Run nurture campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>Drip and nurture campaigns get used interchangeably, but they are not the same. Drip campaigns are a predetermined set of time-based emails you send out to a segment of your list, usually designed to drive a conversion. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/30\/lead-nurturing-campaign-emails\">Nurture campaigns<\/a> are behavior-based, meaning they go out to recipients according to how they\u2019ve interacted with your site and previous emails. Nurture email campaigns are best for B2B marketing since they focus on educating the prospect as they interact with your brand and provide more personalized content to help build the relationship.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a great example of a nurture email I got from Moz after creating an account to use their Chrome extension.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/b2b-marketing-strategies-nurture-email-example-1.png\" alt=\"b2b marketing strategies example of a nurture email\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1375\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The next email I get from Moz will depend on whether I click on this guide.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>For more help with your emails, check out these <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/small-business-email-examples-and-templates\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">34 free email examples and templates<\/a>\u00a0I created to make your life easier.<\/p>\n<h3>18.
