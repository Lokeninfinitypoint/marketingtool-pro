But based on the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/13\/digital-marketing-trends-2022\"> marketing trends so far<\/a>, here are the six ingredients we know you&#8217;ll need.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Review &amp; reset benchmarks<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s a best practice to review benchmarks and set goals on a regular basis, sure. But it&#8217;s time to look beyond the recurring analysis that we frequently do to monitor campaign performance and do it at a macro level.<\/p>\n<p>As I mentioned above, 2020 was the beginning of what seems like unending \u201cunprecedented times\u201d in the sense that most things are still not quite back to normal. Most of us have found a \u201cnew normal,\u201d to use another clich\u00e9, and advertisers have trudged forward, but many businesses\u2019 purchaser trends have changed over the past few years.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/paid-media-strategy-consumer-changes.png\" alt=\"paid media strategy - consumer behavior COVID chart\" width=\"563\" height=\"428\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-56741\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/paid-media-strategy-consumer-changes.png 563w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/paid-media-strategy-consumer-changes-480x365.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 563px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/us\/en\/insights\/economy\/us-consumer-spending-after-covid.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>With new variants on the rise, we could see another totally unique year or we might see trends that resemble prior years, whether that be 2021 or pre-COVID times. The reality is that most of us do not yet know what to expect, so we make use of the data that we have and we revisit it frequently.<\/p>\n<p>This year, advertisers need to seek out firmer, more established trends. This will be a year of revisiting what we thought we knew vs. what we saw in 2020 and 2021, while adding external annotations, to try to project what to expect on a go-forward basis.<\/p>\n<h3>How to do it<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Conduct quarterly reviews. <\/strong>This doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re off the hook with weekly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/07\/ppc-reporting\">PPC reporting<\/a>. You should be doing that too. But at the end of each quarter you should take a look at the broader trends going on with your performance and identify anything to improve, harness, or nix for the quarter ahead.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Visualize your data. <\/strong>Tools like Google Data Studio can help you achieve a better and more actionable understanding of your performance. <a href=\"https:\/\/datastudio.google.com\/gallery?category=marketing&amp;search=google%20ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Data Studio offers pre-made templates<\/a> to choose from, and you can find more in our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/10\/free-google-ads-tools\">round-up of free Google Ads tools<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use benchmarks. <\/strong>In addition to comparing against your own benchmarks, check your performance against industry benchmarks to make sure you\u2019re staying competitive.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/paid-media-strategy-benchmarks.png\" alt=\"paid media strategy - benchmark data example\" width=\"397\" height=\"497\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-56740\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/13\/search-advertising-benchmarks\">Check out our latest search advertising benchmarks here.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>2. Build a first-party-first strategy<\/h3>\n<p>The goal to eradicate third-party cookies across all browsers is clear, so big tracking and targeting changes are on the horizon. Because of this, there\u2019s no doubt there is a high premium on first-party data.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/zero-first-second-third-party-data.png\" alt=\"zero, frist, second, third-party data\" width=\"720\" height=\"467\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-57202\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>How to do it<\/h3>\n<p>To <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/12\/first-party-data\">collect more first-party data<\/a> from your audience, follow these tips:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Create <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/15\/lead-magnet-ideas\"><strong>lead magnets<\/strong><\/a><strong>.<\/strong> Offer free guides, free tools, and free consultations on your website\u2014anything of enough value that your relevant visitors will fill out a form for.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Run lead form ads. <\/strong>Try out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/26\/generate-leads-facebook-ads-ios14\">Facebook lead ads<\/a> or Google lead form extensions.

Stay on top of advanced tracking technology<\/h3>\n<p>For similar reasons, it&#8217;s also imperative that you increase your investment in tracking technology\u2014technology that gives you access to the data you need to propel you ad strategies and report on their effectiveness, but that also maintains the privacy of the prospects being targeted.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2021\/08\/privacy-enhancing-technologies-and-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced<\/a> that it would be investing in a multi-year initiative focused on privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) in collaboration with other organizations including the Partnership for Responsible Addressable Media (PRAM), the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), and World Federation of Advertisers (WFA). One such technology is private lift measurement, which it has been testing and plans to roll it out to advertisers this year.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2021\/08\/privacy-enhancing-technologies-and-ads\/\"><em><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/paid-media-strategy-privacy-enhancing-technologies.png\" alt=\"paid media strategy - privacy-enhancing technologies\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-56744\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/paid-media-strategy-privacy-enhancing-technologies.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/paid-media-strategy-privacy-enhancing-technologies-480x270.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2021\/08\/privacy-enhancing-technologies-and-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Facebook is calling on the industry to work together, collaboratively, noting that it will only work if there is a shared set of standards. It has open-sourced its framework for private computation to allow any developer to create privacy-centric measurement products.<\/p>\n<p>I tend to agree with Facebook that it would likely benefit most parties to have a shared set of standards versus a sea of different tracking mechanisms and standards between different devices, browsers, and ad platforms. The crossover with those three areas gets messy quickly\u2014not to mention the different legislation by geography.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook is not the only large company doing its due diligence, of course. We are seeing it with Google\u2019s Topics API and Microsoft\u2019s Parakeet, as well.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/google-topics-api-flowchart.jpg\" alt=\"google topics api - flowchart of topic assignment process\" width=\"720\" height=\"247\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-56560\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/google-topics-api-flowchart.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/google-topics-api-flowchart-480x165.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Image source<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tremplin-numerique.org\/en\/microsoft-prefers-their-parakeet-to-google-floc\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>And I anticipate other companies to have their own testing in motion. It will be really interesting to see what lies in store for us on this front.<\/p>\n<h3>How to do it<\/h3>\n<p>Unless you\u2019re a Facebook or Google Developer, there\u2019s not a whole lot to do here except stay informed on what\u2019s being built. However, you can start adopting tools that have already been made available to us.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Implement the Facebook Conversions API:<\/strong> The power of the Facebook Pixel is dwindling. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/06\/facebook-conversions-api\">Start using the Facebook CAPI<\/a> now to minimize gaps in your reporting.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Import your offline conversions: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/ocihelper.withgoogle.com\/\">Google\u2019s OCI helper tool<\/a> walks you through the process of getting your offline conversion data into Google Ads so you can find similar, high quality leads. Provide your information and it will put together a customized implementation plan with a progress dashboard and everything.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Set up Google ads enhanced conversions:<\/strong> This is Google\u2019s way of providing cross-device conversion tracking without cookies.

Test more paid media channels<\/h3>\n<p>Events of 2020 and 2021 created instances where certain platforms either underperformed or exceedingly overperformed most benchmarks. When those opportunities or issues arise, the advertisers that are prepared to take control of their circumstances are those that have already been proactively testing multiple channels.<\/p>\n<p>Single-platform advertisers, on the other hand, or advertisers that have the majority of their eggs in one bucket, struggle to be agile. In instances where that platform does not perform as well as it used to, it is hard to heavily reinvest elsewhere until you have had a chance to test and gather data.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/paid-media-strategy-facebook-outage.png\" alt=\"paid media strategy - facebook outage\" width=\"1055\" height=\"286\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-56746\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/paid-media-strategy-facebook-outage.png 1055w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/paid-media-strategy-facebook-outage-980x266.png 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/paid-media-strategy-facebook-outage-480x130.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1055px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Likewise, if another platform is suddenly performing really well, it is hard for advertisers to fully capitalize on it without knowing exactly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/13\/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-world\">which targeting options will perform well<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For example, with many advertisers scaling back budgets in the wake of COVID in 2020 while social usage was increasing at the same time, CPMs dropped significantly for advertisers that stayed the course <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/11\/lower-facebook-ads-cpm\">(how to combat rising CPMs here)<\/a>. It was tough for advertisers that had not previously had a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-increase-social-media-presence\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social presence<\/a> to determine whether they should transition budget or stay in their current channels, because they did not have a benchmark.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Having a diverse media mix makes advertisers more nimble and tougher to disrupt, even in the wake of big changes.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>How to do it<\/h3>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how to create a strong <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/10\/15\/multi-channel-marketing\">cross-channel marketing<\/a> strategy.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Always be testing out new <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-channels\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing channels<\/a>.<\/strong> You don\u2019t have to invest heavily in them, but make sure you know how they work for your business, which offers perform best on them, and what your benchmarks are so that should you need to fall back on it, you won\u2019t be upstream without a battle.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Employ a mix of paid and organic strategies.<\/strong> Head to our list of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/18\/best-marketing-strategies\">19 best marketing strategies for 2022<\/a> and you should be covered.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t promote the same offer on every channel. <\/strong>This is one of our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/24\/cross-channel-marketing-mistakes\">cross-channel marketing mistakes<\/a>.

Be a steward of automation<\/h3>\n<p>Not unlike tracking changes, there has been a clear and concerted effort to move advertisers into more automation. This is evidenced with the rollout of Performance Max, an ongoing push to automated bidding, and a push toward <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/01\/google-ads-auto-applied-recommendations\">auto-applied account changes<\/a> from both Google <a href=\"https:\/\/help.ads.microsoft.com\/#apex\/ads\/en\/60121\/2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">and Bing<\/a>, where the platforms will automatically make updates\u2014unless advertisers opt out.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-auto-applied-recommendations-list-of-recs-1.png\" alt=\"paid media strategy - google auto applied recommendations list\" width=\"936\" height=\"846\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8187\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-auto-applied-recommendations-list-of-recs-1.png 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-auto-applied-recommendations-list-of-recs-1-480x434.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Not to mention changes to Google Partner standards requiring premier partners to achieve a minimum of a 70% optimization score, which is a well-intentioned-but-mostly-meaningless score that truly only measures whether or not you mindlessly implement Google\u2019s (often self-serving) suggestions. This change was scheduled to roll out in 2020 but was pushed back in the midst of COVID, and is now officially set to roll out in 2022.<\/p>\n<h3>How to do it<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Test.<\/strong> Personally, I have seen success in automated bidding strategies and Performance Max campaigns, when used in the right instances and at the right times. You have to test them and give them time, as they don\u2019t always work right out of the gate.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Become a steward of automation. <\/strong>Sometimes automation feels like a power struggle. Plus, the lack of visibility makes it hard to trust that something is working optimally. But it can be helpful in many cases. Find things that automation can do well and use it there to free up time on what you need to manage manually.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Educate yourself. <\/strong>Of course, if you\u2019re not familiar with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/04\/google-ads-automation\">Google Ads\u2019 automation features<\/a>, get yourself up to speed! You can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/19\/google-ads-automated-bidding\">learn the pros and cons of every automated bidding strategy in Google here.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Try out AI. <\/strong>Automation, machine learning, and AI all come hand-in-hand. Check out these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/15\/ai-marketing\"> practical examples of AI in marketing<\/a> to see where you can get started.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote><p>Becoming a steward of automation still takes less time than full manual implementation and can lead to better outcomes in many cases. It is not man (or woman) versus machine, but rather man and machine!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>6. Master responsive search ads (RSAs)<\/h3>\n<p>Last but not least, the Google Ads portion of your paid media strategy needs to include RSAs. Though advertisers can continue to use existing expanded text ads (ETAs), including pausing and reactivating existing ETAs, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/02\/google-sunsetting-expanded-text-ads\">new ETAs cannot be created after June 2022.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Many advertisers noticed Google giving precedence to RSAs over ETAs at auction time in 2021, so it did not come as a surprise to most when Google announced RSAs would become the only option for new ads in the future.<\/p>\n<p>This also ties closely to the trend toward more automation (especially by Google) in 2021. Some advertisers have noted they do not find as great of performance with RSAs and so, it is no surprise that some have held off on fully jumping into RSAs. At this point, though, the transition is inevitable so it benefits advertisers to place a heavy focus on creating and improving RSAs to ensure that they are putting their best foot forward.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/responsive-search-ad-cheat-sheet-wordstream.png\" alt=\"responsive search ad cheat sheet\" width=\"401\" height=\"468\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-56751\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/responsive-search-ad-cheat-sheet-wordstream.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">See our full responsive search ad cheat sheet here.<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>How to do it:<\/h3>\n<p>Start creating RSAs, of course!

Get RSAs active in every ad group now so you can have clear expectations for what performance will look like after June.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Diversify your copy: <\/strong>Each headline and description should be different so Google can mix and match. At least two headlines should include keywords and at least three should not include keywords.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t abandon ETAs! <\/strong>Your existing ETAs will still run after June 30, 2022, you just won&#8217;t be able to edit them.
