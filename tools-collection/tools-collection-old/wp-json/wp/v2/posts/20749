It\u2019s September 2016, Rob Bucci of STAT Search Analytics has just taken the stage at MozCon. As unsuspecting attendees, we didn\u2019t quite know what we were in for. What he delivered, in my opinion, was the starting pistol for what has become the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/20\/expandable-featured-snippets\">featured snippet<\/a> gold rush.<\/p>\n<p>It was all anyone could talk about during the break, and people were still buzzing about Bucci\u2019s talk days later.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, forward-looking SEOs have known for some time that snippets are a huge, largely untapped opportunity. But having Bucci bash us over the head with his <a href=\"https:\/\/getstat.com\/blog\/featured-snippets\/\">in-depth study on snippets<\/a> snapped several thousand SEOs out of their reveries. Well, at least, that\u2019s what it did for me.<\/p>\n<p>Since then, I\u2019ve been thinking (read: obsessing) a lot about <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/10\/13\/google-answer-box\">featured snippets<\/a>. I\u2019ve been trying to figure out the best tools to use to get more of them. And I\u2019m pumped to say I\u2019ve found one. It\u2019s a free service called <a href=\"http:\/\/answerthepublic.com\/\">AnswerThePublic<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s already helped me get results and earn snippets like this one for the question, \u201cWhat is a business dashboard?\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"9191ee42-819d-4b3d-8350-6667f933bf33\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/earning-featured-snippets-with-answer-the-public-research.png\" alt=\"how to earn featured snippets\" width=\"800\" height=\"323\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>In this post, I\u2019m going to walk you through my process for snagging featured snippets using AnswerThePublic.<\/p>\n<h2>Questions Are The New Long Tail<\/h2>\n<p>Aside from being a frank and humorous post, Larry Kim\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/searchenginewatch.com\/2017\/01\/12\/nine-crazy-predictions-for-seo-in-2017\/\">nine crazy predictions for SEO in 2017<\/a> was another important reminder to me that organic search positioning is increasingly reliant on your ability to provide value to the end user.<\/p>\n<p>That is what search is all about, anyway. Query-based learning is such a natural way to learn. That we type terms into Google using short-hand terms is unnatural. Would you walk up to a friend and, devoid of any emotion, say \u201cChicken Recipes\u201d?<\/p>\n<p>I hope not. Like the fast-growing percentage of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/14\/google-voice-search\">voice searches<\/a>, you\u2019d say something like \u201cWhat\u2019s a good chicken recipe?\u201d And <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/tactical-keyword-research-in-a-rankbrain-world\">Google\u2019s RankBrain<\/a> is preparing for the fact that you\u2019re increasingly more likely to use a search engine to ask real, human questions, such as:\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s a good chicken recipe that uses lemon and basil and maybe is cooked on the BBQ?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Optimize for that!<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4684cc8f-6134-43ee-87dd-a69603d928e2\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/featured-snippet-questions-via-moz1-1.jpg\" alt=\"featured snippet questions\" width=\"800\" height=\"593\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/what-we-learned-analyzing-featured-snippets\"><em>Image via Moz<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/09\/question-keywords\">Questions<\/a> represent the new long-tail opportunity for SEOs, and, it just so happens, they also are much more likely to <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/what-we-learned-analyzing-featured-snippets\">trigger featured snippets.<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>AnswerThePublic and Keyword Research<\/h2>\n<p>Keyword research is the foundation of good SEO, which is why so many SEOs are depressed that Google seems intent on <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/craft-remarkable-seo-strategy-2017-whiteboard-friday\">obscuring keyword data<\/a>. What do we do!?<\/p>\n<p>The answer, for me at least, is to demote the importance of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/23\/keyword-search-volume\">keyword volume data<\/a> and focus on the opportunity to answer user queries in a meaningful way. Let\u2019s use search to establish a relationship as opposed to pulling top rank.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why AnswerThePublic is such a valuable tool. The technology is simple. It looks at the auto suggest results from Google and Bing, and automates the capturing of those results (<a href=\"http:\/\/answerthepublic.com\/#about-us\">Read in full here<\/a>). The end result is a one-page report that is full of brilliant insight.<\/p>\n<p>This matters because we\u2019re going to see SEO move away from surgical keyword targeting to topic ownership. Couple this with the advent of RankBrain, voice search, and featured snippets, and you\u2019ve got a compelling argument to optimize for answering questions as opposed to exact match keywords.<\/p>\n<h2>Using AnswerThePublic For Practical Keyword Research<\/h2>\n<p>AnswerThePublic has become ingrained in my <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/06\/keyword-research-tips\">keyword research<\/a>. It\u2019s the first stop on my journey to understanding the <a href=\"\/keyword-intent\">intent<\/a> behind a particular topic, and the insights are always illuminating. I use AnswerThePublic to complete the following three tasks:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What questions are being asked for a given term\/topic?<\/li>\n<li>Analyzing topically related terms<\/li>\n<li>Compiling a dictionary<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>1. What questions are being asked?<\/h3>\n<p>Search queries that start with an interrogative word are much more likely to generate a featured snippet, <a href=\"https:\/\/getstat.com\/blog\/best-words-generate-featured-snippets\/\">according to STAT\u2019s snippet research<\/a>. These types of inquiries offer the best chance for Google to answer your question within the SERP.<\/p>\n<p>When you enter a term into AnswerThePublic, it will show you information for Questions, Prepositions, and Alphabet. Last year I helped our Dev Manager perform some keyword research for a blog he wanted to write on \u201cHackathons.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what I get for results on that search:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"8c9df9c6-4da9-47b2-8a3d-a8210811b8c9\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/atp-keyword-research-for-featured-snippets.png\" alt=\"answer the public keyword research\" width=\"877\" height=\"749\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>Tip:<\/strong> If you don\u2019t feel like contorting your head to read all the questions, you can click the \u201cData\u201d tab at the top section to see an easy to read table of values.<\/p>\n<p>This question wheel is a gold mine for potential snippets. You can click on questions to go directly to Google search results and see what\u2019s being ranked, and if there\u2019s a snippet on that term. Instead of trying to boil the ocean, we decided to focus in on the \u201chow question\u201d and do a great job of answering \u201chow to run a hackathon.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>2. Analyzing topically related terms<\/h3>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"http:\/\/answerthepublic.com\/seeds\/963119\">seed for hackathon<\/a> and you\u2019ll see it\u2019s dominated by hosting hackathons, corporate hackathons, and how to win them. It can be overwhelming at first, but your objective as an SEO isn\u2019t to tackle them all; it\u2019s to succinctly and correctly answer a searcher\u2019s question.<\/p>\n<p>So seeing a giant list of terms is useful for narrowing your topic through exclusion. We made an active effort to avoid certain terms in our research because we wanted to provide value to a specific audience, and didn\u2019t want to get lost in the vast material available for folks participating in popular hackathons.<\/p>\n<p>AnswerThePublic provided great guidance as to what terms are related to running hackathons. Combine this with a bit of audience profiling, and I was able to identify a few questions which would add value to the article:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is a hackathon?<\/li>\n<li>How to organize a hackathon?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Based on this research, we decided a step-by-step guide would provide the most value.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Compiling a dictionary<\/h3>\n<p>I do see SEO as a form of constrained writing; it\u2019s the process of writing content in a way that reflects what people are looking for. If you\u2019re trying to rank for \u201cChicken Recipes,\u201d you\u2019d be silly to write an article on \u201cfowl dish instructions\u201d even if it satisfies your literary yearnings.<\/p>\n<p>AnswerThePublic lets you see what words people actually use when performing a search. Sometimes it takes a little course correction, like choosing the phrase \u201crun a hackathon\u201d over \u201claunch a hackathon.\u201d Or it can be more substantial like focusing in on \u201chackathon\u201d vs \u201chackday.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Preposition section gives you the pertinent information you need for understanding what the topic is really about. Remember, prepositions indicate movement or relationships within a sentence. I see this section as getting to the heart of the relationship between your topic and the reader\u2019s intent. Check out the results for the \u201cto\u201d section for \u201chackathon.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d5e32386-f02b-46d4-97a9-23afa310bd53\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/answer-the-public-hackathon-keywords.png\" alt=\"answer the public keyword data\" width=\"535\" height=\"312\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Your dictionary is a guidepost for what types of terms users expect to see when searching for a particular topic. I don\u2019t see a dictionary as a secondary keyword list that I need to jam into my content. Instead, it offers guidance when I\u2019m thinking about my content and what will be useful to users.<\/p>\n<h2>Answer The Public as the First Stop in Your Snippet Quest<\/h2>\n<p>Questions trigger featured snippets <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/what-we-learned-analyzing-featured-snippets\">at a much higher rate than other terms<\/a>. AnswerThePublic is a brilliant tool for analyzing the questions that users are actually asking. Now, I\u2019d argue that you can\u2019t just rely on what you see in the AnswerThePublic results. You need to read between the lines and rely on a bit of your SEO intuition.<\/p>\n<p>The results will speak for themselves. With a little bit of on-page SEO and content tweaking, we were able to snag snippets for our piece on Hackathons, and have seen big changes in traffic. Integrating AnswerThePublic into our keyword research has dramatically helped drive results for our scrappy digital marketing team will have. I think, regardless of the size of your team, it can do the same for you.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2061f9a3-0214-4fca-bee4-f8f938549d77\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/answer-the-public-analytics-traffic.png\" alt=\"featured snippet seo\" width=\"1302\" height=\"234\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>About the author<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Jonathan Taylor leads the digital marketing team at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.klipfolio.com\/\">Klipfolio<\/a>.
