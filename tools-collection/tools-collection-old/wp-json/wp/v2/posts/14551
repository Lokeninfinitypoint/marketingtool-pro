If your offer is for in-store shopping, users will receive a barcode or a QR code that can be later used on their mobile device at checkout.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"23913c57-23c0-4223-aa01-5b9b7eaf1e71\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-offer-ads-setup.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook offer ads setup\" width=\"764\" height=\"697\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Next up, head to the ad set level to the section labeled \u201cOffer\u201d where you\u2019ll see a toggle button.

When you move on to the ad level, both static images and video creatives are available options for Facebook offer ads. If you have video content relevant to your campaign and target audience, we encourage testing that\u2014subtle motion goes a long way in captivating users as they scroll down feeds. Get your prospective customers to stop on mobile and view your ad, then entice them with your ad copy and special offer to click and potentially convert.<\/p>\n<h2>Facebook offer ads specs<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When creating your Facebook offer ad, you\u2019ll have the option to present it to your target audience as a single image, a single video, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/21\/facebook-carousel-ads\">a carousel of images and videos<\/a>. Therefore, the specs for Facebook offer ads are a combination of all the specs for those other ad formats. Here\u2019s a quick refresher on image ads specs, video ads specs, and carousel ads specs:<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Facebook image ads specs (with link)<\/h3>\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\n<li>File type: .jpg or .png<\/li>\n<li>Image ratio: 1.91:1 to 1:1<\/li>\n<li>Maximum file size: 30 MB<\/li>\n<li>Recommended resolution: at least 1080px x 1080px<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Facebook video ads specs<\/h3>\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\n<li>Recommended file type: MP4 or MOV<\/li>\n<li>Video ratio: 9:16 to 16:9<\/li>\n<li>Maximum file size: 4 GB<\/li>\n<li>Recommended resolution: highest supported by file type and size<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Facebook carousel ads specs<\/h3>\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\n<li>Static image file type: .jpg or .png<\/li>\n<li>Recommended static image ratio: 1:1<\/li>\n<li>Maximum static image file size: 30 MB<\/li>\n<li>Recommended static image resolution: at least 1080px x 1080px<\/li>\n<li>Recommended video file type: MP4 or MOV<\/li>\n<li>Recommended video file size: 1:1<\/li>\n<li>Maximum video file size: 4 BG<\/li>\n<li>Recommended video file resolution: at least 1080px x 1080px<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>No matter what you choose for your visual assets, you\u2019ll always be limited to a <strong>50-character headline<\/strong> and a <strong>250-character description<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>How to use promo codes with Facebook offer ads<\/h2>\n<p>As you\u2019re strategizing your offer campaign and moving on to the ad creation, what kind of promo code will you use? Depending on your goals, your target audience, and how you prefer to track promo code use, you should test three types of promo codes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Generic:<\/strong> These codes can be used by anyone. These are effective and also efficient in terms of set up. For example, you can create one specifically for all of your Facebook offers that may look a little something like this: \u201cBOGOFB\u201d for a buy-one-get-one-free deal or \u201cFB25OFF\u201d for a 25% discount. Feel free to get creative with these, but make them short and easy to remember.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Unique:<\/strong> Prefer to not have your promo codes shared around the web and potentially impact your tracking of their source? Test our unique promo codes and barcodes with your offer Ads. With these, every user that saves your offer will receive a different code. To set these up using a .csv or .txt file\u2014instructions and specs can be located <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/1181893525262443\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Barcodes and QR codes:<\/strong> If you are using the Store Visits <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/26\/facebook-objectives\">campaign objective<\/a>, this is an excellent option to test out. Users can save your offer and redeem it at a later time in-store. Please refer to Facebook\u2019s Ads Help Center for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/1137765529610034\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">offer ads barcode formatting guidelines<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Send reminders, automatically<\/h3>\n<p>Claimed offers sitting stagnant? Worry not. Facebook has a gentle nudging solution for that. As the deal nears its expiration date, Facebook will send automatic reminds to any people who claimed an offer and didn\u2019t yet use it. Convenient and will help raise your conversion rates given the urgency and discount factor. A notification similar to this will appear:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"794ca94e-6051-4e64-b3f2-0c54f30f0e5e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-offer-ads-automatic-reminder.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook Offer Ads automatic reminder\" width=\"830\" height=\"438\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Once you set up an offer ad and a user saves it, they will also receive an email that may look like this:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_image_narrow\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2385ec9e-7eb9-4073-b25c-70884067f974\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-offer-ads-notification.jpg\" alt=\"Notification example for Facebook Offer Ads\" width=\"842\" height=\"886\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Facebook offer ads tips &amp; best practices<\/h2>\n<p>Testing your Facebook offer Ads is the most effective way to determine what works\u2014and what doesn\u2019t\u2014with your audience. But there are a few standard best practices that you should be sure to follow.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Edit your ads<\/h3>\n<p>As always, review your work before publishing, as once you publish an offer ad, you will not be able to edit. If someone does need a revision post-publishing, disable and create a new offer ad.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Set limits<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019ve found one thing very effective for our clients who use Facebook offer ads: set a lower limit on the Total Offers Available. More often than not, these sell out, given the lower quantity enticing higher demand. We\u2019re also testing increments to see where our sweet spot is with selling out and not having much left over, unclaimed. Simple economics here, but it works. To set a limit on the number of offers you have available, input a quantity in the Total Offers Available option to set a maximum.<\/p>\n<p>Please note, if you are using unique promo codes and setting limits, the Total Offers Available cannot exceed the number of unique codes that you upload.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Try geotargeting<\/h3>\n<p>If you are running an in-store offer, be mindful of your location targeting. If you have a physical location, you may see more success in targeting people within a particular radius targeting of the city you\u2019re based in or by zip code, rather than showcasing your Offer to people further away. It\u2019s easy to overlook this, but you\u2019ll focus your budget and increase your chances of offer claims and sale-based conversions by narrowing down your targeting.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Test ad copy<\/h3>\n<p>While the creative possibilities are endless here, if you\u2019re experiencing writer&#8217;s block, one thing we\u2019ve seen work well for a large number of our ecommerce clients is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/27\/facebook-ad-copy-tests\">testing ad copy<\/a> that mentions something along the lines of \u201cenjoy 10% off on us\u201d or \u201ctreat yourself to $25 off on us.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"84a472a2-14c2-49d9-b3d7-36d63715d815\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-offer-ads-on-us-ad-copy.jpg\" alt=\"ad with &quot;on us&quot; in the copy\" width=\"450\" height=\"637\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Make your audience feel special, and be genuine about it\u2014like you\u2019re treating them, because after all, you are.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Target new users<\/h3>\n<p>Test out timely Facebook offer ads with cold audiences as a way to get them into your funnel and familiarized to your brand. What could be easier as a first-time incentive to try you out and see how great your products are? Typically, when people are interested in something, unfamiliarity and price are deterrents from them opening up their wallets and converting. If you have a higher priced product or are struggling to get users to convert sooner, test out Offer Ads and see if that helps your sales volume and reducing your conversion window time.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Remarket, remarket, remarket<\/h3>\n<p>Prefer to not give a discount to cold audiences upon first touch and potentially mismanage expectations between customers and your pricing? Run other campaign types in order to drive conversions at full price. If your warmer audiences are lingering and not converting, Facebook offer ads can then step in to save the day in converting these users.<\/p>\n<p>With remarketing, you can certainly get as creative as you like with your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/10\/facebook-ad-targeting-options\">Facebook targeting option<\/a>s. If you\u2019re stuck on who to reach, we often recommend targeting custom audiences such as website visitors, specific landing page visitors, newsletter subscribers, leads, or customers that you are looking to upsell or cross-sell other products.<\/p>\n<p>Make it easy for your audiences to overcome any hesitation in opening their wallets by providing a valuable deal. Valuable doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a huge discount. Deals aren\u2019t about discounting the value of your products worth. Offers are just an extra tool you have to test out, if and when the time is right. Try out various deals to see how little of a discount it will take to convert users so that it\u2019s a mutual win for both your business and your customers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"align-center\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-offer-ads-take-my-money-gif.gif\" alt=\"take my money gif\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"ee0cf2ab-0062-4dc5-96a1-f3987235a103\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via <a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/romantic-comedy-vk6MA8yIfmqhW\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">giphy<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Facebook offer ads case study<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In case you\u2019re still not sold\u2014though, honestly, I\u2019m not totally sure how that could be\u2014we\u2019ll wrap up today\u2019s guide with a Facebook offer ads case study.
