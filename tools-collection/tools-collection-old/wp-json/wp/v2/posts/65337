A topic cluster is a collection of articles or blog posts on related topics within a subject that, together, provide a comprehensive understanding on that subject.<\/p>\n<p>The idea with the pillar page\/topic cluster strategy is to use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/04\/internal-linking\">internal linking<\/a> to group related content together on your site (into a cluster) and then to have one main page that acts as a directory for all the links in that cluster (the pillar page). The pillar page and topic cluster method is also known as the hub and spoke method.<\/p>\n<p>Zoomed out, pillar and cluster pages look like this:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/pillar-page-strategy-hub-spoke.png\" alt=\"pillar page hub and spoke diagram\" width=\"720\" height=\"698\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65344 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/pillar-page-strategy-hub-spoke.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/pillar-page-strategy-hub-spoke-480x465.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The pillar page is the hub of your topic cluster. It&#8217;s the central resource that all other pages in the cluster are linked both to and from.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSEO: The Complete Guide\u201d in the middle is the pillar or hub page and the articles around it (On-Page SEO Checklist, Google Ranking Factors, etc.) are the cluster or spoke articles that together allow a reader to learn everything they want to know about SEO.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s common to find pillar pages being treated as an &#8220;ultimate guide&#8221;, a &#8220;what is X&#8221; or a &#8220;how to do Y&#8221; page because these types of searches indicate a user that is looking for a solution to a problem.<\/p>\n<p>If you can offer them a solution to that problem, it benefits you to invest in a pillar page demonstrating your expertise on that subject and therefore also why you are the perfect candidate to help them solve their issue.<br \/>\n<a id=\"seo\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>How do pillar pages and topic clusters improve SEO?<\/h2>\n<p>The pillar page method is critical to building trust with searchers and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/17\/website-visibility\">increasing your visibility online<\/a>. Here\u2019s how it improves your SEO:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Improve site structure<\/h3>\n<p>Topic clusters improve your site structure, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/28\/technical-seo\">technical SEO<\/a> optimization that makes it more easily crawlable by Googlebot and other search engines. The easier your site is to crawl, the easier Google can find, index, and rank your pages.<\/p>\n<p>How do you make your site easier to crawl? In an ideal site structure, any page on your site should be accessible in three clicks or less from the homepage, and the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/information-architecture\"> information architecture<\/a> is such that the most important pages are the closest to the homepage.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/pillar-pages-seo-site-structure.png\" alt=\"what are pillar pages - optimal site structure\" width=\"720\" height=\"357\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65339 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/pillar-pages-seo-site-structure.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/pillar-pages-seo-site-structure-480x238.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Pillar pages support this model because they are meant to be a destination in their own right, and as such are often accessible from a site\u2019s homepage or one tier down.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Improve user experience<\/h3>\n<p>A topic cluster also helps make your website more navigable for actual human users who are looking for information about a specific topic or topic area.<\/p>\n<p>When you have a bunch of related pages easily found under one umbrella term, it makes sense for them to be grouped together. That way, when someone searches for something like \u201chow to do X\u201d they can find all the information they need in one place.<\/p>\n<p>The improved experience keeps people on your site longer, giving Google&#8217;s algorithm more data to indicate that you deserve to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/06\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google\">rank higher<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p>\ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffe\u200d\ud83d\udcbb<strong> Is your site optimized to rank on Google?<\/strong> \ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83d\udcbb<\/p>\n<p>Find out fast with our <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/website-grader\/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free Website Grader<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h3>3. Rank for competitive keywords<\/h3>\n<p>Since pillar pages are the hub pages for a main topic, they are meant to target broad keywords\u2014and broad keywords are super competitive on the SERP.<\/p>\n<p>To <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/11\/14\/how-to-rank-for-a-keyword\">rank for a broad keyword<\/a>, you need a long-form piece of content that comprehensively covers that keyword, linking out to other pages that comprehensively cover its child keywords\u2014aka a pillar page.<\/p>\n<p>And when pillar pages rank, they accumulate traffic, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/10\/link-building-secrets\">backlinks<\/a>, and SEO power. As a bonus, they then pass \u201clink juice\u201d on to the cluster pages they\u2019re linking out to, improving the rank of those pages as well.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/what-are-pillar-pages-link-juice-seo.png\" alt=\"how seo link juice gets transferred from pillar pages to cluster pages\" width=\"546\" height=\"494\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-65345\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/what-are-pillar-pages-link-juice-seo.png 546w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/what-are-pillar-pages-link-juice-seo-480x434.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 546px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>4. Build your reputation<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to understand that a search engine&#8217;s entire goal is to provide the best answer to whatever the searcher types in. To give bad results would be a bad experience for the user, diminishing faith in the search engine \u2014 the last thing Google wants.<\/p>\n<p>It could also be detrimental societally. Imagine if a random person (not a doctor) were to understand SEO well enough to write an article about &#8220;how to know if you&#8217;re having a heart attack,&#8221; that ranks number one, and then millions of people read that article and believed the advice provided inside?<\/p>\n<p>It would be terrible.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not in anybody&#8217;s best interest for Google to rank non-experts for anything, and they&#8217;ve put a ton of effort into its algorithm&#8217;s ability to surface the best information possible, no matter who types in what.<\/p>\n<p>Google has three key foundational concepts behind its many ranking factors: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/12\/google-e-a-t\">expertise, authority, and trust.<\/a> These concepts refer to how closely your content matches what people are searching for while demonstrating authority based on how reputable and trustworthy your site is.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/what-are-pillar-pages-google-e-a-t.png\" alt=\"google expertise, authority, trust\" width=\"463\" height=\"422\" class=\" wp-image-65347 aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When you complete a topic cluster around a pillar page, you demonstrate that you know the subject inside and out. After all, when have you known an expert to only discuss a subject just once?<\/p>\n<p>And when Google trusts your expertise enough to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/19\/get-on-first-page-google\">rank you on the first page<\/a>, its users will too.<br \/>\n<a id=\"how\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>How to create a pillar page to improve your SEO<\/h2>\n<p>Once you know how to create topic clusters, you can use them as a foundation when writing new content or making changes to your website&#8217;s existing content.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how to do it:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Decide on the topic you want to rank for<\/h3>\n<p>The first step in creating an effective pillar page is to have a clear idea of the core topic you want to rank for. The best way to choose which topic to focus on is by considering your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">target audience<\/a> and aiming to thoroughly cover a specific subject they need help with (that also pertains to your business).<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll have several topics that you want to rank for, and one site can succeed in having multiple topic clusters. But it&#8217;s important to focus on one at a time, otherwise this can lead to confusion with your audience and dilute your efforts.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Plug it into a keyword research tool<\/h3>\n<p>Once you have an idea of the topic for your pillar page, you\u2019ll want to plug it into a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/09\/18\/best-keyword-research-tools\">keyword research tool<\/a>. These allow you to see which keywords have the most searches in a given time frame (usually monthly), and how much competition there is for each search term.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-create-pillar-page-keyword-research.png\" alt=\"keyword research tool for identifying target keywords for pillar page\" width=\"720\" height=\"633\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65346 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-create-pillar-page-keyword-research.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-create-pillar-page-keyword-research-480x422.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>3. Identify your pillar vs cluster keywords<\/h3>\n<p>In general, your hub\/pillar page will target a broad, high-volume keyword on the topic. Then, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/long-tail-keywords\">long-tail keywords<\/a> that fall under that keyword will dictate what the main headings\/sections of your pillar page should be, which will then dictate the keywords to target with your cluster pages.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/pillar-page-cluster-topic-pages.png\" alt=\"what are pillar pages - pillar page and cluster page illustration\" width=\"720\" height=\"656\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65343 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/pillar-page-cluster-topic-pages.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/pillar-page-cluster-topic-pages-480x437.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For more help with keyword research, check out our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">guide to keyword research<\/a>.

Create your content&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>Since your pillar page and cluster pages are targeting keywords, you\u2019ll want to take care of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/06\/on-page-seo\">on-page SEO<\/a> for each one. Be sure to include the target keywords in your title, headings, throughout the body of the article, in the meta descriptions, image alt-tags, and so on.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-create-pillar-page-keyword-placement.png\" alt=\"keyword placement for optimizing pillar pages for SEO\" width=\"720\" height=\"477\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65348 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-create-pillar-page-keyword-placement.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-create-pillar-page-keyword-placement-480x318.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This will help search engine crawlers to find it and register that when someone in the world searches for that term, your article deserves to be ranked as a response.<\/p>\n<h3>&#8230;high-quality content<\/h3>\n<p>But remember: although you must be accommodating of the robot crawlers that need to scan your site, your goal is to ultimately create content that\u2019s useful to your readers.<\/p>\n<p>Keyword-heavy content that looks good on paper but doesn\u2019t actually help anyone solve their problems might rank temporarily, but once Google starts to realize that people are clicking away once they get there, you&#8217;ll be dropped like it never happened.<\/p>\n<p>A general rule of thumb: make your pillar page longer and more in-depth than any other article on that subject out there to show Google that you deserve to be ranked number one for it. It&#8217;s common for pillar pages to be well over 5,000 words.<\/p>\n<p>This method is also referred to as the <a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/skyscraper-technique\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">skyscraper technique<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/pillar-pages-skyscraper-technique.png\" alt=\"skyscraper technique for pillar page creation\" width=\"720\" height=\"522\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65349 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/pillar-pages-skyscraper-technique.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/pillar-pages-skyscraper-technique-480x348.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>5. Take care of internal linking &amp; cluster pages<\/h3>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve written your pillar page, you&#8217;ll need to internally link to the cluster articles that further explain the concepts within it.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re building out a brand new topic cluster, these pages may not be created yet. If you have a larger site with a lot of existing content, you can perform a site search to see if your site already has content covering that subject.<\/p>\n<p>Simply go to your browser&#8217;s address bar and type in the following (without the quotation marks): \u201csite:mysite.com topic&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Example:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/pillar-pages-site-search-google.png\" alt=\"example of a site search on google\" width=\"720\" height=\"690\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65351 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/pillar-pages-site-search-google.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/pillar-pages-site-search-google-480x460.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve written about the topic, it&#8217;ll turn up on the following results page\u2014ranked by what the search engine thinks is the most relevant to that term. You can also put the term in quotations to search for exact instances of that phrase. Link to the best article that explains the concept you were looking to support your pillar page with. And make sure that article links to your pillar page and that the articles within the cluster link to each other.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-create-pillar-page-internal-linking-example.png\" alt=\"example of internal linking for pillar pages\" width=\"720\" height=\"285\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65350 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-create-pillar-page-internal-linking-example.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/how-to-create-pillar-page-internal-linking-example-480x190.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Just keep in mind that you don\u2019t want your pillar page to link out to articles that cover any and everything mentioned in the pillar page, but ideally to SEO-optimized articles that target child keywords within the pillar page\u2019s parent keyword. This will keep your topic cluster clean and clear to search engines<\/p>\n<h3>5. Promote your pillar pages<\/h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re going to invest in paid ads and\/or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/social-media-marketing\">social media<\/a> exposure for any pages on your site, it should be to your pillar pages.<\/p>\n<p>The point of a pillar page is that it&#8217;s supposed to be a destination in its own right. So when you promote it, make it clear just how excellent a resource this is for your target audience.<\/p>\n<p>They&#8217;re going to want to read it and you&#8217;d be doing them a disservice by not getting it in front of them.<br \/>\n<a id=\"examples\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Effective pillar page examples<\/h2>\n<p>Some of the best pillar pages can be identified by the URL of the page itself, whether the article includes many links to other pages on the same site, and how in-depth of a resource it is. Here are some great examples of pillar pages in action:<\/p>\n<h3>1.
