Not only does this have to happen offline, but online as well in your Google Ads strategy.

Run Google Local Services Ads<\/h3>\n<p>Many small businesses are service-based. Luckily, Google has a specialty ad type for many service industries that can improve the matching experience for both the advertiser and the searcher.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/11\/google-local-service-ads\">Local Services Ads<\/a> are easy enough to employ as they\u2019re managed right from your Google Business Profile, and you\u2019ll only get charged for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/25\/lead-qualification\">qualified leads<\/a>. These ads are specifically made to reach customers within your service area\u2014and Google also has users confirm their location and service they\u2019re seeking before connecting them to you\u2014making them a great option for getting more attention from relevant local markets.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-local-service-ads-2018.png\" alt=\"local service ads - example of a local locksmith service ad on Google SERP\" width=\"781\" height=\"371\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-17804 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-local-service-ads-2018.png 781w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-local-service-ads-2018-480x228.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 781px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For more on this ad type, check out these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/11\/google-local-services-ads-tips\">seven tips to improve your Local Service Ads ROI<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Don\u2019t neglect impressions<\/h3>\n<p>Small business owners are quick to focus on the bottom line. Understandably so. However, while there are many <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/19\/ppc-metrics\">PPC metrics<\/a> that can tell you how well you\u2019re using your ad spend, there is one metric that sadly gets overlooked.<\/p>\n<p>If you want local awareness, your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-impression-share\/\">impression share<\/a> in the local market matters. Use tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/trends.google.com\/trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Trends<\/a> to identify searches that are popular within your local community and target keywords associated with those searches with your Google Ads. Don\u2019t be disappointed if you\u2019re only pulling in impressions, that\u2019s still a win for a small business!<\/p>\n<h3>6. Remember DKI or local terms when applicable<\/h3>\n<p>Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/17\/dynamic-keyword-insertion-guide\">DKI (dynamic keyword insertion)<\/a> automatically inserts terms into your ad\u2019s headlines or descriptions to match the searcher\u2019s query in real time. Many small business advertisers use this hack to match up to multiple different location names within their targeted area.<\/p>\n<p>If DKI isn\u2019t for you, remember to at least include location-based language, like \u201cnear me\u201d in your keywords and ad copy. In fact, searches for \u201cnear me\u201d or \u201cclose by\u201d have grown by more than <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/local-seo-stats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">900%<\/a> over recent years, so those types of terms can be easy\u00a0keyword wins.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Use geotargeting<\/h3>\n<p>A major theme in <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/local-marketing-lab\/ppc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">local PPC<\/a> is, of course, geotargeting. While tailoring your keywords and ad copy to your local market is important, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/07\/google-ads-geotargeting\">geotargeting<\/a> is what pulls your local strategy together.<\/p>\n<p>When you implement geotargeting, you\u2019re being selective of where, geographically, your ads will show. Limiting your ads to audiences within a certain location will help you maximize your budget as well as your impression share within that area.<\/p>\n<h3><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-geotargeting-setup-highlighted-radius.png\" alt=\"google ads location targeting - setup\" width=\"720\" height=\"376\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-51041 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-geotargeting-setup-highlighted-radius.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/google-ads-geotargeting-setup-highlighted-radius-480x251.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/h3>\n<h3>8.

The same concept applies to call extensions. Sitelinks, the extra links you can apply underneath your ad text, can also help your lead generation efforts by increasing traffic to your site since they give users something else to click on. Or, take sitelinks a step further and lead them directly to another conversion source, like a contact or purchase page.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/google-ads-guide-small-business-search-ad-example-with-sitelinks.png\" alt=\"google ads guide - small business search ad using sitelinks\" width=\"720\" height=\"306\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55812 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/google-ads-guide-small-business-search-ad-example-with-sitelinks.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/google-ads-guide-small-business-search-ad-example-with-sitelinks-480x204.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>In this example, the viewer could click on the headline to download the tool, or click the \u201cwedding checklist\u201d sitelink to convert instead.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a id=\"ROI\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>How small businesses can maximize ROI with Google Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Okay; you have your awareness, you have your leads, and all without breaking the bank.

You could be bidding far more or less aggressively than you need to, which changes your position on the SERP and your likelihood of pulling in quality clicks or conversions.<\/p>\n<p>If you need help choosing a bidding strategy, check out our full breakdown of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/19\/google-ads-automated-bidding\">pros and cons of every automated bidding strategy<\/a> in Google or see the automated bidding strategy tutorial in our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/12\/02\/best-google-ads-training-courses\">Google Ads training course round-up.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/tCPA-tROAS-retiring-bidding-1.png\" alt=\"google ads guide for small businesses - bidding strategy set up example\" width=\"800\" height=\"347\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9049 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/tCPA-tROAS-retiring-bidding-1.png 800w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/tCPA-tROAS-retiring-bidding-1-480x208.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>14. Focus on lead generation first<\/h3>\n<p>Small businesses are often guilty of focusing on their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/04\/adwords-roi\">Google Ads ROI<\/a> first when<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/07\/lessons-in-ppc\"> starting out in PPC<\/a>. As tempting as that may be, putting your efforts into bringing leads in first, rather than customers, will bring you a better return in the long run. The more leads you bring in, the more they will offset your costs.<\/p>\n<h3>15. Spend money to make money<\/h3>\n<p>If you aren\u2019t bidding or spending enough to compete, your ads won\u2019t drive enough activity for you (or Google) to analyze and inform your optimizations. In other words, you have to spend enough money if you want to make money from Google Ads. Otherwise, you\u2019re wasting what little you do spend.<\/p>\n<p>And if at first your CPA is high or ROAS is low at first, don\u2019t pull back your budget! Because this could likely mean even lower results. The margins may be small at first, but you can rinse and repeat our tips to see your ROI rise.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t fret about putting a chunk of budget behind a campaign if it\u2019s likely to convert.<br \/>\n<a id=\"growth\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>How small businesses can achieve sustainable growth with Google Ads<\/h2>\n<p>In order for your small business to continue growth in the Google Ads world, you\u2019ll want to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/04\/client-retention-tips\">retain customers<\/a> by providing consistent value unique to your brand.<\/p>\n<p>After all, the cost of acquiring a new customer can be up to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/19\/customer-marketing-strategies\">30 times<\/a> that of keeping an existing one.
