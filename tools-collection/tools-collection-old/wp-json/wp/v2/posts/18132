Why? Because this will allow you to place a premium on both <em>locality <\/em>and which extensions appear. If you load up your Bing ads call-only campaign with snippets and images and whirligigs, your call extension-turned star of the show isn\u2019t going to show up.<\/p>\n<p>From the campaign creation screen, when prompted to select a goal, choose \u201cPhone calls to my business.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"fcb12d9e-6a42-4dbc-8379-5f8adbde15b6\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/bing-ads-campaign-goal-phone-calls.png\" alt=\"bing ads campaign goal drive phone calls for my business\" width=\"546\" height=\"369\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Per the neat little bubble that pops up when you click the accompanying question mark, you should select this campaign goal if \u201cyou want to drive new phone calls to one or more of your business numbers.\u201d Sold.<\/p>\n<p>Next up, it\u2019s time to name your campaign, assign a budget, and, most importantly, define your new call-only campaign\u2019s geographic parameters. While the naming convention should align with the rest of your account (save the ever-important \u201ccall-only\u201d distinction\u201d), you should note that skimping on the budget here isn\u2019t going to do you any good. To ensure that your ads are served in the prime positions at the top of mobile SERPs, which offer <em>limited real estate<\/em>, you\u2019ll need to ensure that you\u2019re:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bidding on keywords that represent actual business value<\/li>\n<li>Maximizing your Quality Scores<\/li>\n<li>Budgeting accordingly<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This will allow you to mitigate some of the costs associated with appearing in position one <em>and<\/em> receiving enough impressions to optimize your campaign through testing while you\u2019re keeping the lights on with valuable phone calls. Now, back to location\u2026<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a small, local business in search of leads (the sorts of folks call-only ads really do wonders for), you want to make sure that your campaign\u2019s location parameters align with the areas you service.

Since you\u2019re looking for advanced workarounds baked into Bing, I\u2019m assuming this ain\u2019t your first rodeo.
