Identify your competitors<\/h3>\n<p>First and foremost, you need to identify who you\u2019re competing against. It\u2019s important to remember that there are different types of competitors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Direct competitors: Offer the same product\/service and meet the same need.<\/li>\n<li>Indirect competitors: Offer a different product\/service but meet the same need.<\/li>\n<li>Perceived\/replacement competitors: Offer a different product\/service that doesn\u2019t exactly meet the same need but is similar enough to serve as a replacement for your product\/service. They are perceived by your audience to meet the same need.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/types-of-competitors.webp\" alt=\"graphic showing the different types of competitors for your competitive analysis\" width=\"896\" height=\"658\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83282\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/types-of-competitors.webp 896w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/types-of-competitors-480x353.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 896px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.codeharbor.dev\/2022\/08\/29\/market-analysis-part-2-competitive-analysis\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>How to identify your competitors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Search on Google<\/strong>for the products and services you offer and see what comes up, both in local and general results. Search also for your business name to see if there are any businesses <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/06\/12\/bidding-on-competitor-brands\">bidding on your business name<\/a> in Google Ads.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use a competitive analysis tool <\/strong>like SimilarWeb, Semrush, or Ahrefs. These platforms often have freemium versions or free trials that will suffice for this first step. These <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/09\/competitor-keywords\">tools for finding competitor keywords<\/a> can also be helpful here.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Look at <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/best-free-business-listing-sites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>review sites<\/strong><\/a> <strong>relevant to your industry.<\/strong> For example, service businesses may look on Google Maps and Angi while SaaS providers may look on Trustpilot and G2.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ask your customers. <\/strong>Find out who else they considered when deciding on a provider.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Collect as many competitors as you can and categorize them into the above-mentioned groups.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Identify your competitors\u2019 products<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s not enough to just know that they offer something similar to what you offer. Spend time on their website and nail down exactly what they offer. Most businesses, yours included, may have several offerings\u2014and solid offerings, too\u2014but there always tends to be one core offering that is the bread and butter. Find this out as well as the secondary offerings. For retail with several products, get a sense of their best sellers.<\/p>\n<p>How to identify your competitors\u2019 products\/services:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Act like a consumer. <\/strong>Use their product, solutions, and pricing pages, ask questions on live chat; you could even call and ask questions.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Read reviews.<\/strong> Identify any products or services that get mentioned more than others. Also pay attention to what doesn\u2019t get mentioned.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Understand packages and pricing tiers. <\/strong>See how your offerings compare with them <em>at the same price points<\/em>. For example, a competitor might offer the same things as you but through a much higher-priced package.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Look at keywords they\u2019re bidding on. <\/strong>Use our above-mentioned <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/09\/competitor-keywords\">tools for finding competitor keywords<\/a><strong>.<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-analysis-keyword-research.webp\" alt=\"example of competitive analysis keyword research\" width=\"972\" height=\"956\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83283\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-analysis-keyword-research.webp 972w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-analysis-keyword-research-480x472.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 972px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A quick scan through your competitors\u2019 PPC keywords can reveal a lot about their core offerings.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd0e <strong>Need help finding competitor keywords?<\/strong> Try our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h3>3. Identify your competitors\u2019 target audience<\/h3>\n<p>Yes\u2014by definition, your competitors have the same audience as you\u2014but every audience has its nuances, so it\u2019s important to dig deeper. You want to identify not just demographics but also the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/25\/buyer-persona-examples\">personas<\/a> your competitors are targeting.<\/p>\n<p>How to find your competitors\u2019 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">target audience<\/a> and personas:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Look at testimonials and case studies<\/strong> on their website. This can give you an idea of who the end users are of the product\/service. Pay attention to their occupation especially.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Check review websites. <\/strong>This can help you better understand the underlying pain points and expectations of customers, and the small details they point out can uncover information about their lifestyle (B2C) or work style (B2B).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Look at their social media profiles. <\/strong>See who their posts and social media ads are geared for. You can learn a lot about who they\u2019re targeting based on the copy and imagery. Also, look at which followers engage with their posts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/wild-ones-instagram-profile.webp\" alt=\"wild ones instagram profile as part of competitive analysis\" width=\"458\" height=\"594\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83284\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/wild-ones-instagram-profile.webp 458w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/wild-ones-instagram-profile-231x300.webp 231w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A quick browse through <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/wildone\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Wild One\u2019s Instagram profile<\/em><\/a><em> and you can see that they are targeting young urban pet owners.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>And if you\u2019re running paid ads, these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/14\/competitor-targeting\">strategies on targeting competitor audiences<\/a> can help you as well.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Identify their positioning and messaging<\/h3>\n<p>No matter how many businesses there are that offer the same thing, each business has its own positioning (the context in which they offer their product) and messaging (the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\">unique value<\/a> the product provides). Understanding these is essential for developing your own positioning and messaging.<\/p>\n<p>How to identify your competitors\u2019 positioning and messaging<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Look at their business descriptions.<\/strong> A <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-write-a-business-description\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">good business description<\/a> distills the business down into key messaging points. Check business listings, social profiles, and review sites for these.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Look at their \u201csoft skill\u201d content.<\/strong> I\u2019m defining this content as things like their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/09\/company-core-values\">core values<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/about-us-page-examples-and-tips\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">about us<\/a> pages. If they have an explicit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/02\/how-to-write-a-business-mission-statement\">mission statement<\/a>, even better.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Read press releases. <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/04\/how-to-write-a-press-release\">Press releases<\/a> are prime pieces of content for revealing a company\u2019s position and messaging. Check local media and online press release sites.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Subscribe to their newsletter or blog. <\/strong>You don\u2019t have to read every post or email in detail, but regularly glancing at this content over time and paying attention to what gets repeated will help you to identify key messaging.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This information, along with the other website copy you analyzed in the previous steps, should be enough for you to get a basic idea of their key features and benefits, as well as their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/unique-selling-proposition\">unique selling proposition<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-analysis-unique-selling-proposition-example.webp\" alt=\"example of home service business unique selling proposition as part of competitive analysis\" width=\"871\" height=\"481\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83285\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-analysis-unique-selling-proposition-example.webp 871w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/competitive-analysis-unique-selling-proposition-example-480x265.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 871px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Some companies even have a \u201cwhy us\u201d page, like <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/theairconditioningspecialist.com\/about\/why-us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>this one<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>5. Summarize it all with a SWOT analysis<\/h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/swot-analysis-templates\">SWOT analysis<\/a> is a nice way to develop insights and visualize all of the information you gathered in the above steps. SWOT stands for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strengths: What the business does well.<\/li>\n<li>Weaknesses: Where it needs to improve.<\/li>\n<li>Opportunities: Outside factors that could provide a competitive advantage.<\/li>\n<li>Threats: Outside factors that could create a disadvantage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can do a SWOT analysis on your own company as well as your competitors.
