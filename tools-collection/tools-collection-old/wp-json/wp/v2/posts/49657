Here\u2019s how to write a solid press release that includes all the information you\u2019ll need:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Start with an attention-grabbing title<\/h3>\n<p>You want people to write or tweet about your announcement to generate press and buzz for your business. That starts with reading your press release. And that, my friends, starts with your headline.Make sure you\u00a0clearly summarize the announcement with a strong, descriptive verb.\u00a0Take a look at this\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/ace-hardware-reveals-top-grills-and-grilling-accessories-for-holiday-gifts-this-season-301406757.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">press release example from Ace Hardware<\/a>:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-to-write-a-press-release-ace-hardware-headline-example.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"528\" alt=\"how to write a press release: example of good headline\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The headline reads:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Ace Hardware Reveals Top Grills and Grilling Accessories for Holiday Gifts this Season<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;Reveals&#8221; implies both that the items have been under wraps and that the public has been awaiting this announcement.\u00a0 Also, &#8220;for Holiday Gifts this Season&#8221; explains the purpose of the press release and draws the reader in.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, it\u2019s short and sweet\u2014which\u00a0is key. Cision, a press release software, analyzed more than 40,000 press releases from 2020 and found that the ideal length for a press release headline is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cision.com\/resources\/research-reports\/state-of-the-press-release-ty-download\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">70-90 <\/a>characters.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-to-write-a-press-release-headline-character-count.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"404\" alt=\"how to write a good press release: headline character count chart\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cision.com\/resources\/research-reports\/state-of-the-press-release-ty-download\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>2. State the announcement &amp; its significance in your intro<\/h3>\n<p>As with any news article, the introduction of your press release needs to answer all five W&#8217;s right off the bat: who, what, where, when, and why it matters. Take the introduction in the MasterClass press release example below.<\/p>\n<p>It reads:<\/p>\n<ul><\/ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p-small\">SAN FRANCISCO,\u00a0Oct. 21, 2021\u00a0\/PRNewswire\/ &#8212;\u00a0MasterClass, the streaming platform where anyone can learn from the world&#8217;s best across a wide range of subjects, today announced that\u00a0Yo-Yo Ma\u00a0will teach a class on music and connection. Sharing philosophies that he&#8217;s developed alongside stories from his legendary career, Ma unpacks how to better collaborate, connect with art in new ways, and expand relationships through music. Ma&#8217;s class is now available exclusively on\u00a0MasterClass,\u00a0where subscribers get unlimited access to all 100+ instructors with an annual membership.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>If I only read the introduction to this press release, I have all the information I need.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where: San Fransisco<\/li>\n<li>When: October 21, 2021<\/li>\n<li>Who: MasterClass, an online learning streaming platform.<\/li>\n<li>What: Announced that Yo-Yo Ma will teach a class on music and connection.<\/li>\n<li>Why it matters: A musician with a legendary career will be sharing his philosophies with subscribers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-to-write-a-press-release-example-masterclass.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"382\" alt=\"how to write a press release: example of masterclass event press release\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This introduction does a great job fitting in the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-write-a-business-description\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">description of the company<\/a>, the impact, the new class, Yo-Yo Ma, and even a soft sell direction for more information. Well done.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Expand on why this announcement matters in the body<\/h3>\n<p>When you get to the body of your press release, use this space to give your readers more information. This is the ideal place to incorporate quotes from experts or images to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/15\/website-copy\">make the content more engaging<\/a>.\u00a0In the body of the MasterClass press release is a photo of Yo-Yo Ma and a reaction from the founder and CEO of MasterClass.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-to-write-a-press-release-example-yo-yo-ma.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"413\" alt=\"how to write a press release: example of press release image\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The photo is great for encouraging readers to stay on the page longer, but the quote here is even better. Rogier explains what the class offers students and why this is a significant release for the MasterClass community.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s exactly what you want to do in the body of your press release\u2014give the information on what\u2019s happening and why it matters for your company and your audience.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Stick to a formal, authoritative tone<\/h3>\n<p>You want your press release to grab attention and keep your audience engaged, but it\u2019s important to remember that this is a statement on behalf of your business to the general public. It isn\u2019t a blog post from your CEO or a whitepaper supporting a product launch. It\u2019s the company\u2019s official announcement, so it needs to have a formal, authoritative tone.<\/p>\n<p>Note that you can certainly write a blog post supporting that news in a more conversational and subjective manner, and as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rebootonline.com\/blog\/creating-press-release-that-converts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reboot mentions in its post on how to write a press release<\/a>, there are certain times when an entertaining press release works.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Use active voice<\/h3>\n<p>Active voice is more appealing and clear\u00a0in any <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/23\/self-editing-tips\">good writing<\/a>, but it\u2019s especially important in press releases. You\u2019re trying to convey information about a company to the public, and you need to effectively share who did what. Active voice occurs when your subject performs your verb (e.g., I wrote the press release), as opposed to passive voice where the subject receives the verb (e.g., The press release was written by me). Active voice is the best way to share who did what.<\/p>\n<p>It also turns out that it\u2019s the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/14\/increase-traffic-to-my-website\">best way to get traffic<\/a>. Cision even found that press releases with active verbs in headlines got more views than their passively constructed counterparts.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-to-write-a-press-release-active-verbs-headline.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"370\" alt=\"how to write a press release: chart on active verbs in headline\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cision.com\/resources\/research-reports\/state-of-the-press-release-ty-download\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Writing in active voice will make your press releases stronger and clearer\u2014and this is good when there\u2019s no room for confusion.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Be concise<\/h3>\n<p>Your press release doesn\u2019t need to be long\u2014in fact, it shouldn\u2019t be. The goal of this content is to make a formal, public announcement. That means your ideal length is simply how long it takes to explain your announcement and its significance.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cision.com\/resources\/research-reports\/state-of-the-press-release-ty-download\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cision<\/a> found that the majority of press releases on its platform in 2020 were 400 words or less, and overall the average length was 686 words. The company also found that after a certain point, the longer the press release got, the shorter time people spent reading.\u00a0You can learn\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/06\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells#concisecopy\">how to write concise copy here.<\/a><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-to-write-a-press-release-length-chart.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"414\" alt=\"how to write a great press release: length vs time on page\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>TL;DR:\u00a0Try to stick to 500 words or so in your press releases.\u00a0<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cision.com\/resources\/research-reports\/state-of-the-press-release-ty-download\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>(Image source)<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>7. Give the reader an action to take<\/h3>\n<p>If your ideal reader finishes your press release and wants more information, you need to make it clear where they should go. Otherwise, you\u2019ll lose the opportunity to engage the reader or convert a potential customer. Not the outcome you want after you spend your time and effort writing a press release.<\/p>\n<p>So include follow up instructions at the end of your press release. This will likely vary with the content of your release\u2014it could be a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/15\/landing-page-best-practices\">well-written landing page<\/a> to sign up for a trial for your product being released\u00a0or directions to attend the event you&#8217;re promoting.<\/p>\n<p>Take this example from Smith College\u2019s press release about replacing loans with grants.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-to-write-a-good-press-release-smith-college-example.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"175\" alt=\"how to write a press release: smith college follow-up example\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/smith-college-makes-historic-investment-in-financial-aid-replacing-loans-with-grants-301406837.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It reads:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Additional information about the financial aid initiatives Smith announced today is available in an online FAQ.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This makes it easy for anyone interested to click to the FAQs and get all the information they need about the announcement and how it could impact them.<\/p>\n<p>Okay, now that we\u2019ve covered the basics, let\u2019s talk about what you want to pay attention to when you\u2019re drafting some common press releases.<\/p>\n<h2>How to write a press release for an event<\/h2>\n<p>A press release is a great way to supplement your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/04\/25\/event-marketing\">event marketing strategy<\/a>. By releasing an official statement, you can alert the media to all of the relevant details in one easy document. This is great for two reasons:<\/p>\n<p>First, media coverage will help get the word to any interested attendees. Second, it\u2019ll increase the chances of getting your event covered, as well. It\u2019s great to have your upcoming event get press\u2014it\u2019s even better to have the impact of your event written up, too.<\/p>\n<h3>Event press release example and tips<\/h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-to-write-event-press-release-example.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"607\" alt=\"how to write a press release: event press release example\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/patch.com\/new-jersey\/hillsborough\/flounders-brewery-host-first-ever-kringle-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re writing a press release for your next event, be sure to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Share who the event is for. <\/strong>Who is your ideal audience? This might seem awkward, but you should explicitly state this since it\u2019s not always clear. For example, your company\u2019s baking competition could be for anyone over 14 or it could be for local pastry chefs in the area. There\u2019s a huge difference there, so err on the side of caution. (Plus, you don&#8217;t want to have to turn away an aspiring 14-year-old who shows up with spatula in hand at your door.)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Explain the significance of the event. <\/strong>Why does your event matter for your company and your community? If you\u2019re hosting that baking competition to find the next best pastry chef in your city, that\u2019s significant. If it\u2019s the fifth year you\u2019re hosting and other winners have gone on to open their own businesses, that\u2019s also worth mentioning.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Include registration or ticketing details. <\/strong>How can someone attend your event? Make sure the end of your press release includes whether tickets are for sale or free, whether registration is required or not, as well as key information about deadlines and event dates.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Event press release template<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1e3Yatl4SHQFZGAHi-GsTmP0v4DrB50lDczlSi9chvV4\/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here&#8217;s an event press release template to get you started<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>How to write a press release for a product<\/h2>\n<p>When you\u2019re <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/29\/how-to-promote-a-product\">launching a new product<\/a>, you want customers and brand advocates engaging on social media, industry writers mentioning the updates, and any other buzz you can get.
