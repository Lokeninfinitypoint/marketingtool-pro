Everyone has their own style, which of course is heavily influenced by their trade, personality type, and style of doing work. Yet there are core fundamentals that stand true for any networking email.<\/p>\n<h3>Add value<\/h3>\n<p>Always come to the table with a dish. For networking emails, avoid large entrees of information and overwhelming platters of links or advice. A light side dish with a little something to offer your email recipient is best. That may be a single link to an article, <a href=\"\/keywords\">free tool<\/a>, or resource; the contact information of someone who could help them; or even simply offering to share your insights on something when you meet up.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/networking20email20subject20lines20and20templates20generosity.png\" alt=\"networking email subject lines and templates generosity\" width=\"600\" height=\"266\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Be brief<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As with any <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/16\/copywriting-formulas\">form of copywriting<\/a>, your side dish networking email should be as\u00a0concise as possible.\u00a0Even if you connected with someone on a truly personal level (that happens) and they expressed enthusiasm about the gazillion tips and resources you said you could share, don\u2019t overload the email with them. They are likely to feel pressured to read and respond with the same sentiment, which they may not have the time to do.\u00a0<span lang=\"EN\">So keep it brief no matter what, just so you can establish the connection. You can share those resources later or when you meet up.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Be specific and personal<\/h3>\n<p>There are a few different ways to be specific in your networking emails.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, be sure to mention the specific event during which you met them.<\/li>\n<li>Second, if proposing a meet-up, let them know that you&#8217;re happy to work around their schedule, but give some specific dates and times\u00a0to spare the person from having to come up with an arbitrary time.<\/li>\n<li>Third, and most important, mention something highly specific in your email that the person said or demonstrated during your conversation with them. This shows the person that you were truly listening, and it will set your networking email apart from the rest.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Be prompt<\/h3>\n<p>Reaching out promptly to new contacts from networking events is essential. Within hours of the event is not necessary\u2014maybe even a bit aggressive. But you should contact them within a day while you are still fresh in their memory. Plus, you\u2019ll be able to follow the previous tip\u00a0with the event fresh in your mind.<\/p>\n<h3>Be yourself<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s important to be polite and professional, but injecting your personality into your networking emails and subject lines is equally as important. Just as a<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/08\/brand-story\"> brand helps a business<\/a> to stand apart from its competitors, your personality helps you to distinguish yourself from the rest of the crowd.<\/p>\n<h3>Keep the long term in mind<\/h3>\n<p>While it\u2019s important to follow up promptly, keep in mind that networking is a long-term thing. Ideally, it would be great to hear back right away from everyone you reach out to, but don\u2019t take it personally if you don\u2019t hear back. Life happens. People get swamped.<\/p>\n<p>Also many of your contacts you will not stay in touch with on a regular basis. But when the time comes, a year or three later, to reach out to a person, you can reach out with your\u00a0original thread. And since your email was so thoughtful and specific, they should easily be able to jog their memory and remember you.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/networking20email20subject20lines20and20templates20importance20of20networking.png\" alt=\"networking email subject lines and templates importance of networking\" width=\"800\" height=\"586\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>How to write strong networking email subject lines<\/h2>\n<p>The rules of thumb for networking email subject lines are generally the same as those for general <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/31\/email-subject-lines\">email subject lines<\/a>. The good news is, they tend to be a bit easier to come up with. Here are the core guidelines for networking email subject lines:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Keep it short:<\/strong> Regardless of what type of email you\u2019re sending, brevity is key (50 characters or fewer). Readers should not have to spend more than one or two seconds identifying\u00a0what the email is about.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Customize it:<\/strong> Even if you\u2019re sending similar emails to other people you met at a networking event, make sure each subject line is tailored in some way\u2014such as by including their name or\u00a0something specific you talked about.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Make it clear: <\/strong>Make it crystal clear to your recipient what the purpose of your networking email is, especially if there is an ask in the email. There is no need to beat around the bush. Is it to request a coffee chat? Say so. Is it to connect two people? Spell it out.<\/p>\n<p>Now that we\u2019ve covered the basics of networking emails and subject lines, let\u2019s get to the templates!<\/p>\n<h2>Follow-up networking emails and subject lines<\/h2>\n<p>If you connected with someone, whether it was at a conference, networking event, or even at a happy hour, it\u2019s essential that you follow up with them within a day. This will help reinforce the connection and increase the chances of it being a meaningful one\u2014since it is likely that the person made plenty of other connections at the event.<\/p>\n<p>P.S.

If you are sending a &#8220;cold outreach&#8221; networking email to someone you&#8217;ve never met, it\u2019s critical that you put the time and thought into its contents. Your email serves as a reflection of your personal and professional self, and with introductory emails, it\u2019s all your recipient has to go on when deciding whether they want to work or connect with you.<\/p>\n<p>One thing to note here: While networking emails should be short, your cold outreach <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/introduction-email\">introduction emails<\/a> can be a little longer. Similar to when you&#8217;re <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/21\/social-media-influencers\">reaching out to influencers<\/a>, you want to demonstrate that you\u2019ve <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/06\/21\/social-media-influence\">done your homework<\/a> and will be worth their time.<\/p>\n<h3>Example #6:\u00a0Informational interview request for career growth<\/h3>\n<p>This type of networking email can be used for reaching out to someone in a role or field you&#8217;re interested in; someone in a non-competing business with \u200b\u200b<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/07\/best-marketing-strategies\">strategies<\/a> you&#8217;d like to model after; or someone in the same role with whom you&#8217;d like to share insights.<\/p>\n<p>Since you don&#8217;t know this person, you probably won&#8217;t be able to offer them anything specific in exchange (yet), but you can still make a general gesture.
