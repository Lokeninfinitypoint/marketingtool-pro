Want to see your website on the elusive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/19\/get-on-first-page-google\">first page of Google <\/a>for a given search term? Prepare yourself: Unless you\u2019re Wikipedia or The New York Times, it won\u2019t be easy. But it\u2019s not impossible, either. Seriously \u2013 we do it all the time!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ranking for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/organic-keyword\">keyword in organic<\/a> search is a repeatable process.<\/strong> You won\u2019t get the results you want 100% of the time, especially if you\u2019re <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/08\/28\/why-are-popular-keywords-so-hard-to-rank-for\">a new website trying to rank for a popular keyword<\/a>, but if you take <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2011\/09\/27\/content-marketing-mistakes\">content marketing<\/a> and SEO seriously, you can start to make things happen. Things like rankings, and traffic, and sales, oh my!<\/p>\n<p>Here are the ten steps to rank for a keyword in Google.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 1: Lay the Groundwork<\/h2>\n<p>This is really more of a pre-step than a first step. You\u2019ll need to have some basics in place before you can hope to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/06\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google\">rank higher on Google<\/a> for any random keyword. These pre-requisites include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A strong website<\/strong> \u2013 The longer your website has been around, accruing authority and links, the better. It\u2019s also key that your entire site follow SEO best practices \u2013 start with <a href=\"http:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/bin\/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=35769\">Google\u2019s Webmaster Guidelines<\/a> if you don\u2019t know what that means.<\/li>\n<li><strong>A network to draw on<\/strong> \u2013 In order to rank quickly for a keyword, it\u2019s very useful to have a built-in network to share new content with \u2013 a blog following, an audience on social networks like Facebook and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/06\/18\/twitter-email-strategy\">Twitter<\/a>, email contacts you can reach out to for occasional help with a link. If you don\u2019t know what <em>that<\/em> means, it\u2019s time to start thinking about <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2010\/11\/18\/real-life-link-building\">link building as relationship building<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Don\u2019t rush this stuff in your race for Internet gold.<\/strong> If you don\u2019t do things right the first time, you\u2019ll just have to do them again later.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 2: Do Your Initial Keyword Research<\/h2>\n<p>You may think you know what keyword you want to target, but fact-check your instincts. Use several <a href=\"\/free-keyword-tools\">keyword tools<\/a> to get a sense of the search volume for the keyword as well as the competition before you finalize your keyword choice. Your main considerations will include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Choosing a keyword with good volume, but not too much volume<\/strong> \u2013 In general you don\u2019t want to target a keyword that has low relative search volume if there\u2019s an equivalent term that is much more popular. For example, there are usually over twice as many searches for \u201cblah blah jobs\u201d versus \u201cblah blah careers.\u201d However, don\u2019t always automatically go for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/12\/keyword-difficulty\">keyword with the highest volume or difficulty<\/a>; some keywords are simply too competitive and not worth your time. You\u2019re not going to rank for \u201cairline\u201d unless you are, in fact, an airline.\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ranking-for-a-keyword-high-volume-1.jpg\" alt=\"find keywords to rank for\" width=\"648\" height=\"514\" \/><\/div>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Choosing a keyword that\u2019s relevant to your business model<\/strong> \u2013 You\u2019re more likely to succeed in ranking for a keyword if the term is relevant to your site and your business. You\u2019re also more likely to get some real return on your ranking \u2013 remember that rankings in and of themselves aren\u2019t particularly valuable, unless they\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download\">driving worthwhile traffic and leads<\/a>. For example, a party planning business might target \u201chow to cook for a party\u201d \u2013 but \u201chow to cook rice\u201d isn\u2019t really going to be relevant to them or their target audience.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>At this stage of the process, you should also make a list of close variations on your primary keyword. These will be helpful in writing and optimizing your content later on.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Blog_InContentTextLink_FKT\"><strong><em>Use WordStream&#8217;s Free Keyword Tool to find your most rank-worthy keywords.<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Step 3: Check Out the Competition<\/h2>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve settled on a keyword, do a search for it on Google and a few other search engines to see what your competition is already doing. Pay particular attention to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The domains and URLs<\/strong> \u2013 How many are <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2009\/08\/19\/google-loves-exact-match-domains\">exact match domains<\/a>? Does every URL <a href=\"https:\/\/thrivehive.com\/how-to-get-to-the-top-of-google\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in the top 10 <\/a>include the keyword?<\/li>\n<li><strong>The titles<\/strong> \u2013 How do the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2009\/08\/05\/seo-title-tag-formulas\">title tags<\/a> incorporate the keyword?<\/li>\n<li><strong>The type of content that\u2019s ranking<\/strong> \u2013 Product pages? Blog posts? Videos?<\/li>\n<li><strong>The types of businesses that are ranking<\/strong> \u2013 Are they huge brands? Small businesses? News sites?<\/li>\n<li><strong>How authoritative those sites are <\/strong>\u2013 You can use a plugin to check the age of the sites in the top 10, the size of their link profiles and so on.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>You\u2019re looking for ways that you can differentiate yourself.<\/strong> You\u2019ll need to do at least as much as your competitors are doing to beat them. Ideally, you should be doing more, and doing it better.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 4: Consider Intent<\/h2>\n<p>The more specific the keyword (think <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/11\/07\/how-to-find-long-tail-keywords\">long-tail keywords<\/a>), the easier it is to gauge the searcher\u2019s intent, and the easier it will be to serve up what those searchers are probably looking for. In search marketing, \u201cintent\u201d is our best guess at what the person using the search query really wants. Consider the following keywords and notice how much easier it is to guess the intent from the words alone as you go down the list:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>glasses<\/li>\n<li>eyeglasses<\/li>\n<li>discount eyeglasses<\/li>\n<li>discount eyeglasses frames<\/li>\n<li>discount eyeglasses frames for kids<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Ask yourself, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/09\/04\/content-marketing-goal-alignment\">what kind of content best serves the keyword<\/a>? In this case, it would obviously be a selection of kid\u2019s eyeglasses for sale. From the first term, you can\u2019t even tell if the person is looking for eyeglasses or drinking glasses. And even for the second, the person might just be looking for pictures of eyeglasses; there is no clear intent to buy. An e-commerce business is mostly going to be trying to rank for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/07\/17\/google-advertising\">commercial keywords<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s founders have said that the perfect search engine would serve only one result. <strong>You want to be that one result<\/strong> that satisfies the searcher\u2019s need so they don\u2019t bounce back to the search results, looking for a better answer.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 5: Conceptualize the Content<\/h2>\n<p>Next, form a plan for the actual content you\u2019re going to create that will \u2013 hopefully \u2013 rank for your chosen keyword. There are many paths to ranking for a keyword, including but not limited to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>An article<\/li>\n<li>A blog post<\/li>\n<li>A product page<\/li>\n<li>An index or directory of links (to other pages on your site or around the web)<\/li>\n<li>An authoritative guide<\/li>\n<li>An infographic<\/li>\n<li>A video<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>How long will it take to create the content? Who should create it? Will you be doing everything in-house or outsourcing? Do you have all the resources and budget you need? Don\u2019t get defeated: No matter your size or your budget, you have the ability to create a blog post. Content like <a href=\"\/articles\">infographics<\/a> and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/01\/10\/rank-on-google-with-video-content-part-one\">videos<\/a> will require more resources. Sometimes, the best way to answer a search query is with some sort of tool, like a mortgage calculator. If this is the case, you&#8217;ll need engineering resources.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 6: Execute<\/h2>\n<p>Here\u2019s where the rubber meets the road. Execute on your plan. Again, you shouldn\u2019t rush <em>any<\/em> of these steps, but it\u2019s especially important not to rush this one. More and more, <strong>search engines are looking for high-quality content<\/strong> that benefits the searcher, not keyword-stuffed spam or pages full of ads that only benefit you. If you\u2019d rather buy traffic than put in the effort it requires to earn \u201cfree\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDL25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?camplink=InContentCTA\">organic search traffic<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wordstream-for-ppc\">investigate PPC<\/a>. \u201c<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/10\/15\/why-seo-is-harder-for-small-businesses\">SEO isn\u2019t easy<\/a>\u201d should be your mantra.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 7: Optimize for Your Keyword<\/h2>\n<p>In reality, steps 6 and 7 should be intertwined. <strong>Optimize your content while you\u2019re creating it<\/strong>, rather than applying optimization after the fact. This is where the list of keywords you formulated in step 2 comes in. Leverage those keywords where you can in your content, but not to the point of sounding like a crazy robot. Remember that there are a lot of \u201cinvisible\u201d places for keywords, and I\u2019m not talking about using white text on a white background or anything else that violates Google guidelines. I mean stuff like image file names \u2013 users won\u2019t see these if they\u2019re not looking for them, but they can <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/02\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps\">increase your keyword rankings<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For a full list of on-page optimization factors, check out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.seomoz.org\/blog\/perfecting-keyword-targeting-on-page-optimization\">SEOmoz\u2019s guide to the \u201cperfect\u201d page<\/a>. Another good tip is to copy Wikipedia, whose pages tend to have stellar on-page optimization.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-rank-for-keywords-like-wikipedia-1.jpg\" alt=\"Wikipedia Keyword Rankings\" width=\"513\" height=\"421\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Before you hit \u201cpublish,\u201d it\u2019s a good idea to quickly double-check your keyword research. It\u2019s possible that your content has evolved during the development and creation phases, and you\u2019ll need to make sure that there\u2019s still <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/09\/04\/content-marketing-goal-alignment\">alignment between keyword and content<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDL25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?camplink=InContentCTA\">Check out our free download: 25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Step 8: Publish<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s (finally) time to push your content out into the world. Depending on the type of content it is, you may need to be careful about scheduling this step. This isn\u2019t usually a consideration for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/10\/16\/guide-to-evergreen-content-marketing\">evergreen content<\/a>, but it may be important for content that\u2019s tied to something in the news, an event or a trend. You may also need to coordinate with PR or other interested parties at your company, for example when launching content related to a new product or service.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 9: Promote<\/h2>\n<p>This step is important and should come immediately after publishing \u2013 in fact, for big pieces of content, it\u2019s great if you can do some media outreach <em>before<\/em> the piece goes live. Make sure you do what you can to get your content in front of as many eyeballs as possible before it even has a chance to rank for the keyword:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Share your content through your business\u2019s social accounts<\/strong> \u2013 Twitter, Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn et al. If you can, do this through your personal accounts too.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use social buttons or widgets on your site to promote independent sharing<\/strong> \u2013 Make it easy for readers and viewers to keep the chain going. They\u2019re more likely to tweet or share your article if all they have to do is click a button.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Build links to your content <\/strong>\u2013 Whatever the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/25\/pagerank\">future of PageRank<\/a>, link building is still a huge part of SEO (even if it is <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2010\/04\/06\/most-annoying-search-marketing-task\">the most annoying part<\/a>). Check out our blog archive on the topic if you\u2019re looking to <a href=\"\/category\/wordstream-blog-tags\/link-building\">learn about link building<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/social-media-for-keyword-rankings-1.jpg\" alt=\"How to Increase Keyword Rankings\" width=\"638\" height=\"380\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Accruing page views and social shares will help you accrue links, which will help you earn that ranking.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 10: Analyze<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019re not <em>quite<\/em> done yet! The web is a living medium, and it\u2019s never too late to better optimize your content. Check your keyword ranking manually (be sure you\u2019re signed out and not seeing overly <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2009\/12\/11\/google-personalized-search\">personalized results<\/a>) or with a rank checking tool. Also use your analytics to see what keywords your content is actually ranking for \u2013 they might not be the exact ones you initially targeted. If, after a couple of weeks or so, you\u2019re not ranking for the right keywords, you have more work to do. Make sure that your content:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is truly optimized<\/li>\n<li>Is truly high-quality<\/li>\n<li>Is truly visible<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It\u2019s also possible that the keyword you chose is too competitive and you need to scale back your ambition. Try targeting less competitive keywords until you\u2019ve built up more authority.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s it! This is the process we follow to rank for hundreds of keywords related to search marketing. Whatever your business niche, you can make the same process work for you.
