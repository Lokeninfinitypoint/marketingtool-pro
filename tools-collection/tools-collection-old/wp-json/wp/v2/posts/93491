Understand and match keyword intent<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-intent\">Keyword intent<\/a> refers to the <em>reason<\/em> people search for the keyword you\u2019re thinking about targeting. Generally speaking, there are four broad types of keyword intent:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Informational:<\/strong> A user wants to learn more about something, like a topic, product, or industry. Example: \u201chistory of Valentine\u2019s Day\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Navigational:<\/strong> A user wants to visit a specific website or web page. Example: \u201c1800 flowers\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Commercial:<\/strong> A user is researching products or services and has the intent to make a purchase in the near future. Example: \u201cBest flowers for a friend on Valentine\u2019s Day\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Transactional:<\/strong> A user is ready to make a purchase.

Target ancillary keywords<\/h3>\n<p>A single piece of content can rank for several keywords. Ideally, much of your content will rank for several keywords.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve picked a primary keyword, look for complementary terms that keep within the overall theme of the topic but don\u2019t overlap 100%.<\/p>\n<p>Say you want to target the term \u201cback pain.\u201d There are a bunch of ancillary keywords you could also target in the same content, like \u201cwhat causes back pain\u201d and \u201chow to relieve lower back pain.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>You can use your keyword tool to find ancillary keywords. Or you can look at two features of the Google search page: People also ask and People also search for.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-pas.webp\" alt=\"SEO copywriting - people also search screen.\" width=\"937\" height=\"426\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93497 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-pas.webp 937w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-pas-480x218.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Those two features tell you what people search for next after reviewing the main keyword\u2019s results. So they\u2019re the perfect additions to make your content comprehensive and rank for more keywords with one asset.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ancillary keyword tip: <\/strong>Google\u2019s search bar autofill is another way to quickly find ancillary keywords. Just start typing your primary keyword in the search bar and see what it autofills. Oh, and try doing this in \u201cprivate\u201d or \u201cincognito mode\u201d so your search history doesn\u2019t affect the results.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-autofill.webp\" alt=\"SEO copywriting - Google autofill.\" width=\"620\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93498 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-autofill.webp 620w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-autofill-480x465.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 620px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"place-keywords-strategically-and-naturally\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Place keywords strategically and naturally<\/h3>\n<p>Using keywords strategically means using them where they can have the most influence on search engines without negatively affecting the experience for readers.<\/p>\n<p>Where should you use keywords? Wherever they can act as a signal that a webpage has the information a searcher is looking for. Here are the most common keyword placements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The page title<\/li>\n<li>In your URL<\/li>\n<li>Meta title tag<\/li>\n<li>Meta description<\/li>\n<li>In the introduction<\/li>\n<li>In subtitles like H2s and H3s<\/li>\n<li>Organically in the body copy<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This post ranked for the search term \u201chow to choose a daycare.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-daycare.webp\" alt=\"SEO copywriting - Daycare blog post.\" width=\"596\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93499 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-daycare.webp 596w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-daycare-480x483.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 596px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It has the exact keyphrase match in the title, and a couple of variations in the introduction. The keyphrase is also in the page\u2019s URL and title tag.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to go overboard here, but whatever you do, do NOT try to stuff your page full of keywords. That tactic worked for about 10 minutes at the dawn of SEO. Not only will it not help you rank, it\u2019ll provide a terrible experience for your visitor, which, in turn, will hurt your chances of ranking.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, use related terms and synonyms\u2014like \u201cdaycare choices,\u201d \u201coptions for daycare,\u201d and \u201cwhere to look for daycares online.\u201d The goal is to balance SEO goals with a positive reader experience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Keyword placement tip:<\/strong> Only use keywords in the body of your text organically.

Get to the point<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019ve been known to write a lengthy introduction every now and then. As valuable as that may be for those writing term papers or Dickensian novels, when we\u2019re talking about SEO copywriting, we have to keep in mind the ultimate goal: to create <strong>relevant <\/strong>content. Relevant content, after all, is the stuff Google puts at the top of the organic results.<\/p>\n<p>Though creating relevant content is largely about matching keyword intent, that\u2019s not the <em>only <\/em>consideration; it\u2019s also important to prove to Google that your content is pertinent. As I\u2019ve learned first-hand, an effective way to prove the pertinence of your content is to <strong>target your main keyword early on in your copy.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To see what I mean, take a look at the first two paragraphs of <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/improve-your-email-subject-line\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this HubSpot article<\/a> about writing email subject lines:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/seo-copywriting-get-to-the-point.jpg\" alt=\"seo copywriting example from HubSpot\" width=\"739\" height=\"162\" \/><\/div>\n<p>By 50 words in, the writer\u2019s already targeted her main keyword three times.

Although Google says they don\u2019t use them as a ranking factor, following the guidelines of E-E-A-T can prove to search engines (AI and traditional) that your website deserves exposure.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what E-E-A-T stands for and how you can show it in your content:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Experience:<\/strong> Share personal experiences, first-hand knowledge, and your results.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Expertise:<\/strong> Stay within the topical realm of your website, include credentials in author bios, and cite only credible sources.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Authoritativeness:<\/strong> Get backlinks from credible websites and encourage mentions of your brand.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Trustworthiness:<\/strong> Verify the information you share, nurture a solid online reputation, and be transparent.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The key to all of this is remembering that trust isn\u2019t just one of the criteria; it\u2019s at the center of them all.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-eeat.webp\" alt=\"SEO copywriting - EEAT graphic.\" width=\"881\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93502 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-eeat.webp 881w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-eeat-480x327.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 881px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As a bonus, AI search results ground some of their responses in the E-E-A-T principles.

But now, with some brands leaning hard on AI-generated copy, those survey results or unique research studies will help you stand out even more.<\/p>\n<div id=\"cover-the-topic-in-depth\"><\/div>\n<h3>8.

That\u2019s like spending years on the interior design of a beautiful home and then throwing on a second-hand, unpainted door nobody wants to walk through.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll make your content way more competitive in the SERPs if you set aside a substantial amount of time for brainstorming headlines.

Meaning that now, most of the time, users leave the SERP without clicking a single hyperlink.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>Before AI took over results pages, featured snippets were the main culprit for the zero-click trend. Featured snippets still exist. But now, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-overviews-impact-on-seo\">AI Overviews<\/a> are delivering complete answers right in the SERP. So searchers don&#8217;t have to click a link to learn how to winterize their homes.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-aio.webp\" alt=\"SEO copywriting -\" width=\"649\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93519 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-aio.webp 649w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-aio-480x444.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 649px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"examples-of-seo-copywriting\">\n<p>The good news is that Google also offers links, citations, images, and videos from the content it uses to create its AI Overviews.
