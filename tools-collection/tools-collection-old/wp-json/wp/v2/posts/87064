Exact match is the new broad match<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What changed<\/strong>: The way that keyword match types work in Google Ads has changed.<\/p>\n<p>The definition of exact match used to be &#8220;Ads may show on searches <em>that match the exact term<\/em> or are close variations of that exact term.&#8221; That\u2019s why it\u2019s called exact match.<\/p>\n<p>Since 2021, <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/7478529?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the definition of exact match<\/a> has been: &#8220;Ads may show on searches<em> that are the same meaning or same intent<\/em> as the keyword.&#8221; Same name, very different meaning.<\/p>\n<p>Although this definition switch happened a few years ago, we\u2019ve only been seeing changes in our Google Ads accounts for the last year or so. And it\u2019s pretty shocking!<\/p>\n<p><strong>What you need to know<\/strong>: Here is how all three keyword match types work today. Let\u2019s use the keyword <em>digital marketing services<\/em> for our example.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exact match:<\/strong> Ads will show for searches that <strong>share the same<\/strong> <strong>meaning<\/strong> as your keyword. For instance, &#8220;digital marketing services&#8221; could match to a query for <em>google ads agency.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Phrase match:<\/strong> Ads will show for searches that <strong>include the meaning<\/strong> of your keyword, where \u201cdigital marketing services\u201d could match to a query for <em>who is the best facebook ads freelancer.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Broad match:<\/strong> Ads will show for searches that <strong>are related to<\/strong> <strong>the meaning<\/strong> of your keyword, as in &#8220;digital marketing services&#8221; on broad match could serve to a query for <em>branding agencies in new york.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Watch out!<\/strong> Even if you\u2019re using exact match keywords, you could end up serving ads on searches you never intended to. For example, one of my clients uses exact match keywords in her<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/11\/02\/brand-keywords\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> brand search campaign<\/a>, and a year ago, out of the blue, she started seeing <em>her competitors<\/em> show up in her search terms report.<\/p>\n<p>Check your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/16\/google-ads-search-terms-report-changes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search terms report<\/a> regularly, and add negatives as needed. There are also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/n-gram-google-ads-script\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads scripts<\/a> you can add to automatically negate \u201cclose variant\u201d matches if it really bothers you.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/keyword-match-type-chart.webp\" alt=\"keyword match types in google ads\" width=\"722\" height=\"477\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87112 size-full\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"negative-keywords\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Negative keywords don\u2019t work how you think they do<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What changed<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/15070437\">Google announced<\/a> in June 2024 that <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/negative-keywords\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">negative keywords<\/a> will now block misspellings. Note that as of publishing this article, the \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/2453972\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">About negative keywords<\/a>\u201d Help Center article has not yet been updated to reflect this change.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What you need to know<\/strong>: Until now, if you wanted to block a certain query or a competitor name, you would need to also block every conceivable misspelling to ensure you don\u2019t serve an ad where you don\u2019t want to.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you sell Google Ads services and want to ensure you don\u2019t advertise when people are searching for Google Analytics services, you would have had to block not only \u201canalytics\u201d but also \u201canalytic,\u201d \u201canlytics,\u201d \u201canalitics,\u201d etc. It was like playing a game of whack-a-mole with your search terms report.<\/p>\n<p>With this new misspellings update, Google is saying that the negative keyword \u201canalytics\u201d will also block all misspelled searches, due to improved semantic understanding.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Watch out!<\/strong> It is too soon to know if this feature is working as intended for advertisers. While it\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/04\/google-ads-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">powered by AI<\/a>, some concerns include how this will treat brand names that are intentional misspellings (like Krispy Kreme or Scribd) or words that are homographs (minute [time] \/ minute [small]) or homophones (ad \/ add, our \/ hour).<\/p>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t reviewed your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/06\/negative-keyword-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">negative keyword lists<\/a> in a while, now is the time to do so.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/google-ads-keywords-negative-list.jpg\" alt=\"future of keywords - negative keyword list example\" width=\"893\" height=\"329\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87103 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/google-ads-keywords-negative-list.jpg 893w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/google-ads-keywords-negative-list-480x177.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 893px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"pmax\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. You can (finally) exclude your brand from Performance Max<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What changed<\/strong>: The <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/14505308?sjid=7170002814080390323-NC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">brand exclusions<\/a> feature has expanded to include all search and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/05\/performance-max-tips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Performance Max campaigns<\/a>. If you don\u2019t want to advertise on searches for your brand, a competitor brand, a partner\u2019s brand, etc., Google says it\u2019s now possible with brand exclusions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What you need to know<\/strong>: In the campaign settings for your search or Performance Max campaign, you can create a \u201cbrand list\u201d of brands you\u2019d like to exclude. Using the branded terms you select as a guide, Google will exclude you from advertising on all searches related to that brand.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you add \u201cYouTube\u201d to your brand list for exclusion, you would not show ads on searches for \u201cyoutube,\u201d \u201cyitibe,\u201d or even \u201cgoogle music app.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Watch out!<\/strong> Brand exclusions are helpful, but not foolproof. You\u2019ll still want to check your<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-performance-max-updates-2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> search themes report<\/a> (PMax) and search terms report (search) regularly to ensure no brand variants are slipping through the cracks.<\/p>\n<p>We expect the feature to continue to improve over time.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/google-ads-performance-max-campaigns-brand-exclusion-list.jpg\" alt=\"google ads performance max campaigns - brand exclusions\" width=\"924\" height=\"199\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-80371 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/google-ads-performance-max-campaigns-brand-exclusion-list.jpg 924w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/google-ads-performance-max-campaigns-brand-exclusion-list-480x103.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 924px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"brand-campaigns\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. You can use broad match keywords for your brand campaigns<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What changed<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/15070437\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brand restrictions are now called brand inclusions<\/a>, and it\u2019s the opposite of brand exclusions. (Huh?)<\/p>\n<p><strong>What you need to know<\/strong>: If you want to <em>only<\/em> advertise on searches that are related to a specific brand, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/14453047?sjid=7170002814080390323-NC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">apply brand inclusions<\/a> to your search campaign with broad match keywords by using a brand list.<\/p>\n<p>Since <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-match-types\">keyword match types<\/a> have loosened up considerably, it\u2019s an interesting new strategy to test to keep your brand search campaigns focused on your brand. Or your competitor search campaigns focused on your competitor if you\u2019d like.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Watch out<\/strong>! It\u2019s not enough to have a search campaign with broad match keywords; brand inclusions only work with the broad match setting turned on.<\/p>\n<p>If you accept Google\u2019s recommendation to \u201cadd brand inclusions and turn on broad match,\u201d it will change the broad match setting for your campaign.<\/p>\n<p>And what does that mean? This brings us to our next point: the push for broad match from Google Ads.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd0e <strong>Need help finding the right keywords?<\/strong> Try our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"broad-match\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Google wants you to use broad match keywords\u2026for everything<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What changed<\/strong>: When you set up a new search campaign, there\u2019s a section in the settings called &#8220;broad match keywords.&#8221; This section isn&#8217;t new, but the default setting is. Now, if you\u2019ve chosen a Smart Bidding strategy, it&#8217;s automatically set to &#8220;on: use broad match keywords for your entire campaign.&#8221; Previously, it was &#8220;off: Use keyword match types.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>What you need to know: <\/strong>When you use the campaign-level broad match keywords setting, this seemingly small step makes two major changes to how your Search campaign runs.<\/p>\n<p>First, <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/13389795?hl=en&amp;sjid=3167375269957238143-NA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">with this setting on<\/a>, all your keywords will be treated as broad match, regardless of whether you&#8217;ve added them as phrase or exact match. Even if you include match types when typing in your keywords, Google Ads will simply discard your match types when you hit \u201cSave.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Second, keywords in campaigns with the broad match setting on will be prioritized as if they were exact match, meaning they&#8217;ll have the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/2756257?sjid=3167375269957238143-NA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">highest priority in the auction<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Watch out!<\/strong> The broad match setting is now going to be one of those things you\u2019re going to need to check in every campaign you take on, right up there with search partners and display network.<\/p>\n<p>The setting isn\u2019t bad, but it will cause a lot of confusion for you if you\u2019re not aware it\u2019s on.<\/p>\n<div id=\"search-themes\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. You can use search themes (instead of keywords) to guide your Performance Max campaigns<\/h3>\n<p><strong>What changed<\/strong>: Last year, Google launched the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/14767319?hl=en&amp;sjid=15739392587824482937-NC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search themes beta for Performance Max<\/a>, giving advertisers the option to add up to 25 \u201cwords and phrases your customers use to find your offerings to help Performance Max campaigns reach the right audience.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>What you need to know<\/strong>: Performance Max campaigns have a search themes report that shows you the types of searches you\u2019ve been advertising on. Now, you can use search themes as a campaign input, not just an output.<\/p>\n<p>However, just like an optional audience signal is meant to help guide the automation, ultimately Google will show your ads whenever, and wherever it wants to achieve your goals. Search themes are also optional, and don\u2019t guarantee that you\u2019ll serve ads on those specific searches.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Watch out!<\/strong> Adding search themes to Performance Max changes your <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/2756257\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">campaign prioritization<\/a>. When more than one campaign could serve an ad on a given query, exact match keywords in search campaigns still have priority #1, but phrase match keywords, broad match keywords, and PMax search themes all share priority #2.<\/p>\n<p>In a nutshell, search themes can make your PMax campaign as likely to serve as your search campaigns. Without search themes, search campaigns will always beat PMax.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/google-ads-performance-max-campaigns-search-themes.jpg\" alt=\"google ads performance max campaigns - search themes example\" width=\"899\" height=\"225\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-80373 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/google-ads-performance-max-campaigns-search-themes.jpg 899w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/google-ads-performance-max-campaigns-search-themes-480x120.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 899px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"future-of-google-ads-keywords\"><\/div>\n<h2>Expert advice on the future of Google Ads keywords<\/h2>\n<p>Given how much has changed in this space over the last two years, I asked five Google Ads experts what this article would look like if I were writing it in another two years. How will keywords work? Will we still have keywords in Google Ads?<\/p>\n<p>The consensus seems to be that search themes and brand inclusions\/exclusions are a harbinger of what\u2019s to come, while match types and negative keywords are on the way out.<\/p>\n<p>Here is what industry experts are saying about the future of Google Ads keywords beyond 2025.<\/p>\n<h3>Google Ads keywords may evolve in favor of broad match types and search themes<\/h3>\n<h4>Menachem Ani, Founder at JXT Group<\/h4>\n<p>I think that Google will always stay with the intent of the keyword. However, we&#8217;ve seen Google working to go beyond intent for a while. First, with audiences (RLSA), then with algorithmic and predictive intent alongside the search term intent. I&#8217;d say that keywords will continue to be around in some form, but <strong>match types will evolve and likely be replaced with broad match keywords and some form of search themes<\/strong> as we&#8217;ve seen in Performance Max.<\/p>\n<h4>Meriem Nacer, Founder at 4M Digital Consulting<\/h4>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/meriem-4m-digital-consulting-headshot-150x150.webp\" alt=\"google ads keywords - meriem \" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class=\"wp-image-87115 size-thumbnail alignright\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Currently, I&#8217;m seeing challenges with phrase match terms like \u201c5-star hotels London\u201d matching specific hotel names, and \u201cHotel Bedding\u201d matching with mattress brands. <strong>I predict phrase match will be phased out, leaving only exact and broad matches. Ultimately, more dynamic campaigns like Performance Max will likely dominate. <\/strong>However, websites and systems are not yet strong enough across smaller accounts, leading to inefficiencies and wasted spend. Smaller businesses and B2B could suffer severely from this.<\/p>\n<h4>Anne Bui, Founder at Puffer Digital<\/h4>\n<p>In my opinion, <strong>keywords will become extinct and replaced with clusters of search themes\/intent<\/strong>, rather than the keyword granularity we\u2019re currently used to. That movement can already be seen with the evolution of match types and how keywords are reported in Performance Max campaigns\u2014it\u2019s only a matter of time before Google scales that out across all search targeting. With AI advancements there\u2019s now more search context used via smart bidding in auctions, enabling the shift from looking at keywords at an individualistic level. Gone are the days of selecting every single keyword for our campaigns\u2014and I\u2019ll gladly take that time back!<\/p>\n<h3>Keywords are just a part of a larger targeting strategy<\/h3>\n<h4>Navah Hopkins, Brand Evangelist at Optmyzr<\/h4>\n<p>I&#8217;m a big believer in embracing close variants because they allow you to bid on profitable ideas, versus having to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-cost\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">budget for every single keyword<\/a>. With that said, I do believe<strong> targeting keywords will remain.<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/navah-headshot-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class=\"alignright wp-image-87118 size-thumbnail\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><\/strong><strong>However, they&#8217;re going to fully morph into signals versus syntax. This means negative keywords, placement exclusions, and audience exclusions will be even more important. <\/strong>Keyword signals represent additional privacy protections for Google (and other keyword-based ad buys). While it&#8217;s frustrating to lose that lever, I&#8217;d count on negatives remaining the same so that Google can&#8217;t be held liable by mounting\u00a0litigations.<\/p>\n<h4>Solange Abraham, Founder at House by Solange<\/h4>\n<p>In two years, <strong>keywords will likely evolve from direct targeting tools to contextual guides. This shift is evident in Google&#8217;s loosening of match types and focus on search themes. <\/strong>As AI advances, search engines will better understand user intent, reducing the importance of exact-match keywords. We&#8217;ll see a move towards topic-based content and semantic optimization. Google&#8217;s BERT update, improving natural language processing, supports this trend. Voice search growth necessitates a conversational approach. Keywords won&#8217;t vanish, but their role will diminish as algorithms interpret context more sophisticatedly. Marketers must adapt, prioritizing content strategies over individual keyword targeting.<\/p>\n<h4>Adrienne Shaver, Co-Founder at Second Banana Bunch<\/h4>\n<p>In the next two years, keywords will evolve towards a more audience-centric, intent-driven approach. This shift reflects consumers&#8217; desire to be understood, not just targeted. AI advancements will reduce reliance on exact matches, focusing on broader query intent and user context. Traditional keywords won&#8217;t vanish but will integrate with semantic search, creating more intuitive PPC campaigns. <strong>These will utilize broad match strategies and first-party data to align with user intent authentically. <\/strong>As search automates, PPC professionals must invest in analyzing audience behaviors to grasp the motivations behind searches. This approach will help brands build valued communities rather than mere target audiences, fostering genuine connections through more empathetic, context-aware keyword strategies.<\/p>\n<div id=\"what-to-expect-for-google-ads-keywords\"><\/div>\n<h2>What to expect for Google Ads keywords in 2025<\/h2>\n<p>Needless to say, your traditional approach to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> keyword research<\/a> in the coming years will likely need to adapt to AI advancements and changes to the search advertising experience.
