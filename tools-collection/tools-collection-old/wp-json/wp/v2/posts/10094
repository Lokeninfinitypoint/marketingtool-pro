Core Web Vitals as a Google ranking factor<\/h3>\n<p>In May 2020, <a href=\"https:\/\/webmasters.googleblog.com\/2020\/05\/evaluating-page-experience.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google announced<\/a> three new metrics, called<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/19\/core-web-vitals-google-page-experience-update\"> Core Web Vitals<\/a>\u00a0to be used for measuring user experience: Loading, Interactivity, and Visual Stability. All three metrics are basically related to just one thing, and that is page speed: how fast does the page load, how soon does it get interactive, and how stable is it while loading.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"293a41b6-e130-448b-819f-49ebc8ea2b1a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/seo20trends20for20202120core20web20vitals-1.png\" alt=\"seo trends for 2021\u2014chart showing core web vitals are now google ranking factors\" width=\"1044\" height=\"588\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/19\/improve-core-web-vitals\">Core Web Vitals<\/a> will be among Google&#8217;s\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/09\/google-ranking-factors\">ranking factors<\/a>\u00a0in May 2021, meaning you will have to pay close attention them in order to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/19\/get-on-first-page-google\">appear on the first page<\/a>.

It works in more than 70 languages and for almost every query in Google English.<\/p>\n<p>With Google&#8217;s BERT update, the Google search engine bots have become much more &#8220;conversational,&#8221; so now, Google&#8217;s algorithm can now interpret the intent of the searcher. In simple words, Now Google can understand things like the human brain.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2c2c1a64-a2ad-4d57-ab49-430489152bc9\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/seo20trends20for20202120BERT-1.png\" alt=\"seo trends for 2021\u2014quote about Google's BERT update and conversational language\" width=\"800\" height=\"354\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>What this also means is that websites that have content-<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-intent\">intent<\/a> mismatches will be negatively impacted. No matter how detailed or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/15\/quality-content-defined\">high-quality<\/a> that long-form content is, if it\u2019s is not satisfying user intent then BERT will ignore yours and prefer another content piece that satisfies the intent for the given query.<\/p>\n<p>One thing to note is that Google BERT is not an algorithmic penalty. It\u2019s a part of the Google search engine that helps filter out the most relevant &amp; useful content to users by understanding search queries and content as humans. So it won\u2019t de-rank or <a href=\"https:\/\/seoconsultation.co\/recover-google-penalty\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">penalize sites<\/a>. It will just give favor to those that show the best results to users, which is what Google has always strived to do.<\/p>\n<p>If your content is not providing what a user is looking for, then your content is not BERT-friendly and you won\u2019t <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/11\/14\/how-to-rank-for-a-keyword\">rank for that keyword<\/a> for the long-term. That\u2019s why publishing valuable content that satisfies the user-intent can help you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to optimize for Google\u2019s BERT<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Search intent is exactly what the user is searching for when they type a particular keyword into a Google search. Are they looking for an answer to a question? A list of options? A how-to tutorial? Or do they want to buy a product and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/16\/get-more-google-reviews\">read reviews<\/a>? There is a lot of intent that users bring to the Google search bar, so it\u2019s important to make sure your content and the keyword intent match.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if someone is searching \u201cseo\u201d as a keyword on Google, that means the user wants to know about SEO. But if a user is searching \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/15\/small-business-seo-services\">seo services<\/a>\u201d as a keyword that means the user is seeking out someone for &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/loudgrowth.in\/seo-services\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">seo services<\/a>.&#8221; So the keyword \u201cseo&#8221;\u00a0is an informational keyword while \u201cseo services\u201d is a commercial keyword.<\/p>\n<p>But some keywords could be multi-intent keywords like \u201cseo expert\u201d Maybe the person who is searching it is looking for an SEO expert to hire or wants to be an <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/search-engine-optimization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO expert<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5babf7a7-3c56-4298-ba5d-fadb8753fa70\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/seo20trends20for20202120keyword20intent20seo20services-1.png\" alt=\"seo trends for 2021\u2014SERP example showing keyword intent for the keyword &quot;SEO services&quot;\" width=\"500\" height=\"1358\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Always search a keyword on Google before starting working on content for it!

Simply put, this is unique content that has not already been published somewhere else.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"78351069-a837-46c5-90b7-6065a41de97b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/seo20trends20for20202120unique20content-1.png\" alt=\"seo trends for 2021 unique content\" width=\"800\" height=\"378\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Would you buy a shirt with the same color and design that you already have?

Voice search<\/h3>\n<p>According to Google, a staggering 27% of the entire global population is using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/14\/google-voice-search\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">voice search<\/a> on their mobile phones. Furthermore, ComScore reports that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/04\/10\/voice-search-statistics-2018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more than half <\/a>of smartphone users are engaging with voice search technology in 2020.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"39e3efd5-4c99-4526-b066-f29142a3e3f3\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/seo20trends20for20202120voice20search-1.png\" alt=\"seo trends for 2021 voice search\" width=\"600\" height=\"672\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/simple_image\/public\/images\/google-voice-search-uses.jpg\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Now here\u2019s a thing, most of the voice search queries are <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/11\/07\/how-to-find-long-tail-keywords\">long-tail<\/a> and very specific. Users look for specific answers to their queries when they use voice search. And such users are at the consideration <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/01\/ecommerce-sales-funnel\">stage of the funnel<\/a> and are more likely to convert than the rest of the users.

Artificial intelligence<\/h3>\n<p>Just like most of the industries,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/11\/04\/rankbrain\"> AI is changing the SEO<\/a> and marketing industry as well. The reason behind this impact of AI is the personalization that AI provides.

And then creating strategies accordingly takes a lot of time. While SEO experts can help with such strategies, utilization of AI and machine learning can be a game-changer. It would be much more efficient and powerful in terms of decoding the algorithms and creating favorable strategies.<\/p>\n<p>There are several companies like HubSpot, Frase, and MarketMuse that are providing AI-based solutions that can help companies with their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/23\/seo-for-startups\">SEO efforts<\/a> and in the coming years, such tools can become a major trend in the industry.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Video marketing<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/27\/youtube-statistics\">YouTube<\/a> is the second most popular search engine after Google with over 1 billion users.

Start with optimizing your video channel name and description. Though the description shouldn&#8217;t be overloaded with keywords but provide a user-friendly description of what your channel is all about.<\/p>\n<p>However, even keywords are important. For example, if you&#8217;re <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/14\/how-to-get-more-views-on-youtube\">optimizing your videos for YouTube<\/a>, you can use YouTube&#8217;s autocomplete feature.

The suggestions are the related keywords that you can use for optimizing the video for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/23\/personalized-video-marketing\">reaching the right set of audience<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>8.

For example, to get in the featured results, you need to answer a specific question, and answering in bullet points (well-structured content) would be better.<\/p>\n<h3>9.
