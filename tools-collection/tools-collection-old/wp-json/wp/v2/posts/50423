I\u2019ll admit, as a seasoned Google Ads vet, attribution models has been my weak point in terms of expertise\u2014up until recently.<\/p>\n<p>Google has yet again stirred the pot by releasing changes to default attribution models across accounts. This was the push I needed to take my knowledge in attribution modeling beyond surface level. So I did the dirty work of investigating Google\u2019s latest change to answer all your questions, like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is changing about attribution modeling in Google Ads?<\/li>\n<li>What are the current attribution models available to advertisers?<\/li>\n<li>What action should advertisers take regarding their own attribution model?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Read on to find out!<\/p>\n<h2>Data-driven attribution modeling is the new default<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/ads-commerce\/data-driven-attribution-new-default\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google announced<\/a>\u00a0on September 27 that it is changing the default <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/11\/06\/google-ads-attribution-models\">attribution model<\/a> for all <strong>new<\/strong> conversion actions in Google Ads, from last-click attribution to data-driven attribution (DDA). In addition, it is removing any previously required data minimums for DDA attribution modeling and making it available for more conversion types, including in-app and offline conversions.<\/p>\n<h2>A brief refresher on attribution models<\/h2>\n<p>In order to fully understand this update, you\u2019ll want to have a solid base knowledge of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/08\/attribution-models\">attribution modeling<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Attribution models help you\u00a0accurately credit actions that lead to a conversion, helping to remove some of the\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/24\/google-ads-conversion-tracking\">conversion tracking hangups<\/a>\u00a0advertisers face. When someone converts, they may have interacted with multiple different ads over time up until that point. The various attribution models credit each of those moments differently to fit your business needs.<\/p>\n<p>There are six attribution models:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Last click:<\/strong> credits a conversion to the final ad and corresponding keyword a user clicked on when they finally converted.<\/li>\n<li><strong>First click: <\/strong>credits a conversion to the very first ad (and corresponding keyword) a user sees.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Linear: <\/strong>credits a conversion evenly across all interactions involved with a customer\u2019s path.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Time-decay:<\/strong> credits a conversion to ad interactions that happened closer in time to the actual conversion.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Position based: <\/strong>credits 40% of a conversion to each the first and last click, and 20% to the rest of the interactions.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Data-driven: <\/strong>credits each conversion differently, because it looks at tons of different data signals that make up each conversion action.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"b7e2d92c-cdcc-482c-bd32-4d385f76ecb1\" data-langcode=\"en\" class=\"embedded-entity align-center\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/attribution-model-types-google-ads.png\" width=\"650\" height=\"365\" alt=\"google ads attribution model types\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/sunbaymarketing.com\/google-ads-attribution-models\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Essentially, while the first five attribution models are \u201crules-based,\u201d DDA uses your account\u2019s historical data to distribute the credit for a conversion across interactions that may have different weights or impacts onto the overall bottom line.

There are two main ways:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Data-driven attribution can provide more holistic data<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In some ways, DDA can give you a more holistic view of your conversion paths. This will help the underdogs of your account shine. Remember, even if the last click from those assets didn\u2019t result in a conversion, their interactions will still show they did at least <em>something<\/em> for you.<\/p>\n<p>Last click, however,\u00a0is more rigid, only allowing the ad that brought in the final click to wear the conversion crown.<\/p>\n<div data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1240c7c8-ecac-4c9e-b0ef-c17fbc70ea69\" data-langcode=\"en\" class=\"embedded-entity align-center\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/data-driven-attribution-new-default-google-ads-meme-office.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"334\" alt=\"last-click attribution model meme\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>DDA is less black and white<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Second, last click attribution (and first click attribution) only report on complete conversions. These can be easier grasped when <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/04\/adwords-roi\">analyzing your advertising ROI<\/a>. Meanwhile, DDA will credit interactions on ad towards a conversion action even if those\u00a0interactions didn\u2019t directly result in a completed conversion.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a DDA conversion might be reported as 1.5 conversions within the conversions column, while a last click conversion will would\u00a0just consider it one single conversion.<\/p>\n<p>The above point drives home the fact that DDA looks at various historical data points to know when an interaction is actually meaningful. In contrast, last click reporting is black and white.<\/p>\n<h2>More questions<\/h2>\n<p>Even the most advanced PPC experts can get tripped up when it comes to attribution modeling. I\u2019ll bet there\u2019s plenty of questions popping up with this change, so let\u2019s address a few:<\/p>\n<h3>Do I have to use DDA for <strong>new<\/strong> conversion actions?<\/h3>\n<p>No. Even though DDA will become the default attribution model for all <strong>new<\/strong> conversion actions, you can manually switch to any of the five other attribution models if you choose.<\/p>\n<h3>What about my <strong>existing<\/strong> conversion actions?<\/h3>\n<p>While Google said DDR will be the default for <strong>new<\/strong> conversion actions, it did say that it will be migrating existing conversion actions \u201cfor many advertisers\u201d over to DDA. As mentioned above, it\u2019s unclear exactly which accounts this applies to, but it will\u00a0be happening over the coming months\u00a0and you will get plenty of notice.<\/p>\n<div data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d8401bec-862f-4719-ac8f-66c7b3732e36\" data-langcode=\"en\" class=\"embedded-entity align-center\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/data-driven-attribution-new-default-google-ads-migrating-1.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"118\" alt=\"ginny marvin tweet: google will migrate some existing conversion actions to data-driven attribution\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>How do I opt out of Google changing my existing conversion actions to DDA?<\/h3>\n<p>If Google chooses to switch your existing conversion actions over to DDA, you will get multiple alerts indicating that your actions are about to switch to DDA.
