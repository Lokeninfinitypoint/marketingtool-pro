You\u2019re always on the hunt for the next big idea or tactic to try.<\/p>\n<p>Marketing newsletters are a great source of info to feed that curiosity. So, I asked a bunch of marketers which ones they loved most.<\/p>\n<p>I filtered out newsletters from big-name marketing gurus (sorry, Seth Godin). That way, you\u2019d only get options that share ground-level, relatable strategies to use in your everyday work.<\/p>\n<p>I also reached out to several of the newsletter authors to get a little behind-the-scenes scoop about what they write and who it\u2019s for.

It can be misunderstood. Not just by senior leadership, but by your own marketing peers,\u201d Lauren said. \u201cWe are more cross-functional and less transactional than a lot of marketing functions, and sometimes even marketing leaders don&#8217;t know what to do with us.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This topic can get a bit existential at times. But Lauren breaks it down into bite-sized bits and presents them so readers have an actionable takeaway. \u201cEach issue includes three sections on a topic like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/customer-data\">using data<\/a> or working with SMEs: an actionable tip, an anti-pattern like a major misconception or common mistake, and a big idea that tackles a more philosophical angle,\u201d she explained.<\/p>\n<p>Personally, I love how vulnerable and transparent Lauren is in her writing. Many content marketers struggle with connecting the dots between a blog or social media post and a line item on the revenue report.

Tether Signal: Best for understanding consumer psychology<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019m a sucker for learning how our brains work, so I was instantly intrigued by the inspiration behind <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/sarahlevinger\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sarah Levinger\u2019s<\/a> newsletter, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sarahlevinger.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tether Signal<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-tether-1024x659.webp\" alt=\"Marketing newsletters - screenshot from Tether.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"659\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89871 size-large\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-tether-1024x659.webp 1024w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-tether-300x193.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-tether-768x495.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-tether-1080x695.webp 1080w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-tether-1280x824.webp 1280w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-tether-980x631.webp 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-tether-480x309.webp 480w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-tether-png.webp 1317w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Sarah Levinger blends marketing best practices with consumer psychology in her newsletter.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cMost of my inspiration comes from the work I do with brands\u2014analyzing customer psychology, running identity-based research panels, and uncovering what actually moves the needle,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cI also pull insights from behavioral science studies, psychology research, and real-world experiments in DTC marketing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The content Sarah shares makes good on the promise. Each issue digs into a real-world example of how a brand successfully\u2014and sometimes surprisingly\u2014used psychology to establish a foothold in its customers\u2019 consciousness.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy goal is to bridge that gap by sharing real, research-backed insights that help brands cut costs, boost sales, and build deeper connections with their audiences,\u201d she added.<\/p>\n<h4>The past issue you need to read<\/h4>\n<p>The newsletter issue and subsequent<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tetherinsights.io\/blog\/how-ikea-grew-11-4-yoy-using-coffee-cup-emojis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> blog post<\/a> about IKEA\u2019s little price tag trick were fascinating. Basically, IKEA replaced the numerical price of a plant pot with three banana emojis. It sounds weird, but it sure did work\u2014and it\u2019s a perfect illustration of what Sarah\u2019s newsletter is all about.<\/p>\n<div id=\"4-more-marketing-newsletters-worthy-of-your-inbox\"><\/div>\n<h2>More marketing newsletters worthy of your inbox<\/h2>\n<p>I got so many great recommendations that I didn\u2019t have time or space to do a deep dive into them all. But these four marketing newsletters definitely deserve a look.<\/p>\n<div id=\"mkt1\"><\/div>\n<h3>9. MKT1<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/emilykramer\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Emily Kramer<\/a> is the mastermind behind both the <a href=\"https:\/\/newsletter.mkt1.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MKT1 newsletter<\/a> and the Dear Marketers podcast. The newsletter is a monthly discussion of a broad spectrum of B2B marketing topics like AI workflows, choosing the right marketing channels, and account-driven GTM strategies. There\u2019s also a job board and a library of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/18\/free-marketing-templates\">marketing templates<\/a> on the MKT1 website.<\/p>\n<p>This <a href=\"https:\/\/newsletter.mkt1.co\/p\/marketing-strategy-exercises\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post on marketing strategy<\/a> is a good example of the long-form, step-by-step type of content you\u2019ll get from Emily and the MKT1 newsletter.<\/p>\n<div id=\"mkt1\"><\/div>\n<div id=\"why-we-buy\"><\/div>\n<h3>10. Why We Buy<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/learnwhywebuy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Why We Buy<\/a> is another fantastic newsletter for us <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/23\/influence-buyers-marketing-psychology\">marketing psychology<\/a> nerds. In it, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/katebour\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Katelyn Bourgoin<\/a> addresses the psychological phenomenon that guides our buying decisions. She builds her case either through the lens of a real-world brand example or starting from the definition of a particular psychological principle.<\/p>\n<p>Katelyn\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/learnwhywebuy.com\/effort-justification\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">explanation of effort justification<\/a> is a good place to start. Not only is it representative of her typical structure (What this is, How to apply it), but it\u2019s also a good example of her staccato writing style. If you like quick, skimmable paragraphs, you\u2019ll enjoy reading Why We Buy.<\/p>\n<div id=\"command-create\"><\/div>\n<h3>11. Command + Create<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/command-create.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Command + Create<\/a> was one of the first newsletters recommended to me when I started asking. After perusing the content that writer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/hsingtseng\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hsing Tseng<\/a> publishes, I see why. It\u2019s a cozy, comfortable place to learn about the soft and hard skills required to be a great freelance content marketer.<\/p>\n<p>I like <a href=\"https:\/\/command-create.com\/your-audience-doesnt-care-about-your-brand-and-thats-okay\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hsing\u2019s take<\/a> that some businesses consider their brand more precious than it should be and how that could scare away customers.<\/p>\n<div id=\"contentment\"><\/div>\n<h3>12. Contentment<\/h3>\n<p>Full disclosure: I\u2019ve been a happy\u2026ahem, content\u2026<a href=\"https:\/\/workweek.com\/brand\/contentment\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contentment<\/a> subscriber for a while now. I\u2019ve always enjoyed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/traceyrwallace\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tracey Wallace\u2019s<\/a> pragmatic notions about how marketing really works. So I was glad when another marketer suggested Contentment for this list. You\u2019ll be glad you subscribed to this newsletter if you want smart, no-nonsense ruminations from a truly expert content marketer.<\/p>\n<p>Now, just because her newsletter isn\u2019t dripping with memes and hand-crafted visuals doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bland or boring. Case in point, in <a href=\"https:\/\/workweek.com\/2025\/01\/08\/9-timeless-content-marketing-lessons-from-benjamin-franklin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this issue<\/a> Tracy breaks down Benjamin Franklin\u2019s Poor Richard\u2019s Almanack to construct a framework for modern-day content marketing.<\/p>\n<h2>Which is the best marketing newsletter?<\/h2>\n<p>Trick question. The best marketing newsletter is the one you actually read.<\/p>\n<p>I get a lot of newsletters in my inbox (a hazard of being a content marketer). But I only read a few regularly. I tend to gravitate towards those with quick lessons and quipy writing. You might prefer long-form takedowns with tons of data and charts. That\u2019s great, too.<\/p>\n<p>The point is, there are so many great <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/popular-marketing-resources-2025\">learning options<\/a> out there, so don\u2019t stress yourself out trying to stay on top of every one. We all learn differently. Lean into your style and have fun (If listening is your thing, check out this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/best-marketing-podcasts\">list of podcasts<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and don\u2019t be afraid to connect with the authors on LinkedIn. I find them to be genuinely great people who want to help other marketers succeed.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>These are the best marketing newsletters as recommended by
