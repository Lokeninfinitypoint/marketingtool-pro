Few fields promise to \u201cdisrupt\u201d (to borrow a favored term) life as we know it quite like machine learning, but many of the applications of machine learning technology go unseen.<\/p>\n<p>Want to see some real examples of machine learning in action? Here are 10 companies that are using the power of machine learning in new and exciting ways (plus a glimpse into the future of machine learning).<\/p>\n<h2>1. Yelp \u2013 Image Curation at Scale<\/h2>\n<p>Few things compare to trying out a new restaurant then going online to complain about it afterwards. This is among the many reasons why Yelp is so popular (and useful).<\/p>\n<p>While Yelp might not seem to be a tech company at first glance, Yelp is leveraging machine learning to <a href=\"https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/simple_image\/public\/images\/machine-learning-yelp-image-categorizing.png?gWGEygaMvtnyAQK39kc3N0L3v1l4NB55&amp;itok=DCXqJXCo\">improve users\u2019 experience<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Since images are almost as vital to Yelp as user reviews themselves, it should come as little surprise that Yelp is always trying to improve how it handles image processing.<\/p>\n<p>This is why <a href=\"https:\/\/engineeringblog.yelp.com\/2015\/10\/how-we-use-deep-learning-to-classify-business-photos-at-yelp.html\">Yelp turned to machine learning a couple of years ago<\/a> when it first implemented its picture classification technology. <strong>Yelp\u2019s machine learning algorithms help the company\u2019s human staff to compile, categorize, and label images more efficiently<\/strong> \u2013 no small feat when you\u2019re dealing with tens of millions of photos.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Pinterest \u2013 Improved Content Discovery<\/h2>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re a hardcore pinner or have never used the site before, Pinterest occupies a curious place in the social media ecosystem. Since Pinterest\u2019s primary function is to curate existing content, it makes sense that investing in technologies that can make this process more effective would be a priority \u2013 and that\u2019s definitely the case at Pinterest.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/machine-learning-pinterest-recommendation-engine.jpg\" alt=\"Machine learning technology Pinterest recommendation engine\" width=\"815\" height=\"544\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In 2015, <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@Pinterest_Engineering\/the-future-of-machine-learning-at-pinterest-88e6d4bf1968\">Pinterest acquired Kosei<\/a>, a machine learning company that specialized in the commercial applications of machine learning tech (specifically, content discovery and recommendation algorithms).<\/p>\n<p>Today, <strong>machine learning touches virtually every aspect of Pinterest\u2019s business operations, from spam moderation and content discovery to advertising monetization and reducing churn of email newsletter subscribers<\/strong>. Pretty cool.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Facebook \u2013 Chatbot Army<\/h2>\n<p>Although Facebook\u2019s Messenger service is still a little\u2026contentious (people have <em>very<\/em> strong feelings about messaging apps, it seems), it\u2019s one of the most exciting aspects of the world\u2019s largest social media platform. <strong>That\u2019s because Messenger has become something of an experimental testing laboratory for chatbots<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/machine-learning-facebook-messenger-chatbots.jpg\" alt=\"Machine learning Facebook Messenger chatbots\" width=\"1400\" height=\"698\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Some chatbots are virtually indistinguishable from humans when conversing via text<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Any developer can create and submit a chatbot for inclusion in Facebook Messenger. This means that companies with a strong emphasis on customer service and retention can leverage <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/04\/chatbots\">chatbots<\/a>, even if they\u2019re a tiny startup with limited engineering resources.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, that\u2019s not the only application of machine learning that Facebook is interested in. <strong>AI applications are being used at Facebook to filter out spam and poor-quality content<\/strong>, and the company is also researching <a href=\"https:\/\/research.fb.com\/category\/applied-machine-learning\/\">computer vision algorithms that can \u201cread\u201d images to visually impaired people<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Twitter \u2013 Curated Timelines<\/h2>\n<p>Twitter has been at the center of numerous controversies of late (not least of which were the much-derided decisions to round out everyone\u2019s avatars and changes to the way people are tagged in @ replies), but one of the more contentious changes we\u2019ve seen on Twitter was <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/engineering\/en_us\/topics\/insights\/2017\/using-deep-learning-at-scale-in-twitters-timelines.html\">the move toward an algorithmic feed<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/machine-learning-rob-lowe-twitter-meltdown.png\" alt=\"Machine learning Rob Lowe Twitter algorithm rant\" width=\"517\" height=\"247\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Rob Lowe was particularly upset by the introduction of algorithmically curated Twitter timelines<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Whether you prefer to have Twitter show you \u201cthe best tweets first\u201d (whatever that means) or as a reasonably chronological timeline, these changes are being driven by Twitter\u2019s machine learning technology. <strong>Twitter\u2019s AI evaluates each tweet in real time and \u201cscores\u201d them according to various metrics<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, Twitter\u2019s algorithms then display tweets that are likely to drive the most engagement. This is determined on an individual basis; <strong>Twitter\u2019s machine learning tech makes those decisions based on your individual preferences<\/strong>, resulting in the algorithmically curated feeds, which kinda suck if we\u2019re being completely honest. (Does anybody actually prefer the algorithmic feed? Tell me why in the comments, you lovely weirdos.)<\/p>\n<h2>5. Google \u2013 Neural Networks and \u2018Machines That Dream\u2019<\/h2>\n<p>These days, it\u2019s probably easier to list areas of scientific R&amp;D that Google \u2013 or, rather, parent company Alphabet \u2013 <em>isn\u2019t<\/em> working on, rather than trying to summarize Google\u2019s technological ambition.<\/p>\n<p>Needless to say, Google has been very busy in recent years, having diversified into such fields as anti-aging technology, medical devices, and \u2013 perhaps most exciting for tech nerds \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/simple_image\/public\/images\/machine-learning-google-neural-network-images.png?uU4LdaLzlr3XtdGDcg4tMsI.DUa8srBq&amp;itok=nk6vfPag\">neural networks<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The most visible developments in Google\u2019s neural network research has been <strong>the DeepMind network, the \u201cmachine that dreams.\u201d<\/strong> It\u2019s the same network that produced <a href=\"https:\/\/research.googleblog.com\/2015\/06\/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html\">those psychedelic images everybody was talking about<\/a> a while back.<\/p>\n<p>According to Google, the company is researching \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/research.google.com\/pubs\/MachineIntelligence.html\">virtually all aspects of machine learning<\/a>,\u201d which will lead to exciting developments in what Google calls \u201cclassical algorithms\u201d as well as other applications including natural language processing, speech translation, and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/11\/04\/rankbrain\">search ranking<\/a> and prediction systems.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Edgecase \u2013 Improving Ecommerce Conversion Rates<\/h2>\n<p>For years, retailers have struggled to overcome the mighty disconnect between shopping in stores and shopping online. For all the talk of how online retail will be the death-knell of traditional shopping, many ecommerce sites still suck.<\/p>\n<p>Edgecase, formerly known as Compare Metrics, hopes to change that.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/machine-learning-edgecase-example.jpg\" alt=\"Machine learning examples Edgecase\" width=\"720\" height=\"385\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Edgecase hopes its machine learning technology <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2014\/08\/26\/edgecase-relaunch\/\">can help ecommerce retailers improve the experience for users<\/a>. In addition to streamlining the ecommerce experience in order to improve conversion rates, Edgecase plans to <strong>leverage its tech to provide a better experience for shoppers who may only have a vague idea of what they\u2019re looking for, <\/strong>by analyzing certain behaviors and actions that signify commercial intent \u2013 an attempt to make casual browsing online more rewarding and closer to the traditional retail experience.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Baidu \u2013 The Future of Voice Search<\/h2>\n<p>Google isn\u2019t the only search giant that\u2019s branching out into machine learning. Chinese search engine Baidu is also investing heavily in the applications of AI.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/machine-learning-voice-recognition-diagram.png\" alt=\"Machine learning examples voice recognition\" width=\"1600\" height=\"732\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A simplified five-step diagram illustrating the key stages of a natural language processing system<\/em><\/p>\n<p>One of the most interesting (and disconcerting) developments at Baidu\u2019s R&amp;D lab is what the company calls <a href=\"http:\/\/research.baidu.com\/deep-voice-2-multi-speaker-neural-text-speech\/\">Deep Voice<\/a>, <strong>a deep neural network that can generate entirely synthetic human voices that are very difficult to distinguish from genuine human speech<\/strong>. The network can \u201clearn\u201d the unique subtleties in the cadence, accent, pronunciation and pitch to create eerily accurate recreations of speakers\u2019 voices.<\/p>\n<p>Far from an idle experiment, Deep Voice 2 \u2013 the latest iteration of the Deep Voice technology \u2013 promises to have a lasting impact on natural language processing, the underlying technology behind <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/04\/10\/voice-search-statistics-2018\">voice search<\/a> and voice pattern recognition systems. This could have major implications for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/15\/voice-search-seo\">voice search<\/a> applications, as well as dozens of other potential uses, such as real-time translation and biometric security.<\/p>\n<h2>8. HubSpot \u2013 Smarter Sales<\/h2>\n<p>Anyone who is familiar with HubSpot probably already knows that the company has long been an early adopter of emerging technologies, and the company proved this again earlier this month when it announced the acquisition of machine learning firm Kemvi.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/machine-learning-predictive-lead-scoring.png\" alt=\"Machine learning predictive lead scoring concept illustration\" width=\"892\" height=\"632\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Predictive lead scoring is just one of the many potential applications of AI and machine learning<\/em><\/p>\n<p>HubSpot plans to use Kemvi\u2019s technology in a range of applications \u2013 most notably, integrating Kemvi\u2019s DeepGraph machine learning and natural language processing tech in its internal content management system.<\/p>\n<p>This, <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@HubSpot\/why-hubspot-acquired-kemvi-b57c2ada8877\">according to HubSpot\u2019s Chief Strategy Officer Bradford Coffey<\/a>, <strong>will allow HubSpot to better identify \u201ctrigger events\u201d<\/strong> \u2013 changes to a company\u2019s structure, management, or anything else that affects day-to-day operations \u2013 to allow HubSpot to more effectively pitch prospective clients and serve existing customers.<\/p>\n<h2>9. IBM \u2013 Better Healthcare<\/h2>\n<p>The inclusion of IBM might seem a little strange, given that IBM is one of the largest and oldest of the legacy technology companies, but IBM has managed to transition from older business models to newer revenue streams remarkably well. None of IBM\u2019s products demonstrate this better than its renowned AI, Watson.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/machine-learning-ibm-watson.jpg\" alt=\"Machine learning IBM Watson AI\" width=\"800\" height=\"527\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>An example of how IBM\u2019s Watson can be used to test and validate self-learning behavioral models<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Watson may be a <em>Jeopardy!<\/em> champion, but it boasts a considerably more impressive track record than besting human contestants in televised game shows. <strong>Watson has been deployed in several hospitals and medical centers in recent years<\/strong>, where it demonstrated its aptitude for\u00a0making highly accurate recommendations in the treatment of certain types of cancers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Watson also shows significant potential in the retail sector, where it could be used as an assistant to help shoppers<\/strong>, as well as the hospitality industry. As such, IBM is now offering its <a href=\"https:\/\/datascience.ibm.com\/features#machinelearning\">Watson machine learning technology<\/a> on a license basis \u2013 one of the first examples of an AI application being packaged in such a manner.<\/p>\n<h2>10. Salesforce \u2013 Intelligent CRMs<\/h2>\n<p>Salesforce is a titan of the tech world, with strong market share in the customer relationship management (CRM) space and the resources to match. Lead prediction and scoring are among the greatest challenges for even the savviest digital marketer, which is why Salesforce is betting big on its proprietary Einstein machine learning technology.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/machine-learning-salesforce-einstein.png\" alt=\"Machine learning Salesforce Einstein AI technology\" width=\"759\" height=\"636\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Salesforce Einstein allows businesses that use Salesforce\u2019s CRM software to analyze every aspect of a customer\u2019s relationship<\/strong> \u2013 from initial contact to ongoing engagement touch points \u2013 to build much more detailed profiles of customers and identify crucial moments in the sales process. This means much more comprehensive lead scoring, more effective customer service (and happier customers), and more opportunities.<\/p>\n<h2>The Future of Machine Learning<\/h2>\n<p>One of the main problems with rapid technological advancement is that, for whatever reason, we end up taking these leaps for granted. Some of the applications of machine learning listed above would have been almost unthinkable as recently as a decade ago, and yet the pace at which scientists and researchers are advancing is nothing short of amazing.<\/p>\n<p>So, what\u2019s next in machine learning trends?<\/p>\n<h3>Machines That Learn More Effectively<\/h3>\n<p>Before long, we\u2019ll see artificial intelligences that can learn much more effectively. This will lead to developments in how algorithms are treated, such as AI deployments that can recognize, alter, and improve upon their own internal architecture with minimal human supervision.<\/p>\n<h3>Automation of Cyberattack Countermeasures<\/h3>\n<p>The rise of cybercrime and ransomware has forced companies of all sizes to reevaluate how they respond to systemic online attacks. We\u2019ll soon see AI take a much greater role in monitoring, preventing, and responding to cyberattacks like database breaches, DDoS attacks, and other threats.<\/p>\n<h3>Convincing Generative Models<\/h3>\n<p>Generative models, such as the ones used by Baidu in our example above, are already incredibly convincing. Soon, we won\u2019t be able to tell the difference at all. Improvements to generative modeling will result in increasingly sophisticated images, voices, and even entire identities generated entirely by algorithms.<\/p>\n<h3>Better Machine Learning Training<\/h3>\n<p>Even the most sophisticated AI can only learn as effectively as the training it receives; oftentimes, machine learning systems require enormous volumes of data to be trained. In the future, machine learning systems will require less and less data to \u201clearn,\u201d resulting in systems that can learn much faster with significantly smaller data sets.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Machine learning is one of the most exciting technological developments in history.
