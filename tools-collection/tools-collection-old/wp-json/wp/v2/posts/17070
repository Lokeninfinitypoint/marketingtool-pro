The platform offers multiple options, including photo ads and carousel ads, as well as video ads and ads on Instagram Stories\u2014with the latter two offering sight, sound and motion to further connect with users. And we all know <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/08\/video-marketing-statistics\">video is hot right now<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Connor Voss, social media strategist at Veterans United Home Loans, said brands considering Instagram Stories should start by spending time interacting with them to better understand interactive capabilities, trends, and content expectations.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen viewers are engaging with Stories, they\u2019re expecting to see video and, often, to interact\u2014so placing a video ad [within] Instagram Stories can reach users who are more open to watching videos and to swiping up to see more products or read the rest of an article,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the feed, users are accustomed to scrolling and glancing\u2014not necessarily stopping, interacting or clicking through to another web page.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Vivien Conway, cofounder of Instagram-focused agency Ace the Gram, said users don&#8217;t curate Stories as much as they do their feeds, and that makes it easier for advertisers to stand out.<\/p>\n<p>No matter which video ad format you choose, here are ten tips to maximize their effectiveness.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Make the first seconds count<\/h2>\n<p>Instagram users quickly scroll through their feeds, so whether it&#8217;s a regular Instagram video ad or an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/04\/instagram-story-ads-polls\">Instagram story ad<\/a>, brands need to make <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/video-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video ads<\/a> that compel users to stop.<\/p>\n<p>Per Natasha Courtenay-Smith, CEO of digital marketing firm Bolt Digital, this means incorporating movement in the first three seconds.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-video-ad-movement.gif\" alt=\"how to make an instagram video ad\" width=\"302\" height=\"170\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cYou have no time at all to capture anyone&#8217;s attention,\u201d she said. \u201cDon&#8217;t be arty with slow openers\u2026you want something that is bright, moves and catches attention.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And Voss said to make sure consumers can immediately tell your ad is a video.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMake sure that the first second of your video has enough movement that, with the sound off, viewers know immediately that it\u2019s a video and not a still image,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the first few seconds are so subtle that it appears to be an image, they\u2019ll scroll right by without realizing they missed anything.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>2. Add text<\/h2>\n<p>Because Instagram audio is muted by default, Jonathan Jacobs, partner of digital agency Digital Natives Group, said brands must lead with visuals and\/or text.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou can grab their attention\u2014or just get your message across\u2014by providing more than just captions,\u201d said Chuck Cotterman, social media marketing specialist at business software and services review firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.g2crowd.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">G2 Crowd<\/a>. \u201cCreate dynamic text effects using apps like Apple Clips to highlight main points that you wouldn&#8217;t want any viewer to miss.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/using-text-in-instagram-video-ads.jpg\" alt=\"instagram video ad tips\" width=\"500\" height=\"742\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Ehud Basis, senior online acquisition manager at discovery platform Outbrain, agreed this kind of text can help reinforce the most important messages a brand wants to deliver.<\/p>\n<p>However, Veronica Romney, president of digital marketing agency LoSoMo, cautioned against using <em>too<\/em> much text.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA few short captions in the video will help pique your audience\u2019s interest so that they watch the entire video and even end up playing the sound later on,\u201d she said. \u201cToo much text, however, can be overwhelming for the viewer and make the video seem cluttered.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Conway noted that a quick and easy way to generate video captions is to use services like Rev.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, Vincit-Lee Lloyd, CEO of digital agency Lloyd Media Solutions, said to nevertheless ensure audio is high quality.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Solve a problem<\/h2>\n<p>Instagram video ads should <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/28\/pain-points\">identify a problem<\/a> and show how a particular product or service solves it.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/customer-pain-points-biggest-challenges-ppc-agencies.jpg\" alt=\"Customer pain points WordStream agency survey biggest challenges\" width=\"760\" height=\"452\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cBy identifying a problem your potential customers have, you&#8217;re creating an emotional bond with them, so they&#8217;re already intrigued with what you have to offer,\u201d said Tom Caulton, digital growth specialist at digital agency Dijitul. \u201cOnce you&#8217;ve got them hooked, show them how your product or service solves that problem.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>PS: We have a post for you if you&#8217;re looking for\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/05\/video-ad-ideas\">ideas for your video ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Focus on a single goal<\/h2>\n<p>Natalie Athanasiadis, head of digital at marketing agency Digital Visibility Group, said to focus on a central theme, topic and goal for each ad.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis could be brand awareness, product education or \u2018buy now\u2019 options,\u201d she said. \u201cJust don\u2019t try to incorporate all of this into the one ad because you will bombard your audience and they will just scroll past your ad.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>John Surdakowski, founder of digital agency Avex Designs, agreed to focus on one thing at a time.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf your video ad contains too many products or selling points, it will seem like a pitch,\u201d he said. \u201cTarget your customer base and c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/13\/video-ad-tools\">reate video content<\/a> tailored for them.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>5. Look less like an ad<\/h2>\n<p>Video ads should blend naturally into Instagram feeds for the best reception and not be overly self-promotional, Athanasiadis said.<\/p>\n<p>Surdakowski agreed advertisers should make sure video ads blend into feeds organically.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen users scroll through their feeds, you want to capture their attention,\u201d he said. \u201cPosting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/22\/instagram-tv\">video content<\/a> that brings value to the user is more likely to have engagement.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Q2UACm3ie-k?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Lloyd also recommended using drones to capture content that really wows audiences.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Shoot in the right dimensions<\/h2>\n<p>Unlike on Facebook, in-feed videos can\u2019t be enlarged to take up the whole phone screen on Instagram, so Voss said to recognize viewers will consume a video ad within an Instagram post. In Stories, however, the video\u00a0will\u00a0fill the entire screen but should be designed and filmed vertically.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe best ads are ones that fill the entire space,\u201d said Olumide Gbenro, founder of media marketing agency Globo Media Marketing. \u201cScrap the horizontal videos and have an editor format to 600&#215;600. This has an entirely different look and should catch the viewers attention even more.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Basis, however, recommended using a 1:1 aspect ratio of 1080&#215;1080 and 1080&#215;1920 for Stories.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Think about thumbnails early on<\/h2>\n<p>Elizabeth Venanzi, online marketing manager at marketing agency Sparq Designs, noted another difference with platforms like Facebook or YouTube, where advertisers can customize thumbnails. With Instagram ads, brands have to use thumbnails from videos.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-video-ad-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"thumbnails for instagram video ads\" width=\"677\" height=\"571\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cThis needs to be in your mind while you are shooting or preparing a video, as the thumbnail is the most important part of your Instagram video ad,\u201d she said. \u201cThe thumbnail will define whether or not someone turns on the volume to watch your ad, click on your post in the search section and ultimately end up on your profile. So save yourself the time and incorporate your desired thumbnail into your video.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>8. Optimize your landing page for mobile<\/h2>\n<p>If the call to action on a video ad leads to a landing page, the brand has to make sure these pages are optimized for mobile, Surdakowski said. Instagram is accessed overwhelmingly from mobile devices.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than tapping on \u2018Learn More,\u2019 and the page you\u2019re directed to is not optimized for the device you\u2019re on,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>Reuben Field, creative director of video production company Lights Camera Business, agreed advertisers will want consumers to easily be able to take the desired action from their mobile devices.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou lose your user as soon as you make this difficult in any way for them,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<h2>9. Use visual consistency<\/h2>\n<p>In addition, Jacobs said brands should keep the momentum going with supporting content that is aligned with the ad.<\/p>\n<p>Romney said the same is true for the ad as a whole.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis includes the colors, the style of video and the music involved in the video ad,\u201d she said. \u201cEach small component makes a significant impact on the video as a whole. If the message of the video does not line up with your brand identity, it will come off as inauthentic and users will scroll right past it.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>10. Add a clear call to action<\/h2>\n<p>Venanzi discouraged advertisers from using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/04\/instagram-videos\">Instagram video<\/a> ads as teasers as users are looking for content that can be quickly consumed, and tracking down a link in a bio requires a lot of effort.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-video-ad-cta.jpg\" alt=\"instagram call to action\" width=\"450\" height=\"641\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cYou should always simplify your call-to-action as much as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead of sending them from your video to your profile to a landing page, try incorporating the \u2018learn more\u2019 on your video advertisement and complete your entire message within the video advert. This will encourage interested viewers to learn more on your website, rather than have to go searching for your call-to-action.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>11. Test<\/h2>\n<p>According to Field, advertisers should create multiple versions of their Instagram video ads and A\/B test them to see which work best with their audiences.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-video-ads-tests.jpg\" alt=\"testing instagram video ads\" width=\"841\" height=\"350\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\">Via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.addmustard.com\/blog\/instagram-ads-testing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Add Mustard<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Nate Masterson, marketing manager for personal care company Maple Holistics, agreed advertisers should take advantage of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/21\/instagram-marketing-tools\">Instagram tools<\/a> to enhance results.<\/p>\n<p>And, beyond Instagram itself, Marcus Harjani, cofounder of data-centric web destination FameMoose, said to also track the user\u2019s path from ad to conversion.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is the experience like? Make sure it is a good experience and a user is headed toward conversion,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<h2>12. Wait until users are connected to WiFi<\/h2>\n<p>Lesya Lui, social media strategist at news site The Social Media Current, said to show the ads only to consumers connected to WiFi to avoid a subpar experience where videos slow to a crawl.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/wifi-on-instagram-video-ad-tips.png\" alt=\"guide to instagram video ads\" width=\"540\" height=\"506\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cPeople are very impatient and have so many distractions on social platforms, they won&#8217;t wait for your video ad to buffer and start playing,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<h2>13. Make loopable videos<\/h2>\n<p>Warren Jolly, CEO of digital marketing agency adQuadrant, said to create a video ad with loopability in mind, with fade-out video and music at the intro and outro.<\/p>\n<p>The longer your prospect spends with your video ad, the more likely the ad and your brand are to make an impression.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Here&#8217;s
