I&#8217;ve defined it here as a project executed to drive a specific action and carried out\u00a0through one or a variety of channels. For example, you might be run a giveaway marketing campaign and carry it\u00a0all out on social media. Or you might send out emails about it, write blog posts on it, have an influencer get the word out, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>Marketing campaigns are designed to drive a\u00a0specific goal, like <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/14\/increase-traffic-to-my-website\">increasing website traffic<\/a>, boosting sales on a particular product or service, or getting more people to try out a free tool.

Let&#8217;s take a look at some types of marketing campaigns you can run.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>1. Launch campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>For those of us who like to work for startups, you\u2019re probably familiar with the hustle of trying to get brand new launches in front of an audience\u2014whether for a new product, service, or feature.<\/p>\n<p>This is the perfect opportunity for a marketing campaign! Depending on the size of your launch, you may want a full-court press on all your marketing platforms. For launches in particular, think about including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Press release (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/04\/how-to-write-a-press-release\">Learn how to write a press release here!<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Press features or sponsorships<\/li>\n<li>Blog post written by stakeholders<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/16\/content-syndication\">Syndicated<\/a> content on LinkedIn or Medium<\/li>\n<li>Advertising campaigns on social platforms<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/23\/how-to-become-a-social-media-influencer\">Influencer<\/a> or network support<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/best-marketing-campaigns-apple-ipod.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"549\" alt=\"best marketing campaigns\u2014apple ipod launch\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>The iPod launch campaign\u00a0did so well, Apple still uses this type of imagery and copy for their wearables.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>For tips on this campaign type, check out <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/29\/how-to-promote-a-product\">12 Ways to Effectively\u00a0Promote a New Product or Service<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Sales promotion campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>Thinking about reducing the price of a service for a limited time only? Upgrading your bread-and-butter product? Sounds like a great time to market that through a time-limited marketing campaign.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/sales-promotion-examples-teacher-special.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"385\" alt=\"example of time limited marketing campaign sales promotion\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You\u2019ll need to communicate with your existing customers to update them about the discount or new UX, and you can try to leverage them to spread the word.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll need:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Email communication <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/21\/promotional-email-examples\">(promotional email examples here<\/a>).<\/li>\n<li>Blog post (depending on the duration of the campaign).<\/li>\n<li>Network support<\/li>\n<li>Shareable social media assets<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a list of<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/13\/sales-promotion-examples\"> sales promotions <\/a>you might use for a campaign like this.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Event marketing campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>Conferences are finally making a comeback! This hits close to home, as I am neck-deep in planning conference sponsorships, speaking sessions, and booth designs. Not to mention attending webinar after webinar on \u201chow to\u201d this and \u201chow to\u201d that.<\/p>\n<p>To make sure people attend your webinar, show up to your workshop, or\u00a0buy tickets to the conference you\u2019re holding, include some of these materials:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drip emails<\/li>\n<li>One-to-one outreach<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/19\/webinar-landing-pages\">Landing page<\/a> with registration form<\/li>\n<li>Shareable social assets<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/best-marketing-campaigns-traffic-summit.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"502\" alt=\"best marketing campaigns: example of event marketing campaign\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>A blast from the ol&#8217; WordStream past.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Need some event marketing ideas?

Lots of other marketing campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>Those are just three of the many types of marketing campaigns. The list goes on and on, depending on your goals, business circumstances, and what you define as a marketing campaign.<\/p>\n<p>For example, here are some more to consider:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reengagement marketing campaigns: <\/strong>to get dormant or former customers to come back.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Product or service-specifc marketing campaigns:<\/strong>\u00a0to promote an existing product or service that needs some extra love.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/24\/updating-google-ads-for-company-rebrand\">Rebranding<\/a> marketing campaigns:\u00a0<\/strong>Nothin&#8217; like showing your new makeover to the world.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Without further ado, let\u2019s get into some examples! You can use these to inspire your next marketing campaign, spark some creativity for the current one, or help you plan a roadmap.<\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">The best marketing campaigns we&#8217;ve seen and what we can learn from them<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">Below are five great examples of marketing campaigns done right. I&#8217;ll also talk about how you can apply them to your own campaigns.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>1. Two kinds of people (Apple)<\/h3>\n<p>Way back before the Mac was a &#8220;book&#8221; and when personal computers were a luxury, Apple launched the Lisa\u2014the first ever computer with a mouse. Their launch campaign included\u00a0\u00a0a TV commercial starring Kevin Costner.<\/p>\n<p>No, this was not the first <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/26\/influencer-marketing\">influencer marketing campaign<\/a>. In fact, this was a pre-fame Kev.<\/p>\n<p>And no, the Lisa never took off.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the script of this commercial that makes it such a hallmark campaign:\u00a0<em>&#8220;That&#8217;s why we make the most advanced personal computers in the world. And why soon, there may be two kinds of people: those who use computers and those who use Apples.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/best-marketing-campaigns-kevin-costner-apple.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"374\" alt=\"best marketing campaigns apple kevin costner\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=m515f5p5e1w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Watch the commercial here.<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Takeaway: stay committed to your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/31\/brand-voice\">brand voice<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As you can see, &#8220;Think different&#8221; may be Apple&#8217;s current<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/21\/advertising-slogans\"> marketing slogan<\/a>\u00a0but this has been their\u00a0messaging since the 80s.\u00a0 encompasses the history of their brand messaging.

Marketing Campaigns of 2021<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>2. Operation Santa (USPS)<\/h3>\n<p>I am fascinated by USPS. I\u00a0mean, how absolutely mind-boggling amazing is it that you can put a cheap, sticky paper onto an envelope, put it in a box outside your house, and it will MAGICALLY end up thousands of miles away?!<\/p>\n<p>But I digress. With Operation Santa, USPS encourages children to write letters to the &#8220;North Pole,&#8221; aka a collection center that posts pictures of the letters online. Participants can then read these letters and\u00a0answer one or many of the requests in the letter by mailing the child a package.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/best-marketing-campaigns-operation-santa-usps.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"308\" alt=\"best marketing campaigns: usps operation santa\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uspsoperationsanta.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>So while this marketing campaign helped to drive more business to USPS, it was\u00a0in a charitable manner that made\u00a0everyone feel good.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Takeaway: involve a third benefactor with your campaign<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All marketing campaigns are technically a win-win: your customers get the valuable offer you&#8217;re promoting, and you get their business. But with a charitable marketing campaign, you can go for a win-win-win. The third benefactor here\u2014children of underserved communities\u2014gives both USPS and its customers incentive to make the best of this marketing campaign. We all love buying products that also have a positive impact on our society.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/22\/cause-based-marketing\">Head here for more cause-related marketing campaign ideas.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>3. What Agnes Saw (Tokyo Olympic Games)<\/h3>\n<p>This inspiring commercial\u00a0features the oldest living Olympian (Agnes Keleti)\u00a0as well as several incredible Olympics moments that have occurred over her lifetime.\u00a0 &#8220;What Agnes Saw&#8221; represents her seeing the torch light\u00a0and the thousands of athletes just like her.<\/p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ArIftpnnR0c?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>If this doesn\u2019t tug at your heart strings or make you want to get up and do something, you might not have a heart. I\u2019m going to be honest, I had no plans on watching the Olympic games this year. Mostly because I don\u2019t have cable TV (as opposed to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/09\/what-ott-advertising\">OTT<\/a>). But after I stumbled upon Agnes\u2019s sweet memories, I stole a login to my parents\u2019 cable plan.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Takeaway: try a &#8220;look back&#8221; campaign that shows your achievements, challenges, or even mistakes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Olympics are an event unlike any other. And each year they are held is so different than the last; locations, cultures, geopolitical events, and athletes all influence the make-up of the games.<\/p>\n<p>What this marketing campaign from the Olympics shows us is how to embrace the different challenges and achievements. Don\u2019t shy away from where you\u2019ve been and celebrate where you\u2019re going.<\/p>\n<p>In practice, that means apologizing for any wrong doing and showing your customers how you are correcting it (<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/01\/psychology-copywriting-tips-examples\">acknowledging your mistakes has its benefits, you know<\/a>). Or maybe it is best illustrated in showing the generations of family that have worked to develop the perfect formula for your business.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Prime Day (Amazon)<\/h3>\n<p>In 2015, Amazon had their first Prime Day as a campaign to get more Amazon Prime subscribers. And oh boy, did it work. So well that they\u2019re still holding multiple days of Prime Day six years later.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/best-marketing-campaigns-prime-day.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"417\" alt=\"best marketing campaigns: amazon prime day\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Takeaway: offer a little something extra for loyalty<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you are a subscription-based business, take a page out of Amazon\u2019s book and offer your subscribers a little something extra for their <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/10\/customer-loyalty\">loyalty<\/a>. Something that will make their friends and family so jealous, they\u2019ll want to subscribe to your service as soon as they can.<\/p>\n<p>I always suggest free stuff, because people love free stuff. In fact, the gym I go to recently had a \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/gagestrengthtraining.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Member\u2019s Day<\/a>\u201d that focused on fun games and giveaways for their members. They even brewed a signature beer for the event!<\/p>\n<h3>5. Where are my Quays?<\/h3>\n<p>How could we not include an <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/digital-marketing\/influencer-marketing-tips\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">influencer marketing campaign<\/a> in here?\u00a0\u00a0And no, I\u2019m not going to mention a certain weight-loss gummy\/tea\/supplement\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Where are my Quays is the ultimate influencer campaign. Does anyone remember when Chrissy Teigen absolutely blew up Quay sunglasses in 2019?<\/p>\n<p>Everyone *had to have* a pair of these gigantic sunglasses after the comedian\/model\/John Legend\u2019s baby mama endorsed them through a series of commercials and social media plugs.<\/p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/-iFeW4M5zYM?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Great move, Quay. Although my child-sized face was unfortunately too small for any of their products, I too fell victim to the campaign. You can find my sunglasses on Poshmark, please take them off my hands.<\/p>\n<h4>Takeaway: seek out genuine endorsement<\/h4>\n<p>First of all,<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/18\/beginners-guide-to-target-markets\"> know your audience<\/a>. Who are you trying to reach? Who is in their sphere of influence? And how can you match the person within their sphere of influence with your product?<\/p>\n<p>Working with influencers isn\u2019t easy. But, in my experience, sometimes the right influencer will fall in your lap (aka send you an email pitch). You want someone who loves your product as much as you do, because genuine endorsement can\u2019t be faked.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the best marketing campaigns you&#8217;ve seen?<\/h2>\n<p>While these are just some of my favorite marketing campaigns, it\u2019s certainly not an exhaustive list.
