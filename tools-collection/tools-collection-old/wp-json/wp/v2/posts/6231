Don\u2019t worry about SEO, conversion rate optimization, any of that, just <strong>create great content<\/strong>!<\/p>\n<p>But what does that really mean? What makes content great, and what exactly is \u201ccontent\u201d anyway?<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s my definition: <strong>\u201cContent\u201d is really just information<\/strong> \u2013 really, simple as that! When you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/13\/content-creation\">create content<\/a>, you\u2019re putting information on your site. Some of it is intended to teach, some of it is intended to persuade, some of it is intended to entertain. And <strong>great content is information that succeeds at teaching, persuading or entertaining your visitors while also helping you meet your business goals<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>To make this all a little more concrete, here are eight traits \u2013 all words that end in \u201cable\u201d \u2013 you should strive to embody with your content. If your content meets all or even most of these standards, you\u2019re off to a great start!<\/p>\n<h2><strong>1. Great Content Is Findable<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Your beautifully written content is utterly worthless if nobody knows it exists. (Unless you\u2019re Emily Dickinson \u2013 are you hoping to be discovered after you\u2019re dead?)<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/emily-dickinson-great-content-1.jpg\" alt=\"Emily Dickinson writes great content\" width=\"300\" height=\"261\" \/><\/div>\n<p><em>Emily D: hardly the poster child for SEO<\/em><\/p>\n<p>So those gurus I quoted earlier who tell you to forget about SEO and just focus on greatness? They\u2019re lying. <strong>Good SEO is part of what will make your content great<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Really, your content should be findable in at least two ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>From inside your site<\/strong> \u2013 If someone is already surfing around your site, they should be able to find your latest and greatest.<\/li>\n<li><strong>From outside your site<\/strong> \u2013 That almost always means via a search engine. People who don\u2019t even know you or your website exist should be able to find your content through a Google search.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>The best way to achieve search findability is to align your content with a highly relevant keyword<\/strong>. Then <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/18\/content-optimization\">optimize your content<\/a> for that keyword. For more help with that process, check out: <strong><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/11\/14\/how-to-rank-for-a-keyword\">How to Rank for a Keyword in 10 Steps<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>As for those people who are already on your site, here are some tips for making your content more discoverable:<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Optimize your information architecture<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Individual pieces of content are easier to find when they\u2019re sorted within a well organized site. (As a bonus, Google tends to favor well organized sites too.) Have a site map that gives visitors an overview of your organization. Use <a href=\"http:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/2009\/03\/17\/breadcrumbs-in-web-design-examples-and-best-practices-2\/\">breadcrumbs<\/a> and\/or a left navigation menu to show visitors where they are within the organization of your site. Here\u2019s Amazon\u2019s left nav for example:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/amazon-left-nav-findable-content-1.png\" alt=\"content architecture\" width=\"1032\" height=\"712\" \/><\/div>\n<p>These design elements\u00a0increase visibility of your other, related content pieces and make it easy for visitors to move up a level or down a level in the content hierarchy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/level-up-great-content-1.jpg\" alt=\"great content guide\" width=\"480\" height=\"320\" \/><\/div>\n<p><em>Level up, Mario!<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Include a search function on your site<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This is a no-brainer \u2013 visitors might want to see if you\u2019ve covered a certain topic, or want to relocate something on your site that they\u2019ve read in the past. A search function makes it easy.<\/p>\n<p>(You may have noticed the glaring lack of a search box on the WordStream site. I\u2019m not happy about it either.)<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Have a \u201cbest of\u201d sidebar<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Show off your most popular content so it <em>stays<\/em> popular. A great way to do this is with a little sidebar module that shows your blog readers, for example, your top blog posts, like this one on the Moz blog:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/great-content-popular-posts-1.png\" alt=\"Great Content Sidebar\" width=\"780\" height=\"478\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This makes your site more \u201csticky,\u201d meaning people are more likely to stick around and read more.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Promote new content<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/26\/content-promotion\">Content promotion<\/a> is a huge part of content success. When you create new content, promote it on your home page or other highly trafficked pages. Consider sending out an email blast to your list. The more people who know your content is out there, the more people are likely to read it, love it, share it, act on it.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>2. Great Content Is Shareable<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>This is another two-parter\u2014shareable content meets two criteria:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>People want to share it<\/strong> \u2013 When people find truly great content, they want to sing it from the rooftops, or at least put it on Facebook.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It\u2019s easy to share<\/strong> \u2013 The first part is making something that people want to share, the second part is making it super easy for them to do that.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The folks at Upworthy are experts in getting people to share their content. A while back I gleaned some tips for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/01\/15\/viral-content-marketing-tips\">maximizing your content\u2019s viral potential<\/a> based on a great slidedeck from Upworthy. Read the whole thing, but here are the basics of shareable content:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Start with something truly awesome<\/strong> \u2013 Would YOU want to share it? If you\u2019re embarrassed to tell your coworkers what you just posted on the blog, start over, it\u2019s not good enough.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Spend more time on \u201cframing\u201d <\/strong>\u2013 That means the headline, the \u201cshare text,\u201d the lead image, etc. \u2013 the stuff that shows up on Facebook. Think in terms of funnels \u2013 the more people that see your headline and feel intrigued, the more of them are going to click and read, maximizing the potential of <em>them<\/em> sharing it with <em>their<\/em> networks, and so on.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use handy-dandy social sharing tools<\/strong> \u2013 Hovering share buttons, \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/clicktotweet.com\/\">Click to Tweet<\/a>\u201d tweetables, a big fat pop-up that says \u201cShare this, homie!\u201d Do what you have to do, within reason, to encourage your readers to share your stuff.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I\u2019m way more likely to tweet out an article if there\u2019s a button that makes it stupid-simple for me.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/great-shareable-content-tips-1.png\" alt=\"Great Content Is Shareable\" width=\"680\" height=\"522\" \/><\/div>\n<p><em>Scroll all you want, that sucker\u2019s not going anywhere<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If I have to actually copy and paste both the headline and link into a tweet compose box, ugh \u2013 your content has to be 3-5 times more awesome for that.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>3. Great Content Is Usable<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>\u201cUsability\u201d is key in design, whether you\u2019re talking about an online tool or a fork. And great content needs to be usable too \u2013 that is to say, <strong>it should be easy for people to consume your information<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re starting with a well-designed, highly usable website in the first place, any content you layer on top is going to be more usable too. But you also need to think about it at the level of each piece of content. This is especially true if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Your content is some kind of interactive tool<\/strong> \u2013 Tools are content! Apps are content! But people won\u2019t use them if they\u2019re not easy to use, so do user testing and take feedback seriously. Make sure they work across multiple browsers, environments, etc.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There\u2019s some kind of action you want people to take<\/strong> \u2013 That action might be as simple as sharing the content (see above). Or you might want them to provide an email address, or click a button to donate some money, or make a purchase. This is where <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/07\/11\/landing-page-conversion-rate-guide\">conversion rate optimization<\/a> comes in.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example of the tool as content \u2013 the online stopwatch.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/online-stopwatch-usable-content-1.png\" alt=\"Great Content Tools\" width=\"473\" height=\"143\" \/><\/div>\n<p>I was about to complain that the tool could be bigger when I noticed that you can change the size:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/stopwatch-2-1.png\" alt=\"usable content\" width=\"1438\" height=\"616\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Usability hack! That&#8217;s more like it.<\/p>\n<p>Other stuff to worry about from a usability perspective \u2013 how does your site work on mobile devices? Do you have a loading speed problem?<\/p>\n<p>What if we\u2019re talking about a regular old article? How do you make <em>that<\/em> usable? That brings us to our next able word.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>4. Great Content Is\u00a0Readable <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/04\/seo-content-readability\">Readability<\/a> is essentially usability for text. This idea encompasses both good design and good writing.<\/p>\n<p>From a design perspective, readable content is <strong>easy on the eyes<\/strong>. So think about readability factors like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Font size<\/strong> (We recently increased our blog\u2019s font size after some readers complained that our \u201cgreat content\u201d was too hard to read)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Text and background color<\/strong> (Think red on black would look cool? Think again)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Column width<\/strong> (Too wide and readers lose their place when they move back to the left margin)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Leading <\/strong>(<a href=\"http:\/\/www.webdesignerdepot.com\/2012\/06\/leading-space-is-just-as-important-as-words\/\">Leading<\/a> is the vertical space between lines \u2013 not too tight)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As far as writing goes, know that writing for the web is a specialized skill. My list of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/02\/19\/content-marketing-skills\">50 things every content marketer should know<\/a> includes plenty of tips for making your content more readable, but here are a few to get you started:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lists<\/strong> \u2013 It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 but it\u2019s true, people love lists \u2013 it\u2019s because they\u2019re easy to process. Consider lists both as a structure for your whole article (this one is a list of 8) as well as a way to increase readability within your article \u2013 notice all the bullet lists on this page?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Scannable chunks<\/strong> \u2013 Another able word! Break your text up into as many chunks as possible, so it\u2019s easier for web readers to scan. That means bullet lists, headings and subheadings, use of bold text and pop-out quotes, etc. Give the eyes something to latch onto.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Clarity and concision <\/strong>\u2013 These two C words are a copywriter\u2019s best friends. Aim for concision at the level of the sentence \u2013 there is nothing wrong with long-form content if every sentence conveys valuable information. Just don\u2019t ramble. To increase your clarity levels, never write anything you\u2019d feel weird saying out loud. Write like you talk (but with better grammar).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>5. Great Content Is Memorable<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Great content doesn\u2019t just amuse you for 2 minutes and then disappear from your mind. It should stick with you, making you more likely to revisit it and recommend it to friends or colleagues. You can make your content more memorable by making sure it answers the &#8220;So what?&#8221; question, or by creating <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/19\/contrarian-content-marketing\">contrarian content<\/a> that doesn&#8217;t just parrot what everyone else is already saying.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to illustrate this one by way of example. Here are a few pieces of great content that I\u2019ve remembered because they were so striking, unusual, or just excellently executed that I couldn\u2019t get them out of my mind. (Note that my picks are influenced by my being a woman; YMMV.)<\/p>\n<h3><strong>25 Ways to Wear a Scarf<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I think I first saw this video when Joanna Lord tweeted it. (Videos are content!) I immediately emailed it to my mom, and that weekend, my friend Katie and I watched it again and tried to re-create some of these styles (not always with success). It\u2019s just awesome \u2013 she\u2019s so cute and the way it\u2019s edited (the split screens, the sped up and slowed down parts) keeps you watching:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"videos\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_video\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"8cf89caf-a075-4c3d-8ea1-cba68639aa2f\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/5LYAEz777AU?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>You can create your own video content with helpful how-to videos or\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/13\/explainer-videos\">explainer videos<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>10 Charts About Sex<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I picked a random example from OkTrends \u2013 OkCupid\u2019s blog \u2013 but seriously, every post they ever published was both awesome and memorable. I say published, in the past tense, wiping away a tear, because they haven\u2019t put up a new post since <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.okcupid.com\/index.php\/10-charts-about-sex\/\">this one in April 2011<\/a>. But\u00a0I\u2019m sure they\u2019re still getting plenty of traffic for these content marketing gems, full of charming, witty, sexy data analysis (yes, data can be sexy!) on OkCupid\u2019s user base. Like this graph:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/memorable-great-content-chart-1.png\" alt=\"Creating Great Content\" width=\"480\" height=\"550\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As they put it, \u201cthe more your parents are paying for your education, the more horny you are.\u201d (Maybe because those Ivy Leaguers don&#8217;t have to work a job and study for class at the same time, sort of frees up the imagination\u00a0&#8230; go figure.)<\/p>\n<h3><strong>In Which We Teach You How to Be a Woman in Any Boy\u2019s Club<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>I love <a href=\"http:\/\/thisrecording.com\/today\/2011\/2\/22\/in-which-we-teach-you-how-to-be-a-woman-in-any-boys-club.html\">this article by Molly Lambert<\/a> from 2011, a manifesto\/rulebook for women in male-dominated environments (ahem! SEO). Basically, Molly Lambert said what needed to be said. It\u2019s shareable \u2013 I have shared it many times. It\u2019s readable \u2013 see how it\u2019s broken up into scannable sections with subheads? With pretty yet interesting (relevant, but not obvious) pictures? It\u2019s memorable, or it wouldn\u2019t be in this list \u2013 memorable because it\u2019s unique (I\u2019ve never seen another article quite like this) and beautifully executed (it\u2019s fierce and fearless). It\u2019s also quotable (see next section!) \u2013 here are some memorable quotes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Megan Fox Syndrome, aka Wendy from Peter Pan. It is the delusion that you can become an official part of the boys&#8217; club if you are its strictest enforcer, its most useful prole.<\/li>\n<li>Some conversations are uncomfortable but also necessary. They are so uncomfortable because they are so necessary.<\/li>\n<li>The only men who are turned off by ambition and success are men that are insecure about their own talents and success or lack thereof.<\/li>\n<li>Whatever you look like, it will be used against you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Etc. Etc.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>6. Great Content Is Quotable <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>One element of great web writing is <strong>the soundbite<\/strong>. Some writers are particularly great at this \u2013 almost every sentence in an article is full of biting wit and under 140 characters. (That can actually get pretty annoying.) The thing about quotable content is that it\u2019s both more memorable and more sharable. See how these able words are all working together now?<\/p>\n<p>Here are some tips for writing more quotable content:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read more<\/strong> \u2013 The best way to become a better writer is to read good writing. Learn by absorption. Copy people you admire until you \u201cfind your own voice.\u201d (Most likely, you won\u2019t be able to copy them exactly anyway; you\u2019re not an impressionist.) And if you write for the web, don\u2019t just read books and print mags \u2013 read blogs and websites.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Work on concision<\/strong> \u2013 Allow me to quote myself, because I said this in the readability section too. Clarity and concision are your buddies! If none of the sentences in your content are tweet-size, put down the Henry James novel and use the period key more often.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Be funny <\/strong>\u2013 People like to quote the laugh lines. If you\u2019re funny in real life, you can be funny in writing. If you\u2019re not funny in real life, try something else \u2013 be wise. Be brilliant. Be poignant.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Tell readers what to quote<\/strong> \u2013 If you know you\u2019ve come up with a good line, put it in bold text or pop it out. Make sure people see it! Don\u2019t bury your treasure.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Avoid cliches<\/strong> \u2013 You want your readers to be quoting <em>you<\/em>, not the same <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/04\/marketing-cliches\">familiar marketing cliches<\/a> we&#8217;ve all heard a billion times before.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>7. Great Content Is Actionable <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As a business, one of the reasons you\u2019re creating content is to position yourself as an authority. If you can step up and help people when they need your help, they\u2019ll thank you for your expertise, and they\u2019ll trust you more in the future and be more likely to return to your site. (And maybe buy your stuff!)<\/p>\n<p>If we\u2019re talking about informational content (the kind you find using <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/12\/10\/three-types-of-search-queries\">informational search queries<\/a>), the most helpful content is actionable content. That means people read it and think, \u201cHey! I could do that! I\u2019m going to do it right now, in fact.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/great-content-is-actionable-ostrich-1.jpg\" alt=\"Great Content Ostrich\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Actionable content gives people something to act on. Here are a couple of examples:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2011\/02\/16\/symbols-in-ppc-ads\">Using Symbols to Get an 89% Lift in Conversions<\/a> \u2013 It\u2019s one thing to say \u201cWrite better ads, they get higher CTR.\u201d It\u2019s another to make a very specific recommendation that people can actually do without having to think too hard. This post shares some data on the power of symbols (like a registered trademark symbol) when it comes to lifting click-through rate. Read article, add symbols, get higher CTR, boom boom boom.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/unbounce.com\/landing-pages\/5-headline-formulas\/\">5 Landing Page Headline Formulas You Can Test Today<\/a> \u2013 Again, just telling people to write better headlines for their landing pages isn\u2019t actionable; it\u2019s vague. What is \u201cbetter\u201d? How do you do that? This post from Unbounce offers actual formulas with lots of examples to get you rolling. And notice how the title of the post sells how actionable it is!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>8. Great Content Is Reportable<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Remember, way back about 2,500 words ago, when I said that great content helps you meet your business goals? Well, you can\u2019t know if content is doing that unless you make sure it\u2019s reportable.<\/p>\n<p>Every time you create a piece of content, have a goal in mind. Most of the time you\u2019ll have multiple, overlapping goals. <strong>Bake reportability into your content<\/strong> so you\u2019ll be able to tell if it\u2019s meeting those goals, which might include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Traffic<\/strong> \u2013 The absolute easiest metric to track. Usually not super valuable in and of itself \u2013 it\u2019s what you do with that traffic that matters.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Engagement <\/strong>\u2013 We look at a number of engagement metrics including social shares (that clicky sidebar tells us how many tweets, likes, etc. we have), number of comments, time on page (moving to more <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/05\/longform-content\">long-form content increased our average time on site<\/a>!), and bounce rate. We want our visitors to really dig into our stuff, not just click, scan, and click away.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Conversions <\/strong>\u2013 Conversion tracking is trickier than just tracking traffic, but it\u2019s worth the trouble so you know what kind of content helps you drive leads and sales, not just page views.
