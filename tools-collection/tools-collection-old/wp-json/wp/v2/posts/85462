This is a longer-term strategy to grow your audience, build trust with your readers, and ultimately inspire loyalty to your brand.<\/p>\n<p>Now, does content marketing sometimes point you toward an action? Absolutely.

This is a common role on a marketing team, where the copywriter will support any or all <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/26\/marketing-channels\">marketing channels<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also a common role in an advertising agency, where the copywriter will work with clients to produce copy. This copy may include captions or taglines for a photo or even scripts for a video. But it\u2019s most likely that the copywriter\u2019s contribution is the writing, not the vision or the visuals.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/copywriting-example-petcarewebp.webp\" alt=\"example of copywritten and designed petcare ad\" width=\"821\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/copywriting-example-petcarewebp.webp 821w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/copywriting-example-petcarewebp-480x351.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 821px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The adorable ad concept?

This copy appears everywhere, in print media, across social media, on the Google SERP, even on the radio or TV. The goal is always the same: to get your attention, capture your interest, and convince you to act.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Website copy:<\/strong> Website copywriting appears on the homepage, the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/about-us-page-examples-and-tips\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">about page<\/a>, the product pages, the side bars, the navigation bars, and even the footer. The goal here is usually to direct the visitor to engage further, whether it\u2019s to sign up for a newsletter, click to a deeper page, or fill out a form.<\/li>\n<li><strong>SEO copywriting: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/seo-content-beginners-guide\">Writing copy for SEO<\/a> involves optimizing headlines, subtitles, and metadata with the goal of having the page rank of the SERP.<\/li>\n<li><strong>PR copywriting: <\/strong>The goal of any PR copy in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/04\/how-to-write-a-press-release\">press release<\/a>, announcement, or even campaign blurb, is to get media to cover your story, whether it\u2019s traditional print journalists, digital coverage, or even influencer spots.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Email marketing copy: <\/strong>When you\u2019re writing email copy, you might have different actions as your goal for each piece. The goal for your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/email-subject-lines-for-sales\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">subject line<\/a> is to encourage opens, but the goal for the email copy might be to download a guide or even forward the email.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Social media copywriting: <\/strong>Writing for social media involves drafting posts, optimizing bios, and creating captions. The goal of social media copywriting might be to follow your profile, go to the website, or click a link to view content or even check out your product.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Direct response copy: <\/strong>This comes up in ecommerce a lot.

We talk about this a lot with social media, since it\u2019s an easy example: You wouldn\u2019t write the same copy for LinkedIn and TikTok, because they\u2019re different platforms.<\/p>\n<p>Still, there are some things that can make any copywriting stronger and more effective. Here are the essential elements of all great copywriting:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Be clear<\/h3>\n<p>Clarity is so important. Sometimes it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the process of creation. You need to write taglines for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/29\/how-to-promote-a-product\">product launch<\/a>. You fill out ad copy for a Facebook ads campaign. This is especially true when you have too much to write, too much to do\u2014which is often the case when you\u2019re a marketing team of one or you\u2019re running your own small business.<\/p>\n<p>But when you\u2019re writing that copy, remember that you\u2019re communicating with your audience. They should be able to understand not only what you\u2019re saying, but also what you\u2019re asking of them. Take these two Facebook ads from Supergoop, for example.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/copywriting-example-supergoop-glowscreen.webp\" alt=\"example of facebook ad copywriting for glowscreen from supergoop\" width=\"650\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85514\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/copywriting-example-supergoop-glowscreen.webp 650w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/copywriting-example-supergoop-glowscreen-480x442.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/copywriting-example-supergoop.webp\" alt=\"example of facebook ad copywriting for supergoop\" width=\"648\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85515\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/copywriting-example-supergoop.webp 648w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/copywriting-example-supergoop-480x444.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 648px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The copy in the first ad is so much better because it\u2019s clearer. \u201cDiscover\u201d gets me to a fun new beauty product way quicker than the language in the second ad. Plus, making room on my shelf sounds like a chore. Avoid that kind of confusion and ambiguity.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Write within the limits<\/h3>\n<p>Your copy will be stronger if you\u2019re writing with the constraints and context of its place in mind. That\u2019s because you\u2019ll be able to know how much space you have to get creative\u2014we\u2019ll spend more time on this soon\u2014and how efficiently you need to convey your message. The context will also let you know what else your audience is looking at.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, if they\u2019re on your website, they\u2019re seeing your other page copy or pop-ups. But if they\u2019re on social media, they\u2019re seeing ads from other brands and content from friends and creators. And if they\u2019re on the SERP, they\u2019re seeing your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/competitors-ads\">competitors<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So make sure this context is top of mind while you\u2019re drafting.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Know your audience<\/h3>\n<p>This is so important, even though it seems like common sense: You need to know who you are writing to to persuade them into action. So get to know your audience.<\/p>\n<p>If your brand has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/25\/buyer-persona-examples\">buyer personas<\/a>, make sure you\u2019re familiar with them. If your company has customer interviews or spotlights, keep up with these. The demographic information is useful, so you can glean basic interest. The motivations and pain points, though\u2014these are more useful.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a great example from the formula company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hibobbie.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bobbie&#8217;s<\/a> homepage.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/copywriting-example-bobbie.webp\" alt=\"copywriting example from bobbie\" width=\"855\" height=\"430\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85516\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/copywriting-example-bobbie.webp 855w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/copywriting-example-bobbie-480x241.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 855px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The tagline appeals to a common ground with parents: \u201cOur babies made us do it.\u201d The language is casual but confident, with \u201cmom-led\u201d prominent and a well-placed \u201cdamn\u201d in the parenthetical. These hints make the visitor want to learn more about the founders and how they started this company. It encourages you to click that button and read the story. As a new mom myself, and part of the target demo, I can confirm that this is motivating. Reader, I read the story, then I bought the formula.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Get creative with language<\/h3>\n<p>Copy should encourage an action, but that doesn\u2019t mean it needs to be explicit or, worse, boring. You want to grab your reader\u2019s attention because this will make encouraging that action more effective.<\/p>\n<p>So take a look at great <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/03\/copywriting-examples\">copywriting examples<\/a> for inspiration, and then start drafting. Choose your words intentionally to surprise your readers. Use humor if that works for your brand. Include wordplay to entertain your readers and let them in on the joke. Be sure to keep your audience in mind here, too. Writing and editing tool <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Grammarly<\/a> does this really well with its punny use of \u201cword\u201d in its website headline.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/copywriting-example-grammarly.webp\" alt=\"copywriting example from grammarly\" width=\"850\" height=\"401\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85517\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/copywriting-example-grammarly.webp 850w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/copywriting-example-grammarly-480x226.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 850px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>5. Appeal to emotions<\/h3>\n<p>People make decisions based on emotions, and this is important for your business. <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2015\/11\/the-new-science-of-customer-emotions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Harvard Business Review<\/a> research shows that customers with an emotional connection to a brand will actually represent more value to the company.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/emotional-connection-copywriting.webp\" alt=\"chart showing the value of emotional copywriting\" width=\"292\" height=\"565\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85519\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/emotional-connection-copywriting.webp 292w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/emotional-connection-copywriting-155x300.webp 155w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 292px) 100vw, 292px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Use this for your copywriting.

Keep it concise<\/h3>\n<p>Copywriting is often a practice in doing more with less. Taglines for image or video-heavy ads don\u2019t leave much space, and ads on search and social have strict limits. That\u2019s why keeping it concise and to the point is key.<\/p>\n<p>Even when you have the space for more context and more explanation, less is more. Take this full-page magazine ad, for example.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/copywriting-example-chex.webp\" alt=\"copywriting example from chex\" width=\"459\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85520\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/copywriting-example-chex.webp 459w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/copywriting-example-chex-230x300.webp 230w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 459px) 100vw, 459px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is an old ad for a Chex cereal. Two-thirds of the page contains images of a woman about to eat a spoonful and a picture of the box to make sure it\u2019s easy to spot in the grocery aisle. The copy takes up about a third of the page, but much of this is white space. The copy is almost exclusively exclamations. Some of them are one word, including my personal favorite: \u201cYum-m-m-mmm!\u201d This ad gets the idea across\u2014people love this new flavor of Chex\u2014in about 20 words (this is a form of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/bandwagon-advertising\">bandwagon advertising<\/a>). Short and sweet.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Tell a story<\/h3>\n<p>We crave stories. Neuroscientists have found that reading fiction and engaging with narratives, offers a full sensory experience in our brains, and the immersive experience helps foster an emotional connection.<\/p>\n<p>Creating this emotional connection by using stories helps make the audience more invested in the outcome and more likely to remember your ad. That\u2019s why using a narrative\u2014or the implication of a narrative\u2014in your copy is effective.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an ad that captures a story in just a few lines. This is an advertisement for Australian tourism that ran after travel opened up after the pandemic lockdowns. The copy references this lightly by including a \u201cWelcome Back,\u201d and even in the tagline about saving the \u201cfirst\u201d look. This, of course, is that \u201cfirst\u201d look after the country\u2019s tourism reopened.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/copywriting-example-australia.webp\" alt=\"tourism copywriting example\" width=\"847\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85521\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/copywriting-example-australia.webp 847w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/copywriting-example-australia-480x339.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 847px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>8.

Open AI\u2019s Chat GPT works for generating captions, website copy, or even taglines, or you can use a tool like Copy.ai that is specifically created for sales and marketing.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/copyai-copywriting-example.webp\" alt=\"example of copywriting prompt output from copy.ai\" width=\"883\" height=\"514\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85523\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/copyai-copywriting-example.webp 883w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/copyai-copywriting-example-480x279.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 883px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>An example prompt and output from Copy.ai. Not perfect (those ? should be emoji), but it\u2019s a start.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Now, let\u2019s be clear: Don\u2019t type in an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-prompts\">AI prompt<\/a> to create taglines or generate Facebook ads and call it a day. Regardless of what some AI proponents might say, the output is a starting point. It\u2019s a way to avoid a blank page so you can shape, edit, and rewrite, or use for inspiration for new versions. But it\u2019s a great first step that way.<\/p>\n<p>And speaking of editing your copy brings us to our next tip.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Proofread your copy<\/h3>\n<p>Your copy should be error-free. This might seem like we\u2019re being sticklers, but it\u2019s important. Not only for your copy, but for your business.<\/p>\n<p>In a survey of 1,800 people, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tidio.com\/blog\/common-grammar-mistakes\/\">Tidio<\/a> found that grammar and spelling errors can have a real impact on your brand\u2014and even your revenue. Over 50% of respondents shared that grammar mistakes ruin a company\u2019s professional image. 35% said that grammatical errors can impact the company\u2019s credibility.<\/p>\n<p>The good news is that this is an avoidable risk. Take the extra time to proofread your copy before finalizing it.<\/p>\n<h3>11. Test and optimize<\/h3>\n<p>The best way to improve your copy is to, well, keep improving it. Whenever possible, set up <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/11\/25\/copy-testing\">copy testing<\/a> to A\/B test your copy to determine which versions perform better. You can do this with your Google Search Ads, with website copy, and even social ads. Once you get feedback, make changes to continue optimizing. Then make sure to remember what works\u2014and use that.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/ad-copywriting-example.webp\" alt=\"example of google ads copywriting\" width=\"637\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85524\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/ad-copywriting-example.webp 637w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/ad-copywriting-example-480x452.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 637px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Leveling up from copywriting 101<\/h2>\n<p>We covered all the copywriting basics here: what copywriting is, who copywriters are, which types of copywriting are, and how to make your copywriting even better.
