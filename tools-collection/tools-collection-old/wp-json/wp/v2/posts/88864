Maybe you\u2019re just starting a new campaign and don\u2019t have any performance history to go off of. Perhaps you have low conversion volume and Google\u2019s machine learning can never really detect any patterns, or you\u2019re low on budget and need to find a way to keep costs low. These are all examples of times you could try manual CPC <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/17\/google-ads-bid-management\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bidding in Google Ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>No matter the reason, if you are going to be using manual CPC, this post is for you.<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-manual-bidding-mistakes-irregular-performance-reviews\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Irregular performance reviews<\/h3>\n<p>One of the first problems we see with most accounts using manual CPC is that they don\u2019t have a regular review process. It seems like every once in a while it crosses the manager\u2019s mind to check bids, but sometimes the next review is a week later, other times it\u2019s a month later, then maybe a couple days.<\/p>\n<p>Without a regular cadence of reviews, it\u2019s hard to consistently see better performance from your ads.<\/p>\n<p>The change history you see below isn\u2019t uncommon when we review a manual CPC campaign.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistake.webp\" alt=\"google ads manual bidding mistakes - change history screenshot\" width=\"754\" height=\"409\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88968 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistake.webp 754w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistake-480x260.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 754px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Looking from the bottom up in the left-hand column, changes for this keyword were made twice on February 14th, then only again on July 5th.<\/p>\n<p>However, I\u2019m talking about the timing of reviews, not changes. Not every keyword needs a bid change on every review. It could be very well likely that this keyword only needed changing twice in a handful of months.<\/p>\n<p>The reason this stands out is due to the degree of changes (which we\u2019ll get to in a little bit). If the CPC was pulled down drastically from $7.19 to $1.31, that tells me that it probably wasn\u2019t performing well for all those months between February and July and that more regular reviews could have helped keep this keyword more profitable.<\/p>\n<p>Having a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-calendar\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">regimented calendar<\/a> of changes makes it more likely you\u2019ll see good performance and makes it easier to follow since it\u2019s already laid out.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example of a cadence that I like to do:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-audit.webp\" alt=\"google ads manual bidding mistakes - example bid review cadence \" width=\"829\" height=\"337\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88965 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-audit.webp 829w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-audit-480x195.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 829px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When conducting these reviews, I\u2019m focusing on a few main areas:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistakes-audit.webp\" alt=\"google ads manual bidding mistakes - audit indicators\" width=\"816\" height=\"333\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88982 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistakes-audit.webp 816w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistakes-audit-480x196.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 816px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Let\u2019s start with an example<\/strong> of a weekly review and say my target CPA is $100.<\/p>\n<p>Every Monday, I\u2019ll log into an account and look at the keyword performance for the last week. There, I\u2019m looking for the three categories above:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Strong Performers:<\/strong> Keywords with CPAs below $100.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Low Performers:<\/strong> Converting keywords with CPA over $100.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Outliers:<\/strong> Keywords with extremely high CPAs (likely 3x the CPA target) or high spend and no conversions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I\u2019ll then adjust the keyword bids based on the performance I\u2019m seeing and make any larger changes to the outlier keywords to try and bring them back in line. That could include pulling back on budget, adding <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/negative-keywords\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">negative keywords<\/a>, or many other things.<\/p>\n<p>The benefit of a process like this is twofold. It\u2019s easy to keep a weekly check-in when the task falls on the same day of the week. In my example, that was Monday. Secondly, keywords are being regularly reviewed and adjusted to hit performance goals.<\/p>\n<p>But you\u2019ll notice that weekly isn\u2019t the only cadence I have. I also have line items for monthly and quarterly reviews.<\/p>\n<p>These can also be done on the same Monday, but the lookback window and degree of your bid changes will change compared to the weekly review. Let\u2019s take each of these separately as they\u2019re two more issues I regularly see with manual CPC campaigns.<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-manual-bidding-mistakes-incorrect-lookback-windows\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Incorrect lookback windows<\/h3>\n<p>The challenge when reviewing performance regularly is to always make sure you have the right lookback window in use.<\/p>\n<p>If you were to launch a keyword on July 15, and then have weekly check-ins based on the data since launch, your timeline might look like the image below.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistake-lookback-window.webp\" alt=\"google ads manual bidding mistakes - timeline for review\" width=\"832\" height=\"304\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88983 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistake-lookback-window.webp 832w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistake-lookback-window-480x175.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 832px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The problem is, when you make adjustments on those windows, it\u2019s actually going to look a little more like the following, with the performance data from the first week being included in 3 different rounds of bid adjustments.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistake-window.webp\" alt=\"google ads manual bidding mistakes - timeline\" width=\"816\" height=\"316\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88964 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistake-window.webp 816w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistake-window-480x186.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 816px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Instead, we should be looking for these short-term weekly reviews to be mutually exclusive of each other. Once you make your bid changes on July 22 based on the first week of data, you shouldn\u2019t be including that data in your weekly reviews (until we get to longer-term analysis). The bid changes on 7\/29 should only include the performance data from July 22 on so you\u2019re only evaluating how the current bids perform compared to your targets.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistake-short-term-review.webp\" alt=\"google ads manual bidding mistakes - short-term bid review example\" width=\"961\" height=\"327\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88984 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistake-short-term-review.webp 961w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistake-short-term-review-480x163.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 961px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This way, on a weekly basis, you\u2019re moving your keyword bids up and down based on how a keyword is performing with that given bid and not discounting or enhancing its performance with past data.<\/p>\n<p>The easiest rule of thumb: look back to when you did the last review. Weekly looks back a week. Monthly looks back a month. And so on.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-by-day.webp\" alt=\"google ads manual bidding - lookback window\" width=\"631\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88970 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-by-day.webp 631w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-by-day-480x456.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 631px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Technically, the monthly and quarterly reviews will overlap with the weekly changes you\u2019re making, but that brings us to the next mistake we see.<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-manual-bidding-poor-bid-adjustments\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Poor degrees of bid adjustment<\/h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s quickly revisit the example we started off this post with.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistake-change-history.webp\" alt=\"google ads manual bidding mistakes - change history screenshot\" width=\"731\" height=\"418\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88981 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistake-change-history.webp 731w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistake-change-history-480x274.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 731px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The two bottom line items are for February 14th and the bid went from $2.85 to $7.19. That\u2019s a 152% increase in one day. On the way back down, going from $7.19 to $1.31 is an 82% decrease. Personally, those swings are just too large for me. I\u2019d like to see something a little more conservative.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Quick side note: <\/strong>I\u2019ve always been a fan of changing bids by percentage rather than a flat amount. If your bids are $10, then it might make sense to raise or lower the bid by $1 based on recent performance. But for someone only bidding $1, another $1 one way or the other could either be a doubling or flatlining of the bid. Percentages are always your best friend with this as they scale with you and can fit into any account.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at the following image again. We have review layers for weekly, monthly, and quarterly, and as I mentioned above, monthly and quarterly reviews will overlap with weekly adjustments, but the degrees of changes here should be relative to the date range we\u2019re looking at.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistakes-reviews.webp\" alt=\"google ads manual bidding mistakes - review timeline example\" width=\"783\" height=\"320\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88980 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistakes-reviews.webp 783w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistakes-reviews-480x196.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 783px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For weekly changes, I like to keep my bid changes small. The date range is smaller, so the changes should reflect that. Typically, if performance is close-ish to the target CPA, I\u2019ll adjust by 10% and if something looks really bad or good in a given week (say 2x the CPA target or only at half), then I\u2019ll make a 15% adjustment.<\/p>\n<p>As we get into longer time frames like a monthly review, my percentage of bid changes grows. Now I\u2019m looking at 20% to 25%.<\/p>\n<p>Same thing with quarterly changes, my bid changes might be an additional 25% &#8211; 40% or I might even think about pausing a keyword altogether.<\/p>\n<p>Effectively, these monthly and quarterly bid changes can help give you insights into longer-term performance and will allow you an opportunity to get more or less aggressive on a keyword as compared to the weekly reviews.<\/p>\n<p>When doing these longer reviews, don\u2019t forget to use your best judgment. Rules make it easy to do the work, but if you have a hesitation, explore it. If a keyword has converted but has a CPA that\u2019s 2.5x your target, maybe check to see if it\u2019s trending in the right direction with your weekly changes before pausing it or giving it a big bid cut. That brings us to the next Google Ads manual bidding mistake.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udcb8 Looking to get the most bang for your buck in Google Ads?<\/strong> Download our free guide to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/ways-to-save-money-in-google-ads?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_SaveMoneyinGoogleAds_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> 6 easy ways to save money in Google Ads<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-manual-bidding-long-term-reviews\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Not conducting long-term performance reviews<\/h3>\n<p>In addition to the weekly, monthly, and quarterly reviews, it\u2019s very important to check back to even longer date ranges. There are two sides to this longer review.<\/p>\n<p>First, even with the shorter time frame reviews, you could be missing out on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/26\/intent-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">overall impact of a keyword<\/a>. With long-term reviews like half-year and annual lookback windows, you can see<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> the weight each keyword carries<\/a> in your account. Does one keyword account for more than 20% of the conversions? Is one category of keywords dragging up the CPA because they\u2019re higher on average? Without looking at longer ranges, you may not see those trends.<\/p>\n<p>Second, while the shorter time frames above help with keywords that are likely to have decent volume and have some conversion performance, there\u2019s a category of keywords that usually is only discovered with these longer-term reviews: the silent thief.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the data for a certain keyword for the last week:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistakes-performance-review.webp\" alt=\"google ads manual bidding - keyword report\" width=\"900\" height=\"207\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88971 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistakes-performance-review.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistakes-performance-review-480x110.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The CPA target for this account is $100, so even though it hasn\u2019t converted, it\u2019s still under that threshold and just 1 conversion would make it profitable, so we don\u2019t make any changes.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the last month&#8217;s worth of data:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistakes-performance-.webp\" alt=\"google ads manual bidding mistakes - keyword performance report screenshot\" width=\"900\" height=\"208\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88972 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistakes-performance-.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistakes-performance--480x111.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now we\u2019re about 2x the CPA target on spend, so we lower the bid by 25% and set it on its way.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a quarter&#8217;s worth of data:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-quarterly-data.webp\" alt=\"google ads manual bidding - quarterly keyword data\" width=\"900\" height=\"209\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88973 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-quarterly-data.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-quarterly-data-480x111.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Again, now we\u2019re in 3x the CPA range so based on our rules, we might lower the keyword bid another 25-40% and see how it goes.

Is there a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/great-landing-pages\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> different landing page<\/a> we could send these folks to? How can you get this term back on track?<\/p>\n<p>But now we\u2019re at a 6-month review:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistakes-six-month.webp\" alt=\"google ads manual bidding mistakes - keyword data for six months\" width=\"900\" height=\"203\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-88974 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistakes-six-month.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistakes-six-month-480x108.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And still nothing.

Without this 6 month review, we\u2019re left to look at only a quarterly basis, which might only show us a 3x CPA spend with no conversions and we may continue optimizing when in reality, this keyword just isn\u2019t working. At this 6 month point, I was ready to pause.<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-manual-bidding-modifiers\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. Not leveraging all bid modifiers<\/h3>\n<p>While all this might sound like a lot of work, you\u2019re not off the hook yet. We\u2019ve just been talking about keywords, but one of the other mistakes I see with manual CPC is that most advertisers don\u2019t take advantage of all the other bid modifiers available in Google Ads.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike all the Smart Bidding strategies, manual CPC is compatible with all the bid modifiers including audiences, devices, demographics, ad scheduling, and more.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-adjustment-chart.webp\" alt=\"google ads manual bidding mistakes - bidding adjustment application chart\" width=\"741\" height=\"546\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89017 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-adjustment-chart.webp 741w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-adjustment-chart-480x354.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 741px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now, I\u2019m not suggesting you review all of these bid modifiers on a weekly basis. Likely monthly and quarterly reviews will suffice for these since more data will need to accrue, but they should absolutely be part of your regular process.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-ad-schedule-adjustments.webp\" alt=\"google ads manual bidding - ad schedule adjustments\" width=\"356\" height=\"546\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89018 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-ad-schedule-adjustments.webp 356w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/google-ads-manual-bidding-ad-schedule-adjustments-196x300.webp 196w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Each will be in a different place, but bid modifiers will always look like the image above. You\u2019ll be able to add a percentage increase or decrease to your target layer to decide if you want to get more or less aggressive in that segment. Just like with keywords, these percentages should all be based on performance.<\/p>\n<h2>Turn these manual bidding mistakes into<\/h2>\n<p>Manual CPC bidding takes quite a bit of time to do properly, but I think it\u2019s a great solution for campaigns that need a little more attention and don\u2019t see good results from smart bidding strategies. Make a schedule, keep to it, and you\u2019ll get the most from manual CPC.
