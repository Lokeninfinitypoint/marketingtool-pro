This was a short-lived option as part of a Display campaign where you could show ads to people within Gmail. And get this: you could target those ads based on the content of people\u2019s emails! As you can imagine, this was highly effective for advertisers but also a serious privacy concern for users. Google nixed that many years ago, and the Gmail placement was eventually folded into Demand Gen and PMax campaigns. Standalone Gmail Ads died&#8230;or so we thought.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, Google introduced a new option in Demand Gen campaigns that allows you to pick your channels. Demand Gen campaigns can place ads on YouTube, Discover, Gmail, and the Display Network. Now, if you only select the \u201cGmail\u201d option, you can run ads exclusively on Gmail. This presents a unique opportunity for email marketers, Google Ads practitioners, small business owners, and more.<\/p>\n<p>In this guide, I&#8217;m going to share everything you need to know about Gmail Ads in 2025 so you can decide if this is the right next step for your marketing strategy.<\/p>\n<h3>Contents<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#gmail-ads\">What are Gmail Ads?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#types-of-gmail-ads\">What are the different types of Gmail Ads you can run?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#targeting-gmail-ads\">How to target users with Gmail Ads<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#gmail-bidding\">How does bidding work with Gmail Ads?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#create-gmail-campaign\">How to create a Gmail-only Google Ads campaign<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#gmail-ads-examples\">Examples of Gmail Ads<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#measuring-gmail-ads\">How to know if your Gmail Ads are working<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"gmail-ads\"><\/div>\n<h2>What are Gmail Ads?<\/h2>\n<p>Gmail Ads are ads that show directly in users&#8217; inboxes. When users are on their Promotions or Social tabs in Gmail, the ad will look like they have an email from your business. It will say &#8220;Sponsored&#8221; next to your business name and then display one of your headline options and one of your description options. This is called the \u201cteaser ad.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes, your image, video, or products may be shown, too, before the user even clicks on the ad.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/gmail-ads-example.jpg\" alt=\"example Gmail ad\" width=\"309\" height=\"594\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93817 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/gmail-ads-example.jpg 309w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/gmail-ads-example-156x300.jpg 156w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 309px) 100vw, 309px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>An example of Gmail Ads in the &#8220;promotions&#8221; tab of a Gmail inbox. The ad from Google Ads includes an image as part of the teaser ad, while the ad from Wealthsimple is a plain-text teaser ad.<\/em><\/p>\n<div id=\"types-of-gmail-ads\"><\/div>\n<h2>Types of Gmail Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Since a Gmail Ad is part of a Demand Gen campaign, you can create a <strong>single image ad<\/strong>, a <strong>carousel image ad<\/strong>, or a <strong>video ad<\/strong>. Here is a breakdown of all these different types of Gmail Ads:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Single image and video ads<\/strong>: You can have up to five headlines and five descriptions per ad. With an image ad, you can add up to 20 images per ad, and with a video ad, you can add up to five videos per ad. Note that, currently, the Google Ads Help Center says that video ads are not compatible with Gmail, but this is outdated information! Video ads can run in Gmail, though for now, they only serve on mobile devices.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Carousel image ads<\/strong>: These ads only get one overall headline and one overall description. This is because when a user clicks on your ad, it will open an email that has multiple \u201ccards\u201d forming your carousel. Each card then has its own image, headline, description, and final URL. Think of this as similar to a Carousel ad you might run on Meta. (This is actually the only place in Google Ads where carousel ads are supported.)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Product Ads<\/strong>: If you have a product feed from Google Merchant Center connected to your Google Ads account, you can also choose to include this as part of your ad. You can select this in your Campaign settings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><span data-contrast=\"auto\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" lang=\"EN-US\" class=\"TextRun SCXW91369322 BCX0\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW91369322 BCX0\">\ud83d\udea8 <\/span><\/span>Could silly mistakes be hindering your Gmail Ads campaigns?<\/strong> Find out with our free guide to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/google-ads-mistakes?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_googleadsmistakes_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> six common (but costly) Google Ads mistakes and how to fix them<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"targeting-gmail-ads\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to target users with Gmail Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Because Gmail ads are part of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/22\/demand-gen-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Demand Gen campaign<\/a>, you have a variety of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-audience-targeting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">audience targeting options<\/a> available to you.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Google&#8217;s audiences<\/strong>: You can target using detailed demographics, in-market segments, life event segments, and affinity segments.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Custom segments<\/strong>: You can target based on the things people search for, the types of websites they visit, and\/or the types of apps they use.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your data segments<\/strong>: You can<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/retargeting-ad-ideas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> reach people who have visited your website<\/a>, used your app, interacted with your YouTube content, or are on a customer list you\u2019ve uploaded. You can also target a Google Engaged audience, which is made up of users who have visited your website from Google or YouTube search results.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Lookalike segments<\/strong>: You can build a lookalike segment of people who are similar to any of your data segments.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Basic demographics<\/strong>: You can narrow your audience further using basic demographics such as age, gender, and parental status.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Location targeting<\/strong>: As with any other type of Google Ads campaign, you can use location targeting.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Optimized targeting:<\/strong> This option turns your audience <em>targeting<\/em> into audience <em>signals<\/em>, giving Google permission to show your Gmail Ads to people who might not match the audiences you&#8217;ve chosen, but who it thinks are likely to convert.

When your Gmail ad appears in someone&#8217;s inbox, that counts as an <strong>impression<\/strong>. If they click to open the ad, that does not actually count as a click; that counts as an <strong>engagement<\/strong>. Once someone opens the ad and sees the full details, they then have the option to <strong>click<\/strong> and be taken to your website.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If your goal is <strong>engagement<\/strong>, then you should measure the success of your campaign based on its <strong>engagement rate<\/strong> and <strong>cost per engagement<\/strong>. A low engagement rate suggests that your headlines and descriptions may need improvement. And because we know that sometimes images can show in the teaser ad, you might also want to try using more engaging imagery. The more engaging your ad is, the more Google will want to show it to people, so focus on <em>increasing<\/em> engagement rate in order to <em>decrease<\/em> cost per engagement.<\/li>\n<li>If your goal is <strong>website visits (clicks)<\/strong>, then you should measure the success of your campaign based on its <strong>click-through rate<\/strong> and <strong>cost per click<\/strong>. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/14\/improve-google-ads-click-through-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">low click-through rate<\/a> suggests that people who were interested enough to expand your ad didn\u2019t find it compelling enough to follow through to your website. Experiment with different calls-to-action and different image and\/or video assets to improve this metric. The more people who click on your ad, the more Google will want to show it to people, so focus on <em>increasing<\/em> click-through rate in order to <em>decrease<\/em> cost per click.<\/li>\n<li>If your goal is <strong>conversions<\/strong>, then you&#8217;ll want to measure success based on <strong>conversion rate<\/strong> and <strong>cost per conversion<\/strong>. Remember that Gmail Ads are meant to complement Search or Shopping campaigns. Your conversion metrics will also look very different if you\u2019re targeting a warm audience, like previous website visitors, vs. a cold audience, like an affinity segment. With those caveats in mind, if your campaign has been running for at least four weeks and you have no conversions, you can try changing your bid strategy, optimizing for a micro-conversion that occurs earlier in the customer journey, or testing different audiences.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Remember, if people don&#8217;t engage, they can&#8217;t click. And if they don&#8217;t click, they definitely can&#8217;t convert. The key takeaway here is to focus on <strong>engagement first<\/strong>, then focus on <strong>clicks<\/strong>, and then, if you&#8217;re trying to get conversions, focus on your <strong>conversion metrics<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>Try Google Gmail Ads today<\/h2>\n<p>And there you have it: your ultimate guide to Gmail Ads in 2025.
