As the sun slowly set across the small desert city just outside Reno, Belknap and Vance, who were 18 and 20 at the time, decided to visit a nearby playground.<\/p>\n<p>It was at that playground that the two young men shot themselves with a 12-gauge shotgun.<\/p>\n<p>Belknap went first. After successfully killing himself with a single gunshot wound to the head, Vance took the shotgun from his friend\u2019s hands and attempted to end his own life. Unlike his friend, Vance did not die immediately, instead sustaining serious facial injuries that left him disfigured. Vance died of complications stemming from the failed suicide attempt three years later.<\/p>\n<p>Belknap and Vance\u2019s families sued Judas Priest\u2019s label, CBS Records, for $6.2 million (approximately $14.2 million in 2017). They argued in court that the pair had been driven to commit suicide by auditory signals concealed in Judas Priest\u2019s cover of the Spooky Tooth song, \u201cBetter By You, Better Than Me.\u201d The plaintiffs claimed that the song contained a subliminal message \u2013 <em>\u201cDo it\u201d<\/em> \u2013 urging listeners to take their own lives.<\/p>\n<p>The suit was eventually thrown out, but not before putting the perceived dangers of subliminal messaging front-and-center in the minds of concerned parents across the country. Other performers, including Ozzy Osbourne and 2 Live Crew, would also find themselves defending their music in court on similar charges before the hysteria gradually faded from the public\u2019s mind.<\/p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t just rock stars who allegedly dabble in what the judge presiding over <em>Belknap\/Vance vs. Judas Priest<\/em> called \u201csubliminals\u201d and what the media called \u201cbackward masking\u201d for years. Many advertising campaigns have leveraged this controversial practice to make their ads and branding even more persuasive. In this post, we\u2019ll take a look at seven such cases of subliminal advertising.<\/p>\n<p>First, though, let\u2019s take a moment to explain what subliminal messages actually are.<\/p>\n<h2>What Is Subliminal Advertising?<\/h2>\n<p>Subliminal messages are visual or auditory stimuli that the conscious mind cannot perceive, often inserted into other media such as TV commercials or songs. This kind of messaging can be used to strengthen or heighten the persuasiveness of advertisements, or to convey an altogether different message entirely.<\/p>\n<p>True subliminal messages cannot be observed or discovered by the conscious mind, even if you\u2019re actively looking for them. This is because stimuli to which we respond every day \u2013 the things we see and hear around us \u2013 are above the threshold of conscious perception, unlike subliminal messages, which are below this threshold.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/subliminal-advertising-how-subconscious-mind-works.png\" alt=\"Subliminal advertising how the subconscious mind works\" width=\"837\" height=\"550\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Image via <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.visme.co\/subliminal-messages\/\"><em>Visme<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>What makes subliminal messaging so insidious is that even though we\u2019re utterly unaware of the message hidden in whatever we\u2019re watching or listening to, part of our subconscious mind cannot help but respond to this concealed stimuli \u2013 it happens entirely without our knowledge or consent.<\/p>\n<h2>How Are Subliminal Messages Used in Advertising?<\/h2>\n<p>Although the term \u201csubliminal\u201d has been widely used for many years, it wasn\u2019t until 1957 that the practice became known beyond scientific and academic circles, when Vance Packard\u2019s book, <em>The Hidden Persuaders<\/em>, brought the concept of subliminal messages to the mainstream.<\/p>\n<p>The book detailed the results of a study conducted in the 1950s that claimed Coca-Cola had used subliminal advertising in movie theaters to drive sales of sodas and popcorn at concession stands. The study claimed that by splicing single frames of visual messages like \u201cBuy Coca-Cola\u201d and \u201cBuy popcorn\u201d into movie reels, sales of those products had increased by 57% and 18%, respectively.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/subliminal-advertising-the-hidden-persuaders-coke-popcorn.jpg\" alt=\"Subliminal advertising The Hidden Persuaders book Coca-Cola popcorn sales\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Packard, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/magazine-30878843\">the study was completely bogus<\/a>. It had been fabricated in its entirety, as its disgraced author James Vicary admitted years after its publication, in an attempt to part advertisers from their money.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the shaky factual foundation of <em>The Hidden Persuaders<\/em>, the book popularized the concept of subliminal messaging and its potential uses. Coca-Cola might not have been engaged in a campaign of psychological manipulation aimed at America\u2019s moviegoers (in that specific instance), but this particular application of subliminal messaging \u2013 leveraging the power of the subconscious mind to increase sales \u2013 is among subliminal advertising\u2019s primary functions.<\/p>\n<p>Subliminal messaging has also reportedly been used to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apa.org\/monitor\/2012\/04\/advertising.aspx\">further certain political agendas<\/a>. During the bitter fight for the U.S. presidency between George W. Bush and Al Gore in 2000, Gore accused Republican campaign managers of <a href=\"http:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Politics\/story?id=122936&amp;page=1\">including a subliminal message in an attack ad<\/a> focusing on Gore\u2019s proposed healthcare policies.<\/p>\n<p>Gore alleged that, in the video, the word \u201cRATS\u201d appears onscreen for a fraction of a second before the ad shows a visual featuring the word \u201cBureaucrats.\u201d Personally, I think it\u2019s impossible to miss, especially if you\u2019re looking for it:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"videos\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_video\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5235925d-5c1d-4586-a6dc-3881950eeda9\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/2NPKxhfFQMs?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Today, the use of subliminal messaging is banned in many countries. Unsurprisingly, the United States does not expressly forbid the use of subliminal messages in advertisements, though their use does fall under federal law enforcement jurisdiction.<\/p>\n<p>Now let\u2019s see some examples of subliminal advertising in action.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Playing Games with Husker Du<\/h2>\n<p>Husker Du (the board game from which <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/H%C3%BCsker_D%C3%BC\">the rock band<\/a> takes its name) was released in the early 1970s and marketed as a family game by its maker, Premium Corporation of America. The company paid for a series of TV ads for the game to be created, which featured single frames that read, \u201cGet it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>An executive for Premium Corp. later admitted responsibility for the inclusion of the frames, which the FCC investigated following viewer complaints.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/subliminal-advertising-husker-du-board-game.jpg\" alt=\"Subliminal advertising Husker Du board game cover art\" width=\"620\" height=\"447\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The incident prompted the FCC to declare that subliminal messaging in TV ads was \u201ccontrary to the public interest\u201d and forbade the practice.<\/p>\n<p>The board game might be a forgotten relic of a bygone age, but the incident is believed to be the first example of subliminal messages being utilized in TV ads, securing it a strange yet unique place in advertising history.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Marlboro\u2019s Subliminal Barcode<\/h2>\n<p>Despite attempts to curb cigarette advertising around the world, Marlboro remains one of the best-known American brands. We may not see the famous \u201cMarlboro Man\u201d on TV anymore \u2013 tourism to Flavor Country has declined sharply in the past 20 years \u2013 but Marlboro is still among the world\u2019s best-known cigarette brands, a coveted position Marlboro sought to retain through the use of subliminal ads.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"videos\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_video\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"da1bad4f-9f60-4fe1-8bd1-f3e12ed2f829\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/F_4pXusde8s?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>In the late \u201890s and early 2000s, many professional sporting organizations and regulatory bodies expressed concern about the prevalence of cigarette advertising in Formula 1 racing. Until that point, virtually all of the world\u2019s top drivers raced in cars emblazoned with cigarette brand logos, but the sudden ban on cigarette company sponsorship in Europe precipitated an exodus of cigarette brands leaving the sport.<\/p>\n<p>To circumvent this inconvenient restriction, the marketing team at Marlboro came up with a dastardly ingenious idea; they would use subliminal visual messaging to convey the Marlboro brand without using the typographical logo of the company itself.<\/p>\n<p>Marlboro accomplished this by using a barcode-style design that, at the high speeds at which F1 cars travel around the track, was almost as recognizable as the logo itself.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/subliminal-advertising-marlboro-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Subliminal advertising Marlboro F1 barcode design\" width=\"620\" height=\"413\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While clever, Marlboro\u2019s attempts to get around the advertising ban were short-lived. The European Public Health Commission applied considerable pressure to European lawmakers, who ruled that the design was indeed too close to the banned Marlboro design.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/subliminal-advertising-marlboro-logo-barcode.jpg\" alt=\"Sub\" width=\"800\" height=\"203\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Image via <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.campaignlive.co.uk\/article\/marlboro-coke-kfc-used-subliminal-advertising\/1383489\"><em>Campaign<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Hilariously, Marlboro <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/SB10001424052748703674704575234083089692088\">told The Wall Street Journal in 2010<\/a> that, \u201cThe barcode was never intended to be anything other than a neutral design, one that was not linked to the sale of tobacco products. It was never intended to be a reference to the Marlboro brand in any way.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>Right<\/em>.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Seriously Suggestive Ads<\/h2>\n<p><em>Warning: The three following ad examples all feature strongly suggestive content that should be considered NSFW. The worst offending ads themselves are not shown, but readers may still want to exercise caution.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Benson &amp; Hedges<\/h3>\n<p>Marlboro may have raised a few eyebrows with its supposedly neutral barcode design, but this was far from the first time that a cigarette company used subliminal visual clues to sell smokes.<\/p>\n<p>In the late 1970s, British tobacco brand Benson &amp; Hedges launched an advertising campaign in the United States. The campaign\u2019s primary goal was to raise awareness of the brand\u2019s new cigarette packaging; B&amp;H was among the first tobacco brands to adopt cigarette packs that used hard card, rather than the thin paper packaging that cigarette manufacturers favored at that time.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the ad as it appeared in print:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/subliminal-advertising-benson-hedges-cigarette-ad-sfw.jpg\" alt=\"Subliminal advertising Benson &amp; Hedges cigarette ad\" width=\"293\" height=\"388\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d call this one truly subliminal; it&#8217;s hard to see the &#8220;hidden message&#8221; until it&#8217;s highlighted. If you want to see a side-by-side comparison of the ad, complete with hidden visuals highlighted, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.subliminalsex.com\/subliminal%20advertising%20example.htm\">you can see it here<\/a>. (You were warned!)<\/p>\n<p>The ad doesn\u2019t leave much to the imagination once you\u2019ve noticed it.<\/p>\n<h3>Gilbey\u2019s Gin<\/h3>\n<p>Although British distillery Gilbey\u2019s lacks the name recognition of other brands of gin such as Beefeater and Gordon\u2019s, Gilbey\u2019s gin has been helping people temporarily forget their problems since 1857. Gilbey\u2019s itself may not be the most famous distillery in the world, but Gilbey\u2019s signature gin certainly left an impression on people back in the late \u201870s when it launched a controversial ad campaign.<\/p>\n<p>Like many of our examples, Gilbey\u2019s chose to experiment with subliminal advertising in an attempt to sell more bottles of gin. And, like many of our examples, it\u2019s surprisingly easy to spot \u2013 once it\u2019s been pointed out to you, of course.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/subliminal-advertising-gilbeys-gin.gif\" alt=\"Subliminal advertising Gilbey's Gin sex icecubes ad\" width=\"646\" height=\"461\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Coca-Cola<\/h3>\n<p>Coca-Cola was also accused of similarly risqu\u00e9 ads in the mid-1980s, when a member of the public spotted what appeared to be a strongly suggestive image when they saw it on the back of a truck.<\/p>\n<p>To avoid offending any of our readers, we\u2019ve decided against including the ad in this post. If you want to see it for yourself, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.snopes.com\/cokelore\/poster.asp\">you can see it here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Legend has it that the artist responsible for the artwork included the visual as a joke, and that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.snopes.com\/cokelore\/poster.asp\">Coca-Cola was unaware of it until the initial complaint<\/a>. The incident prompted Coca-Cola to fire the artist and instigate legal proceedings against him. It also forced Coca-Cola to recall millions of items of collateral and promotional material.<\/p>\n<p>Today, examples of this particular ad are highly sought-after by collectors of rare <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/22\/vintage-ads\">vintage advertising<\/a> memorabilia.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Food Network\u2019s Fast-Food Fracas<\/h2>\n<p>In 2007, during the broadcast of an episode of Food Network\u2019s enormously popular cooking show, Iron Chef America, the image of the McDonald\u2019s logo was flashed on-screen for a fraction of a second \u2013 short enough to slip by most viewers unnoticed, but long enough for more than a few eagle-eyed cooking fans to notice.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"videos\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_video\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ddfeb3bb-5985-494d-ae71-d55b71cf6343\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/2xPvYgTvr8I?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Both the Food Network and McDonald\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/usatoday30.usatoday.com\/life\/television\/news\/2007-01-26-mcdonalds-ironchef_x.htm\">denied the accusation that they had colluded on a secretive subliminal ad campaign<\/a>. Food Network spokesperson Mark O\u2019Connor said that, \u201cIt was a technical error on our part and not a subliminal message as suggested by a website running the slow-motion playback.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>McDonald\u2019s was even more blunt in its dismissal of the allegations, merely stating \u201cWe don\u2019t do subliminal advertising.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>5. Wendy\u2019s Family Values<\/h2>\n<p>Speaking of major fast-food franchises, our next example comes courtesy of Wendy\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p>When Wendy\u2019s redesigned its classic, yet somewhat disturbing logo a few years ago, people immediately noticed a rather subtle detail \u2013 the apparent inclusion of the word \u201cMom\u201d in the logo. As with Amazon\u2019s A-to-Z or the FedEx arrow, it\u2019s impossible to miss once it\u2019s been pointed out to you:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/subliminal-advertising-wendys-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Subliminal advertising Wendy's new 'mom' logo\" width=\"600\" height=\"434\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This example of subliminal messaging is a little different than our previous examples. It doesn\u2019t use an existing slogan or strapline in the message. Rather, it attempts to leverage word association to create a favorable mental image in the mind of the observer.<\/p>\n<p>However, just because this particular example isn\u2019t pushing the hard sell doesn\u2019t make it any less creepy. Let\u2019s face it \u2013 you couldn\u2019t get much further away from delicious, home-cooked family meals or meaningful family relationships than a nationwide burger joint.<\/p>\n<h2>6. KFC\u2019s 12th Secret Ingredient<\/h2>\n<p>Since we\u2019re on the topic of creepy, overly familiar fast-food mascots, our final example of subliminal advertising comes from The Colonel, or rather, his restaurant franchise, KFC.<\/p>\n<p>In 2008, a keen-eyed TV viewer caught something in a visual of KFC\u2019s then-new Snacker sandwich:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/subliminal-advertising-kfc-dollar-lettuce.jpg\" alt=\"Subliminal advertising KFC Snacker sandwich dollar hidden in lettuce\" width=\"551\" height=\"357\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Yes, that\u2019s a dollar bill hidden in the lettuce.<\/p>\n<p>This example proved particularly controversial at the time. For one, there\u2019s the fact that the guy who claimed to be the first to notice the bill concealed amid the sandwich\u2019s garnish is believed to have actually fabricated the entire incident to create business for his market research company \u2013 American entrepreneurship at its finest. Then there\u2019s the fact that this wasn\u2019t the first time KFC had experimented with this kind of promotion, having ran a similar campaign two years previously in 2006 for its Buffalo Snacker sandwich.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s unclear whether KFC has resorted to such trickery in the decade since its first foray into subliminal messaging, but since the effectiveness of subliminal advertising has called into question repeatedly, it\u2019s also unclear whether it would be worth it.<\/p>\n<p>KFC certainly has a sense of humor when it comes to its branding. Allen recently drew the attention of the WordStream content team to KFC\u2019s Twitter profile \u2013 specifically, the accounts KFC is following.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/subliminal-advertising-kfc-twitter-followers.png\" alt=\"Subliminal advertising KFC Twitter following 11 herbs spices\" width=\"963\" height=\"595\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>KFC is following just 11 accounts: all five former members of British \u201890s pop sensation, the Spice Girls, and six guys named Herb.<\/p>\n<p>Get it? 11 Herbs and spices?<\/p>\n<p>What other examples of subliminal messaging have you come across?
