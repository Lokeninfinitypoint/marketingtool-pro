It captures <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/216573\/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines\/#:~:text=Google%20in%20the%20global%20market&amp;text=Google%20has%20dominated%20the%20search,revenues%20are%20generated%20through%20advertising.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">92%<\/a> of the search engine market share. Ergo, advertising on Google is a good way to get in front of people searching for not just products and services, but brands\u2014whether that&#8217;s yours or your competitors.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Measurability.\u00a0<\/strong>As is the case with most forms of digital marketing, the Google Ads platform provides quantifiable results so you can get a clear read on which ads, offers, keywords, and landing pages are performing best.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Multiple formats.\u00a0<\/strong>While we typically associate search ads with Google Ads, there are lots of other formats to work with, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/29\/ad-channels\">each ad channel plays a different key role<\/a> in your marketing strategy.<\/li>\n<li><strong>ROI.<\/strong> The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/14\/how-does-google-ads-work\">nature of the Google Ads auction<\/a> says that you pay the lowest possible price for a click on your ad. This is because the formula for your cost per click factors in the maximum bid of the ad that appears below yours, plus one cent. And, of course, you&#8217;re only paying when someone clicks on your ad. PPC, on average, returns $2 for every $1 spent, and Google (so take this with a grain of salt) has gone so far as to say that Google Ads actually returns <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/14\/how-does-google-ads-work\">$8<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Cons<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Low costs are not guaranteed.<\/strong> Building on that last point above. Paying the lowest possible price for a click on your ad doesn&#8217;t necessitate a low price. You&#8217;re paying the lowest price relative to your competitors, and some keywords can be pretty expensive. Plus, it&#8217;s no secret that Google Ads is one of the best marketing channels. The more people that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/how-to-use-google-adwords\">use Google Ads<\/a>, the more competitive and expensive it becomes.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Upkeep.<\/strong>\u00a0 How much you pay for your campaigns depends on a number of factors\u2014one of the main ones being how effective you are at optimizing your ads.
