They don\u2019t necessarily promote.<\/p>\n<p>They might \u201cdistribute\u201d (heavy on the air quotes).<\/p>\n<p>But\u2026to where? Borders?<\/p>\n<p>Oh that\u2019s right. They don\u2019t exist anymore. And good luck finding a Barnes &amp; Noble or any other needle-moving retail chain out there.<\/p>\n<p>You want a bestseller? The fact is, you\u2019re gonna have to roll up your sleeves and <em>make<\/em> it a bestseller. And you can do that by thinking like a smart marketer.<\/p>\n<p>The time to think about promoting your book is before it comes out. Here\u2019s how to do it, with book promotion lessons learned from bestselling authors who\u2019ve taken matters into their own hands.<\/p>\n<h2>1. The Old Guards are Gone. Here\u2019s What to Do Instead<\/h2>\n<p>Steven Pressfield, acclaimed author of <em>The Legend of Bagger Vance<\/em> (among many others), also wrote a book for first-time authors looking to hit it big.<\/p>\n<p>The title? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Nobody-Wants-Read-Your-Sh-ebook\/dp\/B01GZ1TJBI\"><em>Nobody Wants to Read Your Sh*t<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-promote-a-book-nobody-wants-to-read-your-shit.png\" alt=\"How to promote a book Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit Pressman\" width=\"345\" height=\"503\" \/><\/div>\n<p>I\u2019m sure your book is fantastic. But I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and say it\u2019s not going to get the Oprah\u2019s Book Club sticker.<\/p>\n<p>But that\u2019s ok. You don\u2019t need her. You don\u2019t need Oprah. (I know you\u2019re reading this Oprah, so just go with me on this).<\/p>\n<p>What used to be the norm for book promotion isn\u2019t anymore. Instead, a targeted, niche approach will see more results than a traditional \u201cthrow it at the wall and see what sticks\u201d campaign.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Education-Millionaires-Everything-College-Successful-ebook\/dp\/B0052RDJFE\/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1493410379&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+education+of+millionaires\">Michael Ellsberg<\/a> learned this firsthand after trying out the old ways first:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Radio interviews<\/li>\n<li>National media<\/li>\n<li>And an email blast to a miniscule list<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Even after all this, his book didn\u2019t break the 1,000 rank marker on Amazon.<\/p>\n<p>But then his <em>4-Hour Work Week<\/em> buddy, Tim Ferriss, came along.<\/p>\n<p>Tim wrote up a blog post featuring Ellsberg and recommending it highly. Within an hour, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/michaelellsberg\/2012\/01\/11\/the-tim-ferriss-effect\/#6edc8072363e\">the book reached 45 on Amazon<\/a>. It even hit #1 in the Job Hunting and Career Guides section on the site.<\/p>\n<p>In the weeks to follow, Ellsberg tried to capitalize on the increased attention, continuing to do traditional press. Nothing, though, was ever able to give him another boost like Ferriss\u2019s post.<\/p>\n<p>So why did one simple blog post perform better than weeks of tireless promotion?<\/p>\n<h2>2. Solo Author Blogs Benefit from the \u2018Halo Effect\u2019<\/h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Halo_effect\">Halo Effect<\/a> is a real thing.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a cognitive bias that explains why some people (or brands or products) are seen as more credible, smarter, or more attractive than their peers.\u00a0That\u2019s why Apple gets the benefit of the doubt over Microsoft. Or Samsung, Google, and any of their other competitors for that matter.<\/p>\n<p>The Halo Effect commonly applies to people with devoted followings, too. Like crazy televangelists. And Oprah.<\/p>\n<p>The \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/o\/oprah-effect.asp\">Oprah Effect<\/a>\u201d was coined because if she featured you on her show, you became an overnight sensation.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-promote-a-book-oprah-frey-book-sales.png\" alt=\"How to promote a book James Frey Million Little Pieces sales figures Oprah trade paperback edition\" width=\"555\" height=\"254\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Nielsen sales data for James Frey\u2019s heavily embellished memoir, \u2018A Million Little Pieces\u2019 in both<br \/>\nhardcover and Oprah Trade Paperback editions<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Popular solo-author blogs cultivate the same devotion. Even if their numbers pale in comparison.<\/p>\n<p>One reason is convenience. Get featured on the biggest radio show (I literally cannot name one), and someone still needs to wait until they get home or to the office to remember to look you up.<\/p>\n<p>Online, you\u2019re just a link away. So there\u2019s no delay. Less friction between the devoted reader and the Amazon One-Click to Purchase button.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-promote-a-book-amazon-one-click.png\" alt=\"How to promote a book Amazon One Click button\" width=\"350\" height=\"241\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Ferriss has spent years cultivating a following. So when he recommended Michael Ellsberg\u2019s work, it translated into intense action. (More so than anything CNN or the New York Times was able to generate).<\/p>\n<p>Because Ferriss was appealing to a tight-knit group that was <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Priming_(psychology)\"><em>primed<\/em><\/a> and engaged.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/janefriedman.com\/use-guest-blogging-promote-book\/\">Online marketer Beth Hayden agrees<\/a>, and even goes one step further. If you don\u2019t have a Tim Ferriss type to write for you (and not everyone does), connect with blogs with an audience that looks just like yours. This gives you a chance to claim your status as an expert in your book\u2019s topic and puts your book in front of the right people.<\/p>\n<p>Do a little digging and research high-traffic blogs in your book\u2019s niche. Hayden suggests coming up with a few topic ideas that would connect well with the blog\u2019s readers, and then email the blogger to pitch a guest submission.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Your Title Is a Headline.

First, because you should see the movie\u2014it\u2019s great.<\/p>\n<p>But, second, because no one cares about, or understands, your obscure or kitschy title. When it comes to marketing your book, picking a bad title can be catastrophic.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/17\/how-to-write-great-headlines\">think of book titles as an ad or article headline<\/a>. Because they, like book titles, are often the single biggest determinant of who sees your finished work. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/02\/ppc-ad-headlines\">A great headline<\/a> entices people to read what\u2019s inside.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-promote-a-book-childrens-book-parody.jpg\" alt=\"How to promote a book children's book parody\" width=\"1318\" height=\"1600\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Masterful.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/09\/ogilvy-advertising\">Ogilvy once said<\/a>, \u201c<em>On the average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy.

But then he took it one step further with a too-good-to-be-true incentive.<\/p>\n<p>Altucher created a special Slideshare to promote his latest book (to business people).<\/p>\n<p>On Slideshare, authors can upload their own PowerPoint presentations and visitors to the site can search for slide decks by keyword or topic. Good presentations should be full of pictures and exclusive snippets from the book.<\/p>\n<p>Altucher did all of that. But then at the very end, he included a call to action, promising the reader <em>their money back<\/em> if they could prove they bought and read the book.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-promote-a-book-slideshare-presentation.png\" alt=\"How to promote a book Slideshare presentation\" width=\"662\" height=\"617\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In other words, he was creating his own echo-chamber, <em>incentivizing<\/em> people to leave reviews (that would only help to expose others to his work) and further cultivating the relationship with his audience.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Establish Your Own Halo Effect By Recording an Audiobook<\/h2>\n<p>Initially, a professional voice actress was going to perform Geraldine DeRuiter\u2019s memoir.<\/p>\n<p>Geraldine was a first-time author. And this was like \u201cstandard procedure.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>However, Geraldine didn\u2019t like the idea. She\u2019d spent years building a loyal audience at her blog <a href=\"http:\/\/www.everywhereist.com\/\">The Everywhereist<\/a>. The story was personal. And so she wanted the performance for listeners to be personal, too.<\/p>\n<p>Recording your own audiobook is like the equivalent of someone having a conversation with you for ~10 hours during their commutes.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-promote-a-book-audiobooks.jpg\" alt=\"How to promote a book audiobook concept\" width=\"1024\" height=\"481\" \/><\/div>\n<p>That was no small hurdle, though.

Milena Canizares of <a href=\"https:\/\/blurb.com\/\">Blurb.com<\/a> suggests <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blurb.com\/blog\/how-get-reviews-amazon-once-you-have-launched-your-book\/\">coming up with a list of 100 or more<\/a> in hopes of walking away with 25 or so reviews.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-promote-a-book-amazon-reviews.jpg\" alt=\"How to promote a book Amazon reviews\" width=\"400\" height=\"271\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Explore outside of Amazon, too, to connect with book bloggers who would be willing to read and review your book. You can search a nerdy SEO tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/followerwonk.com\/\">Followerwonk<\/a> to find niche-specific bloggers on Twitter.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how-to-promote-a-book-followerwonk.jpg\" alt=\"How to promote a book Followerwonk\" width=\"655\" height=\"411\" \/><\/div>\n<p>And <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blogmetrics.org\/books\">Blogmetrics.com will rank bloggers<\/a>, so you can prioritize which ones will come with the most cachet and biggest following.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Where-Hell-Tesla-Novel-Dircks-ebook\/dp\/B00U05YSCQ\"><em>Where the Hell is Tesla<\/em><\/a> author Rob Dirks used this method to help sell 10,000 copies of his book. By his own account, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/279385\">no one knew he was<\/a>, and yet he was able to self-publish and sell lots of books. On his publish day, he had already lined up 25 reviews to be live on Amazon. He gave free books to reviewers and reaped the rewards of credibility of having others confirm his book\u2019s quality.<\/p>\n<h2>See Your Name on the Bestseller List<\/h2>\n<p>Authors can\u2019t afford to write anymore.<\/p>\n<p>Literally.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, the promotion-monkey is now falling squarely on the backs of authors themselves. And because of your already jam-packed schedule (of you know, actually writing the damn book in the first place), you need a viable, repeatable promotion system.<\/p>\n<p>Start by recognizing the ramifications. And how you\u2019ll need to find the new influencers, like solo author blogs within your niche, who\u2019ll promote your book to those that matter most.<\/p>\n<p>You can also take a cue from mainstream digital marketing campaigns, like testing your headlines, repurposing content for different formats (even video), and then incentivizing them to leave reviews that will help bring in brand new people in the future.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not easy. It takes time and tons of effort. But it also means that the ultimate success of your soon-to-be bestseller is entirely within your own control.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Want to know how to promote your book?
