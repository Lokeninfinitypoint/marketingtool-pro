The five agency metrics listed here are best at surfacing the biggest bottlenecks and leak points.<\/p>\n<div id=\"Utilization-rate\"><\/div>\n<h3>1. Utilization rate<\/h3>\n<p>If you have an internal team that delivers work to clients, utilization rate will be the first and most foundational metric to start paying attention to in terms of profitability.<\/p>\n<h4>What is utilization rate?<\/h4>\n<p>Employees who interface with clients can split their working hours into billable and non-billable hours. Billable hours are those spent on client projects or directly working with clients, while non-billable hours are those spent not directly on the client, such as with internal projects and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/07\/marketing-meetings\"> meetings<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Utilization is defined as the percent of your employees\u2019 billable total time. To increase your agency\u2019s profitability, you need to make sure your team has enough work to do for clients to keep a threshold of billable hours.<\/p>\n<h4>Why is utilization rate important?<\/h4>\n<p>Understanding your utilization rate helps you avoid situations where you\u2019re paying a salary to the team but not earning any revenue in return. If the team isn\u2019t busy, optimizing for profitability is not much point because the time recouped from increased efficiency can\u2019t be transferred to other revenue-earning opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>Suppose you primarily lean on contractors or outsourced partners to do work for clients. In that case, you may not need to worry about utilization as much since you\u2019re not paying those contractors when the agency isn\u2019t busy. Your contribution or gross margins may be lower, but if you haven\u2019t figured out how to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/01\/16\/get-more-clients\"> predictably acquire clients<\/a>, keeping your workforce more elastic might be a good idea until you\u2019ve<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/07\/marketing-funnel\"> sorted out your funnel<\/a> and acquisition channels.<\/p>\n<h4>How do you calculate utilization rate?<\/h4>\n<p>Use the following formula to calculate utilization rate:<\/p>\n<p><em>Gross capacity \/ Billable hours = Utilization rate<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-utilization-rate.webp\" alt=\"Agency metrics - graphic of utilization rate calculation\" width=\"936\" height=\"339\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83182 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-utilization-rate.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-utilization-rate-480x174.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gross capacity:<\/strong> The total number of available billable hours (most employees are 40 hours per week for 52 hours per year less time off, or 2080 hours maximum).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Billable hours:<\/strong> The amount of time spent doing work for clients (regardless of whether you\u2019re billing hourly or not).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Utilization benchmarks<\/h4>\n<p>On a week-to-week basis, you generally want your \u201cpure\u201d producers (designers, developers,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/16\/free-copywriting-resources\"> copywriters<\/a>, etc.) to be utilized between 75% and 90%.<\/p>\n<p>On an annual basis, you should aim to have your production team hit a utilization rate of between 65% and 80%.<\/p>\n<p>With utilization above 65%, you should achieve healthy margins as a business, so long as you\u2019re earning your revenue efficiently (more on that next).<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udce3 Ready to scale your agency\u2019s growth?

Simply put, it means calculating the profit margin on a per-client or per-project basis by subtracting time and material costs from whatever the client has paid you.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/agency-metrics-wordstream-gross-margin-model.webp\" alt=\"Agency metrics - graphic of grow margin factors\" width=\"849\" height=\"419\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83187 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/agency-metrics-wordstream-gross-margin-model.webp 849w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/agency-metrics-wordstream-gross-margin-model-480x237.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 849px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This method is generally more accurate but can be more expensive and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/16\/spend-less-time-in-google-ads\"> time-consuming<\/a> to calculate since it usually happens in an accounting tool. And without an aggressive bookkeeping schedule, this may be something you can only ever look at retroactively.<\/p>\n<h4>Who should use gross margin?<\/h4>\n<p>I recommend the gross margin metric to mature agencies with a bookkeeper who updates biweekly or weekly and agencies that work with many contractors.<\/p>\n<h4>Why is gross margin important?<\/h4>\n<p>Being able to hit gross margins in this range consistently means your delivery systems are efficient enough to scale profitably, allowing you to cash-flow<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/16\/grow-your-digital-marketing-agency\"> your agency\u2019s growth<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>How do you calculate gross margin?<\/h4>\n<p>Use the following formula to calculate gross margin:<\/p>\n<p><em>Adjusted gross income \u2013 (COGS\/Labor costs) = Gross margin<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Gross margin \/ Adjusted gross income = Gross margin %<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-gross-margin.webp\" alt=\"Agency metrics - graphic of gross margin calculation\" width=\"936\" height=\"342\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83183 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-gross-margin.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-gross-margin-480x175.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Adjusted gross income (AGI):<\/strong> The amount of revenue left over for the agency to earn after pass-through expenses are paid (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/21\/ad-spend-pacing\">ad spend<\/a>, print budgets, equipment rentals, etc.).<\/li>\n<li><strong>COGS and labor costs:<\/strong> The costs associated with the people you\u2019ve brought on to work on this project, be they internal team members or external contractors.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To calculate your<a href=\"https:\/\/parakeeto.com\/blog\/how-to-accurately-calculate-your-agencys-billable-employee-cost-per-hour\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> employee cost per hour<\/a> for internal team members, you\u2019ll need to take their salary + benefits and divide it by their gross capacity.

Average billable rate (ABR)<\/h3>\n<p>Average billable rate is often a much simpler, more accessible way to get an idea of your revenue-earning efficiency and benchmark different clients or projects against each other.<\/p>\n<h4>What is ABR?<\/h4>\n<p>ABR helps us understand the average rate we\u2019re earning per hour based on the amount of time it actually takes us to earn our revenue. This method is generally a bit less accurate, but it is much faster and easier to calculate and doesn\u2019t require a bookkeeper or accountant to figure out.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/agency-metrics-wordstream-ABR-model.webp\" alt=\"Agency metrics - Graphic of ABR model.\" width=\"787\" height=\"274\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83188 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/agency-metrics-wordstream-ABR-model.webp 787w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/agency-metrics-wordstream-ABR-model-480x167.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 787px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Who should use ABR?<\/h4>\n<p>I generally recommend using the ABR metric method for<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/02\/manage-social-media-accounts\"> smaller agencies<\/a> that may just be getting started with tracking metrics and for agencies that tend to work with fewer contractors and keep most of their labor in-house.<\/p>\n<h4>Why is ABR important?<\/h4>\n<p>For the same reasons mentioned about gross margin, if you hit ABR <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/smart-goals-examples\">goals<\/a>, you can grow profitably.
