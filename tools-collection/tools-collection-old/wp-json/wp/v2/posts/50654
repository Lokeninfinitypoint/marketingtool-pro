Our definition says that this only happens when the mistake-maker is perceived as highly competent. So you generally don&#8217;t make mistakes, but when you do, it&#8217;s endearing.<\/p>\n<p>This makes sense because we are\u00a0attracted to what we can identify with\/relate to, and we can all identify with mistakes. So, using this effect in your copywriting can humanize\u00a0your business, make you an approachable expert, and build emotional connections with your audience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1.

Not only are you increasing your interpersonal appeal, but you&#8217;re helping others to avoid those mistakes themselves.

In other words, it was the novelty of the dish that made the food more appealing.<\/p>\n<h3>What it is<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Novelty_effec\">The Novelty Effect<\/a>\u00a0refers to when there is an improvement or positive result to a change, due NOT to that specific change, but to the fact that there was <em>any change at all<\/em>. Once the novelty wears off, whatever improved will return back to its original performance.<\/p>\n<h3>How to use it in copywriting<\/h3>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how to use the Novelty Effect to your advantage and how to prevent it from messing with your A\/B testing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3.

It could just be that people got so\u00a0used to (and bored with) seeing the original copy that the new copy catches their attention.<\/p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https:\/\/instapage.com\/blog\/validating-ab-tests\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instapage<\/a>\u00a0suggests, if you&#8217;re doing any sort of split testing with your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/22\/marketing-copy\">marketing copy<\/a>, make sure to either give the experiment time for the novelty to wear off, OR run the test to a new audience or new visitors to your site. This way, you can ensure that it really was the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/02\/landing-page-copywriting\">copy that improved conversion<\/a>\u2014and that the improved conversion rate won&#8217;t drop off.<br \/>\n<a id=\"priming\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>The Priming Effect<\/h2>\n<p>The Priming Effect comes in handy not for your call to action copy, but for the copy preceding it.<\/p>\n<p><span>(P.S.

But &#8220;top-of-mind&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean &#8220;pronounced and distinct.&#8221; And it&#8217;s not your business in general that you want top of mind here, but rather, information specific to the decision you want your readers to make.<\/p>\n<h3>How to use it in copywriting<\/h3>\n<p><strong>8.

One of my examples was from Sleeknote.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/psychology-copywriting-easy-to-read-example-sleeknote.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"182\" alt=\"copywriting psychology - example of homepage with easy to read features\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">From Sleeknote&#8217;s homepage<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>While Sleeknote offers plenty of advanced features and benefits in the way of click-through rate, conversion rate optimization, campaigns, domains, custom CSS, and more\u2014you don&#8217;t see any of that language here. You see simple, familiar terms that don&#8217;t make them look like they&#8217;re trying to impress you or convince you of anything. It inherently feels more trustworthy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>16. Write in conversational style<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This one&#8217;s a no-brainer. Write your blog posts, emails, and other website copy as if you&#8217;re conversing with your audience\u2014not giving a course lecture. Take this LOCALiQ blog post on <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-claim-a-business-on-google\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to Claim Your Business on Google<\/a>, for example. The author, Mary Lister, is great at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/05\/conversational-tone\">writing conversational copy<\/a>. She writes:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Most people tell you that Google My Business (GMB) is essential for local SEO, and they\u2019re not wrong, but it\u2019s also a big step to getting on the map, period. Even if you don\u2019t have a brick-and-mortar location, verifying your business with Google will make you searchable \u2014 and findable \u2014 when you want to\u00a0stand out from your competition.&#8221;<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>With the information so simply put (including the &#8220;This could be you!&#8221; caption on the diagram), it&#8217;s easier to understand and trust that it&#8217;s true.\u00a0(Of course, make sure you&#8217;re explaining actually true facts here.)<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/psychology-copywriting-conversational-cognitive-fluency.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"359\" alt=\"copywriting psychology - example of conversational tone\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Our brain\u00a0says that conversational = familiar = true<\/em><\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s better than conversational copy? Conversational bucket brigades. Learn about this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/20\/copywriting-techniques\">copywriting technique<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>17. Be super blunt<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You can also use cognitive fluency for your taglines.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/psychology-copywriting-tips-catch-homepage.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"300\" alt=\"copywriting psychology - example of easy tagline for cognitive fluency\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>The Cognitive Fluency Effect (again)<\/h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s another aspect of cognitive fluency that I want to cover, where the difficulty of reading or absorbing the information is transferred onto the process it is describing.<\/p>\n<p>So in other words, it&#8217;s not just about the exact words you use in your copy, but how that copy appears to the eye.<\/p>\n<p>So in the example\u00a0UXmatters gives, people were asked to choose between two phones. For one group, the information about the phones was presented in an easy-to-read font. For the other group, it was in a more difficult font.<\/p>\n<p>For the difficult font group,\u00a041% postponed their decision.\u00a0For the easy font group, only 17% of postponed the decision.<\/p>\n<h3>How to use it in copywriting<\/h3>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, these tips have more of a design focus.<\/p>\n<p><strong>18. Present information clearly<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The first is that\u00a0the more difficult it is to obtain the information for a decision, the more difficult the decision will appear to be. This is why pricing pages and cognitive fluency have a bit of a turbulent relationship. It&#8217;s essential to make sure your pricing page copy is easy to understand and visually organized in a way that supports decision-making.<\/p>\n<p>Check out this example by Semplice.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/psychology-copywriting-pricing-page-cognitive-fluency.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"431\" alt=\"copywriting psychology - example of pricing page with cognitive fluency\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>There&#8217;s more information on that\u00a0page, of course. But this is the primary visual on the page, and its simplicity in both design and copy helps the reader get oriented and understand their options right away. Now, they don&#8217;t have to dig through the details to come up with a potential decision. They can have a decision in mind and then read on to gather more details.<\/p>\n<p><strong>19. Describe easy processes&#8230;easily<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The other implication of the Cognitive Fluency Effect is that\u00a0the\u00a0more difficult it is to read instructions\u00a0for a task, the more difficult we perceive the task to be. I&#8217;ve seen plenty of emails and websites where a business says\u00a0&#8220;[Doing X] is easy!&#8221; and then plunges you into a sea of words. This is just one mild example:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/psychology-copywriting-cognitive-fluency-pain-free-process.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"318\" alt=\"copywriting psychology - example of pain free process\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>A numbered list within a numbered list, followed by a bulleted list = not easy<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If you want your readers to believe that it&#8217;s easy, you need to make your copy concise and easy to digest. You can always add more details in a subsequent section on the page, or link to a longer page. For example:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/psychology-copywriting-cognitive-fluency-web-design-example.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"270\" alt=\"copywriting psychology - example of getting started is easy\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Of course, there is a lot more that goes into partnering with a website design agency, but I don&#8217;t care what anyone says\u2014you can always simplify a complex process down into three to five core steps.<br \/>\n<a id=\"fonts\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>20. Use easy-to-read fonts<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you want to convey that a process is easy, you also must make sure the font you use is easy to process. Studies have proven that when people read a simple set of instructions for a particular process, the more difficult the font, the more time they estimate the task to take.<\/p>\n<p>For example using the font in the red box? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/16\/copywriting-mistakes\">Big copywriting mistake<\/a>:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/psychology-copywriting-cognitive-fluency-taxes.png\" width=\"409\" height=\"295\" alt=\"copywriting psychology - example of instructions with good and bad fonts\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>The more difficult the font, the more difficult the process your copy is\u00a0describing is perceived to be.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a id=\"truth\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>The\u00a0Illusory Truth Effect<\/h2>\n<p>Don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;re not tricking our readers with this effect.<\/p>\n<h3>What it is<\/h3>\n<p>The Illusory Truth Effect says that the more often we are exposed to a message, the more important our brain perceives it to be, and the truer it becomes. In <a href=\"http:\/\/www.acrwebsite.org\/volumes\/v33\/v33_10345.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one study<\/a>, survey participants were asked to rate a particular statement according to how trustworthy it was. Participants who had been exposed to that statement multiple times were more likely to rate it as true than those who had been exposed only once.<\/p>\n<p>So basically, brainwashing. But like I said, that&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re doing with our copy here.<\/p>\n<h3>How to use it in copywriting<\/h3>\n<p>Your goal is not to convince your readers of an illusory truth. Use this effect to\u00a0drive home important messages that support your product, service, or brand.<\/p>\n<p><strong>21. Use repetition<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Take this example from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thoughtspot.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ThoughtSpot<\/a>. Whether you&#8217;re on their homepage, browsing Facebook, or scrolling through LinkedIn, you see the same thing repeated over and over: &#8220;Dashboards are dead.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/psychology-copywriting-illusory-truth-thoughtspot.png\" width=\"631\" height=\"578\" alt=\"copywriting psychology - example of illusory truth effect\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Of course, data dashboards are far from dead. And\u00a0ThoughtSpot is not trying to trick you into believing otherwise. Rather, their product makes true the fact that\u00a0there are better ways to report on your data these days. And with repetition throughout their assets, they are building this truth in your mind.<\/p>\n<p><strong>22. Be consistent<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You also don&#8217;t have to repeat the same exact statement over and over. You can consistently convey the same <em>message<\/em> over and over using <em>different<\/em> <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/13\/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing\">words and phrases.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a gander through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.referralcandy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ReferralCandy&#8217;s<\/a> Twitter feed, Facebook page, blog posts, and homepage.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/psychology-copywrwiting-referral-candy-consistent-messaging.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" alt=\"copywriting psychology tips - example of consistent messaging for cognitive fluency\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Though each piece of copy is different, there is one central message getting repeated here: ReferralCandy wants to help you make and save money.

Like, finding out what happens at the end of [the latest show you&#8217;re binge-watching on Netflix].<\/p>\n<p>The brain longs to close loops. This is why we get curious. Love stories. Click on clickbait.<\/p>\n<h3>How to use it in copywriting<\/h3>\n<p>So in copywriting, open loops are basically teasers, and there are lots of ways to insert them into your content. The idea is to provide just enough information to pique interest, but not enough to close the loop.<\/p>\n<p><strong>23. Use &#8220;one&#8221; in your titles<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The Number <strong>One<\/strong> Reason You&#8217;re Not Getting Hired<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>This <strong>One<\/strong> Simple Strategy Increased Our Conversion Rate 20%<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>Want to Run the Perfect Event? Avoid This <strong>One<\/strong> Mistake<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Of course, you&#8217;ll want the outcome to be compelling as well. So in this YouTube video title, we read &#8220;How we used this one simple strategy to generate 43,000 leads for our business in 10 months.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/psychology-copywriting-open-loop-youtube-video-example.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"124\" alt=\"copywriting psychology - example of youtube title with open loops\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>And what&#8217;s great about this type of title is that you don&#8217;t have to focus on one thing in your video or blog post. For example, you can provide one mistake and then give X\u00a0tips on how to avoid it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>24. Include your favorite<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When you&#8217;re sharing a list of tips, strategies, examples, or mistakes, add your favorite one to the title. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>8 Free Resources to Learn How to Invest <strong>(#6 is Our Favorite!)<\/strong><\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>15 Common Mistakes Developers Make <strong>(Brace Yourself for #4 )<\/strong><\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>12 Yoga Poses to Improve Your Sleep <strong>(#7 is a Life Changer)<\/strong><\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>25. Take the &#8220;find out&#8221; approach<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re trying to get someone to sign up for a webinar or\u00a0download an ebook, take the approach of &#8220;find out [why, how, when, etc.]&#8221;<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/psychology-copywriting-open-loop-email-example.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"665\" alt=\"copywriting psychology - example of email with open loops\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In this example, you learn that by signing up for the webinar, you can close those open loops that your brain is now itching to close. You&#8217;ll find out <em>why<\/em> more than 20% of marketing emails reach the inbox. And <em>why<\/em> click-throughs only represent 1\/4 of total responses. And how subscribers <em>really<\/em> feel about email relevance. Great work Validity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>26. Throw some loops into your blog post intros<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So as I demonstrated in this post, you can throw in little open loops to keep readers engaged in the current piece of content. Use phrases like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>But we&#8217;ll get to that later<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>Which we&#8217;ll\u00a0soon learn was a big mistake<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Or start off your blog post with a novel-style opener.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>So there I was&#8230;<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>And that&#8217;s when I realized I&#8230;<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>I never meant to&#8230;<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Use psychology to improve your copywriting<\/h2>\n<p>Use these tips and psychological effects to write copy that builds your brand, earns your readers&#8217; trust, and makes for a positive experience overall. Let&#8217;s sum it all up:<\/p>\n<h3>The psychological effects:<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pratfall Effect: <\/strong>Your likeability will increase if you\u2019re not perfect.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Novelty Effect: <\/strong>The event of a change affects performance rather than the change itself.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Priming Effect:<\/strong> Words subconsciously prime

<\/strong>We&#8217;re more likely to do something if we&#8217;re told we don&#8217;t have to do it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Primacy\/Recency Effect: <\/strong>We remember the first and last items in a
