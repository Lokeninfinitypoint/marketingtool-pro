All of my ecommerce counterparts have been ramping up and stressing out about Black Friday, Cyber Monday, shipping dates, and more. While I did occasionally have a little bit of FOMO from all that excitement, I must admit, it\u2019s kinda nice not having to stress that much about sales numbers on any single day of the year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/holiday-ppc-advertising-meme.jpg\" alt=\"holiday ppc advertising - meme of robert downey jr. giving a sigh of relief\" width=\"379\" height=\"454\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76435 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/holiday-ppc-advertising-meme.jpg 379w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/holiday-ppc-advertising-meme-250x300.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 379px) 100vw, 379px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>That feeling when the holidays are right around the corner, but you&#8217;re not advertising for an ecommerce business.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span>Now, just because lead generation campaigns don\u2019t have all those same hallmarks of the holiday season (see what I did there?) doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t strategies you can employ to make the most of your holiday season.

It\u2019s almost never a bad idea to fill a gap your competitor leaves behind, so if they are thinking or planning on pausing, you might be able to take advantage of the lower competition and win some incremental business during the most wonderful season of the year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc40 See how your competitors approach advertising year-round with our latest <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteGoogleAdsBenchmarks2023.html?cid=Web_WS_incontent_guide_2023benchmarks_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incontent_links\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search ad industry benchmark report<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h3><span>People are usually active during the holidays<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>For better or worse, time with family around the holidays also usually leads to more scrolling time on your phone.

The same is true if you were to pause campaigns or cut budgets way back during the holidays. This should deter you from making large changes to your account this season.

Maybe your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/05\/best-call-to-action-phrases\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">call to action<\/a> is to request a callback or a custom quote.

If your typical messaging says \u201cCustom Quote in 24 Hours or Less\u201d and someone fills out the form on Wednesday at 5 p.m., are you really going to get them that quote before 5 p.m. on Thursday? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Think about the expectations you set for your potential customer. Make sure your calendar link has any holidays (or days you\u2019ll be out of the office) blocked off and ensure everyone is on the same page.\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span>2.

If you don\u2019t have softer calls to action to use, can you push out the timeframe for the follow-ups? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Maybe you set your Calendly link to only have openings starting in January. Maybe your<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/03\/ad-copy-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> ad copy<\/a> says to get in touch now to reserve your spot in the new year.
