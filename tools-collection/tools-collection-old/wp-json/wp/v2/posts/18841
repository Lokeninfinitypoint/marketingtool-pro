No other advertiser can use your brand in their copy (it\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adwordspolicy\/answer\/6118?hl=en\">against Google\u2019s guidelines<\/a>) and it\u2019s unlikely that a competitor\u2019s using your name in their URL or on a landing page.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/how-quality-score-impacts-cost-per-click-google-ads.png\" alt=\"how quality score impacts cost per click\" width=\"504\" height=\"366\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61091\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/how-quality-score-impacts-cost-per-click-google-ads.png 504w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/how-quality-score-impacts-cost-per-click-google-ads-480x357.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 504px, 100vw\" \/><\/div>\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum, it\u2019s almost impossible to get a Quality Score of 10 when bidding on your competitor\u2019s name; for New Balance to outrank Nike on a search for \u201cNike,\u201d they\u2019re going to have to pay an arm and a leg.<\/p>\n<p>Between the poles of brand and competitor, we can split keywords into two groups: low intent (typically informational or navigational searches) and high intent (commercially relevant keywords, the ones that lead to conversions, the backbone of your AdWords account. Need I go on?). Both are important to your overall AdWords success (if you use remarketing, cheaper low intent keywords are a great way to create audiences and drive conversions down the road), but treating them as equals is a waste of your time and money.<\/p>\n<p>With that, let\u2019s look at what a solid Quality Score looks like for each type of keyword (and talk about how to improve them if you\u2019re missing the mark).<\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s a Good Quality Score for Branded Keywords? 8+<\/h2>\n<p>Even though your website should be the first thing that shows up in the organic results when someone searches for your business, there\u2019s a big old chunk of real estate above the organic listings that your competitors are welcome to claim. (And the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/12\/mobile-branded-searches\">above the fold real estate on brand searches looks even more commercial on mobile devices<\/a>.) Fortunately for you, competitors need to pay a premium to do so.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, many of them are ready and willing.<\/p>\n<p>For this reason, you need to bid on your own keywords. The required investment is small\u2014especially compared to some of those high intent keywords (we\u2019ll get to them in a minute)\u2014but dominating the SERP pays dividends. <strong>You can basically sleep your way to a high Quality Score for branded campaigns.<\/strong> That means if you\u2019re not seeing at least an 8, something has gone horribly wrong (don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s fixable).<\/p>\n<p>Think about the contributing factors. The expected CTR should be <em>high<\/em> since the search was for your brand (intent city) and your ad couldn\u2019t be more relevant. The only potential detractor is landing page experience, which is impacted by a combination of content, structure, and load time.<\/p>\n<p>Check out this New Balance ad that surfaces when I search for the brand and nothing more (can you tell I love leisurewear sneakers yet?).<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/branded-keyword-quality-score-serp-example-1.png\" alt=\"example serp for branded keywords showing quality score\" width=\"600\" height=\"316\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The copy isn\u2019t salesy outside of an obligatory \u201cshop now\u201d in the description. The rest of the ad speaks to the brand\u2019s heritage (\u201cSince 1906,\u201d \u201cFor more than 100 years\u201d) and ad extensions are used to share additional value propositions and links to high-traffic pages.<\/p>\n<p>Guess what? You can do this, too.<\/p>\n<p>Simply speaking to your prospects and sending them to a relevant location will yield a high <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-quality-score\">Quality Score<\/a>, making your branded keywords dirt cheap on a CPC basis.<\/p>\n<h3>Tips to Improve Quality Score for Branded Keywords<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure that your landing page loads quickly with the <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/speed\/pagespeed\/insights\/\">Google PageSpeed<\/a> Insights tool.<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t be afraid to tout your brand\u2019s distinguishing factors in your headlines, even if it means relegating your CTA to the description .<\/li>\n<li>To dominate the SERP, add as many <em>relevant<\/em> ad extensions to your branded campaigns as you can; this will help prospects navigate to more relevant pages and push competitors further down the page.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What\u2019s a Good Quality Score for High-Intent Keywords? 7-9<\/h2>\n<p>High-intent commercial keywords are the most important subset of keywords in your AdWords account. They also tend to be the most expensive. <strong>As a result, high-intent keywords are the area in which maximizing Quality Score will have the greatest impact on performance.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re a merchant of $15 skinny jeans or $25,000 software, high-intent keywords are those search terms that convey clear intent to do X, where X is your conversion objective.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you sell flowers online and, two days before his mother\u2019s 49th birthday, a terribly forgetful son needs to send something that will elicit a smile. He types \u201cbuy flowers online\u201d into Google and sees\u2026<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/high-intent-keyword-quality-score-serp-example.png\" alt=\"keywords with high commercial intent are the place to focus your quality score optimization efforts\" width=\"700\" height=\"532\" \/><\/div>\n<p>What do you notice about these ads? What do they have in common?<\/p>\n<p>The ads are relevant and feature CTA\u2019s for days.<\/p>\n<p>Even 1-800-Flowers (who have brand recognition for days) uses the search term in their copy. You\u2019ll also notice a smattering of dollar signs and deals, all of which exist to entice a searcher into clicking. These advertisers are specifically attempting to improve their expected CTR for the term \u201cbuy flowers online.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Before Google even considers the landing page experience component of the Quality Score calculation, each of these advertisers has made a concerted effort to optimize for ad relevance and CTR. This means that two-thirds of the contributing factors are accounted for, <strong>making a QS of 6 or 7 attainable through diligent ad testing and good account structure alone.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Landing pages are trickier to tackle from a resources perspective, but if you can ensure speed <em>and<\/em> relevance, you\u2019re going to please Google\u2019s algorithm. For your high-intent keywords, try to build out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/03\/the-case-against-skags\">single keyword ad groups<\/a> and implement ad group level landing pages. While this can be a major hassle (not to mention expensive), ensuring semantic relevance and fast load times is the best way to improve this crucial component of your Quality Score. For the keywords most likely to impact your bottom line, it\u2019s totally worth it.<\/p>\n<h3>Tips to Improve High-Intent Keyword Quality Score<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Use Single Keyword Ad Groups (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/29\/single-theme-ad-groups\">SKAGs<\/a>) to isolate high intent terms. This gives you more control over your bid and allows you to implement the exact term in your ad copy.<\/li>\n<li>Have dedicated landing pages in place for your most valuable keywords.<\/li>\n<li>Include your target keyword in your ad at least twice, but don\u2019t overdo it! I suggest using it in the first headline and again in the URL paths; use a related term in the description to add emphasis without coming off as spammy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What\u2019s a Good Quality Score for Low-Intent Keywords? 7<\/h2>\n<p>Low-intent keywords aren\u2019t unimportant. In fact, they form the foundation of any great remarketing campaign (and can be used to forge successful Lookalike audiences in Facebook). That being said, most SMBs and overworked agencies simply don\u2019t have the time to push Quality Scores to 10 across the board.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you\u2019re running the AdWords account for an online MBA program. This is a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/27\/most-expensive-keywords\">ridiculously expensive niche,<\/a> with stiff competition and CPC\u2019s commonly exceeding $30.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/low-intent-keyword-quality-score-serp-exmaple.png\" alt=\"though important to the top of your sales funnel low intent keywords should be optimized after high commercial intent keywords\" width=\"700\" height=\"551\" \/><\/div>\n<p>That\u2019s why I\u2019m suggesting you set a more realistic target: <strong>aim for a Quality Score of 7 on your non-branded, top-of-funnel keywords.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s baseline Quality Score of 6 is faux optimism on their part; it\u2019s almost guaranteed to go down from there as soon as you record a few hundred impressions. Why? Think back to those contributing factors again.<\/p>\n<p>Google cannot determine your CTR if a keyword is brand new. If you\u2019re lumping comparable keywords into a single ad group (instead of using the SKAG I mentioned earlier), you\u2019ll never maximize the landing page experience component outside of load time. That leaves only ad relevance, which can suffer from the same keyword oversaturation that may plague your ability to max out landing page performance.<\/p>\n<p>From a business value standpoint, it simply isn\u2019t worth your time and money to invest in trying to max out Quality Scores for informational or navigational keywords. That being said, you can make strides towards reaching a Quality Score of 7 for your low-intent keywords by crafting irresistible CTAs (like we talked about earlier) and ensuring a well-laid-out account structure.<\/p>\n<p>This means no more than 20 keywords per ad group. They need to be related by some common thread; whether that\u2019s semantic or thematic is your call, but ensuring similarity will allow you to ensure ad and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/01\/landing-page-relevance\">landing page relevance<\/a> without stretching yourself too thin.<\/p>\n<h3>Tips to Improve Quality Score for Low-Intent Keywords<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Try to implement campaign-level landing pages; this will ensure contextual relevance (allowing you to answer a prospects\u2019 questions) without getting too granular and wasting optimizing for terms that don\u2019t tie back to revenue.<\/li>\n<li>Split your keywords into tight, organized ad groups that can be more effectively tied to individual campaigns and landing pages.<\/li>\n<li>Outside of using a keyword (or close variant) in your ad copy, focus on improving CTR by testing CTA\u2019s in your first and second headlines.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What\u2019s a Good Quality Score for Competitor Keywords? 3+<\/h2>\n<p>Finally, we come to the most challenging subset of keywords (at least in terms of Quality Score): your competitors\u2019 branded terms.<\/p>\n<p>Everything that works in your favor when bidding on your own brand is now reversed; your lack of \u201crelevance,\u201d at least as Google sees it, means you need to bid up if you want to show up. <strong>A Quality Score of 3 or better in a competitor campaign means you\u2019re killing it. <\/strong>That\u2019s because your only real weapon\u2014outside of your own brand recognition\u2014is irresistible ad copy.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s dig into an example\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a SERP for the search query \u201cHubSpot\u201d:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/competitor-keyword-quality-score-serp-example.png\" alt=\"it's difficult to optimize quality score for competitor keywords but focus on expected ctr with compelling headlines\" width=\"700\" height=\"326\" \/><\/div>\n<p>HubSpot doesn\u2019t have an ad on this page, but they\u2019re the first organic result (remember what I said about all that real estate?

One is attempting to trick Google\u2019s Quality Score algorithm (and searchers, for that matter) by implanting an alternate spelling of HubSpot. Don\u2019t do this. While it may save you a buck, it may result in ad disapproval or suspension (plus the dishonesty is a bit uncouth).<\/p>\n<p>Instead, focus all your efforts on crafting headlines that can\u2019t be ignored and CTA\u2019s that make your competitors\u2019 offering look obsolete.<\/p>\n<h3>Tips to Improve Your Quality Scores for Competitor Keywords<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/08\/rlsa\">Use RLSA<\/a> to increase bids for searchers who have already visited your website; they\u2019re worth paying a bit more for because their search habits indicate that they\u2019re shopping around.<\/li>\n<li>Test your CTAs constantly to find out what maximizes CTR: this is the key to a QS 3 or higher.<\/li>\n<li>Say something outlandish in your first headline to draw attention away from the organic search results.<\/li>\n<li>Find <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/09\/competitor-keywords\">keywords your competitors are bidding on<\/a> that <em>aren&#8217;t<\/em> brand terms.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Improving your Quality Scores isn\u2019t a one-time thing: it\u2019s a constant process.
