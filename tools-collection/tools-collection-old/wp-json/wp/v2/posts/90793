Gather customer insights from everywhere<\/h3>\n<p>Understanding your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">target audience<\/a> is critical for lead generation. It\u2019s also really time-consuming. There are so many sources of high-value customer intel\u2014like social media feeds, news reports, and online forums\u2014that it\u2019s hard for a human to sort through them all.<\/p>\n<p>AI tools are extremely handy here. You can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-experiments\">prompt your AI<\/a> to dig through the far reaches of the internet to find specific insights about your target customers. Then, use that information to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/facebook-ad-targeting\">target ads<\/a> more precisely, create more relevant lead-gen content, and more.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/abbiemood\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Abbie Mood<\/a>, marketing director at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.velocityadvisorygroup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Velocity Advisory Group<\/a>, shared an example of how she uses AI for customer research. She starts by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/08\/chatgpt-prompts\">prompting ChatGPT<\/a> with this:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cWhat are the questions [your target audience] ask most frequently about [topic\/service\/program]? Look for them on social sites, forums, Reddit, Quora, and other places where [your target audience] asks questions. Find as many as possible. Then, categorize them and rank-stack them by frequency.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>She then follows up with this prompt so the output is easier to process and use:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cFormat the report with a table at the top summarizing your findings. Then, make each category a heading to be followed by a quick summary of what you found for that category and about a dozen bullets of direct quotes you found that represent that category.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Abbie said she uses these insights and quotes to guide new blog posts, lead generation assets, and FAQ copy.<\/p>\n<p>Another approach is to analyze a specific, long forum discussion. Say you market calendar management software. You could ask an AI like Google Gemini to review a large <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ios\/comments\/197kwxt\/whats_everyones_preferred_calendar_app\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reddit thread<\/a> (e.g., 253 responses) and answer:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Which app is mentioned most positively?<\/li>\n<li>Which app is mentioned most negatively?<\/li>\n<li>Which features do people say they like the most?<\/li>\n<li>Which features do they wish they had?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Scan the feedback and use it to shape your lead-gen copy around the likes, dislikes, and pain points mentioned.<\/p>\n<p>Before prompting an AI tool, be clear about the specific lead-gen challenge you&#8217;re solving. Want better ad targeting? Ask for details about the people posting, such as their industry, location, use case, etc.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 <strong>Need to catch up quickly on AI?<\/strong> Download the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/emergency-ai-guide?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_AIMarketing_Download\">Emergency Guide to AI in Marketing<\/a> now.<\/p>\n<div id=\"supercharge-inbound-lead-generation-on-social-media\">\n<h3>2. Supercharge inbound lead generation on social media<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/05\/inbound-marketing-examples\">Inbound lead generation<\/a> is a fantastic strategy to supplement your paid ads efforts on social media. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/social-media-strategy\">Social media<\/a> content, like educational posts, goes out into the digital world and attracts people who are likely to use what you sell.<\/p>\n<p>So, how do you have the time to post enough on social media to please algorithms and attract leads?<\/p>\n<p>AI platforms, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-copywriting-tools\">generative copywriting tools<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/best-ai-photo-generators\">image creators<\/a>, accelerate content creation for social. When used as assistants, they help you get in front of more people while keeping your brand voice intact.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur link-building agency runs entirely on inbound,\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/zapisotskyi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Andriy Zapisotskyi<\/a>, founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/growthmate.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GrowthMate<\/a>, said. \u201cIt\u2019s powered by referrals and consistent, strategic <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/social-selling\">social selling<\/a> on LinkedIn. AI helps us do this faster, better, and at scale, without losing the personal touch.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One example Andriy gave was using AI to help write new social media posts based on what he and others have written in the past. \u201cI use <a href=\"https:\/\/scripe.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Scripe<\/a>, an AI tool that analyzes my tone, past posts, and thought leaders I follow, to generate authentic hooks and outlines,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt also taps into our internal library of case studies and insights, cutting content creation time in half.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/ai-lead-generation-wordstream-scripe-png.avif\" alt=\"AI lead generation - Scripe screenshot.\" width=\"936\" height=\"522\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90797 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/ai-lead-generation-wordstream-scripe-png.avif 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/ai-lead-generation-wordstream-scripe-300x167.avif 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/ai-lead-generation-wordstream-scripe-768x428.avif 768w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/ai-lead-generation-wordstream-scripe-480x268.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I especially love the bit about tapping into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/03\/how-to-write-a-case-study\">case studies<\/a>. Good case studies are absolute gold mines for lead gen because they highlight how your solutions have helped people in the past. Using AI to find contextually appropriate results from dozens of them to bake into a blog or <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/engaging-posts-on-social-media\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media post<\/a> is next-level genius.<\/p>\n<p>Coming up with new content ideas is another bottleneck that AI solves. Andriy uses <a href=\"https:\/\/chatgpt.com\/g\/g-CMe30GbB0-topic-gpt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Topic-GPT<\/a>, a custom GPT that returns 20 categorized ideas based on a given topic.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/ai-lead-generation-wordstream-topic-gpt-png.avif\" alt=\"AI lead generation -ideation on Topic-GPT.\" width=\"553\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90798 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/ai-lead-generation-wordstream-topic-gpt-png.avif 553w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/ai-lead-generation-wordstream-topic-gpt-277x300.avif 277w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/ai-lead-generation-wordstream-topic-gpt-480x521.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Notice how it also categorizes each idea by objective and content type.

It can also help create multiple variations of marketing assets for different audience segments quickly.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/bhavesh-gabani-6175014a\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bhavesh Gabani<\/a>, co-founder at <a href=\"https:\/\/designwiz.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DesignWiz<\/a>, shared a review of how a local business recently used their product for this purpose.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey used the AI Flyer Generator from DesignWiz to launch a targeted, lead-gen campaign for a home cleaning service,\u201d Bhavesh said. \u201cThe goal was to promote a limited-time \u2018first clean free\u2019 offer and capture qualified leads in different neighborhoods.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The tricky part is that the cleaning business needed multiple versions of the flyer quickly. Each one had to promote a service for different property types like apartments, townhomes, or large, single-family residences. That meant using different copy and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-image-prompt-tips\">images<\/a> to highlight a variety of pain points and be more relevant for each segment.<\/p>\n<p>Using AI made this possible without stretching the business&#8217;s budget or bandwidth.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/ai-lead-generation-wordstream-designwiz-2-png.avif\" alt=\"AI lead generation - screenshot from DesighWiz.\" width=\"936\" height=\"302\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90801 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/ai-lead-generation-wordstream-designwiz-2-png.avif 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/ai-lead-generation-wordstream-designwiz-2-300x97.avif 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/ai-lead-generation-wordstream-designwiz-2-768x248.avif 768w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/ai-lead-generation-wordstream-designwiz-2-480x155.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>They even added a QR code that linked to a short intake form customers could use to schedule a free estimate.<\/p>\n<p>Physical copies of the flyers made their way to each neighborhood, and digital versions landed in Facebook community groups. \u201cThe result was a strong response, with a noticeable uptick in inquiries and conversions,\u201d Bhavesh said.<\/p>\n<p>Audience segmentation and marketing personalization are especially tough for local businesses that often don\u2019t keep a full-time marketer on staff. This use case for AI is a game changer that\u2019ll let local service providers make their lead generation efforts more effective.<\/p>\n<p>You can use similar tactics to personalize emails and texts with AI tools. There are even <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/ai-lead-management\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lead management tools<\/a> that use AI to automatically segment your audience and nurture them based on where they are in the funnel, allowing you to follow up quickly and reach prospects at the exact time they\u2019re ready to convert.<\/p>\n<div id=\"use-ai-to-create-lead-generating-free-tools\"><\/div>\n<h3>4.

That\u2019s why discounts or free resources are so effective at it.<\/p>\n<p>Free online tools are one of the best options for delivering value. People love them and will often use them over and over. One of the newer ways to use AI for lead generation is to build free tools without learning to write code.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/deian-isac\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deian Isac<\/a>, agency success and marketing at<a href=\"https:\/\/spp.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Service Provider Pro<\/a>, has used this strategy prolifically with great results.

Deian placed some of his on an SEO-friendly \u201cFree Tools\u201d page that\u2019ll attract leads through search.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/ai-lead-generation-wordstream-free-tool-page-png.avif\" alt=\"AI lead generation -screenshot from the SPP website tools page.\" width=\"936\" height=\"536\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90802 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/ai-lead-generation-wordstream-free-tool-page-png.avif 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/ai-lead-generation-wordstream-free-tool-page-300x172.avif 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/ai-lead-generation-wordstream-free-tool-page-768x440.avif 768w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/ai-lead-generation-wordstream-free-tool-page-480x275.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/spp.co\/tools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>AI makes building these free tools really easy.

Install a <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">chatbot<\/span> AI agent<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/chatbots\">Chatbots<\/a> act like little customer service specialists and salespeople that work around the clock to convert website visitors into leads. They\u2019re not new, but they have evolved way beyond simply answering FAQs.<\/p>\n<p>Now, a modern <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-agents\">AI agent<\/a> can engage in conversation with a website visitor, offer contextually accurate responses, and learn from interactions to improve future results. If you haven\u2019t seen what this new breed of AI agents can do, it might be a good time to check them out.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/munjalharpreet\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hapreet Munjal<\/a>, founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/loudgrowth.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LoudGrowth<\/a>, shared a compelling example of how effective modern chatbots can be. \u201cFor one of our B2B clients, we developed an AI chatbot to personalize each customer&#8217;s [website] experience,\u201d he said. \u201cThe chatbot does a predictive analysis by analyzing how a person interacts with the website and the kind of pages and content they look for.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The agent asks questions to learn even more about each visitor. Then it provides solutions based on what it learns. Harpreet says that just deploying the bot bumped the client&#8217;s MQLs up by around 40%.<\/p>\n<p>AI agents sound a little far-fetched for a small business, but they\u2019ve become a lot more accessible. <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/ai-lead-management\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dash by LocaliQ&#8217;s AI agent<\/a>, for example, instantly replies to incoming text messages in natural language and guides people through the sales process.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/dmsnext-sms-feature.png\" width=\"976\" height=\"890\" class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"ai-lead-generation-ideas-from-reddit-and-linkedin\"><\/div>\n<h2>3 more AI lead generation ideas from Reddit and LinkedIn<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s no surprise that marketers are talking about how to use AI to generate more leads in online forums. Here are a few of the strategies they shared.<\/p>\n<div id=\"identify-new-ways-to-target-your-marketing\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. Identify new ways to target your customers<\/h3>\n<p>AI excels at identifying patterns and connections. Use it to find new leads who are very <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/get-more-customers-like-best-customer\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">similar to your current best customers<\/a> (and therefore more likely to buy).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/levente-k%C3%B3tka-3495572b1\/overlay\/about-this-profile\/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3B1GoN3TL6Qr2G5%2BX6mRCmbA%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Levente K\u00f3tka<\/a>, CEO and founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.innobotz.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">InnoBotZ<\/a>, briefly mentioned this idea in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/posts\/levente-k%C3%B3tka-3495572b1_ai-leadgeneration-automation-activity-7315962657407229952-sLdV?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAfpBUkBZn1g_3AT-AQ7-zTMTBRIIDRYtto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn post<\/a>. His method is to have AI review data from your customer CRM to find not-so-obvious similarities they share. Then, you can apply those characteristics to refine your targeting.<\/p>\n<p>Try applying the same logic to other types of customer and website visitor data. For example, AI can track how people interact with your website before they decide to buy. As it identifies patterns that suggest buying intent, it can trigger perfectly timed outreach with a personalized offer to close the deal<\/p>\n<div id=\"build-custom-gpts-for-your-lead-generation-needs\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. Build custom GPTs for a variety of content creation jobs<\/h3>\n<p>We talked about how you can use AI to accelerate lead-gen content creation. But sometimes your unique needs can\u2019t be met with the generic version of an AI tool. That\u2019s where custom GPTs come in.<\/p>\n<p>A custom GPT is basically like your own personal ChatGPT, designed specifically for your business and use case. It knows how to write for your brand and situation because you train it with information like your FAQs, policies, product pages, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI find that AI can get really flummoxed if you give it too many seemingly related tasks,\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/curtwoodward\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Curt Woodward<\/a>, content director at <a href=\"http:\/\/zoominfo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ZoomInfo<\/a>, recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/posts\/curtwoodward_behold-my-robot-army-this-week-activity-7315827969627738112-tUmr?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAfpBUkBZn1g_3AT-AQ7-zTMTBRIIDRYtto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted on LinkedIn<\/a>. \u201cIt starts crossing the streams and can&#8217;t give you the right format. So, I just keep the work in chunks and treat the GPTs we train on specific output formats as limited-purpose bots.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>You can create a custom GPT to do almost any job. Here are a few examples Curt shared:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Customer Story Bot:<\/strong> Generates a first draft of a case study from a customer interview.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Case Study Wrapup Wranger:<\/strong> Creates the first draft of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/09\/how-to-write-a-blog-post\">blog post<\/a> or ebook based on several case studies from the same use case.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Executive Voice:<\/strong> a content creation GPT that\u2019s trained using top executives\u2019 interview transcripts and published writings to quickly turn around new material in their voices.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Custom GPTs are surprisingly easy to create.

Use predictive analytics to get more leads through email<\/h3>\n<p>No matter how far along marketing tech goes, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/03\/email-marketing-best-practices\">email<\/a> holds its place as one of the best lead generation and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/lead-nurturing-emails\">nurturing channels<\/a> available. To nudge up your email marketing success, try using AI predictive analytics.<\/p>\n<p>Predictive analytics AI constantly monitors how people interact with your emails. Then, it makes suggestions based on that behavior to help improve your results.<\/p>\n<p>One <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DigitalMarketing\/comments\/1joskam\/what_are_some_success_stories_of_using_ai_in\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reddit user posted<\/a> how they used predictive analytics to boost their open rates by 35% and revenue from email campaigns by 50%.<\/p>\n<p>In the example, they used AI to predict two things: the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/best-time-to-send-email-campaign\">best time to send an email<\/a> and which subscribers were most likely to engage with it.<\/p>\n<p>That second point is really interesting. It\u2019s like dynamically <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/13\/targeted-email-marketing-strategies\">segmenting your audience<\/a> with each email send. Each message is only sent to people who will likely enjoy it. That\u2019ll not only boost open rates, but it could also reduce unsubscribes and keep your emails out of spam folders.<\/p>\n<p>Combine that with the hyper-personalization we mentioned before, and you\u2019ll see how AI can transform your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-email-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">email marketing strategy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>AI is the lead-generation equalizer<\/h2>\n<p>AI lets even a tiny marketing team do things that were once solely accessible to big brands with deep pockets. A marketing team of one, for example, could never before really personalize hundreds of outreach emails using up-to-the-minute industry insights (and don&#8217;t forget to create an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-policy\">AI policy<\/a> and review these <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/ai-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI stats<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>The lead-gen tips on this list are great examples of this. They show that with a little creativity, an AI tool can be a huge force multiplier, increasing lead gen many times over without overtaxing a small team.
