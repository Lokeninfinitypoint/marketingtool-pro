Stay consistent and extend your high-performing ads<\/h2>\n<p>Facebook <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2020\/03\/coronavirus\/#ad-and-content-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recently warned<\/a> advertisers that due to recent staffing changes there will likely be some delays and errors as they increase their reliance on automated systems to review new ads and commerce listings. This means that when new ads are submitted or edited (e.g., <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/02\/marketing-during-covid-19\">changing copy<\/a>, headlines, images, audience targeting), it will cause the ad to undergo a new review policy.

Build brand awareness with your online audience<\/h2>\n<p>With more consumers at home, we\u2019ll likely see more consumers browsing online to pass the time.

Find new leads and build your email marketing list with Facebook lead ads<\/h2>\n<p>If your business is a service-based, online, and\/or local based business, chances are you send emails to keep your audiences engaged and up to date via newsletters. If your business is slow or closed right now, this could be a great time to shift your strategy to collecting new leads and emails in place of promoting sales.<\/p>\n<p>With a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/24\/facebook-lead-ad-examples\">Facebook lead ad<\/a> campaign, you have the opportunity to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pique interest with content.<\/li>\n<li>Increase leads and signups for email newsletter campaigns.<\/li>\n<li>Create an audience to remarket to at a future date.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For example: If you\u2019re in the fitness industry, this could be a good opportunity for you to promote a 30-day challenge that your audience could subscribe to. Or, if you sell products, you could have your audience subscribe to be the first to know whenever there are any upcoming promotions, new product launches, and any other important business updates.<\/p>\n<p>A few things to note:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>When creating your lead gen form, less is more. Consumers are more likely to opt out with the more information you ask from them. General best practice rule is to leave it no more than two fields, such as name and email address.<\/li>\n<li>Integrate with your CRM provider and set up your welcome newsletter to ensure that you immediately follow up with them with content related to your advertising campaign.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>4. Focus on remarketing campaigns<\/h2>\n<p>According to Barilliance, over 75% <a href=\"https:\/\/www.barilliance.com\/cart-abandonment-rate-statistics\/#tab-con-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">of shoppers will abandon your site<\/a> without completing their purchase. With increased browsing, now is a good time to re-engage with previous website visitors and get them back to your site with an incentive like \u2018free shipping,\u2019 and special promos.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a70220c6-4146-48bb-81ee-e9476229f5cc\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/covid-19-facebook-advertising-example-eschelon.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook advertising example\" width=\"491\" height=\"548\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>This is especially true for businesses experiencing increased traffic right now, like the at-home fitness and healthy delivery options.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2f5e40b9-8d86-4f67-a095-00994c25c949\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/covid-19-facebook-advertising-example-daily-harvest.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook advertising example\" width=\"494\" height=\"763\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>In addition to website visitors, you can also drive new potential leads and sales by testing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/1090330204367211?id=2469097953376494\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">engagement custom audiences<\/a>, which allow you to target users who have engaged with your content across Facebook and Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>This includes remarketing to those who have liked, commented on, shared, or interacted with your Facebook and Instagram business page, watched your videos, or viewed\/filled out a lead form. Remember, the more relevant you can get, the better engagement you will see, so segment your audience as much as possible.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Test new ad creative and audiences<\/h2>\n<p>Have you been wanting to test new ad creative to see if your audience engages better with specific imagery and messaging? If your business has slowed down or closed, now might be the time to test out a new creative on a variety of audiences to gather information that will make your future campaigns more effective.<\/p>\n<p>When testing new audiences, consider creating a new ad set rather than updating an existing one so that you can better understand the true impact. For new ad creative, you\u2019ll want to test against an already high-performing ad. This way you can compare the results directly to an ad that you know performs well for your specific business, saving you time when analyzing results.<\/p>\n<p>Pro Tip: You\u2019ll only want to test out one element at a time for a more accurate analysis. For example, if you want to test new imagery, don\u2019t make any changes to the headlines or copy. Give it a couple days and monitor performance.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few things you can try testing.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Audience targeting, demographic, interest-based, or custom audiences.<\/li>\n<li>Ad copy, including headlines and CTAs.<\/li>\n<li>Landing pages, including copy, design, and messaging.<\/li>\n<li>Ad creative, like images vs. videos.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And other media strategies bring me to #6&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>6. Try Facebook and Instagram Live<\/h2>\n<p>For local businesses who are hurting more than ever before, we suggest that you think about how you can shift your business strategy to offer your products and\/or services online to adjust to these unprecedented times. If that\u2019s not possible, getting online and in touch with your customers and prospects on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/31\/facebook-live-guide\">Facebook and Instagram Live<\/a> can still help.<\/p>\n<p>With live video, you can connect with your audience in a more direct and genuine way. Plus, we know that effective video marketing can result in higher conversions: Facebook and Instagram Live videos receive <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2016\/03\/news-feed-fyi-taking-into-account-live-video-when-ranking-feed\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">3x higher engagement than pre-recorded vide<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2016\/03\/news-feed-fyi-taking-into-account-live-video-when-ranking-feed\/\">os<\/a>. So grab your phone and start streaming to engage with your customers.<\/p>\n<p>People who are self-isolating or practicing social distancing will be seeking opportunities to connect with more people face to face. While this isn\u2019t in direct contact, it is a current solution offering the interaction and online experience your audience is craving. Try answering questions in real-time, offer online check-ins, webinars, online demos, and more to keep your audiences up to date with the latest your business has to offer.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"130ce98a-7882-49ce-aa88-79533cb78729\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/covid-19-facebook-advertising-live-videos.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook Live example\" width=\"248\" height=\"441\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>To execute a successful live event, make sure that your broadcast is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/facebookmedia\/blog\/tips-for-using-live\">as clear and high-resolution as possible<\/a>.
