Even if your business is not health-related, you are most likely incorporating the pandemic\u00a0into your content and messaging. Yet you are also most likely trying to figure out exactly how to stay relevant while also appropriate during such an unprecedented time. This guide was written to help you with that.

The goal of this guide is to help you adapt your messaging accordingly so you can continue purposeful,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/21\/client-communication-during-covid-19\"> quality communication with your audience<\/a> and stand strong with your customers. Let&#8217;s start with the most important one.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">Being sensitive<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/18\/covid-19-google-ads-data\">COVID-19 has impacted<\/a> individuals on a personal level world-wide, so\u00a0the risk of inadvertently coming off as insensitive or even exploitative is higher than ever right now. And with social media communication at a peak, one small mistake could mean far-reaching and long-term consequences for you. Follow these guidelines to make sure you&#8217;re communicating appropriately during the COVID-19 outbreak.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Better too serious than sorry<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">While\u00a0it\u2019s normally common and effective for brands to keep a conversational tone,\u00a0it\u2019s best to steer clear of using humor or wit to accomplish that right now. Even being overly casual\u00a0can be off-putting. Your content may not be as colorful or aligned with your brand personality, but it\u2019s far better to be more serious than you want to be\u00a0than to be more sorry than you can express.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">We recommend keeping a positive, inspirational, and helpful tone.

Improper grammar can undermine the validity of your facts, and even alter your message. For example, \u201cthe governor put a shelter in place for the city\u201d actually means a shelter was put into place and even implies a gathering. Small details matter. To clarify, for this example:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Shelter in place is a verb<\/span><\/strong> <span lang=\"EN\">(action)<em><span lang=\"EN\">: &#8220;We advise you to shelter in place.&#8221;<\/span><\/em><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\"><strong>Shelter-in-place is an adjective <\/strong>(description):<em><span lang=\"EN\">\u00a0&#8220;We&#8217;ve instated a shelter-in-place policy.&#8221;<\/span><\/em><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">And for your coronavirus-related copywriting in general, there are two great tools that we can suggest:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.apstylebook.com\/topical_most_recent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Topical Guide on COVID-19<\/a>: This simple yet super-helpful guide was created by the Associated Press to help with coverage of the coronavirus.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Grammarly<\/a>: This is a contextual editor that catches important fixes that slip past regular spell check. It\u2019s a free plugin you can download and use across all applications.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Checking up on details like this takes some extra time, and maybe <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/22\/free-marketing-during-covid-19\">your audience <\/a>will know what you meant, but better to be safe than sorry. Plus, COVID-19\u00a0isn\u2019t a trending topic; its effects are going to be long-lasting, so your content is likely to stay relevant for a while. Make sure it\u2019s as up to standard as the rest of your copywriting. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Stay optimistic, but don\u2019t overpromise<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">It\u2019s important to inspire hope and forward-thinking through your copywriting, but remember that this is an unprecedented situation; even expert predictions have questionable accuracy. All that you can promise your audience is that you\u2019ll stay committed to handling the situation and serving them the best way you can. Ensuring anything else, even if to keep up morale, could backfire on you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">Modifying your offers<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/20\/google-bans-government-documents-ads\">Google has banned advertising on travel-related services<\/a>, but there are still a lot of businesses that can, and should, advertise relevant services during\u00a0COVID-19. Just make sure to modify your copywriting so that calls to action are appropriate. Also, keep in mind that things are evolving fast, so keep your messaging as versatile as possible so you don\u2019t have to be constantly updating your copy. Here are some guidelines and suggestions for CTAs with respect to COVID-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Ease up on urgency<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">\u201cCall now\u201d or \u201cBook now\u201d buttons are fine; but excitement- or scarcity-driven copywriting, like \u201cDon\u2019t miss out!\u201d or \u201cGrab your spot before it\u2019s too late!\u201d is not going to resonate with consumers or businesses right now.
