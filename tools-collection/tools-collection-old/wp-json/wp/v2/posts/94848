Earlier this year, Google released AI Mode, a new user experience that will continue to change the SERP game. That announcement immediately prompted many people to ask, \u201cWhat will ads in AI Mode look like, and how can I get my ads to show there?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Google is now testing ads in AI Mode, so ahead of a larger rollout later this year, we want to give an overview of what AI Mode is, discuss the settings you need to employ to be included, and what that could mean for your advertising strategy moving forward.<\/p>\n<h3>Contents<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#what-is-google-ai-mode\">What is Google AI Mode?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#the-types-of-queries-best-suited-for-ai-mode-and-ai-overviews-ads\">The types of queries best suited for ads in AI Mode<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#requirements-to-show-ads-in-ai-mode-and-ai-overviews\">Requirements to show ads in AI Mode<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#what-could-ai-mode-mean-for-advertisers\">What could ads in AI Mode mean for businesses?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#should-you-be-focused-on-showing-ads-in-ai-mode\">Should you be focused on showing ads in AI Mode?<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"what-is-google-ai-mode\"><\/div>\n<h2>What is AI Mode in Google?<\/h2>\n<p>AI Mode is a self-contained search experience designed to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-experiments\">use AI<\/a> in a conversation-type experience to answer complex queries. It\u2019s powered by <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-use-google-bard\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gemini<\/a>, Google\u2019s largest and most capable AI model, and compared to normal search, which is more of a one-and-done type of experience, AI Mode is intended to drive further research and learning with multiple rounds of questions or query refinement. It will then deliver a range of information based on how that exchange goes.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/google-ai-mode-example.webp\" alt=\"example of google ai mode with query for how to fix sink\" width=\"900\" height=\"519\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-94858\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/google-ai-mode-example.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/google-ai-mode-example-480x277.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As a quick aside, here\u2019s the next question we almost always get after defining AI Mode: \u201cIs AI Mode different from AI Overviews?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In short, yes and no.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, from the user experience, AI Mode is different from AI Overviews.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ai-overviews-statistics\">AI Overviews<\/a> show up within the regular search results and are just a single component of that page of answers compared to AI Mode\u2019s contained experience. They also don\u2019t allow for direct reengagement based on the answers provided. You can click on the supporting documentation links or the ads in AI Overviews, but if you want to go further than that, you have to conduct another search, effectively losing the thread of the previous one, and you may or may not be served another AI Overview.<\/p>\n<p>But also, no, AI Mode and AI Overviews are extremely closely related to each other. The information served in them is usually pretty close (you can compare by clicking between the AI Mode and All tabs in Google), and the way advertisers can engage with them is pretty similar.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/ai-mode-vs-ai-overviews.webp\" alt=\"difference between ai mode vs ai overviews\" width=\"900\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-94859\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/ai-mode-vs-ai-overviews.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/ai-mode-vs-ai-overviews-480x427.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd0e <strong>SEO has evolved&#8230;need help understanding the new rules for ranking where it matters?<\/strong> Download our free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/how-to-do-seo-right?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_SEOstrategies_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\/\">How to Do SEO Right\u2014Right Now!<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"the-types-of-queries-best-suited-for-ai-mode-and-ai-overviews-ads\"><\/div>\n<h2>The types of queries best suited for AI Mode (and AI Overviews) ads<\/h2>\n<p>To try and discern the impact AI Mode may have for advertisers, we need to understand the types of queries that it\u2019s best suited for.<\/p>\n<p>Since <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ai-mode\">AI Mode<\/a> is relatively new, we need to take some direction from the documentation around AI Overviews to understand how AI Mode might be impacted. Let\u2019s dig into what we do know about AI Overviews and see how that can inform our expectations about AI Mode.<\/p>\n<p>AI Overviews are not shown for all query types. They\u2019re usually shown for queries that require a longer, in-depth answer rather than a series of links. That means AI Overviews are likely only going to show when the search is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Broad and information-based<\/li>\n<li>Comparison based<\/li>\n<li>Multi-step<\/li>\n<li>Explanatory<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>None of these is heavily focused on transactions or sales. They\u2019re all more research or learning based and, more often than not, an ad likely won\u2019t show for this type of query anyway.<\/p>\n<p>If you are getting search volume through your campaigns for these higher funnel, more generalized queries, you could likely already be seeing a decrease in impressions as AI Overviews are being shown more often and are likely pushing ads down the page.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc40<strong> Looking for more ways to drive people to your site?<\/strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download\">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"requirements-to-show-ads-in-ai-mode-and-ai-overviews\"><\/div>\n<h2>Requirements to show ads in AI Mode<\/h2>\n<p>To know the impact AI Mode may have on advertising, we also need to know the criteria required to show your ads in AI Overviews. As ads on Google AI Mode are in the experimental stage, there&#8217;s very little documentation around it (just <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/google-ai-mode-ads-internal-document-459931\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this brief from Google<\/a> to brands in August).<\/p>\n<p>Unlike regular <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/ppc-keyword\">keyword targeting<\/a>, where the search term simply needs to closely match what your keywords are for an ad to show, ads on AI Mode require much more cohesion for the searcher. Not only does your keyword need to be relevant to the query, but your ad content and landing pages also need to be relevant to the answers provided by AI Mode as well (this is also how ads work in AI Overviews).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/google-ads-ai-mode-benefits.webp\" alt=\"google ads ai mode details from google\" width=\"900\" height=\"715\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-94871\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/google-ads-ai-mode-benefits.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/google-ads-ai-mode-benefits-480x381.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/google-ai-mode-ads-internal-document-459931\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Additionally, just like AI Overviews ads, Google is requiring advertisers to opt into AI-powered targeting solutions like broad match, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-max-for-search\">AI Max for Search<\/a>, or keywordless targeting that accompanies Dynamic Search Ads or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/performance-max\">Performance Max<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/show-ads-on-google-ai-mode.webp\" alt=\"how to show ads in google ai mode\" width=\"900\" height=\"254\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-94872\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/show-ads-on-google-ai-mode.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/show-ads-on-google-ai-mode-480x135.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/google-ai-mode-ads-internal-document-459931\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 <strong>Running Google Ads and want to see where you can improve results?<\/strong> Find out with a free, instant audit &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"what-could-ai-mode-mean-for-advertisers\"><\/div>\n<h2>What could ads in AI Mode mean for businesses?<\/h2>\n<p>Between the types of queries best suited for AI Mode and the settings required for advertisers to show up there, the implications for advertisers could be pretty large.<\/p>\n<h3>A varied marketing approach<\/h3>\n<p>For your ad to show in AI Mode (or in AI Overviews), you\u2019re likely going to have to shift away from hard selling, as the queries these features are showing for aren\u2019t the right fit. Additionally, you\u2019re likely not going to get away with short landing pages with the minimum viable content to make the sale. Odds are, those pages aren\u2019t going to be supportive enough of the AI answer experience to qualify your ads.<\/p>\n<h3>Targeting expansion<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019re also going to have to lean into Google\u2019s intent-based query matching to leverage these placements. Without broad match or keywordless matching, you won\u2019t be eligible for these new placements. Additionally, the expanded reach of campaigns like Performance Max goes beyond Search and into many other Google properties like YouTube and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/gmail-ads\">Gmail<\/a>, which is obviously quite a big change.<\/p>\n<h3>A bigger role\u00a0for creative assets<\/h3>\n<p>If you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-performance-max-pre-launch-optimizations\">opt into Performance Max campaigns<\/a> or leverage the Text Customization and Final URL expansion features within AI Max for Search, you\u2019re giving at least some control to Google when it comes to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/21\/emotional-ad-copy-examples\">ad copy<\/a>. They\u2019ll be able to create new text and visual components to leverage in your ads as you compete for these queries or expand into new placements that are much more creative forward.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/asset-optimization-ai-mode.webp\" alt=\"ai mode asset optimization\" width=\"900\" height=\"369\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-94862\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/asset-optimization-ai-mode.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/asset-optimization-ai-mode-480x197.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"should-you-be-focused-on-showing-ads-in-ai-mode\"><\/div>\n<h2>Should you be focused on showing ads in AI Mode?<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s no secret that things are changing quickly with AI and that Google is vying to be at the forefront of that industry. But it\u2019s also no secret that Google still heavily relies on ads to account for much of its revenue each year. With those two truths in mind, it&#8217;s hardly a surprise that ads are being integrated into Google\u2019s AI offerings from its search platform.<\/p>\n<p>In my estimation, <strong>getting your ads to show with AI Mode (or AI Overviews) likely shouldn\u2019t be your main goal with advertising.<\/strong> Your goal is still to hit your profitability or volume goals, but that doesn\u2019t mean this shouldn\u2019t be on your mind.<\/p>\n<p>At this point in time, the advertisers who test and iterate on their strategy to both continue to see success with existing campaigns as well as find out what works for them in an AI-centered search experience will end up reaping the rewards in the future. Maybe it makes sense to opt into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-max-for-search\">AI Max<\/a> for a little while and see how it does. Have you run Performance Max campaigns recently? There have been a ton of updates to give advertisers better controls, and if you leverage them, maybe this campaign type can be profitable and get you eligible to show in AI experiences.<\/p>\n<h2>What to do next<\/h2>\n<p>In the immediate future, I don\u2019t foresee AI Mode having a large impact on advertisers who have a dialed-in campaign strategy. At least not while user behavior is still relatively the same. That will almost certainly change over time as users get more used to AI and figure out ways to be more efficient with it. The advertiser who tests and learns in these early stages will be ahead of the game when these AI features are more widely adopted.<\/p>\n<p>For now, it\u2019s important to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/category\/google-ads\">keep up with the latest changes<\/a>, keep an eye on your existing Google Ads campaigns, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-experiments\">use AI in smart ways<\/a> to further your marketing strategy.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google is testing ads in AI Mode, so we&#8217;re breaking down what this means for advertisers, how to show up here, and whether or not it&#8217;s actually worth it for your business.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":114,"featured_media":94865,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[101],"tags":[],"dipi_cpt_category":[],"class_list":["post-94848","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-google-ads"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v25.8 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Google Ads in AI Mode: Here&#039;s What We Know | WordStream<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Google will soon roll out ads in AI Mode.
