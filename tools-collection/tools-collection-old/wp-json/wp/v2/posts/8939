This is especially true on the Google SERP, where your title has a huge impact on your click-through rate and, because of this, your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/14\/increase-traffic-to-my-website\">organic traffic<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Now, it might seem like a lot of effort to devote to what\u2019s often the first or last 60 characters of your content. But with the potential to boost CTR and organic traffic, your blog posts titles are worth the extra time.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, according to an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.orbitmedia.com\/blog\/blogging-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Orbit Media<\/a> study, bloggers who spend time drafting and workshopping their titles see better results.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/better-blog-post-titles-headlines-1.png\" alt=\"tips to write irresistible blog post titles\u2014graph showing that bloggers who draft multiple headlines get better results\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>How to write stronger blog post titles<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve shared tips for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/17\/headline-writing\">writing better headlines <\/a>for your blog posts before, and those tried-and-true tactics are still great to use. But there\u2019s recent industry data and a slew of new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/23\/content-marketing-trends\">content marketing trends<\/a> to consider. With that in mind, here are nine ways to write blog post titles to entice your audience and boost your traffic.<\/p>\n<p>Here we go.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Avoid words that sound like spam<\/h3>\n<p>With over <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oberlo.com\/blog\/blogging-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">two billion blog posts<\/a> published each year, it\u2019s no wonder that common phrases go from recognizable to cliche quickly. (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/01\/holiday-copywriting\">10 ways to avoid cliche copywriting here!<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>Take \u201cultimate guide,\u201d for instance. <a href=\"https:\/\/trends.google.com\/trends\/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=ultimate%20guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Interest<\/a> in these has pretty much declined over the past few years, and it\u2019s more than halved in the last decade. Why? Because we see ultimate guide so often in the SERP that the modifier becomes boring\u2014and, if we\u2019re being honest, lazy.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/better-blog-post-titles-ultimate_0-1.png\" alt=\"tips to write irresistible blog post titles\u2014SERP showing &quot;ultimate&quot; in titles\" width=\"596\" height=\"248\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Great content? Sure. Terrible blog post titles? Absolutely.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Standard constructions like \u201cThe Ultimate Guide to X\u201d or \u201cX Secrets Revealed\u201d are not just boring for your potential readers, but also harmful for your brand authority.\u00a0In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/cdn2.hubspot.net\/hub\/53\/file-2505556912-pdf\/Data_Driven_Strategies_For_Writing_Effective_Titles_and_Headlines.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HubSpot <\/a>found that using words like \u201cmagic\u201d and \u201camazing\u201d can actually decrease your CTR. These cliches get spammy, which does a disservice to your blog content.<\/p>\n<p>So instead of leaning on these overused, ineffective words, find new ones that are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/13\/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing\">great for marketing<\/a>. Focus on using fresh, powerful words that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.trychameleon.com\/blog\/brand-alignment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">align with your brand<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/05\/blog-post-templates\">&gt;&gt; 9 Free Blog Post Templates Guaranteed to Drive Traffic\u00a0<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>2. Check the SERP for numbers<\/h3>\n<p>Numbers are appealing\u2014this is a standard tip, and there\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/5-data-insights-into-the-headlines-readers-click\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">data<\/a> that supports that including numbers in your title increases your traffic.<\/p>\n<p>But adding any old number isn\u2019t going to boost your organic traffic.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve got your<a href=\"https:\/\/databox.com\/blog-topic-ideas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> blog post idea<\/a>, you should check the SERP for your keyword to see what\u2019s ranking before settling on a title. This is good to make sure you\u2019re matching search intent, and it\u2019s also good for avoiding an embarrassing duplicate title, like the \u201cultimate guide\u201d example above.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s especially useful for making numbers in your title appealing.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/better-blog-post-titles-numbers-1.png\" alt=\"tips to write irresistible blog post titles\u2014screenshot of SERP results with numbers in title\" width=\"600\" height=\"232\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Honestly not sure if this is better or worse than the duplicate \u201cultimate guide.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If you were trying to rank for \u201cspring planters,\u201d like these blog posts in the example above, you would know to go for 15 or 16 options\u2014at least.\u00a0Now, consider these results for the search query \u201cbest email subject lines:\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/better-blog-post-titles-higher-numbers-1.png\" alt=\"tips to write irresistible blog post titles\u2014SERP showing results for &quot;email subject lines&quot;\" width=\"600\" height=\"464\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The post from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.engagebay.com\/blog\/best-email-subject-lines\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Engagebay <\/a>actually stands out because it has significantly fewer <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/40-great-email-subject-lines\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">email subject lines<\/a>. If I\u2019m looking for lots of quick examples for inspiration, I might click on Sleeknote\u2019s post. But if I\u2019m short on time or looking for a quick idea to run with? 25 is way more accessible than 80 or 115.<\/p>\n<p>Check the SERP so you can use numbers strategically in your blog post titles.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Remember your keyword<\/h3>\n<p>This is a simple reminder, but it\u2019s important: Your primary keyword needs to be in your blog post title.<\/p>\n<p>Most of your blog posts should start with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">keyword research<\/a>. An effective content strategy for most blogs involves growing traffic organically, which requires keyword-targeted blog posts. Sometimes great blog post ideas come out of discussions with your team or customer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/28\/pain-points\">pain points<\/a>. But even those ideas are better when you can align them with a keyword.<\/p>\n<p>And when you do, make sure to include that keyword in your title.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/better-blog-post-titles-keyword-in-title-1.png\" alt=\"tips to write irresistible blog post titles\u2014ahrefs graph showing correlation of keyword in title with rank\" width=\"800\" height=\"521\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/title-tag-seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>4. Follow a \u201chow to\u201d formula<\/h3>\n<p>Remember how we talked about avoiding cliche words and phrases to keep your titles engaging? That doesn\u2019t mean you need to start from zero every time you\u2019re brainstorming headlines.<\/p>\n<p>Starting from zero every time is so hard. That\u2019s why <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/16\/copywriting-formulas\">copywriting formulas <\/a>are so useful.<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re using a formula, you\u2019re starting with some structure that you can add to, adjust, and make your own. (Read: You\u2019re not plugging your keyword into a run-of-the-mill title and calling it a day.)<\/p>\n<p>Using \u201chow to\u201d to frame your blog post works. Most of the time, we\u2019re sharing education resources or explaining our own processes for our audience, like how to create <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/11\/at-home-diy-video\">DIY marketing videos<\/a> or how to improve your<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/17\/amazon-seo\"> Amazon SEO<\/a>. (An alternate title for this post, for instance, could have easily been \u201cHow to Breathe New Life Into Your Blog Post Titles.)<\/p>\n<p>In fact, these blog posts are a great way to grow organic traffic. Semrush found that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/blog\/content-marketing-funnel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">72% <\/a>of marketers report \u201chow to\u201d blog posts are their best traffic drivers. So next time you\u2019re writing a post on strategy, use this framework and see if that works for your audience.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Add brackets<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019ve been seeing this used effectively more and more lately: brackets in blog post titles. And it works. Here\u2019s an example.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/better-blog-post-titles-brackets_0-1.png\" alt=\"example of blog post title using brackets\" width=\"461\" height=\"617\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This could be because original research, like the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/blog\/mobile-vs-desktop\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">data study from Semrush above<\/a>, has become more common in content marketing over the last few years. Orbit Media found that almost half of content marketers published original data last year, up from 35% the year before.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/better-blog-post-titles-original-research-1.png\" alt=\"tips to write irresistible blog post titles\u2014graph showing rise of original research\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The good news? These brackets work. <a href=\"https:\/\/cdn2.hubspot.net\/hub\/53\/file-2505556912-pdf\/Data_Driven_Strategies_For_Writing_Effective_Titles_and_Headlines.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HubSpot<\/a> found that using brackets to provide extra information or clarification can increase click-through rates by 38%.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some great things to include in brackets in your relevant blog post titles:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>[Data]<\/li>\n<li>[Updated]<\/li>\n<li>[Infographic]<\/li>\n<li>[Video]<\/li>\n<li>[Step-by-Step Guide]<\/li>\n<li>[Report]<\/li>\n<li>[Template]<\/li>\n<li>[Study]<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>6. Use the first person<\/h3>\n<p>According to recent <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/why-do-people-read-blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HubSpot<\/a> research, the number one reason that people read blog posts is to learn something new.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/better-blog-post-titles-learn-something-new-1.png\" alt=\"tips to write irresistible blog post titles\u2014hubspot survey revealing most people read blog posts to learn something new\" width=\"800\" height=\"598\" \/><\/div>\n<p>That means that authority is especially important. When there are tons of different blog posts on any given topic to choose from, it\u2019s important to produce accurate, authoritative resources in order to compete and provide value to your audience. The best way to do this? Have an expert share advice.<\/p>\n<p>Using first person in your blog post title makes it clear that it was written by someone who knows what they\u2019re talking about.<\/p>\n<p>Consider this example blog post on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/29\/google-ads-mistakes\">Google Ads mistakes<\/a>:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/better-blog-post-titles-first-person-1.png\" alt=\"blog post title example using first person\" width=\"600\" height=\"190\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This blog post is a great resource, and it\u2019s also super clickable. That\u2019s a lot of money, and a lot of mistakes. I want to know what Asi did\u2014and what I can learn from it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RELATED:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/01\/headline-examples\">These 88 Headline Examples Are Total Click Magnets<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>7. Include your audience<\/h3>\n<p>While using first person in your blog post title lets the audience know exactly who is sharing the advice (and why it\u2019s worthwhile), including your audience in your title makes no mistake about who the blog post is for.<\/p>\n<p>The best way to think about this is with beginner\u2019s guides. When you see a post like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/20\/youtube-marketing\">The Beginner\u2019s Guide to YouTube Marketing for Small Businesses<\/a>, you know that it\u2019s going to tell you what you need to do to get started and it\u2019s not going to assume much specific knowledge. If I\u2019m a beginner, that\u2019s the post I\u2019m clicking.<\/p>\n<p>You can use the same technique to describe your ideal audience in your blog posts\u2014even if it\u2019s not beginners.<\/p>\n<p>For example, when I was brainstorming a title for a recent blog post about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unstack.com\/blog\/crm-automations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CRM automations<\/a>, I knew that, while the blog post would discuss CRM automations in general, the ideal audience would be startup owners or marketers. I ended up including this in the title to make it more appealing to that target audience: 7 Essential CRM Automations Every Startup Needs.<\/p>\n<p>Bonus: This technique is awesome for targeting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/long-tail-keywords\">long-tail keywords<\/a>, too.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Stress speed<\/h3>\n<p>Are you busy? I\u2019m busy. Sometimes I\u2019m looking for an involved how-to post when I have the time to sit and learn how to get better at something; other times, I need a quick overview to get an answer fast so I can move on to the rest of my to-do list.<\/p>\n<p>If your blog post solves this second need, a quick solution, make sure you\u2019re advertising this in your title. You can include words like \u201cquick\u201d or \u201cfast,\u201d or you can get specific with a number of steps or minutes.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/better-blog-post-titles-time-1.png\" alt=\"blog post title example using &quot;ten-minute guide&quot; \" width=\"800\" height=\"311\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>9. Make the value clear<\/h3>\n<p>The best advice I\u2019ve received about writing blog titles (thanks again, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/elisa-gabbert-3557\">Elisa<\/a>) is to make sure that it communicates the value. The reader should never have to second guess why they\u2019re clicking on the article, and the blog post should deliver on its promise.<\/p>\n<p>This last part is key.<\/p>\n<p>It might be tempting to overhaul your blog post titles based on these tips, but a new title doesn\u2019t lead to meaningful traffic if it doesn\u2019t actually provide the original data or expert advice or audience-specific information. Even worse, it can hurt your brand to oversell in a title.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, make sure your blog post titles clearly convey the value that they do provide\u2014and then go from there to make them as appealing as possible.<\/p>\n<h2>Spend the time on your blog post titles\u2014you won\u2019t regret it<\/h2>\n<p>Your blog post title frames your content for your audience, lets them know what they can expect to read, and convinces them to click. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important. So use these tips to spend more time brainstorming and drafting until you land on a blog post title that will appeal to your reader<em>\u2014<\/em>and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">boost your traffic<\/a>.\u00a0Here&#8217;s a recap:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Avoid words that sound like spam<\/li>\n<li>Check the SERP for numbers<\/li>\n<li>Remember your keyword<\/li>\n<li>Follow a \u201chow to\u201d formula<\/li>\n<li>Add brackets<\/li>\n<li>Use the first person<\/li>\n<li>Include your audience<\/li>\n<li>Stress speed<\/li>\n<li>Make the value clear<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your blog post titles are the first thing your potential reader sees, and they can help boost CTR and organic traffic.
