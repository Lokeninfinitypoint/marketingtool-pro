A successful TikTok SEO strategy will get you in front of this huge and energetic group of buyers.<\/p>\n<h3>TikTok is transforming into a search engine<\/h3>\n<p>TikTok is still a discovery platform that helps users stumble on creators they\u2019ve never heard of. But as we mentioned, it\u2019s also growing into a search platform where people go to find their next pair of comfy boots or even business insurance.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-insurance.webp\" alt=\"TikTok SEO - TikTok search results for insurance.\" width=\"318\" height=\"567\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84612 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-insurance.webp 318w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-insurance-168x300.webp 168w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>TikTok is evolving into a search platform where people learn about a wide range of products and services.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve optimized your TikTok content, those people will learn that you\u2019re the solution to what they\u2019re searching for.<\/p>\n<h3>You can diversify your non-paid traffic<\/h3>\n<p>Google traffic has been a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/2024-google-algorithm-updates\">bit wonky lately<\/a>, to say the least. And with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ai-overviews\">AI Overviews<\/a> now answering users\u2019 questions, we may see even fewer clicks from that search engine.<\/p>\n<p>TikTok\u2019s growing user base and its search engine features make it a viable way to generate unpaid traffic to fill some of the Google gap.<\/p>\n<h3>TikTok SEO has a lower barrier to entry than Google SEO<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s really hard for a new brand to show up on Google results pages for highly searched terms. That\u2019s because Google gives more weight to websites with a high domain authority (something the recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-algorithm-documents-leak\">Google algorithm document leak<\/a> seemed to confirm).<\/p>\n<p>On TikTok, however, past performance doesn\u2019t heavily influence content ranking. So, a brand can appear on TikTok FYPs and search results shortly after posting its first videos. If, of course, the brand uses a smart TikTok SEO strategy.<\/p>\n<div id=\"what-are-the-tiktok-seo-ranking-factors\"><\/div>\n<h2>What are the TikTok SEO ranking factors?<\/h2>\n<p>TikTok\u2019s algorithm analyzes thousands of ranking signals to decide which posts to place on your FYP and search results. We don\u2019t know them all, but the good folks at TikTok did <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.tiktok.com\/en-us\/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">publish a document<\/a> that lists some of the most important ones.<\/p>\n<h3>User interactions<\/h3>\n<p>TikTok personalizes your results based on how you\u2019ve interacted with content previously. This helps ensure you see the most helpful videos (and keeps you on the platform longer).<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few actions that influence TikTok\u2019s decision:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Watching full videos<\/li>\n<li>Following or hiding accounts<\/li>\n<li>Liking or sharing videos<\/li>\n<li>Commenting<\/li>\n<li>Reporting a video as inappropriate<\/li>\n<li>Adding videos to favorites<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It all starts when you first open the app and tell TikTok what interests you.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, if other people who share your interests interact with a video, it\u2019ll be more likely to appear in your feed.<\/p>\n<h3>Video information<\/h3>\n<p>These TikTok ranking factors are really important because they\u2019re the ones you can most directly affect. They include things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hashtags<\/li>\n<li>Sounds<\/li>\n<li>Captions<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When these things in your posts match a search query (and a user\u2019s activities), your content will appear on their screens.<\/p>\n<h3>Device and settings<\/h3>\n<p>How your device and TikTok account are set up will influence the content you see on the platform.<\/p>\n<p>A few examples of device and settings ranking factors include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Language settings<\/li>\n<li>Country settings<\/li>\n<li>Device type<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These make sense since content in an unfamiliar language isn\u2019t going to keep you watching.<\/p>\n<h3>TikTok algorithm weighting factor<\/h3>\n<p>Like most algorithms, TikTok weights some ranking factors more heavily. The idea is to focus more on factors that more directly predict which content will keep users watching.<\/p>\n<p>The takeaway is that your efforts should be on the factors that make your content easier for an algorithm to understand (like adding the right <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/04\/07\/tiktok-hashtags\">hashtags<\/a>) and those that keep viewers clicking and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/17\/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok\">liking your posts<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"5-ways-to-improve-your-tiktok-seo\"><\/div>\n<h2>5 ways to improve your TikTok SEO<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you know how TikTok SEO works, let\u2019s get more of your content in front of more people with these TikTok SEO tips.<\/p>\n<h3>1.

When you listen to a few videos with the same catchy beat or funny voiceover, TikTok tends to serve more that use the same sounds.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, you can search for content by their common sounds, just like with hashtags.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-sounds-list.webp\" alt=\"TikTok SEO - TikTok search for sounds.\" width=\"364\" height=\"577\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84620 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-sounds-list.webp 364w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-sounds-list-189x300.webp 189w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>You can attract a lot of video views with the right sound.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ll go back to TikTok\u2019s Creative Center to see which sounds are trending.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-songs.webp\" alt=\"TikTok SEO - Song finder in TikTok Creative Center.\" width=\"844\" height=\"392\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84619 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-songs.webp 844w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-songs-480x223.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 844px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Look at other accounts in your industry to see which songs best fit the content. To catch their wave, try a few sounds that aren\u2019t yet trending but show early signs of doing so.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Post at the right frequency and time<\/h3>\n<p>When and how often you post aren\u2019t direct ranking factors. But both can help your TikTok SEO tangentially.<\/p>\n<p>When you post more often, you simply have more chances to go viral. The<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/20\/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok#:~:text=According%20to%20TikTok%2C%20you%20should,need%20Avatar%2Dlevel%20production%20quality.\"> exact posting frequency is up for debate<\/a>. TikTok says to post multiple times per day, while other studies say a couple of times per week is enough.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-time-to-post.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84621 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-time-to-post.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-time-to-post-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The real answer is to post as often as you can while still sharing valuable content people want to watch. Remember that video completion <em>is<\/em> a direct ranking factor, so posting more stuff people won\u2019t watch all the way through will hurt more than help.<\/p>\n<p>TikTok also doesn\u2019t directly care<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/09\/best-time-to-post-on-tiktok\"> when you post your content<\/a>. But if you get it in front of your audience when they\u2019re most likely looking at the app, it\u2019ll give your videos a little engagement boost, which may make them more likely to land on the FYP of new potential followers.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, your TikTok analytics tells you when your followers are flipping through the app.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-analytics-1.webp\" alt=\"TikTok SEO - Screenshot of TikTok analytics dashboard.\" width=\"359\" height=\"581\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84622 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-analytics-1.webp 359w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-analytics-1-185x300.webp 185w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Your TikTok analytics dashboard tells you when followers are active. <\/em><\/p>\n<h3>5.
