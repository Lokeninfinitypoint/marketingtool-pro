Will some marketers leverage the power of automation to generate average content that is rich in focus terms but low on value to simply gain organic traffic? Certainly.<\/p>\n<p>But it\u2019s still best to look at AI outputs as a starting point, not the finishing line. The most effective <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/08\/content-creator\">content creators<\/a> of 2024 will use AI to speed up the writing process while taking the time to meet search intent, showcase their experience, and provide the most valuable, <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/docs\/appearance\/helpful-content-system\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">helpful content<\/a> for users.<\/p>\n<p>Marketers will need to realize that AI content is the new frontier of SEO. Some of your competitors will likely use AI content tools to create hundreds to thousands of new pieces of content this year. If you don\u2019t start using these tools as well, you will fall behind.<\/p>\n<p>Not sure what tools you should be using or where to start? Check out this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/25\/ai-content-generators\">list of AI content tools<\/a> to find options that best fit your needs.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd16 Want to use AI the right way? <strong>Free download &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteAIinMarketingGuide.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_AIMarketing_Download\">Emergency Guide to AI in Marketing<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"regularly-update-content\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. Content will need to be regularly updated<\/h3>\n<p>With the mass influx of AI-generated content coming our way this year, competition is about to get a lot stiffer for all of our keywords. If you have a piece of content that is currently performing well, protect your top positions by making sure it is updated regularly.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/09\/google-ranking-factors\">Google\u2019s ranking algorithm<\/a> still has some recency signals that will likely create fluctuations in top-ranking positions as new content is posted, but backlinks, topic authority, and content quality will beat out recency in the long term.<\/p>\n<p>In the past, updating content every 1-3 years was usually sufficient for maintaining rankings, but in 2024, a yearly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/29\/fresh-content-google-ranking-factor\">content refresh<\/a> should become a part of your standard workflow.<\/p>\n<p>To refresh your content for maximum SEO, here are a few suggestions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Confirm that all data and statistics are accurate and the most up-to-date as possible.<\/li>\n<li>Link to the newest research, case studies, and news articles.<\/li>\n<li>Rewrite the content. That means entirely new introductions, insights, and examples.<\/li>\n<li>Check all internal and external links. Repair broken links or replace links with 301 redirects.<\/li>\n<li>Keep building backlinks! A content refresh or rewrite is a great occasion for promoting your content in social media, public relations, and to your existing email subscribers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"brand-signals-grow-in-importance\"><\/div>\n<h3>8. Brand signals will grow in importance<\/h3>\n<p>With so much synthetic content, your brand\u2019s name and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/06\/online-reputation-management\">reputation<\/a> will hold SEO power in 2024, as long as you\u2019ve done the work to establish your brand name online.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s be clear: Google does not prioritize big brands over smaller brands in search engine rankings. But Google uses signals like branded anchor text and branded search volume to understand whether your website is well-trusted and authoritative.<\/p>\n<p>As Google continues to care more about experience and expertise to separate the wheat from the chaff in content, there\u2019s never been a better time to embrace your brand name and leverage it.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few simple ways you can improve your brand signals for SEO purposes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Link to your social media pages from your website and vice versa<\/strong>. This shows Google that your website has a social presence and life outside of your website.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Have robust About pages and Contact pages<\/strong>. This shows that there are real people behind your website and content&#8211;and that they are experienced!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Invest in public relations outreach<\/strong>. Links and brand mentions on authoritative websites show your credibility as a brand, business, or organization.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Get listed in directories, review sites, and third-party aggregators<\/strong>. Focus on quality over quantity and prioritize those sites that have relevance to your industry. For example, a plumbing company should create a listing on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thumbtack.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thumbtack<\/a>, while a software company should set up a profile page on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.g2.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">G2<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/10\/brand-awareness\">brand-building efforts<\/a> can also lead to more appearances in Google\u2019s rich results. Want to appear more in lists like this?<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/seo-trends-brand-signals.webp\" alt=\"google search results for meditation apps\" width=\"936\" height=\"373\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-79295\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/seo-trends-brand-signals.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/seo-trends-brand-signals-480x191.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Google extracts the data about these brand names \u201cfrom across the web,\u201d not just from the brand\u2019s websites.<\/p>\n<p>So those efforts you make to establish your brand name on reliable sources across the internet is a surefire way to help Google understand who you are, what you offer, and your brand authority in your space.<\/p>\n<div id=\"user-interactions-engagement-metrics-increase\"><\/div>\n<h3>9. Google will place more emphasis on user interactions and engagement metrics<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s been a lot of disagreement among SEO professionals on the degree to which Google uses engagement metrics in its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/2024-google-algorithm-updates\">ranking algorithm<\/a>. But documents from the recent antitrust case against Google show that user engagement is not only a ranking factor\u2013it\u2019s a pillar of ranking.<\/p>\n<p>The below slide from Google\u2019s presentation titled \u201cThe 3 Pillars of Ranking,\u201d lists \u201cUser-Interactions\u201d as a core ranking factor. It also clarifies that \u201cclicks, attentions on a result, swipes on carousels, and entering a new query\u201d all qualify as user interactions.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/seo-trends-google-ranking-pillars.webp\" alt=\"google's three ranking pillars from presentation\" width=\"936\" height=\"557\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-79296\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/seo-trends-google-ranking-pillars.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/seo-trends-google-ranking-pillars-480x286.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.seroundtable.com\/google-3-pillars-of-ranking-36340.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>So it\u2019s important to think about how your web content allows users to interact.<\/p>\n<p>Interactive modules like jumplinks and carousels have always been good for improving <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/19\/core-web-vitals-google-page-experience-update\">page experience<\/a>, but when a user clicks on them, they can also show Google that users are finding your content engaging and valuable.<\/p>\n<p>Be careful not to get spammy though in the effort to increase interactions. These interactive features should benefit the user\u2019s experience, not disrupt it.<\/p>\n<div id=\"mobile-page-performance-ranking-factor\"><\/div>\n<h3>10. Mobile page performance will continue to be a big ranking factor<\/h3>\n<p>Mobile-first indexing is now the way of search, and after years of implementation, Google announced that it was <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/blog\/2023\/10\/mobile-first-is-here\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">officially completed<\/a> in October of 2023.<\/p>\n<p>You likely have been hearing about mobile pages for years, so it\u2019s hard to consider this a \u201ctrend,\u201d but it\u2019s important to understand that your mobile pages, <strong>and your mobile pages only, <\/strong>are what count toward rankings.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a website that primarily gets desktop traffic, this still applies to you. You need to pay attention to the performance of your mobile pages.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few \u201cmusts\u201d for your mobile pages:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Responsive Design<\/strong>: Your web pages need to be responsive in 2024, meaning they can serve the same content on mobile, tablet, or desktop from the same URL. Separate URLs for mobile and desktop are a thing of the past, and Google discourages anything but responsive websites.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Proper Character Counts<\/strong>: Remember that meta descriptions on mobile are limited to 120 characters (not the 160 you get on desktop). It\u2019s best to trim up all of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/meta-description\">meta descriptions<\/a> now and aim for 120 regularly.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Check that your pages are mobile-friendly: <\/strong>QA-ing your mobile pages should be a standard part of your publishing workflow. You can use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/16\/how-to-use-google-search-console\">Google Search Console<\/a> to confirm whether your pages are meeting Google\u2019 standards. Go to \u201c<strong>Experience<\/strong>\u201d &gt; \u201c<strong>Core Web Vitals<\/strong>\u201d &gt; \u201c<strong>Mobile<\/strong>\u201d to get a complete report of your mobile pages, like below.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/seo-trends-core-web-vitals.webp\" alt=\"core web vitals results\" width=\"936\" height=\"316\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-79297\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/seo-trends-core-web-vitals.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/seo-trends-core-web-vitals-480x162.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"page-experience-updates\"><\/div>\n<h3>11. Businesses will need to make page experience updates<\/h3>\n<p>In April of 2023, Google <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/blog\/2023\/04\/page-experience-in-search\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">expanded its guidance<\/a> on page experience and discussed the role of page experience in helpful content.<\/p>\n<p>Essentially, a bad page experience is the opposite of helpful. So your pages need to be fast-loading, responsive, and pass Google\u2019s Core Web Vitals.<\/p>\n<p>In March of 2024, Google will be adding <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/9205520?ref_topic=7440006&amp;hl=en&amp;authuser=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Interaction to Next Paint (INP)<\/a> to its Core Web Vitals metrics. This metric measures a page\u2019s response to a user\u2019s interaction, whether a click or keyboard stroke.<\/p>\n<p>With the importance of user interactions in ranking, this is a natural addition for Google to measure the overall quality of a page. Make sure you are ready for the change by reviewing your INP report available in your Google Search Console account right now.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/seo-trends-page-experience-updates.webp\" alt=\"core web vitals report showing INP issues\" width=\"936\" height=\"384\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-79298\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/seo-trends-page-experience-updates.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/seo-trends-page-experience-updates-480x197.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"seo-communities-grow\"><\/div>\n<h3>12. SEO communities will be crucial<\/h3>\n<p>Although it\u2019s not always discussed explicitly, SEO has long been an industry fueled by shared information and crowd-sourcing.<\/p>\n<p>Community is an essential part of SEO success, whether for SEO professionals, agency owners, or entrepreneurs taking ownership of their SEO.<\/p>\n<p>So of all the SEO trends coming in 2024, I believe SEO community groups will be one of the most important and beneficial for organic marketers. Sharing insights, strategies, or essentially, our experiences, can help us navigate the many changes coming this year.<\/p>\n<p>There are all sorts of ways to connect with other SEO-minded folks. Events, conferences, Facebook groups, <a href=\"https:\/\/seotheory.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online SEO courses<\/a>, forums, podcasts, and LinkedIn are some of the primary ways you can find other people who care about providing high-quality content for users and using the power of organic SEO in 2024 to deliver results for their own websites or their clients.<\/p>\n<h2>Make these SEO trends work for you in 2024<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re committed to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/seo-trends-and-predictions-rest-of-2025\">SEO success<\/a> this year, here are the 12 most important SEO trends for 2024:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Focus on creating content that meets the needs of users<\/li>\n<li>Answer questions that users have about your products, services, industry, or topic areas<\/li>\n<li>Ensure your content creators have first-hand experience, and showcase it accordingly<\/li>\n<li>Build topical authority through lots of high-quality content that explores topics in breadth and depth<\/li>\n<li>Use topical maps to build out comprehensive content strategies in 2024<\/li>\n<li>Leverage AI content tools to increase your content velocity and improve the efficiency of your content workflows<\/li>\n<li>Regularly update your content for relevancy and freshness<\/li>\n<li>Improve your brand signals on third-party websites and aggregators<\/li>\n<li>Give your users the opportunity to interact and engage with your content<\/li>\n<li>Make sure your mobile pages are fully-optimized<\/li>\n<li>Continue to focus on page experience and prepare for upcoming Core Web Vitals updates<\/li>\n<li>Join SEO communities and benefit from the power of collaboration and experimentation<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Need more 2024 marketing trends?
