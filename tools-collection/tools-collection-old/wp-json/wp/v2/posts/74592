Custom rules are really what comes to mind when Facebook automated rules get brought into the conversation. The reason is, this is where a skilled account manager can make tweaks that make managing accounts (either for clients or your own) much easier.<\/p>\n<p>For example, you can create <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/cost-per-action\">cost-per-action<\/a> (CPA) caps for conversions and lead generation campaigns by specifying the maximum cost per result you\u2019re willing to obtain.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/facebook-ads-automated-rules-custom-rules.webp\" alt=\"facebook automated rules - custom rules in facebook ads\" width=\"839\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-74608\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/facebook-ads-automated-rules-custom-rules.webp 839w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/facebook-ads-automated-rules-custom-rules-480x343.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 839px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is a simple example, but it is a way to automatically optimize ad sets according to your own standards.

Some advertisers may look at this option and decide that they want to do this to streamline everything in the account&#8211;make the largest possible target audiences and make budgeting easier.<\/p>\n<p>The reason I do not recommend this is that it will completely take away your ability to control individual audience segments and report on the quality of those segments down-funnel.<\/p>\n<p>For example, let\u2019s say you are a business that targets restaurants. You have multiple lookalike and manual audience segments that provide leads of varying quality to you. If you combine them all, you may start getting leads for a lower cost but have no control over the quality that is coming in, subsequently driving up your total costs and ruining the efficiency of your advertising efforts.<\/p>\n<h2>3 custom Facebook automated rules to add to your strategy<\/h2>\n<p>Now that we\u2019ve covered what each category is for automated rules, let\u2019s go back to the custom rules option. Custom rules are really where you can apply your individual strategy in a way that can take care of monotonous tasks and keep certain <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-metrics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">metrics<\/a> in line with what you want in a more effective manner than having to do it manually.<\/p>\n<p>When creating custom rules, you have the option to apply the rule to either campaigns, ad sets, or ads. Then you determine the action that you want to take and the conditions that need to be met for the rule to be applied.<\/p>\n<p>At all levels (campaigns, ad sets, ads) the same actions can be applied:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/facebook-automated-rules-settings.webp\" alt=\"facebook automated rules settings in meta ads manager\" width=\"936\" height=\"436\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-74691\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/facebook-automated-rules-settings.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/facebook-automated-rules-settings-480x224.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>After choosing to either turn on\/off the campaign, ad set, or ad or increase\/decrease the budgets you then choose a condition.<\/p>\n<p>This is where Facebook automated rules can get complex and without going through every single option or combination, I will leave it up to you to decide which applies to your objectives best. Instead, I will go through a couple of very common examples.<\/p>\n<h3>Budget<\/h3>\n<p>You can specify when to turn your campaigns off according to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/17\/lower-cost-per-click\">budget<\/a>. You would be able to specify a timeframe in which to assess the spend and have Facebook automatically turn things off when your target budget is hit so that you don\u2019t overspend.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/facebook-automated-rules-budget.webp\" alt=\"facebook automated rules - budget\" width=\"936\" height=\"559\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-74692\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/facebook-automated-rules-budget.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/facebook-automated-rules-budget-480x287.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Frequency<\/h3>\n<p>A similar strategy can be done for frequency on the ad set and ad levels of campaigns. If a particular audience or ad reaches a high frequency within a specific period of time because the audience is small or spend is high, you can have those ad sets and ads turned off automatically.<\/p>\n<h3>Cost per result<\/h3>\n<p>This example is my favorite to use as my strategies mostly involve <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/12\/how-to-generate-leads\">driving leads<\/a> and sales for clients. Businesses that place themselves above the rest from a paid marketing perspective have a very clear idea of where they are allowed to let costs rise. Those with very good funnel analytics or that are in particular verticals with direct sales (such as ecommerce), will know what the ceiling is for a cost per result in order to maintain <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/24\/digital-advertising\">profitability from advertising<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/facebook-automated-rules-cost-per-result.webp\" alt=\"facebook automated rules - cost per result\" width=\"936\" height=\"334\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-74693\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/facebook-automated-rules-cost-per-result.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/facebook-automated-rules-cost-per-result-480x171.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Having a cost-per-result rule in place allows advertisers to ensure that they get profitability from their Facebook ads when operating at scale.
