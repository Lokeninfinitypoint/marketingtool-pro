So the next time your company winds up in newspapers or you make a big announcement that\u2019s likely to be shared, use that PR momentum to get Instagram verified.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Instagram-verification-meme-Taytay-2.jpg\" alt=\"Instagram verify - screenshot of a meme featuring Taylor Swift\" width=\"467\" height=\"596\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-74939 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Instagram-verification-meme-Taytay-2.jpg 467w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Instagram-verification-meme-Taytay-2-235x300.jpg 235w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Remember that Instagram doesn\u2019t consider paid promotion towards your application, so focus on unpaid (aka earned) media mentions.<\/p>\n<h3>Do not try to buy a verification<\/h3>\n<p>Just like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/black-hat-seo\">black hat SEO schemes<\/a>, shortcuts to getting verified on Instagram will hurt you in the long run. So as tempting as they may sound, don\u2019t fall for the scammers that say they can sell you a blue check.<\/p>\n<p>Attempts to go around Instagram\u2019s official process aren\u2019t going to work. But even worse, they could lead to your account being penalized. A blue check is great, but a healthy Instagram account is better.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of buying your way in, get more notoriety for your account by learning <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/get-more-instagram-followers\">the best time to post on Instagram<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Remove links to other social media platforms<\/h3>\n<p>You can probably imagine why, but Instagram doesn\u2019t love it when you include links to other social media websites in your bio. In fact, they say an account with cross-platform links won\u2019t get verified. So if you want the blue check, ditch the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/social-media-marketing\">social media<\/a> links.<\/p>\n<p>The exception to the rule is that you can link to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/11\/16\/facebook-remarketing\">Facebook<\/a> account since it\u2019s under the same Meta umbrella as Instagram. And feel free to link away to your website, Instagram verifiers won\u2019t care about that.<\/p>\n<h3>Re-apply<\/h3>\n<p>If at first you don\u2019t succeed, try, try again. It\u2019s a good motto for life and for getting verified on Instagram. That\u2019s because you\u2019re allowed to reapply if your first attempt doesn\u2019t go your way.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Instagram-verification-meme-scott.jpg\" alt=\"Instagram verify - meme featuring Michael Scott from The Office\" width=\"927\" height=\"558\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-74940 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Instagram-verification-meme-scott.jpg 927w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Instagram-verification-meme-scott-480x289.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 927px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There are two things to remember. First, you need to wait at least 30 days before applying again. And if you apply a second (or third) time before receiving a notification on your first one, Instagram will cancel your application altogether.<\/p>\n<p>Also, if nothing has changed in your status, it\u2019s probably a waste of time to reapply. Engage your followers, get more brand mentions, and make some news-worthy announcements. Then go get that badge.<\/p>\n<div id=\"FAQs\"><\/div>\n<h2>Instagram verification FAQs<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s make sure you have all the answers you need to launch a successful bid for Instagram verification with a quick Q&amp;A.<\/p>\n<h3>How many followers do you need to get verified on Instagram?<\/h3>\n<p>This is a trick question because Instagram says follower count is not a deciding factor for verification. However, the more followers you have, the more chances your brand will get mentioned. And notoriety will definitely help your bid for a blue badge.<\/p>\n<h3>Can anyone get verified on Instagram?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes. You don\u2019t have to be famous or a huge brand to get verified on Instagram. However, you do need to prove that your brand is in the public interest and that your account actually belongs to you.<\/p>\n<h3>How much does it cost for an Instagram verification badge?<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s complicated. For your personal account, you can now pay either $11.99 per month (web) or $14.99 per month (ios or Android) for Meta Verified which gets you a blue badge on both Facebook and Instagram. Meta Verified doesn\u2019t require the same proof of notoriety as the old-school blue badge.<\/p>\n<p>For brands, there\u2019s no fee to apply for Instagram verification, but you do have to go through a more stringent review process.<\/p>\n<h2>Build your brand with Instagram verification<\/h2>\n<p>A blue check badge in your Instagram account tells visitors that your account is run by the brand it represents. That\u2019s an important level of credibility at a time when anyone can mimic a popular account.<\/p>\n<p>To get verified on Instagram, follow these tips:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a killer bio and profile<\/li>\n<li>Grow your following<\/li>\n<li>Apply when your brand is in the news<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t try to buy a verification badge<\/li>\n<li>Remove links to other social media platforms<\/li>\n<li>Reapply if you don\u2019t get in on the first try<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Instagram, and social media as a whole, is an incredible resource for businesses.
