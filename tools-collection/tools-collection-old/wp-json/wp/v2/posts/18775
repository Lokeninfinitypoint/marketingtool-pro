The classes were at the end of the day \u2026 the time when you\u2019re really tired and only thinking about going to bed.<\/p>\n<p>One night the instructor, contrasting non-profits and their for-profit counterparts, made a comment that I never forgot. It was so simple that I felt stupid: <em>For-profit companies exist to make money<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>It seems like a simple idea, but it\u2019s a revelation that can have serious implications for your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/15\/state-of-the-internet-marketing-agency\">marketing agency<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"68d4f32e-fbee-42a5-bd8b-a5399fc294c7\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/agency-how-to-add-ppc-accounts1.jpg\" alt=\"how to add ppc as a revenue stream\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>If you Google \u201cwealth strategies,\u201d you\u2019ll quickly find the concept of multiple revenue streams. Usually, these articles recommend buying property and generating rental income. But for the modern marketing agency, there\u2019s a simpler way.<\/p>\n<p>Your agency has an advantage over most other companies in that you can, and likely do, offer multiple services. And PPC advertising can be your next revenue stream \u2026 if you ask the right questions.<\/p>\n<p>Today, I\u2019ll outline <strong>five things you should say to your prospects as well as your agency\u2019s new and existing clients to introduce them to PPC<\/strong>. Importantly, these questions will also help you overcome some of the most common objections to adopting paid search as a channel.<\/p>\n<p>With a little extra work, you can add boost your agency\u2019s profits without having to become a landlord.<\/p>\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLWebBlogInContentTextLink11WaystoClients.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_11WaystoClients_Download\">[Free Guide: 11 Ways to Gain &amp; Retain More Clients]<\/a><\/h4>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>1. \u201cLet\u2019s revisit your growth strategies.\u201d<\/h2>\n<p>This question is for your existing clients, and there\u2019s a reason it comes first. In business as in fundraising, <strong>the most important clients are the ones you already have<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Selling your existing clients on PPC is easier because you already have a relationship. Plus, if you\u2019re new to paid search advertising yourself, you\u2019ll have an easier time with their accounts since you are already familiar with them. For your first few, you can easily offer your PPC services free of charge in exchange for a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/19\/customer-testimonial-examples\">testimonial<\/a>. (Check out my tips for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/15\/ppc-agency-pricing\">pricing a new PPC offering<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>And if you\u2019re already a seasoned PPC manager, not connecting with your existing clients is like leaving money on the table.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless, it\u2019s good business practices to engage your clients regularly as a check-in. They\u2019re every bit as concerned about growth as you are, and this is a great way to open a conversation about new marketing channels that will help them grow.<\/p>\n<h2>2. \u201cMy other auto dealer had this problem \u2013 what about you?\u201d<\/h2>\n<p>This isn\u2019t about auto dealers. That\u2019s just an example. The point is, two things happen when you use anecdotal stories about other clients: First, <strong>you build credibility<\/strong>. Second, you learn.<\/p>\n<p>By building <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/29\/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks\">industry knowledge<\/a> and listening to your specific client needs, you become an expert.<\/p>\n<p>This question will get your clients listening because we\u2019re naturally interested in <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/05\/how-to-compete-with-big-budgets-adwords\">what our competitors are doing<\/a> and how we can learn from them. If you have multiple clients in the same industry, you should be using your learnings from one account to influence how you manage the others.<\/p>\n<h2>3. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for phone calls, right?\u201d<\/h2>\n<p>Too often, we assume that everyone speaks marketing. Most of us working in the agency world came from marketing. We drop marketing-bombs like \u201cconversion.\u201d Most of your prospects will think you\u2019re trying to save their soul.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do your research before the call<\/strong> and make some assumptions. We know that <em>most <\/em>lawyers and contractors want phone calls. We know most retailers want foot-traffic. We know that online-retailers want an ecommerce purchase.\u00a0Always ask, but don\u2019t hesitate to assume and make that assumption part of the opener.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ea2b45a5-c22f-40b4-8c78-184384147457\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/red-retro-telephone.jpg\" alt=\"getting calls with paid search\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Once you get that \u201cof course\u201d you\u2019re expecting, you can explain how your clients are <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/22\/call-tracking-industries\">using PPC to drive calls<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So what do you say when you get the inevitable pushback? The \u201cWe\u2019re doing just fine\u201d?<\/p>\n<h2>4. \u201cYou said you were doing fine, but&#8230;\u201d<\/h2>\n<p>Most likely, if you hear \u201cWe\u2019re doing just fine,\u201d you\u2019re not talking to a decision-maker. This is when we should go back to their website or LinkedIn and find someone with more authority.<\/p>\n<p>But what if this is the owner? Then we should assume they\u2019re just busy. Turn the \u201cno\u201d into a \u201cmaybe\u201d and ask for a follow-up date\u2026or just call back later. But when you do, <strong>arm yourself with research<\/strong>. What are they doing to generate business? Are they using AdWords? Are their <em>competitors<\/em> using AdWords? Lead with this:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou mentioned last time we talked that you\u2019re doing fine, but I noticed that your competitor popped up when I Googled \u2018St. Louis roof repair.\u2019 Does that mean you\u2019re not doing PPC?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So what do you say if their response is, \u201cPPC is expensive, so we do SEO\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>5. \u201cWhat\u2019s been your experience with PPC?\u201d<\/h2>\n<p>This is actually a great objection. It means they\u2019re somewhat savvy and have a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/26\/marketing-budget\">marketing budget<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This leads to a great follow-up: \u201cHave you ever tried PPC and if so, what happened?\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>PPC complements SEO<\/strong> so well that you have a great opportunity with them. Most likely, they got burned on PPC in the past or their current agency just doesn\u2019t offer it. Either way, you can offer to set up their account for a fee and then manage it for a few months at a discount or offer a free month. Then prove to them that <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/12\/does-google-adwords-work\">AdWords works<\/a> if done right.<\/p>\n<p>However, don\u2019t feel obligated to do too much for free. At my first sales job, they said to never use the word \u201cfree.\u201d It leads people to undervalue what you\u2019re offering.<\/p>\n<h3>In conclusion<\/h3>\n<p>Adding a new revenue stream is a highly effective way to grow your agency.
