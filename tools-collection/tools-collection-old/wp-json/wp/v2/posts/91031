The full funnel options for this channel make it a common starting point (typically alongside Google) for many advertisers, but they also make it rife for seeing overlapping audiences and, in turn, overspending.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, Facebook has provided a tool within the platform to help avoid those overlapping audiences and keep our campaigns mutually exclusive. It\u2019s not perfect. There are limitations. But it\u2019s better than just about every other platform out there in providing insights into how your audience makeups compare<\/p>\n<p>In this article, I\u2019ll show you where the Facebook ads audience overlap tool lives, how it works, and give you some examples for audiences to check to make sure you\u2019re not overspending in your account.<\/p>\n<h3>Contents<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#audience-overlap-tool-facebook-ads-location\">Where to find the audience overlap tool in Facebook ads<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#audience-overlap-tool-how-to-read-report\">How to read your Facebook ads audience overlap report<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#audience-overlap-tool-problem-scenarios\">When audience overlap in Facebook ads can be a problem<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#audience-overlap-tool-avoid-overspending\">How to use the audience overlap tool to avoid overspending<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#audience-overlap-tool-limitations\">Audience overlap tool limitations to be aware of<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"audience-overlap-tool-facebook-ads-location\"><\/div>\n<h2>Where to find the audience overlap tool in Facebook ads<\/h2>\n<p>The audience overlap tool isn\u2019t found in the regular campaign manager.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, we need to head to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-advertise-on-facebook\">Facebook Ads<\/a> Audience Manager.

You\u2019ll be able to see the original size of the audience below the audience name, then off to the right, you\u2019ll see a Venn Diagram of how that audience and your selected audience overlap. Lastly, there\u2019s the number of users in the overlapping portion, meaning those that show up in both audiences, as well as a percentage of the selected audience that is also found in the comparison audience.<\/p>\n<p>For the example above, about 7.9M users from the comparison audience are also in the selected audience, for a 12% overlap of the comparison audience.<\/p>\n<p>While that might not sound like too much by itself, if we flip the audiences and put the smaller audience in the selected audience position, we now have a 99% overlap rate since 7.9M users are nearly all of the 8M users from the smaller audience.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/audience-overlap-tool-comparison-audiences-png.avif\" alt=\"audience overlap tool - example facebook ads audience overlap\" width=\"889\" height=\"467\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91081 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/audience-overlap-tool-comparison-audiences-png.avif 889w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/audience-overlap-tool-comparison-audiences-300x158.avif 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/audience-overlap-tool-comparison-audiences-768x403.avif 768w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/audience-overlap-tool-comparison-audiences-480x252.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 889px) 100vw, 889px\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"audience-overlap-tool-problem-scenarios\"><\/div>\n<h2>When audience overlap in Facebook ads can be a problem<\/h2>\n<p>Audience overlap isn\u2019t inherently bad. If you\u2019re trying to hone in on a group of users because they\u2019re the right fit for your company and you\u2019re trying to reach them in multiple different ways, you\u2019re likely going to have at least a little overlap.<\/p>\n<p>The problem comes in when you\u2019re using these audiences for targeting and not accommodating the overlap.<\/p>\n<p>If you have audiences with overlapping users added to multiple different ad sets or campaigns, those users could be served ads from each of those places where they\u2019re targeted. Since the budget controls live at either the ad set or campaign level in Facebook, depending on which you\u2019re using, that means you could be spending ad funds on the same users just in different ad sets or campaigns.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udea8 Is audience overlap stopping you from getting ahead of competitors?<\/strong> Find out how your account performance compares to averages in your industry using our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/facebook-benchmarks?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_FBAdsBenchmarks2024_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Free Facebook Ads Benchmarks Report<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"audience-overlap-tool-avoid-overspending\"><\/div>\n<h2>3 ways to use the audience overlap tool to avoid overspending<\/h2>\n<p>In the example above, nearly all of the users from the smaller audience are also in the larger audience. So if you targeted both audiences and didn\u2019t have any exclusions in place, you would be targeting that smaller audience in both ad sets or campaigns that it was running in, meaning you would be spending money on it in two different places.<\/p>\n<p>To avoid this, there are a couple of things you could do to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/scale-meta-ads-with-first-party-data\"> optimize your Facebook ads targeting strategy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Don\u2019t target the smaller audience<\/h3>\n<p>The first option is simply not to target the smaller audience. If you\u2019re willing to sacrifice the 96,000 users in the smaller list and leave them untargeted, then we solve the problem of overlap.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Try targeting both audiences together in the same ad set<\/h3>\n<p>If you target both audiences in the same ad set, then the budget allocated to those users comes from the same pool. Each time your account is eligible for one of those users in the auction, the spend will only come from this one ad set, meaning you\u2019re not going to be spending on those users in more than one place, which avoids the main issue.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Create meaningful exclusions<\/h3>\n<p>The last strategy is to use exclusion audiences to help shape your targeting.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/audience-overlap-tool-custom-audiences-png.avif\" alt=\"facebook ads audience overlap tool - example of excluding facebook ads audiences\" width=\"971\" height=\"297\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91080 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/audience-overlap-tool-custom-audiences-png.avif 971w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/audience-overlap-tool-custom-audiences-300x92.avif 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/audience-overlap-tool-custom-audiences-768x235.avif 768w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/audience-overlap-tool-custom-audiences-480x147.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 971px) 100vw, 971px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For this strategy, you have to be careful of how you use your exclusions and only exclude one way to make sure you don\u2019t end up negating the overlapping portion.<\/p>\n<p>For this group, I would target the large audience in an ad set and exclude the smaller audience from it. This means the large audience will target its original 66.9M users and<em> not<\/em> the 7.9M users who were in the overlapping section.<\/p>\n<p>The second ad set would target only the smaller audience and not have any exclusions since there would now be no overlap with the larger audience.<\/p>\n<p>The group of users found in both audiences would only show in the smaller audience ad set and would be excluded from the larger group, meaning it would only be targeted in one of the ad sets.<\/p>\n<div id=\"audience-overlap-tool-limitations\"><\/div>\n<h2>Audience overlap tool limitations to be aware of<\/h2>\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, this tool isn\u2019t perfect and does have some limitations.<\/p>\n<p>While you can use the audience overlap tool for any type of audience you create (meaning lookalikes, customer lists, and saved audiences are all up for grabs), you can only see the overlap for audiences with at least 10,000 Accounts Center accounts.<\/p>\n<p>If your audiences are too small, you\u2019ll see a message in the report that looks like this.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/audience-overlap-tool-limitations-png.avif\" alt=\"audience overlap tool limitations in facebook ads\" width=\"757\" height=\"400\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-91078 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/audience-overlap-tool-limitations-png.avif 757w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/audience-overlap-tool-limitations-300x159.avif 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/audience-overlap-tool-limitations-480x254.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 757px) 100vw, 757px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This message also gives a little further limitation. For privacy considerations, if the overlap between two audiences is lower than 1,000, even if the audiences have 10,000 matched Accounts Center accounts, you won\u2019t be able to see the overlap.<\/p>\n<p>If your audiences are on the larger side, this likely won\u2019t be an issue.<\/p>\n<p>For advertisers trying to be very specific with their targeting and using smaller audiences, this can be frustrating. Without the insights into overlap, you won\u2019t know for sure how many users are in both of your audiences.<\/p>\n<p>Looking on the bright side, though, the tactics for targeting to avoid overlap listed above will still apply. You won\u2019t know the true overlap portion, but the exclusions will still help narrow your groups as needed.<\/p>\n<h2>Make informed targeting decisions with the Facebook ads audience overlap tool<\/h2>\n<p>The Facebook audience overlap tool can be a great tool to see where you\u2019re potentially spending double funds to reach the same users and wisely create mutually exclusive targets, but it does have some limitations.
