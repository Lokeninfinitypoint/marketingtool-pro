There\u2019s plenty enough of that to go around as it is. I will, however, be taking a look back through the past 12 months to see which posts were the most popular at the WordStream blog all year, and examining the wider trends behind the traffic that can help explain why 2016 was such a pivotal year for digital marketers.<\/p>\n<p>So, before we dive into the list of which posts really caught our audience\u2019s eye this year, let\u2019s take a look at those broader trends and what they tell us.<\/p>\n<h2>Trends in PPC, Social, and Search: 2016<\/h2>\n<p>Looking over the list of the most popular WordStream blog posts of this year, there are few surprises. Our original data and research continued to prove popular with our readers, and breaking news headlines about major new AdWords features struck a chord with our audience as they always do. However, there are some tell-tale clues that show us why some of our posts were more popular than others.<\/p>\n<h3>Knowledge is Power: Staying Ahead of the Curve<\/h3>\n<p>Take a look down the list. Notice how many popular posts summarized major changes in marketing in an easily digestible way? This shows that small-business owners, entrepreneurs, and marketers are in desperate need of concise, actionable content about seismic changes taking place across the digital marketing landscape.<\/p>\n<p>Something else we see by looking at this data is that our readers aren\u2019t just looking to understand new features; they want to know how these changes affect their campaigns. That\u2019s why our explainer posts about everything from Facebook ad targeting options to Expanded Text Ads proved so popular with our readers.<\/p>\n<h3>A Growing Shift Toward Paid Social<\/h3>\n<p>Compared to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/12\/31\/best-of-wordstream-blog-2015\">last year\u2019s end-of-year round-up<\/a>, we saw a significant increase in the popularity of posts focused on social advertising, Facebook in particular.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"66600b94-9e8c-46de-a70b-af35dab65c83\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-advertising-concept.png\" alt=\"Facebook advertising concept\" width=\"576\" height=\"401\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Facebook advertising has gained in popularity enormously this year, not least because of its remarkable ROI and highly granular and sophisticated targeting options. Twitter doesn\u2019t seem to gained the same ground, but it remains a very cost-effective and competitive way of advertising your products and services, or promoting content.<\/p>\n<h3>Survival of the Fittest in a Post-Penguin World<\/h3>\n<p>Another trend we see this year is the growing need for marketers and advertisers to keep up with changes beyond their control, such as adjustments to Google\u2019s search algorithm and the shocking decline of organic reach on Facebook.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7ff3f653-6af3-4895-b413-4feb51af6711\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/organic-reach-on-facebook-3.png\" alt=\"facebook organic reach\" width=\"607\" height=\"553\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>These changes are arguably even more significant than new AdWords features or Facebook targeting options. Advertisers can adapt to and learn to leverage new tools and ad formats, but algorithmic changes are much harder to cope with. In some cases, entire organizations have had to radically rethink their approach to digital marketing, particularly with regard to Facebook\u2019s transition to an almost entirely \u201cpay to play\u201d model. We\u2019re glad that our content has helped advertisers and business owners stay on top of wider changes and adapt their strategies to succeed.<\/p>\n<p>1. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/29\/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks\">Google AdWords Benchmarks for YOUR Industry [NEW DATA]<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Even if they won\u2019t admit it, even the most confident advertisers secretly want to know if their account performance measures up to their competition.
