Simple enough right? Well, within the past year, Facebook as a marketing platform has become arguably the most complex and sophisticated way to track specific actions and target individuals based on them.<\/p>\n<p>In this post, I\u2019ll not only show you how to properly track results in Facebook, but also <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/31\/how-to-advertise-on-facebook\">how to advertise on Facebook<\/a> in a way that will allow you to leverage the platform&#8217;s complexity to your advantage.<\/p>\n<h2>The Facebook Pixel<\/h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re thinking about driving direct results using paid media, your first thought should be on setting yourself up for the best possible success. This may sound like common sense, but you\u2019d be surprised how many people cast their line out miles into the ocean, ignoring all of the fish right next to their boat.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s where Facebook\u2019s universal tracking pixel comes in \u2013 officially known as <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/10\/27\/facebook-pixel\">the Facebook Pixel<\/a>. It\u2019s a snippet of HTML code that can be generated from every advertiser\u2019s Business Manager. The reason it\u2019s called \u201cuniversal\u201d is the same reason why your television remote that operates several different things carries the same name. The intention is to place the pixel throughout every page of your website and use it \u201cuniversally\u201d for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/24\/google-ads-conversion-tracking\">conversion tracking<\/a> and audience building.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2021 update:\u00a0<\/strong>The Facebook pixel is losing its power due to iOS 14+ privacy features and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/08\/google-floc\">deprecation of third-party cookies<\/a>.

At the front entrance, people flow in and out periodically throughout the night. If your website is the bar and the potential customers entering and exiting are the site traffic, the Facebook pixel would be a wristband or hand stamp that they are instantly required to wear upon entering. When they leave your bar at any point, they will more than likely continue wearing that stamp or wrist band (unless they actively remove it). Once they are back wandering the street (let\u2019s assume it\u2019s a strip of bars and restaurants), you can target those people back to your bar throughout the night with specific offers or promotions (free shots!).<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a849422a-7ccc-4bbd-ade8-fdc8479de688\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-conversion-tracking-instruct-me-how-to-douglas.png\" alt=\"Facebook conversion tracking instruct me how to douglas meme\" width=\"451\" height=\"592\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>What I just described through that analogy was not only the concept of remarketing, but also the basic usage of the Facebook pixel for that purpose (tracking cookies).<\/p>\n<p>There are several methods, however, to fully utilize this pixel, so now we\u2019ll outline the most effective ways to fully incorporate them into your strategy.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 1: Remarketing Audiences<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/11\/16\/facebook-remarketing\">Remarketing<\/a> is the first step for setting up a proper Facebook Ads foundation.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s assume that you have your Facebook pixel placed throughout your website at this point, you can now start <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/27\/facebook-ad-targeting-options-infographic\">building audiences<\/a> in a variety of different ways.<\/p>\n<p>To create a remarketing audience of users who visited your website, go to the \u201cAudiences\u201d section of Business Manager:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c89386cc-e823-4e66-98ea-ec851d420584\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-conversion-tracking-business-manager-audiences.png\" alt=\"Facebook conversion tracking Business Manager Audiences\" width=\"1916\" height=\"352\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Once there, go to \u201cCreate Audience\u201d and select \u201cCustom Audience\u201d:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"086a8efb-6092-47f7-b001-83b9b55cfdac\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-conversion-tracking-create-custom-audience.png\" alt=\"Facebook conversion tracking create custom audience\" width=\"557\" height=\"131\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Then select \u201cWebsite Traffic\u201d:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"fd81bab1-ddf6-47a3-a80e-9c019526b12b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-conversion-tracking-website-traffic.png\" alt=\"Facebook conversion tracking website audiences\" width=\"641\" height=\"643\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>You should then be given the ability to build a number of remarketing audiences to cater to your desired strategy.<\/p>\n<h3>Timeframe<\/h3>\n<p>One of my favored strategies is based on how recently the user <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/14\/increase-traffic-to-my-website\">visited your website<\/a>.

You can create extremely tailored messaging for these individuals that could increase the probability of another action in the future.<\/p>\n<p>2. Exclusionary \u2013 Just like any other custom audiences, you can exclude these conversion events from your ad sets. A great example of this would be to exclude people who have already converted from seeing your ad again (and thus wasting your spend):<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"244bfcff-9afe-415f-8381-6b3c7bf841e5\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-conversion-tracking-exclude-download-audience.png\" alt=\"Facebook conversion tracking exclude content download audience\" width=\"584\" height=\"366\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>In this example, I\u2019m targeting a remarketing audience and the goal of the campaign is to drive content downloads. I\u2019ve excluded \u201cDownloaded Content\u201d so that when users convert, they\u2019re removed from the audience.<\/p>\n<h2>Using the Conversion Tracking Right Tools<\/h2>\n<p>Keep in mind that Facebook and Google Ads are essentially <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/27\/marketers-toolkit\">marketing tool boxes<\/a>. Inside each are the individual tools necessary to create and build a strong business, brand, and customer base. If you know how to use these tools, the entire process becomes a lot easier.<\/p>\n<p>Setting up proper tracking is an essential tool to ensure that you\u2019re being smart about who you\u2019re reaching with your ads. The easiest way to waste money in Facebook is to advertise to those who aren\u2019t going to convert.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In this comprehensive guide, Brett McHale shows you everything you need to know about tracking &#8211; and driving &#8211; conversions in Facebook.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":171,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[88,7],"tags":[],"dipi_cpt_category":[],"class_list":["post-21702","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-facebook-ads","category-social-media"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v25.8 -
