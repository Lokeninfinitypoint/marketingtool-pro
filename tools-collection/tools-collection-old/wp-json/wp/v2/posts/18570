Put another way, they struggle with sales. This article will explain how your business proposals can help solve this problem.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/07\/proposal-generator\">Your proposal<\/a> is more than just a list of deliverables. It\u2019s part of a process. Here is your strategy for using your proposals to win more business.<\/p>\n<h2>Addressing the Key Objection: <em>Just Send Me A Quote<\/em><\/h2>\n<p>First, do no harm.<\/p>\n<p>A proposal can also be a \u201cfalse-objection.\u201d In sales, the prospect will often push you off indirectly. When they abruptly ask for a quote, it could just be a way of getting off the phone. The rookie mistake is to spend time drafting a quote with an email and sending it. That\u2019s a waste of your time. Instead, push back.<\/p>\n<p>Say: \u201c<em>I\u2019m happy to do that, but I don\u2019t want to waste your time. Can you just let me know if you\u2019re not interested in these services or maybe we can chat later?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not rude to ask this question. You\u2019ll even find that more than likely they are interested. They\u2019re just busy. In this case, don\u2019t let them go without a follow-up.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>[<a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLWebBlogInContentTextLink11WaystoClients.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_11WaystoClients_Download\">Free Guide: 11 Mistakes that Keep Your Agency from Growing<\/a>]<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Emphasize Urgency<\/h2>\n<p>Your quote is your opportunity to shorten your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/26\/sales-cycle\">sales cycle<\/a>. Agencies are busy with creative, business development, administrative work and worst of all\u2026collections. Whether you\u2019re waiting for a signed agreement to get started or a deposit, waiting on a proposal will slow everything.<\/p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/11\/business-proposals\">effective business proposal<\/a> is your opportunity to shorten your sales cycle and get paid. Whether you tell them verbally, in the body of an email or in the proposal itself, let them know the lead-time. They need to know that they\u2019re slowing their own results.<\/p>\n<p>First, it\u2019s good business to set expectations.<\/p>\n<p>Second, it creates urgency. Instead of saying, \u201cDid you get the quote?\u201d You could lead with: \u201cBefore we can begin drafting your copy, setting up keywords and showing your ads on Google, we need your signed agreement\/deposit. There\u2019s about a three-week lead time before your ads can even show, so please get back to me on that proposal at your earliest convenience.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Too often we fall into the \u201cpeople-pleasing trap.\u201d Rather than just telling the client how much harm they\u2019re causing themselves and their business, we want to please them. Don\u2019t.<\/p>\n<h2>Closing As A Favor<\/h2>\n<p>This is a strategy that\u2019s great if you work for someone else at your agency.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ve built rapport with your prospect. They\u2019re sold on your services. They have your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/13\/marketing-proposal\">marketing proposal<\/a>\u2026but haven\u2019t signed and your boss wants to know where it is. In this situation, your job title is irrelevant: You\u2019re a sales rep.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t hesitate to share this with your prospect. It\u2019s honest and people like to help. \u201cHey, I know you\u2019re busy, but my boss is asking for the paperwork. We\u2019re onboarding three more clients and we don\u2019t want you waiting. Can we get a signature today?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Again, it\u2019s true, and it usually works.<\/p>\n<h2>You\u2019re Not Done: Pick Up the Phone<\/h2>\n<p>The proposal is part of a closing process. The phone and email work with it.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7b506057-b274-4e87-b1eb-435bbf6852d5\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/glengarry-lemmon.jpg\" alt=\"always be following up\" width=\"435\" height=\"354\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Always Be Following Up<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/getphound.com\/\">GetPhound<\/a>, a Pennsylvania-based agency, is client-centric in their proposals. They helped with this article and recommend offering small, medium and large packages so clients feel empowered to choose a tailored solution.<\/p>\n<p>Also, don\u2019t be afraid to follow up to earn their business.<\/p>\n<p>The follow-up is the critical part. If you\u2019re offering multiple packages or have multiple quotes, you can reach out to inquire about which option they\u2019d prefer. Following up to answer any questions they have is very effective and also helps the client make a choice.<\/p>\n<p>In this scenario, the proposal is your reason for another contact with the client and another chance to close. Let them hear your voice.<\/p>\n<h2>Don\u2019t Get Greedy<\/h2>\n<p>Finally, don\u2019t get greedy.<\/p>\n<p>In boxing, fighters get greedy after they land one or two punches. They stay too long and keep swinging. Unfortunately, this gives their opponent a great opportunity to counter-punch.<\/p>\n<p>In agency sales, sometimes you should start small. PPC is perfect for that. Offer to manage or build their paid search account. From there, you can upsell as you build rapport. Send multiple quotes, but don\u2019t be discouraged if they decline the biggest one\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Remember: Your proposal is much more than a document. If used properly, it can lead to more transactions and more clients.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Most agencies we speak with struggle to find new clients.
