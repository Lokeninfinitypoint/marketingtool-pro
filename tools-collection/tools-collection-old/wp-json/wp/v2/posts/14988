The study tracked conversions to see if there was any difference in performance of the two button colors based on a sample of 2,000 visitors to the landing page. Contrary to the study author\u2019s expectations, the red CTA button outperformed the green one by a whopping 21%. So is that the final answer?

A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.widerfunnel.com\/case-studies\/sap-landing-page-optimization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wider Funnel test<\/a> corroborated this stance with a study that showed a Big Orange Button resulted in a 32.5% increase in conversions. As Unbounce notes, \u201cAccording to Wikipedia, Orange represents energy, enthusiasm, and a \u2018get-it-done\u2019 attitude.

Some CRO experts are certain your button should be a certain color. As for me, rather than focusing on button color alone, I believe the <em>context<\/em>\u00a0of the button (i.e., your web design)\u00a0is what\u2019s important.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here are five critical web design mistakes that cost you conversions<\/strong> \u2013 regardless of your CTA button color.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Using CTA colors that blend in<\/h2>\n<p>The very first web design\u00a0mistake you can make when it comes to your landing pages is that of using a CTA button color that blends in.<\/p>\n<p>For a moment, let\u2019s take a look at the HubSpot study again:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f1ab7d76-e1d4-42ad-974b-334e2260ae1f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/web-design-mistakes-hubspot_1.jpg\" alt=\"web-design-mistakes-hubspot-study\" width=\"500\" height=\"266\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>When you carefully analyze that image, something becomes instantly clear: the green button blends in with the site\u2019s design. The site\u2019s color scheme and background is green. After black, green is the most used color on that page. Naturally, users are already used to seeing the color green and are as a result more likely to ignore it.<\/p>\n<p>Now, when you take a look at the CTA button on <a href=\"https:\/\/hostingfacts.com\/best-vps-hosting-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this page comparing VPS services<\/a>, however, the bright orange color stands out in stark contrast to the site\u2019s blue color scheme \u2013 and that is all that matters.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6cbbb7cc-b024-4e6c-8f6f-145aef842402\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/web-design-mistakes-bluehost-example.jpg\" alt=\"web-design-mistakes-color-contrast\" width=\"766\" height=\"523\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>This makes sense and goes in line with a principle of psychology called <a href=\"https:\/\/sciencing.com\/examples-sensory-adaptation-14224.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sensory adaptation<\/a>. While this doesn\u2019t talk about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/12\/color-psychology-marketing\">color psychology<\/a> exactly, it does talk about stimuli and how we respond to them. According to this principle, repeated exposure to any stimulus prompts us to gradually tune it out until we fail to notice it.<\/p>\n<p>Take a minute to think about what happens when you wear your clothes or your shoes. You feel it for a while, and then it feels as if it is part of your body. Okay, how about when you dip your hands into slightly hot water for a few minutes? It hurts at first, but then your hand adapts and you no longer feel it. That is sensory adaptation at work, and it is one of the first principles you should understand when it comes to web design and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/22\/conversion-rate-optimizations\">conversion rate optimization<\/a>. Whether it is repeat noise or a button color, we are hardwired to react in the same way and start ignoring the stimulus.<\/p>\n<p>Before you start your button color tests, realize that a color that stands out \u2013 whether it is red or orange \u2013 will always outperform a color that blends in. So, always make sure to design your website such that your button color stands out in comparison to your color scheme.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Making buttons that are too small\u00a0\u2013 or too big<\/h2>\n<p>Just as CTA button color needs to stand out, the size of your CTA needs to be a good \u2013 and compelling \u2013 fit. Another very common web design mistake is creating buttons that are either too small or too big.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s go back to the WiderFunnel test, which resulted in a 32.5% increase in conversions and the concept of the \u201cBig Orange Button.\u201d It is clear that the button size played a major role in the increase in conversions.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2275f0a1-643d-4a5d-8c5b-b23ba839475b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/web-design-mistakes-cta-button-size.jpg\" alt=\"web-design-mistakes-button-size\" width=\"470\" height=\"414\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>In fact, an article on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/2009\/10\/call-to-action-buttons-examples-and-best-practices\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">call to action button best practices<\/a> implies that using a CTA button that is 20% larger than the logo is a good idea.<\/p>\n<p>So how important is CTA button size? Important, but relatively. Your CTA button should be large enough to be noticeable in comparison to other elements on your page \u2013 so that it stands out. However, especially in a world where more people access the Internet from mobile devices than desktop computers, making it too large \u2013 in a way that worsens your web design and diminishes UX\u00a0\u2013 can backfire and result in a <a href=\"https:\/\/unbounce.com\/conversion-rate-optimization\/design-call-to-action-buttons\/\">decrease in conversions<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"0c14ce8c-b814-493e-a6c1-d0ae1d449260\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/web-design-mistakes-button-size-comparison.jpg\" alt=\"web-design-mistakes-cta-button-size-comparison\" width=\"560\" height=\"222\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>So when it comes to CTAs, size matters: It has to be big enough to stand out, to be noticeable, but at the same time it shouldn\u2019t be<em> so<\/em> big that it impacts user experience.<\/p>\n<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><strong>\ud83d\udce3 Free guide<\/strong> &gt;&gt; <\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download\" class=\"waffle-rich-text-link\">The 36 Best Call to Action Phrases (Ever)<\/a><\/strong><span><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/div><\/div><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>3. Ignoring your audience&#8217;s color preference<\/h2>\n<p>Besides using CTA colors that blend in, another critical web design\u00a0mistake you can make is ignoring your audience\u2019s color preference, both for your CTA and overall landing page color scheme.<\/p>\n<p>If you run a website where your audience consists of cyclists\u00a0with a preference for doing risky things <em>and <\/em>a website where your audience consists of yogis looking for peace and calm in their lives, due to this huge divide in the type of audience, the color that appeals to each audiences will be different.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, research shows that color of your web design alone can influence people\u2019s decision to interact with your brand. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.emeraldinsight.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1108\/00251740610673332\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">One study<\/a> found that people will decide whether to interact with you within 90 seconds, and that up to 90% of this decision will be influenced by color.<\/p>\n<p>Men and women typically have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.helpscout.com\/blog\/psychology-of-color\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">different color preferences<\/a>. A color that works for an audience of men might not be as effective for an audience of women. This is worth keeping in mind.<\/p>\n<p>The chart below shows common color preferences for men and women:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5309cb44-a35d-45fc-ab06-8988d619506a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/web-design-mistakes-color-preferences.jpg\" alt=\"web-design-mistakes-men-women-color-preferences\" width=\"1000\" height=\"355\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>And this chart shows color dislikes:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"740528e3-542e-427e-b666-e4089ac606bb\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/web-design-mistakes-color-dislikes.jpg\" alt=\"web-design-mistakes-men-women-color-dislikes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"355\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>4. Not optimizing for user flow<\/h2>\n<p>What is user flow? Basically, it\u2019s the series of steps a user takes to achieve a particular goal on a website.<\/p>\n<p>Good web design and conversion optimization should not ignore user flow. <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/cta-case-studies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Moz<\/a> found that when users were asked to \u201cschedule a demo,\u201d users would have to stop what they are doing, check their calendar, and see if there is available time matching the company\u2019s schedule. User flow was interrupted by this, and it affected conversions. By tweaking the CTA offer from \u201cSchedule a Demo Today!\u201d to \u201cFREE 5 Min Demo Video,\u201d Moz eliminated the need for having to check the calendar. This consequently improved user flow, and conversions increased by a massive 739%.<\/p>\n<p>Web design and CRO success is about more than just getting users to click a button. It\u2019s about getting visitors to become leads, and it\u2019s about getting leads to become paying customers. This means your effort goes beyond just the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/14\/ppc-landing-page-experience\">landing page<\/a>. The subscription and checkout page matter, too.<\/p>\n<p>Any action that makes users stop, or even pause, in the process of achieving the goal you set for them on your website is a fundamental web design mistake because it interrupts\u00a0their flow <em>and<\/em> costs\u00a0you conversions. This could be how your site structure and elements are designed<span lang=\"EN\"> \u2013 there is <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/perceptual-set-theory-conversions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">no point in straying from user expectations on your website<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Various studies have demonstrated that every extra form field you add interrupts user flow and negatively affects conversions. So drop those extra form fields from your web design.\u00a0Only request for the barest minimum information you need to get users to act now \u2013 you can gradually get other necessary information later.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Forgetting trust factors to boost your credibility<\/h2>\n<p>Often, when you go through\u00a0CRO studies, you see a major brand implement a particular conversion hack with great results. But when you go ahead to incorporate the same thing into your web design, you got nothing. Or sometimes your conversions even suffer.<\/p>\n<p>After all, based on how much Amazon (or your favorite big brand) spends on conversions, if it implements a particular conversion tweak it can\u2019t be wrong, right? Not necessarily. Your\u00a0not getting results doesn\u2019t necessarily invalidate the experiment you read: perhaps you are studying that particular experiment in isolation when, in reality, there are other factors at play.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Let me be clearer<\/strong>: You could have the best offer, extraordinarily good copy, and follow all the tips in this article, but it wouldn\u2019t move the needle for you if people do not trust you. In a world rife with scams and spams, people aren\u2019t just careful about who they give their credit card details to \u2013 they are also careful about who they give their email address to.<\/p>\n<p>If people do not trust you,\u00a0conversion optimization hacks won\u2019t make much of a difference. This is why one of the most common web design mistakes I see is failing to improve their trust factors.<\/p>\n<p>Simple tweaks like using a trust seal can double your conversions \u2013 as many as <a href=\"https:\/\/econsultancy.com\/which-e-commerce-trustmarks-are-most-effective\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">48% of people<\/a> won\u2019t trust a website that doesn\u2019t use a trust mark.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"666ebf0e-c3ac-4fcb-9278-d7224c1082c3\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/web-design-mistakes-trust-signals.jpg\" alt=\"web-design-mistakes-trust-factors\" width=\"615\" height=\"197\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Research also shows that simply enabling SSL can boost sales by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.papercheck.com\/extended-validation-helps-boost-conversion-at-papercheck\/\">up to 30%<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Take active measures to ensure that you communicate trust with visitors to your landing page:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use trust marks and secure seals to give assurance about users\u2019 security on your website.<\/li>\n<li>Use SSL \u2013 let them see that green padlock!<\/li>\n<li>Use social proof when possible to reinforce the belief that they aren\u2019t taking a leap of faith in dealing with you; they are joining others who have achieved great results.<\/li>\n<li>Make it easy to contact you on your website.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Remember: Your CRO results may vary<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>At the end of the day, it is important to realize that when it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/22\/conversion-rate-optimizations\">conversion rate optimizations<\/a>, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to things.
