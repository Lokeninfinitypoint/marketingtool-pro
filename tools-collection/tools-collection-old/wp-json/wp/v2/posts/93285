Use style codes for consistency<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve noticed a weird dichotomy with<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/best-ai-photo-generators\"> AI image generation tools<\/a>. One of their key selling points is that they can help your team maintain a consistent vibe in your images.

What perplexed me is how Geoff is able to get <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/03\/06\/how-to-use-chatgpt-for-small-business-marketing\">ChatGPT<\/a> to consistently create these thematically relevant images without all the weird hallucinations it gives me when I try.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI start by giving ChatGPT the post as text,\u201d he explained. \u201cThen I ask it to brainstorm possible images to accompany the list. This gives you the opportunity to select the best and most relevant instead of relying on its \u2018best guess.\u2019 Then I tell it which image sounds best and ask it to generate that image.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So, before Geoff asks for an actual image, he has the AI suggest some options. It\u2019s sort of like riffing ideas with an art director before they go off and draft the creative.<\/p>\n<p>He also says that <em>how<\/em> you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/08\/chatgpt-prompts\">prompt<\/a> it matters a lot, too. \u201cI often ask it to include \u2018me Geoff The Healthcare SEO Meakin\u2019 and describe myself (male, mid 40s, Caucasian, beard, quite slim build, blue shirt). Being specific really helps a lot.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He\u2019ll often add more detail, like \u201cdo it in the style of a kids&#8217; animated 3D movie.\u201d He says that not only does it make it fun, but it also \u201creduces the importance of imperfections.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of imperfections, Geoff said you can\u2019t assume the AI will get everything right. \u201cI always check any text in the images for spelling and grammar,\u201d he noted. \u201c You can select and edit it or ask to remove it, which is often easier than regenerating from scratch.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Geoff gave me one more tip on setting a style for your images. \u201cI&#8217;ve found that if you ask for a specific style, it may refuse on copyright grounds,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, \u2018create an image in the style of Star Wars.\u2019 However, if you ask it to describe the visual aesthetic of Star Wars and use this in your prompt instead, you can circumvent the plagiarism issues.\u201d<\/p>\n<div id=\"treat-ai-image-generators-as-a-sketchbook-not-a-shortcut\"><\/div>\n<h3>3.

My best images don\u2019t come from saying &#8216;portrait of a woman,&#8217; they come from ideas like <em>&#8216;surreal creative image\/portrait<\/em>.'&#8221;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Describe materiality and atmosphere:<\/strong> &#8220;I always include textures (like silk, cracked glass, fog), light quality (soft cinematic backlight, chiaroscuro), and artistic style (inspired by analog film, surreal fashion editorials, etc).&#8221;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use structure and contrast inside the prompt:<\/strong> For example, <em>\u201cA surreal portrait of a young model surrounded by floating feathers and ceramic fragments, soft skin tone, calm expression, pale background, fashion editorial lighting, in the style of poetic surrealism.\u201d<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Iterate through subtle changes:<\/strong> &#8220;Once I get an image close to what I want, I regenerate with just one or two adjustments, like replacing <em>white feathers<\/em> with <em>burnt paper<\/em> to see how far the composition can stretch emotionally without losing coherence.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Melissa said she uses <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freepik.com\/ai\/image-generator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Freepik\u2019s AI Image Generator<\/a> for most of her current work. And then she dives into the different AI models available in the Freepik AI Suite for specific projects.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI can choose certain models that work better than others for each project,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;For example, if I\u2019m working with static images, I prefer Seedream. If we\u2019re talking about video, I usually go with Veo 3. When I want something fast and raw, I run some tests with other models, but these give me a better balance between coherence and emotional atmosphere.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re ready to take your masterpiece to the next level, Melissa offered a few advanced steps she uses to reduce errors and improve the output:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Work in series:<\/strong> Instead of refining one image endlessly, she builds a \u201ccollection\u201d of 4\u20136 variations and analyzes them as if she were curating a visual exhibition.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Focus on gesture and composition first:<\/strong> That\u2019s before tweaking style details. If the posture and framing don&#8217;t work, no texture will fix it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use style, composition, light, and color modifiers: <\/strong>This lets her guide the model without over-controlling it or having to change the prompt so much.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"use-ai-to-prompt-ai\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Use AI to prompt AI<\/h3>\n<ol start=\"4\"><\/ol>\n<p>The hardest part about teasing a usable image out of an AI generator is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-prompts\">writing the perfect prompt<\/a>. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/farah-ahmed-0b11691b6\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Farah Ahmed<\/a>, content marketing strategist for <a href=\"http:\/\/zilliondesigns.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ZillionDesigns<\/a>, has a handy little trick to make it much easier\u2014she gets AI to write them.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been using LeapAI [for image generation] and I actually get prompts from ChatGPT and keep refining them,\u201d she said. \u201cFor example, when I&#8217;m working on a social media image, I get AI to prompt all the details possible, like the colors, background, core element, and the supporting ones.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Farah said she prefers LeapAI over Microsoft Designer for this process because it can work with less refined prompts. But if LeapAI isn\u2019t cutting it, she keeps other tools on standby.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUsually, it [LeapAI] gives me something close enough that I want,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If not, I switch to Ideagram, which gives me five variations from the prompt. And I do tweak some images around in Canva too!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I love Farah\u2019s ChatGPT idea.

Try multiple AI platforms<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019ll admit, I fell into the trap of thinking AI image generators don\u2019t work for me because of a few early experiences with one tool.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/travis-irby-06713862\/\"> Travis Irby<\/a>, founder of<a href=\"http:\/\/wepaint.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> wepaint.ai<\/a>, said each model works a little differently, and it\u2019s best to experiment with several to determine where they work best.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGo beyond ChatGPT\u2019s image generation and explore different models on a platform like <a href=\"http:\/\/replicate.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">replicate.com<\/a>,\u201d Travis said. \u201cEach model has strengths. For example, flux-context-pro is great at image editing, recraft-v3-svg creates vector images, and clarity-upscaler can increase the size of your images.

Use AI to explore ideas<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019ve used <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-copywriting-tools\">AI copy generators<\/a> more than their visual counterparts. And in the copy world, I don\u2019t want AI to write for me. Instead, I use it to pressure test ideas and spark creativity.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/jaqiervin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jacqueline Ervin<\/a>, a graphic designer at Gannett, says the same philosophy applies to AI image generators. \u201cSo much of creating great design work is spending a large amount of time concepting and troubleshooting a large number of ideas to whittle down to the best one. In AI&#8217;s current state, that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m finding it helpful\u2014exploring a bunch of ideas very quickly to set you on the right path.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Jacqueline gave a recent example where she was tasked with laying out a graphic to illustrate omnichannel marketing pathways. \u201cI gave Microsoft Copilot a go, and to be honest, it did a poor job, but absolutely set me on a great trajectory to creating a piece that was cohesive and something I&#8217;m proud to include in our marketing collateral,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes it&#8217;s helpful to see what \u2018not\u2019 to do to get you on the right track.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/ai-image-prompt-tips-wordstream-jaqi-combined.webp\" alt=\"AI image prompt tips - two versions of a design.\" width=\"937\" height=\"488\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-93292 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/ai-image-prompt-tips-wordstream-jaqi-combined.webp 937w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/ai-image-prompt-tips-wordstream-jaqi-combined-480x250.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>AI\u2019s not-great version on the left helped motivate Jacqueline\u2019s final version on the right.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe biggest tip for any designer looking to use AI is to set clear expectations for what you want out of the tool,\u201d Jacqueline added. \u201cIt is still very much the responsibility of the designer to execute and deliver a final piece that lives up to professional expectations.<\/p>\n<p>For graphic designers, especially, AI is more of a sparring partner than a replacement for their creativity. It can give you fast mock-ups of ideas and help keep you from going too far down the wrong design path. The key is to go into an AI design session with that expectation already set.<\/p>\n<div id=\"build-custom-gems-in-gemini-pro\"><\/div>\n<h3>7.

As you generate images you like, be sure to add them to your project knowledge resources so the AI assistant can begin to understand the style you\u2019re going for.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This is Reggie&#8217;s typical process when working in an existing Custom Gem:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Write a project prompt into his Custom Gem, ensuring that he provides as much context and relevant examples as possible.<\/li>\n<li>If there are any issues with the images, he will ask for revisions.<\/li>\n<li>If he thinks he will want the same revision on future photos, he adds those instructions and any relevant updates to the custom gem.<\/li>\n<li>Download the image.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Reggie gave me a link for a free four-month trial of Gemini Pro. I promptly used it to create the image of this racecar.
