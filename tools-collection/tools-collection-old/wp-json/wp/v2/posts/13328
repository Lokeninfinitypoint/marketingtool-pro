But that\u2019s neither here nor there.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re a competitive person or not, there\u2019s no denying the power of a perfectly executed competitive ad. And thanks to the high degree of control you enjoy when advertising on the basis of keywords\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/31\/phrase-match-broad-match-modifier-close-variants\">changes to match types<\/a> notwithstanding\u2014Google Ads provides a golden opportunity to get your best messaging in front of your competitors\u2019 prospects.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/competitive-ads-ezcater.png\" alt=\"competitive-ads-ezcater-vs-chipotle\" width=\"655\" height=\"276\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In today\u2019s post, after briefly explaining the logistics of Google Ads competitor targeting, we\u2019ll walk you through the 11 best <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/04\/google-competitive-ad-policy\">competitive ads<\/a> we\u2019ve ever seen in the Google search results.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Instantly find out how you stack up against your Google Ads competitors by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">running our free Google Ads performance Grader<\/a>!<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How do you run competitive ads on Google?<\/h2>\n<p>Running competitive ads on Google means engaging in a tactic known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/06\/12\/bidding-on-competitor-brands\">competitor targeting<\/a>. The basic idea is that targeting a competitor\u2019s brand name as a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords\">keyword<\/a> allows you to advertise your business\u2014and, thus, offer an alternative product or service\u2014whenever a user searches for them on Google.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/competitive-ads-home-chef.png\" alt=\"competitive-ads-home-chef-vs-hello-fresh\" width=\"652\" height=\"556\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>Not one of the <\/em>best<em> competitive ads we\u2019ve seen, but you get the idea.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Running competitive ads on Google, as you may have already guessed, is a roll of the dice. Why? Because you can never know for sure whether the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/12\/10\/three-types-of-search-queries\">intent<\/a> behind a branded search query is <strong>informational<\/strong> or <strong>navigational<\/strong>. Whereas informational intent means the user is simply looking for information, navigational intent means they want to visit a specific website.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s use the above screenshot as an example. It\u2019s entirely possible that a user who searches \u201chellofresh\u201d has recently heard a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/goal-talk\">podcast<\/a> ad for the company and has decided to use Google to find more information. If this is the case, a competitive ad like Home Chef\u2019s could be a slam dunk; because the user isn\u2019t fully committed to HelloFresh, this is a great opportunity for Home Chef to present themselves as an alternative solution.<\/p>\n<p>However, it\u2019s <em>also<\/em> possible that the user is already a HelloFresh customer and is simply using Google to navigate to the company\u2019s website. If this is the case, Home Chef has virtually no chance of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/14\/ppc-ad-copywriting\">enticing the user to click<\/a> and make a purchase from them instead.<\/p>\n<p>This leads me to another important point: If you decide to run competitive ads on Google, <strong>you have to feel comfortable with subpar quality scores<\/strong>. Because a lot of branded queries are navigational in intent, it\u2019s likely that your competitor keyword click-through rates\u2014and, therefore, your competitor keyword quality scores\u2014will be below average. Plus, the fact that you can\u2019t include competitor brand names in your copy diminishes the relevance of your ads.<\/p>\n<p>And that\u2019s okay! Though you should generally aim for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/19\/whats-a-good-quality-score\">high quality scores<\/a>, doing so really isn\u2019t possible when you\u2019re running competitive ads. If you focus on writing compelling copy that grabs the attention of users with informational intent, it\u2019ll all be worth it.<\/p>\n<p>For inspiration, you should draw from these 11 ads.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">The 11 best competitive ads we\u2019ve seen on Google<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To ensure that anyone can walk away from this post with some competitive inspiration, we\u2019ve assembled a mix of both B2C and B2B companies. For each one, we\u2019ll break down exactly what makes it an awesome competitive ad.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">1. 2Movers vs. U-Haul<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/competitive-ads-2-movers.png\" alt=\"competitive-ads-2-movers-vs-uhaul\" width=\"653\" height=\"254\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The effectiveness of this ad lay in the second headline: No Need to Rent A Truck. By speaking directly to what the user is trying to accomplish and assuring them that there\u2019s an easier solution, 2Movers puts forward a really compelling <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\">value proposition<\/a>. Plus, the inclusion of a low price in the first headline makes their offer that much harder to resist. If you\u2019re like me and find the idea of renting a U-Haul completely unappealing, you\u2019re clicking this ad <em>quickly<\/em>.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">2. Tuft &amp; Needle vs. Casper<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/competitive-ads-tuft-and-needle.png\" alt=\"competitive-ads-tuft-and-needle-vs-casper\" width=\"650\" height=\"426\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let\u2019s address the elephant in the room: I haven\u2019t the slightest clue why Tuft &amp; Needle put their first headline in quotation marks. Though it makes no sense and annoys me endlessly, it\u2019s not enough to knock them off this list.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Why? Because their second headline is <strong>just that good<\/strong>. When marketers refer to using the headline to create a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/10\/curiosity-gap\">curiosity gap<\/a>, they\u2019re typically talking about <em>organic<\/em> search. Nonetheless, Tuft &amp; Needle successfully employs the power of mystery in this ad of theirs. By claiming to know \u201cthe truth\u201d about Casper and implying that it has something to do with the price of their mattresses, Tuft &amp; Needle makes their ad infinitely more compelling.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">3. Glassdoor vs. Ziprecruiter<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/competitive-ads-glass-door.png\" alt=\"competitive-ads-glassdoor-vs-ziprecruiter\" width=\"649\" height=\"256\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here, Glassdoor takes an approach somewhat similar to that of 2Movers. In the first headline, they perfectly mirror the user\u2019s query and effectively turn it into a call to action. Wisely, they follow that up with a simple yet attractive value proposition: Reach Millions of Job Seekers. Beyond making a strong impression\u2014that\u2019s a lot of job seekers\u2014this second headline <em>also<\/em> does a great job of matching the user\u2019s intent\u2014that is, to reach potential candidates.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">4. Lyft vs. Uber<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/competitive-ads-lyft.png\" alt=\"competitive-ads-lyft-vs-uber\" width=\"667\" height=\"363\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Just like Glassdoor, Lyft does a perfect job of mirroring the search query and incorporating it into their core <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/20\/call-to-action-examples\">CTA<\/a>: Apply to Become a Lyft Driver. But that\u2019s not what makes this a great competitive ad\u2014it\u2019s the second headline that really brings it home. Typically, people decide to drive for companies like Uber and Lyft because they\u2019re in need of some extra cash. By including a specific amount of money ($1,500) and a specific timeline (one month), Lyft makes a strong, concrete case for driving with them.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">5. Pep Boys vs. Meineke<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/competitive-ads-pep-boys.png\" alt=\"competitive-ads-pep-boys-vs-meineke\" width=\"644\" height=\"280\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nothing too complicated going on here, folks: By using the competitor targeting tactic to promote a limited-time offer, Pep Boys puts forward an appealing alternative to Meineke. More subtly, by repeatedly including \u201ctires\u201d throughout their copy, they boost their keyword relevance and claim the top sponsored search result.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another aspect of this competitive ad that I like quite a bit is the inclusion of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/09\/15\/adwords-ad-extensions-guide\">location extension<\/a> (seen at the very bottom of the ad). It\u2019s never a bad idea to let users know that you can help them out at a nearby location\u2014especially when you\u2019re directly competing with another company.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">6. SendinBlue vs. MailerLite<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/competitive-ads-send-in-blue.png\" alt=\"competitive-ads-send-in-blue-vs-mailer-lite\" width=\"651\" height=\"254\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adspolicy\/answer\/6118?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">According to Google<\/a>: \u201cIf a trademark owner submits a complaint to Google about the use of their trademark in ads, we\u2019ll review it and may enforce restrictions on the use of the trademark.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why I said you can\u2019t include your competitors\u2019 brand names in your ad copy\u2014because they\u2019ll almost certainly report you to Google. Evidently, SendinBlue isn\u2019t too concerned about it.<\/p>\n<p>I love the directness of SendinBlue\u2019s messaging here: <em>\u201cWe offer an alternative to MailerLite and you can try it\u2014right now\u2014for $0\/month.\u201d<\/em> Additionally, this is a rare case in which I\u2019m actually impressed by an advertiser\u2019s use of description copy; the ability to send up to 40,000 emails for only $25\/month definitely jumps off the screen.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, to bring everything home, the use of an ad extension to promote a deal on annual plans is a super nice touch.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Shipt vs. Instacart<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/competitive-ads-shipt.png\" alt=\"competitive-ads-shipt-vs-insta-cart\" width=\"654\" height=\"255\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You know you\u2019ve written an awesome competitive ad when you manage to squeeze not one but <em>two<\/em> value propositions into your headline copy. That\u2019s exactly what Shipt does here in their efforts to compete with Instacart. As a result, with one single ad, they successfully position themselves as a convenient solution in two separate use cases<\/p>\n<p>In the first case, someone who\u2019s procrastinated the task of ordering food for a gathering or an event hurriedly searches for the first food delivery service they can think of: Instacart. Here comes Shipt to save the day\u2014prominently highlighting their same-day delivery service.<\/p>\n<p>In the second case, someone who\u2019s trying to host a group of people while sticking to a budget takes to Google to learn more about the services at their disposal. Once again, Shipt is there with the perfect solution\u2014free delivery on orders over $35.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Sell Back Your Book vs. Chegg<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/competitive-ads-sell-back-your-book.png\" alt=\"competitive-ads-sell-back-your-book-vs-chegg\" width=\"655\" height=\"356\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As someone who recently graduated college, I\u2019m especially appreciative of this competitive ad from Sell Back Your Book. The first headline\u2014\u201dWe Pay the Shipping\u201d\u2014demonstrates their understanding of the user\u2019s chief <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/28\/pain-points\">pain point<\/a> in a succinct, effective way. Recognizing that students are often strapped for cash\u2014hence the demand for used books in the first place\u2014Sell Back Your Book makes the perfect money-saving offer: <strong>free shipping<\/strong>. Plus, the second headline injects a little urgency into the copy and lets the user know that they can take care of their problem <em>right now<\/em>.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Asana vs. Monday.com<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/competitive-ads-asana.png\" alt=\"competitive-ads-asana-vs-monday\" width=\"671\" height=\"607\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Much like Tuft &amp; Needle, the team over at Asana is using their competitive ad copy to create a curiosity gap. It would be one thing to simply claim that teams make the switch from Monday.com to Asana; it\u2019s <em>another<\/em> thing to invite users to visit the Asana website and find out <em>why<\/em>. For high-funnel users who\u2019ve just started doing research, this ad could prove hugely influential.<\/p>\n<p>It also doesn\u2019t hurt that Asana\u2019s value proposition\u2014All Your Work In One Place\u2014is infinitely better than Monday.com\u2019s\u2014Work Better with Monday.com. Regardless of where this particular user falls in their customer journey, we know for a fact that they\u2019re looking for a solution that will help them get more organized. Asana\u2019s copywriters seem to have a greater appreciation for that.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Valvoline vs. Jiffy Lube<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/competitive-ads-valvoline.png\" alt=\"competitive-ads-valvoline-vs-jiffy-lube\" width=\"650\" height=\"295\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This one from Valvoline is another perfect example of a competitive ad that isn\u2019t doing anything complicated. It\u2019s safe to assume that someone who searches \u201cjiffy lube\u201d is looking to find a nearby solution\u2014fast. What better way to grab their attention than with a $25 coupon? The fact that Valvoline has managed to snag the top sponsored position doesn\u2019t hurt, either.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the inclusion of a location extension at the bottom of the ad, I\u2019m a fan of the second headline\u2014Find A Location Near You. Why? Because it implies a simple yet important promise: <em>\u201cClick our ad and we\u2019ll connect you with the most convenient solution possible.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>11. LinkedIn vs. Twitter<\/h3>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/competitive-ads-linkedin.png\" alt=\"competitive-ads-linkedin-vs-twitter\" width=\"643\" height=\"257\" \/><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It\u2019s always good to end on a bit of a meta note, right? In this case, LinkedIn is using a competitive ad to build awareness among businesses interested in advertising on Twitter. Though LinkedIn and Twitter aren\u2019t <em>entirely<\/em> similar, it\u2019s a reasonably safe bet that someone looking to advertise on Twitter could be interested in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/05\/linkedin-advertising\">LinkedIn advertising<\/a>, as well.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It\u2019s far from groundbreaking, but I like the simplicity of using \u201cGrow Your Business\u201d as the core value proposition; I think it succeeds in getting to the heart of the user\u2019s intent. Elsewhere, the description does a great job of fleshing out that value prop. By referencing the immensity of their user base and the variety of objectives advertisers can pursue\u2014brand awareness, lead generation, etc.\u2014LinkedIn uses their description copy to really drive the point home.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Running competitive ads on Google: The big takeaway<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As you\u2019ve noticed by this point, you can go in a ton of different directions when running competitive ads on Google. Depending on which type of customer you\u2019re trying to reach and which specific product or service you\u2019re promoting, what makes your competitive ads successful will be unique to your business and industry.<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, we can leave you with a universal takeaway: The best competitive ads are the ones that <strong>closely align with the user\u2019s intent<\/strong> and <strong>make compelling use of their copy<\/strong>. As long as you write copy that matches what the user is trying to accomplish and gives them a legitimate reason to click, you\u2019ll find success.<\/p>\n<p>For more competitive advertising tips, check out our post on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/24\/how-to-compete-in-google-ads\">how to compete in Google Ads without raising bids<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Running competitive ads in the Google search results is a super effective way to win new customers.
