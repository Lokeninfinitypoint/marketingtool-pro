I saw them on Facebook three times in the last two weeks so I ordered them. I figured it must\u2019ve been fate,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her that <strong>it was not fate, it was remarketing<\/strong>. We\u2019ve all been victim to the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/12\/04\/adwords-remarketing-best-practices-guide\">power of remarketing<\/a>. In fact, I\u2019m often prey even though I\u2019m fully aware what these sneaky advertisers are up to.<\/p>\n<h2>What is Remarketing?<\/h2>\n<p>For those of you unfamiliar, remarketing works by following your leads around the web with related offers. When a user visits your website they are \u201ccookied\u201d or tagged. To remarket to these visitors, a code is placed on the page that the user visits, which then triggers your ads to follow that cookied user around the web, whether that be on a social media site or on various websites across the internet. So when you see ads on the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/18\/google-display-network-tips\">sidebars or top banners of other sites<\/a> of the new dining set you just browsed on Pottery Barn, this isn\u2019t a coincidence or \u201cfate,\u201d it\u2019s remarketing.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c2c6f021-58c4-4288-9f41-160916fe4fee\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-remarketing-shoes-1.png\" alt=\"Facebook Remarketing\" width=\"912\" height=\"400\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Remarketing comes in many shapes and sizes. For instance, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Google Ads<\/a>\u00a0(formerly known as Google AdWords), allows advertisers to remarket through their platform by creating remarketing lists with a set of rules. You can targeted all website visitors or you can target visitors who came to a specific page on your website or completed a specific action. Then Google will trigger your ads to show to the same visitors on websites across the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/18\/google-display-network-tips\">Google Display Network<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>What is Facebook Remarketing?<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLFacebookCustomAudiencesWebsite.html?camplink=InContentCTA\">Facebook remarketing <\/a>works similar to Google Ads remarketing, but rather than showing your ads across websites within the Display Network, your ads are <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/01\/30\/facebook-advertising-tips\">shown on Facebook<\/a>. Facebook also more commonly refers to remarketing as \u201cCustom Audiences.\u201d The concept is the same: someone visits your site or interacts with your brand, they\u2019re tagged with a code you implement to track them, and then while they\u2019re scrolling through their Facebook feed your ad pops up to remind them what they\u2019re missing.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"bf0ed20d-cb29-4277-a653-8d03605f2594\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-remarketing-funny-1.png\" alt=\"Facebook remarketing\" width=\"509\" height=\"269\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>But there are actually a few different flavors of <a href=\"http:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLFacebookCustomAudiencesWebsite.html?camplink=InContentCTA\">Facebook remarketing<\/a>, including customer lists, website traffic, and app activity.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1ed0c6cc-3e4c-43bf-8c0e-d81b13eca847\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-remarketing-custom.png\" alt=\"Facebook remarketing screenshot of creating a custom audience\" width=\"607\" height=\"471\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Customer List<\/h3>\n<p>Perhaps one the most powerful tools Facebook has to offer is the ability to serve personalized ads to a list of contacts you\u2019ve already acquired. With <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/28\/adwords-customer-match\">customer lists<\/a>, Facebook ads becomes more like email marketing by targeting specific people with personalized messages. Whether it be email addresses, phone numbers, or even Facebook user IDs, you can pull a list of contacts from your CRM or wherever your customer data is stored, upload it directly to Facebook, and target people with ads that are relevant to where they are within your sales funnel.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a6e00f97-b42f-4420-815a-351696e4b48d\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-remarketing-adele.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook remarketing funny gif of Adele saying &quot;Don't forget me, I beg&quot;\" width=\"500\" height=\"227\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Website Traffic<\/h3>\n<p>This is the flavor of remarketing that you\u2019re likely most familiar with, which will serve ads to people who have visited your site within a set time frame. Once you\u2019ve placed a Facebook pixel on all pages of your site, you can set up specific audiences with filters based on pages they\u2019ve visited. For instance, if you sell running gear, but you want your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/03\/facebook-f8\">Facebook ads<\/a> to target people searching for sneakers, then you can set up an audience that shows ads to just people who have visited pages with the keyword \u201csneakers\u201d in the URL.<\/p>\n<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udd37 Heads up!

If you have an established app this is typically a good option, and there are multiple ways to show relevant ads to the right people based on user behavior. For instance when someone abandons a shopping cart within your app you could target them with the same product and special discount code. You can reach people who have recently opened your app, recently completed a purchase (to upsell), or achieved a certain level in a game.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Should I Remarket on Facebook?<\/h2>\n<p>Why wouldn\u2019t you?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRemarketing is life,\u201d said WordStream founder Larry Kim when I asked him his thoughts on it. \u201cYour lowest hanging fruit can be converted by using <a href=\"http:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLFacebookCustomAudiencesWebsite.html?camplink=InContentCTA\">Facebook\u2019s custom audiences<\/a> and site visitor remarketing tactics. It\u2019s ridiculously awesome and you\u2019d be stupid to ignore it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Still not convinced? With Facebook\u2019s active monthly user base larger than China\u2019s population, and <strong>22 billion ad clicks per year<\/strong>, the opportunities to gain <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/25\/facebook-ad-improvements\">more business through Facebook<\/a> ads are endless, and what better way to start than with familiar faces?<\/p>\n<p>Just think about it like the dating pool. You\u2019d be more comfortable going on a second date with someone you\u2019ve already had a pleasant evening with, rather than a blind date which is much more intimidating and the chances of flaking are higher. The same goes for advertising. If someone has already visited your site, downloaded your e-book, or engaged with your app, the chances of them interacting with your ad and purchasing from your brand are much higher than if they saw your brand for the first time on Facebook. In fact, <strong>Facebook remarketing ads get 3X the engagement then regular Facebook ads<\/strong>!<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c833a42b-f9a8-434d-8bec-dd630d03bf20\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-remarketing-friends.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook remarketing funny gif from Friends\" width=\"500\" height=\"357\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Regardless, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/10\/14\/advertising-on-facebook\">you should be advertising on Facebook<\/a>, which makes <strong>remarketing <\/strong>on Facebook a no-brainer.<\/p>\n<h2>How Do I Get Started with Facebook Remarketing?<\/h2>\n<p>To get started with remarketing log into your Facebook Ads Manager account, select the \u201cTools\u201d dropdown and select \u201cAudiences.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5b6f60bc-6777-4c86-8534-b44c8ea7f87c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-remarketing-tools.png\" alt=\"Facebook remarketing screenshot of the tools dropdown\" width=\"164\" height=\"270\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Then select \u201cCreate Audience\u201d and \u201cCustom Audience.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"243bfe93-baed-4301-86b0-a39460dc3471\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-remarketing-audience.png\" alt=\"Facebook remarketing screenshot of custom audience option\" width=\"149\" height=\"196\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>On the next screen you can chose which type of remarketing list you want to create from the three I explained above: Customer List, Website Traffic, or App Activity.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3a5a3e18-6e7b-4b4e-a329-1b3445bc31e9\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-remarketing-list.png\" alt=\"Facebook remarketing create a custom audience\" width=\"610\" height=\"479\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Customer List<\/h3>\n<p>To import a customer list you can do so by either copying and pasting your customer list or uploading a file that contains emails, phone numbers, and\/or Facebook user IDs (or mobile advertiser IDs).

Follow these <strong>five best practices to run conversion-worthy Facebook remarketing campaigns<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h3>#1: Buy Followers with Remarketing Lists<\/h3>\n<p>Are you looking to grow your page likes? Whether it be metrics you\u2019re trying to hit to please your boss or providing legitimacy behind your brand on social, it\u2019s always great to have high follower numbers, but growing these organically can be challenging. Luckily, Facebook allows you to run paid campaigns with the main goal of getting page promoters (see image below).<\/p>\n<p>However, Larry advises that <strong>you should never buy followers unless it\u2019s through remarketing<\/strong>! Why? Because you want to reach your \u201csuper-fans\u201d to get the highest engagement rates possible, which will lead to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/10\/07\/ads-on-facebook\">higher relevance scores<\/a>, cheaper clicks, and more organic visibility.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"62ae5fea-b6aa-4773-bb8b-465adcc70b01\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-remarketing-page.png\" alt=\"Facebook remarketing screenshot of promote your page\" width=\"660\" height=\"472\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>If you are an Google Ads advertiser then you\u2019re likely aware of how <a href=\"\/quality-score\">Quality Score<\/a> affects your ad rank and the price you pay per click. Facebook has a similar metric called relevance score, which dictates how much you pay and how often your ads are shown to your target audience. The main influencer of relevance score is engagement rates, which are likely to be much higher if you\u2019re showing your ads to Facebook <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/24\/brand-marketing\">brand loyalists<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ed374c11-c034-4649-bc0e-7e3130224bf7\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-remarketing-meangirls.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook remarketing mean girls gif\" width=\"499\" height=\"291\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>You wouldn\u2019t want a bunch of grumpy people who hate turkey to attend your Thanksgiving feast, right? The same goes for Facebook page likes. You want your Facebook <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/10\/brand-awareness\">fans to be brand ambassadors<\/a> who are likely to engage with your content so that every post has a high relevance score, leading to cheaper clicks and more visibility. The best way to do this is to promote your page to people who are already familiar with your brand via remarketing!<\/p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s the added bonus of organic visibility. If one of your Facebook fans also \u201clikes\u201d your page posts, then that post is likely to show up to the users Facebook network of friends, leading to the potential to gain free likes and followers from this organic visibility.<\/p>\n<h3>#2: Remarket to People Who Have Already Liked Your Page<\/h3>\n<p>Now that you have the followers, you need to ensure they see and interact with your posts. Take tip #1 a step further by remarketing your boosted posts to your Facebook followers. This is a full-proof method because these people have not only already interacted with your brand, but they\u2019ve interacted with your brand on the same platform you\u2019re remarketing with, Facebook. If a user has taken the action of liking your page, then it\u2019s clear they\u2019ve embraced some level of brand loyalty, and the chances of them engaging with your posts are much higher. This again leads to higher relevance scores and organic reach.<\/p>\n<h3>#3: Layer Your Custom Audiences with Facebook\u2019s Targeting Options<\/h3>\n<p>The level of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/10\/20\/facebook-audience\">granularity you can achieve with Facebook targeting<\/a> options is absolutely mind-blowing. From targeting different variations of mom personas to the Prime Minister of Spain, if you know your audience well, you\u2019ll have no trouble finding them. While it\u2019s important to not get too granular and limit your reach, it\u2019s even more important to not stretch your budget across an oversized arena of Facebookers since this will actually limit your visibility and lead to lower relevance scores (and less profitability).<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2885cd45-dc22-4638-a4b3-2218c338b9ef\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-remarketing-joey.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook remarketing funny gif of Joey from Friends\" width=\"500\" height=\"278\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Let\u2019s say your remarketing audience is bordering on the larger side. Perhaps you\u2019ve uploaded a list of 1,000+ contacts, but you only have $150 to spend. Rather than sprinkling a dollar here and there, you\u2019ll be more effective if you combine this list with demographic targeting to hone in on the most in-market, ready-to-buy audience.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s all about finding the right balance between budget and audience size, but experimenting with layering targeting options on top of your custom audiences will likely increase your relevancy and allocate your budget to an audience that is more likely to convert.<\/p>\n<h3>#4: Think Strategically About Your Goal When Setting Time Frames &amp; Creating Ad Schedules<\/h3>\n<p>Advertisers need to be cautious about <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/30\/ad-fatigue\">fatiguing their remarketing audiences<\/a>, but at the same time if buying cycles are longer or special offers are limited they need to be more aggressive. The life of a Facebook ad is typically short-lived, but rather than running your ad continuously until the budget runs out think about the goal of your ad. Are you running a Black Friday, limited-time discount on dining room sets? Then run the ad aggressively for the time of the sale, without frequency caps, to a remarketing list that looked at the one of your dining set landing pages, but didn\u2019t convert. If you\u2019re trying to simply promote your page to site visitors, this might be an on-going ad set, where you change the copy and imagery from time to time to keep your ads fresh.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"058e85a5-19a0-4f9e-8836-112822b4bf6b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-remarketing-schedule.png\" alt=\"Facebook remarketing ad schedule\" width=\"438\" height=\"176\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Similar to Google Ads you can also <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/30\/ad-scheduling\">set up ad schedules<\/a> to run your ads on specific days of the week and hours of the day rather then 24\/7 all week long.

This is an incredibly powerful way to expand your reach and find an untapped audience. What better way to do this then by cloning your remarketing list? These people have already converted by downloading an e-book or subscribing to your blog.
