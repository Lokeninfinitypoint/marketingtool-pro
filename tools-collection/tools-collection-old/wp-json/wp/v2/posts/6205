Everyone is aware by now that Google began <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/07\/17\/enhanced-campaigns-upgrade-date\">transitioning all accounts over to Enhanced Campaigns<\/a> last week, whether you wanted to or not. Despite the overall mixed feelings on Enhanced Campaigns so far, there are a few features we can all be excited about.<\/p>\n<p>One of the features that excited me the most was the changes to <a href=\"http:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/AdExtensionGuide.html\">Ad Extensions<\/a>, specifically <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/06\/18\/google-sitelinks\">Sitelinks<\/a>. This post looks to explore some of the recent changes to Sitelinks, and how you can better understand your sitelinks\u2019 performance.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"194a0e4a-af20-4f69-bc0e-9b53750bf91d\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/new-enhanced-sitelinks-1.jpg\" alt=\"Enhanced Sitelinks Guide\" width=\"650\" height=\"390\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>I performed a couple of case studies to identify if the sitelinks themselves were responsible for improving performance, or if simply taking up more SERP space is all that matters.<\/p>\n<p>Topics covered:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#recap\">Recap of changes to Sitelinks<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#performance\">Understanding my Sitelinks\u2019 performance<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#troubleshooting\">Why aren\u2019t my Sitelinks showing?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#case-studies\">2 Case Studies on Upgraded Sitelinks<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#takeaways\">Summary and My Humble Opinion<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Recap of Changes to Sitelinks<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><a id=\"recap\"><\/a>First Google released a new feature that allows sitelinks to be set at the Ad Group level. Now instead of setting generic sitelinks at the campaign level to be applied to all ad groups within that campaign, we have the ability to set them at the ad group level.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here are some findings on Ad Group Level Sitelinks:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each Ad Group can have up to 20 sitelinks<\/li>\n<li>The Link Text has been shortened from 35 to 25 characters<\/li>\n<li>Sitelinks can be scheduled to show for specific hours or days of the week<\/li>\n<li>You can create mobile-specific sitelinks<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The second big change to sitelinks came when Google rolled out Enhanced Sitelinks. This new feature gives advertiser much more control and flexibility over their sitelinks, andddd it essentially allows you to create 5 ads in 1!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here are some findings on Enhanced Sitelinks:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sitelinks can show in groupings of 2 and 4<\/li>\n<li>Description Lines 1 and 2 can be 35 characters each<\/li>\n<li>Sitelinks cannot violate the duplicate sitelink URL policy<\/li>\n<li>Sitelink text cannot be the same as other sitelinks in the same ad group\/campaign or the main ad that\u2019s showing<\/li>\n<li>Sitelinks cannot use dynamic keyword insertion<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Understanding Sitelink Performance<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><a id=\"performance\"><\/a>With all the new changes to sitelinks, I was very optimistic that Google was going to give us user-friendly data on individual sitelink performance. The data is out there, you just have to do a little more digging to find it.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re like me, the aggregated data Google gives us under the ad extensions tab for sitelinks isn\u2019t really what you\u2019re looking for. Below is an example of what you might see under the ad extensions tab (click the image to enlarge).<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"e0c71292-3220-4e69-8a77-9cdb002fe9fa\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/enhanced-sitelinks-aggregate-data-1.jpg\" alt=\"Enhanced Sitelinks Data\" width=\"1222\" height=\"351\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>You\u2019ll probably notice your sitelinks have identical metrics.

In this case study I wanted to see how the sitelinks impacted overall campaign performance and if the sitelinks actually contributed to performance.<\/p>\n<p>The sitelinks across the entire account followed a similar pattern of directing traffic to various pages on the site which had destination specific information on accommodations, hotels, special offers, and holiday offers. Each campaign had a similar set of sitelinks just substituting in the countries and destination URLs in for their respective campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>I let the enhanced sitelinks run for 3 weeks, and then I measured the performance against the previous 3 weeks. Here are my findings:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"9785a417-270e-4e54-86aa-fc8fe0360f95\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/enhanced-sitelink-lead-gen-campaign-performance-1.png\" alt=\"Sitelink Performance\" width=\"506\" height=\"245\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The CTR results were what I expected but not to the extent I was hoping for. One would assume with the addition of description lines 1 and 2 to sitelinks and just simply the overall ad size\/coverage on SERP would lead to higher CTRs.<\/p>\n<p>The .04% increase in CTR was not as significant as I expected. More disappointing was the effect on conversion rate. To my surprise the conversion rate of the campaign actually dropped.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"cab411b4-a8a3-40e7-8c81-7698a9b4e50f\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/lead-gen-case-study-sitelinks-1.png\" alt=\"Enhanced Sitelinks Case Study\" width=\"512\" height=\"297\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>This second graph takes a look at the percentage of contribution from individual sitelinks to overall performance. There was no significant change in sitelink attributed clicks; <strong>however those clicks were much more likely to generate a conversion<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The results from this test varied from campaign to campaign, but the biggest win came from the Maldives campaign. This campaign didn\u2019t generate any conversions before I upgraded the sitelinks, and afterwards it generated 5 in a couple weeks.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Case Study 2: Enhanced Sitelinks for E-Commerce<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>In this case study I wanted to see how upgraded sitelinks would impact the performance of an e-commerce account. For this case study I chose an online shoe retailer in Canada. Similar to the other case studies I was interested in measuring overall CTR, Conversion Rate (1-per click) and Conversion Rate (many-per-click). After I compared the overall performance, the second aspect I looked at was the actual individual sitelinks\u2019 contribution to performance.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what I found:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2a9d2235-526b-4c9e-8030-6ea892494e3c\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/enhanced-sitelink-conversion-rates-1.png\" alt=\"Sitelink Conversion Rates\" width=\"643\" height=\"336\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>These results were much more in line with what I was expecting and hoping for. The upgraded sitelinks improved performance across the entire account. These improvements might not look too substantial at first, but if you step back and think about it, <strong>improving conversion rate just the slightest amount is going to have a significant impact<\/strong>. If all else stays equal and you can improve conversion rate by .5%, that could almost double your business!<\/p>\n<p>The next graph takes a look at the individual sitelinks\u2019 contribution to total clicks and conversions.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2288a481-e5b0-466c-b799-f53076d06376\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/enhanced-sitelinks-contribution-analysis-1.png\" alt=\"Enhanced Sitelinks Performance Analysis\" width=\"638\" height=\"456\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>This graph shows that the individual upgraded sitelinks had significantly more impact on clicks and conversions. These results show that if you want to get the most out of your sitelinks you should definitely upgrade them.
