But for the core of it, here is a basic framework:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Establish the problem<\/li>\n<li>Introduce the solution<\/li>\n<li>Share the benefit\/value<\/li>\n<li>Include what makes you different<\/li>\n<li>End with a CTA<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>\ud83d\udcda\u00a0<strong>Free guide download<\/strong>\u00a0&gt;&gt;\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download\">The 36 Best Call to Action Phrases Ever (&amp; Why They Work)<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>1. Establish the problem, ideally with a hook<\/h3>\n<p>The problem\/<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/28\/pain-points\">pain point<\/a> is what will resonate most with your audience, so it&#8217;s the best way to start off your elevator pitch. You can simply state the problem, or you can make things more interesting with a hook. Try these on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>When was the last time you\u2026<\/li>\n<li>Picture this:<\/li>\n<li>Have you ever noticed\u2026<\/li>\n<li>You know how&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>Is it me or&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>You know that feeling when&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>Ever wished you could&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>Let\u2019s be real here:<\/li>\n<li>Did you know that\u2026.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udca1 Pro tip \ud83d\udca1<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Avoid the obvious questions like \u201cAre you looking to get more customers?\u201d or framing questions like \u201cAre you looking for an all-in-one platform that will help you manage subscription invoicing? Be creative here. Be real. Your goal is to capture attention here, not sneak in features or benefits.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Introduce the solution<\/h3>\n<p>Once the problem has been established, you can then introduce yourself or your business as the solution, the hero. Be specific about how you solve the problem. Mention <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/21\/features-vs-benefits\">features here rather than benefits<\/a>. And if it&#8217;s not obvious through your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/23\/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name\">business name<\/a>, make it clear what type of solution you are\u2014a platform? An agency? An app? This is important so listeners\/readers can orient themselves and form a mental picture as you speak.<\/p>\n<h3>3. State the benefit<\/h3>\n<p>So your audience now knows that you can solve their problem and take away their pain point, but you need to also talk about how this benefits them. Why is the elimination of this pain point important? What do they stand to gain by solving this problem? This is essentially your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\">value proposition<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Differentiate yourself<\/h3>\n<p>So the audience now knows what you do, how you do it, and what&#8217;s in it for them, but why should they choose you over competitors? How can they be sure that they&#8217;ll get this benefit? This is where you include things like your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/07\/unique-selling-proposition\">unique selling proposition<\/a>, social proof, trust signals, or anecdotes.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\">[Solution] is the only [category] that [unique feature].<\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\">For over [x years], we\u2019ve helped over [X target personas] [achieve benefit].<\/li>\n<li>Backed by\/recommended by [known\/influential\/trusted institution or person].<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u2705 <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite120WordsforMarketingWithEmotion.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_120WordsPhrases_Download\">130+ of the Best Words and Phrases for Marketing with Emotion<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>5. Close with a CTA or question<\/h3>\n<p>Finish off with some sort of action item.

Write it, rewrite it, say it, recite it, record yourself and listen to it. Recite it in front of someone. Completely internalize it so that you\u2019re speaking as naturally and organically as possible.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Make it easy to understand:<\/strong> Don\u2019t try to impress your audience with fancy jargon or complex statements. The simpler it is, the easier it will be for them to remember. And speak conversationally.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Be ready for objections\/questions: <\/strong>You\u2019ll get a feel, over time, for common objections and questions. And you may even have a secondary spiel to address those. But be careful not to address them (or too many of them) in your pitch. If you take too much of a defensive approach, you could be discounting your confidence.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learn how to communicate the value of your business in a fast, compelling, and memorable way.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87,"featured_media":63716,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[17,99],"tags":[],"dipi_cpt_category":[],"class_list":["post-63705","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-copywriting","category-marketing-templates"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v25.8 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>13 (Really) Good Elevator Pitch Examples + Templates<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Learn how to write an elevator pitch for your business in five steps and get inspiration from these 13 elevator pitch examples and templates!\" \/>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/16\/elevator-pitch-examples-templates\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"13 (Really) Good Elevator Pitch Examples + Templates\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Learn how to write an elevator pitch for your business in five steps and get inspiration from these 13 elevator pitch examples and templates!\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/16\/elevator-pitch-examples-templates\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"WordStream\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:publisher\" content=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/WordStream\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:modified_time\" content=\"2025-04-14T19:37:19+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/elevator-pitch-examples-feature-office.jpg\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:width\" content=\"712\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:height\" content=\"507\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:type\" content=\"image\/jpeg\" \/>\n<meta name=\"author\" content=\"Kristen McCormick\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:creator\" content=\"@WordStream\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:site\" content=\"@WordStream\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Written by\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"Kristen McCormick\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:label2\" content=\"Est. reading time\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data2\" content=\"17 minutes\" \/>\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"Article\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/16\/elevator-pitch-examples-templates#article\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/16\/elevator-pitch-examples-templates\"},\"author\":{\"name\":\"Kristen McCormick\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/#\/schema\/person\/b3315760a00dd1c6f240dd75bfd4122e\"},\"headline\":\"13 (Really) Good Elevator Pitch Examples &#038;
