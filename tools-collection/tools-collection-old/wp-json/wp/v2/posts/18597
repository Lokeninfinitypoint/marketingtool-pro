Create seasonal Google Ads search campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re in retail, B2B, finance, or insurance, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/performance-max-holiday-strategies\">Google Ads<\/a> is a great place to get seasonal! How can one do this? Create a campaign targeting holiday shoppers!<\/p>\n<p>For instance, if you sell women\u2019s apparel, you can target keywords like \u201cgifts for mother\u201d or \u201choliday sweaters.\u201d Then create specific ads and landing pages offering incentives to shop with your store during the holiday season.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps you give free shipping if they purchase over $100 worth of clothing? Or let\u2019s say you gift wrap for free? Maybe you offer $20 off if the gift is ordered before a certain date? Highlight these benefits and make sure your landing pages capture the spirit of the holidays.<\/p>\n<p>Not in B2C? Not to worry! There are still ways to get creative with your Google Ads campaigns during the holidays. As holiday shopping goes underway everyone is looking for ways to cut costs, so promote some special seasonal discounts on AdWords. Take advantage of ad extensions to take up more space in the results, get a higher chance of site visits, and highlight the special things your company is doing for the season.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few quick Google Ads holiday marketing tips to remember:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use seasonal ad copy.<\/strong> Include words and phrases like \u201choliday\u201d and \u201c&#8217;tis the season.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t use cliches. <\/strong>Use these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/01\/holiday-copywriting\">ideas for cliche-free holiday copywriting<\/a> instead.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ad assets are your friends.<\/strong> Enhancing your ads with additional ad assets will help you eat up more real estate on the SERP during this competitive time.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Highlight special offers.<\/strong> Be sure to capitalize on any seasonal deals you may be running.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Instill a sense of urgency. <\/strong>Use copy like \u201c40% off if you order before Dec 15!\u201d or \u201cTake Advantage Before It\u2019s Too Late!\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Make sure you\u2019re relevant. <\/strong>Conduct holiday-related <a href=\"\/keywords\">keyword research<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Set up ad scheduling.<\/strong> That way, you can bid on the times when your shoppers are searching.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"0bcaf298-d095-4490-8998-0a3d401b3c63\" data-langcode=\"en\"><\/div>\n<p>Keep in mind that everyone is looking for a deal during the holiday season!

Gift yourself with Google Shopping Ads<\/h3>\n<p>If you sell physical products and you\u2019re not already using Google Shopping, now is the time to treat yourself to your first Google Shopping campaign! These are the perfect treat for your busy online holiday shoppers because they\u2019re extremely convenient and can lead to purchases happening almost instantaneously.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the challenge will be standing out next to your competition in such a visual manner, but as long as your images are enticing and your campaign is set up properly, these babies can work wonders on converting shoppers during the holiday season.

Step up your Instagram ad game<\/h3>\n<p>Instagram is the perfect place to make your holiday game shine! Users are already there posting family selfies and pictures of their decorations, so why not break through the clutter with a fun holiday ad? While posting organically to your account is great as well, to really stand out it\u2019s worth throwing some money behind your very best holiday pics.<\/p>\n<p>Whether it be your team dressed in ugly sweaters or your office dog with a monster mask on, get creative and cheery and bring in those <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/22\/best-instagram-ads\">Instagram hearts<\/a>! Check out this example from a restaurant in my neighborhood. Not only did they get seasonal with a new drink recipe (pumpkin margarita, yum!), but they placed it near a carved pumpkin and used some seasonal emojis in their ad copy.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"fff0d582-dfaa-45ed-ab98-9a92204c040b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/holiday-themed-instagram-ads.jpg\" alt=\"marketing on instagram for the holiday season\" width=\"807\" height=\"575\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Here are some more great tips for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/06\/instagram-marketing-for-restaurants\">marketing a restaurant on Instagram <\/a>like the example above.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We predict social shopping will be a huge <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/29\/holiday-marketing-trends\">holiday marketing trend<\/a> this year. Get tips to capitalize on it!<\/p>\n<div id=\"holiday-marketing-ideas-social-media-giveaway\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Run a holiday giveaway on social media<\/h3>\n<p>Speaking of Instagram, another great way to utilize the platform is by running a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/social-media-holidays\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social holiday<\/a> giveaway. I\u2019d recommend running a social campaign across all the major platforms your business uses (Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, etc.) to get more and more eyes on your business.<\/p>\n<p>And who doesn\u2019t like free stuff, especially during the holidays (hello, re-gifting!)? Whether it be a big discount, a free add-on with an order or just something completely for free, get into the holiday spirit of giving. Typically, asking followers to comment, share, like, etc. are great tactics to get even more engagement on your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/holiday-giveaways\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">giveaway<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"10c2714c-b45c-4da3-ac97-3b206a487df9\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-giveaways-example.jpg\" alt=\"holiday marketing on instagram\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1400\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Check out Dan\u2019s guide on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/11\/instagram-giveaways\">how to use an Instagram giveaway to grow your following<\/a>, and for even more ideas and inspiration check out some <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/24\/best-instagram-marketing-campaigns\">Instagram marketing campaigns<\/a> we loved!<\/p>\n<div id=\"holiday-marketing-ideas-email\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Get seasonal in email<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re not incorporating the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/12\/01\/holiday-email-templates\">holidays into your email marketing campaigns<\/a>, you\u2019re making a big mistake! Holidays instill powerful memories into your shoppers\u2019 minds, so enticing them with fun seasonal emails is a great way to connect in their inboxes.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, this marketing email from Rent the Runway instantly caught my eye. I may not have ended up renting for Halloween specifically, but it did remind me that I could use their service for an upcoming wedding.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"cc1c465c-40ea-462a-90b2-ade6594b83b4\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/holiday-seasonal-email-marketing-ideas.jpg\" alt=\"holiday season email marketing ideas\" width=\"555\" height=\"664\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Pay close attention to your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/31\/email-subject-lines\">email subject lines<\/a> when marketing for the holidays. Similar to ad copy in your seasonal Google Ads campaigns, it\u2019s important to give them an incentive to shop with you, and instilling urgency is a great strategy for your subject lines.<\/p>\n<div id=\"holiday-marketing-ideas-remarketing\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. Rev up your remarketing strategy<\/h3>\n<p>Remember that time you almost bought that dress, and then you saw it again and took that as a sign, so you went ahead and bought it? Sadly, that was not fate, that was remarketing! <a href=\"\/google-remarketing\">Remarketing<\/a> is when you cookie your audience to later remind them what they\u2019re missing out on.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully, you\u2019re already remarketing, but if you aren\u2019t you need to be! Remarketing gives you a chance to remind potential customers that they abandoned their shopping cart or landing page. The holiday season is what I like to call a <strong>mandatory remarketing season<\/strong> because people are busy and making decisions fast. Therefore, if they dropped off your website or <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/17\/shopping-cart-abandonment\">left their cart half full<\/a>, they might just need a quick reminder.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"fec949f4-ef66-47c2-a802-71a8e3ee4687\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>This is where remarketing comes into play. When configuring your remarking lists for the holidays, ensure your membership duration is shorter than normal. For instance, if you typically allow users to be added to your remarking list for 30 days, reduce that to 15 days. That will increase the chances of the individual seeing your ads more frequently closer to the holiday.<\/p>\n<p>And make sure you\u2019re remarketing on all the channels you\u2019re running <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/08\/holiday-advertising-best-practices-2020\">holiday advertising <\/a>on (Facebook, Google, Instagram, Bing, etc.)<\/p>\n<div id=\"holiday-marketing-ideas-audience-segmentation\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. Reimagine your audience segmentation strategy<\/h3>\n<p>As a digital marketer, you and I both know that you\u2019re sitting on piles of user data that you can use to your benefit for future campaigns. The question is, are you actually using this data?<\/p>\n<p>If not, there is no better time to get crafty with your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/28\/behavioral-segmentation\">segmentation<\/a> messaging than the holiday season! Personalizing your messaging is a proven strategy to connect with consumers on a deeper level. If you have a large segment of mothers who express interest in your products or services, create content that shows how your business empathizes with how stressful the holidays can be with a full house of kids. Target a segment of leads with similar hobbies with ad copy relevant to those interests.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3aaaf212-42bd-4ea9-a422-b9d2c6aa1b42\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/behavioral-targeting-and-segmentation-strategies-facebook.jpg\" alt=\"marketing segmentation on facebook\" width=\"800\" height=\"558\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Utilizing the data you\u2019ve collected through platforms like Facebook, GA4, and Google Ads is a great place to start. Also, take advantage of lookalike audiences on these platforms to go after a new segment of leads similar to a high-converting audience.<\/p>\n<div id=\"holiday-marketing-ideas-webinar\"><\/div>\n<h3>8. Conduct a holiday-themed webinar<\/h3>\n<p>Does your company hold a weekly, monthly, or even quarterly webinar for customers or prospects? Webinars are a great way to teach your audience in a more personalized manner, which can in-turn lead to a natural sale or upsell.<\/p>\n<p>However, webinars are common. I probably get about 20-60 webinar invites in my inbox every month from various companies I\u2019ve come across over the years, but the problem is those webinar invites often go unnoticed. This is where holidays can really help add a fun element to an otherwise rudimentary webinar invite.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/holiday-marketing-webinars-e1732544060831.jpg\" alt=\"holiday marketing ideas - webinar example\" width=\"600\" height=\"463\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-18592 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/holiday-marketing-webinars-e1732544060831.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/holiday-marketing-webinars-e1732544060831-480x270.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"cd302654-522e-4d44-8fc3-9ecd27916f2c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>To <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/03\/marketing-webinars\">make your webinar even more enticing<\/a>, tempt your audience with a free gift. For example, at the end of the webinar offer attendees a holiday discount code or free shipping on their next order.<\/p>\n<div id=\"holiday-marketing-ideas-heartstrings\"><\/div>\n<h3>9. Make your holiday marketing pull at the heartstrings<\/h3>\n<p>When I picture the holidays I see Christmas lights, cookies, Santa Claus, and reindeer, but what I feel is that warm fuzzy feeling of enjoying time with family. While holidays may not be loved by all, most people have an emotional tie to them. And we all know that <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/01\/high-converting-landing-page-images\">emotions drive action<\/a>, so now is the time to get emotional with your marketing.<\/p>\n<p>Emotional doesn\u2019t mean you need to make every one of your audience members cry \u2013 even using humor in your messaging can go a long way during the holiday season.

Get creative with holiday video marketing<\/h3>\n<p>There is no better way to communicate a holiday message than with video. Whether it\u2019s a festive webinar invite video that you send via email, a video added to your customer page to wish all of your customers holiday cheer, or a wacky video that you post on social media of your CEO dressed as a reindeer, get creative, and have fun with video to spread the cheer throughout your marketing campaigns.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/holiday-marketing-video-ideas-e1732544267653.jpg\" alt=\"holiday marketing ideas - video example\" width=\"672\" height=\"386\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-18594 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/holiday-marketing-video-ideas-e1732544267653.jpg 672w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/holiday-marketing-video-ideas-e1732544267653-480x270.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 672px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f40757b4-7a41-4b26-ad19-75d2032bdfa7\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A fun <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/wistia\/videos\/10154172501963031\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">holiday-themed video<\/a> example.<\/em><\/p>\n<div id=\"holiday-marketing-ideas-party\"><\/div>\n<h3>11. Throw a holiday party<\/h3>\n<p>Throw a holiday party? Ho-ho-hold up! That sounds expensive\u2026 Well, it can be, but you can be strategic as to who you invite. For instance, you may decide to focus your invitations on a select group of your hottest local leads, and simply have them come to the office for some holiday drinks, appetizers, and games. There\u2019s no better way to build strong relationship with prospects and customers then giving them actual face time, so why not use the holidays as an excuse to do just that. Create a festive e-invite, and get the eggnog cooking!<\/p>\n<div id=\"holiday-marketing-ideas-amazon\"><\/div>\n<h3>12.

It\u2019s usually better to have more inventory in FBA. And don\u2019t forget to plan for inventory you expect to sell in January\u2026so many companies run out of inventory in early January when suppliers are slow to replenish.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Unfamiliar or unsure if you want to advertise on Amazon?
