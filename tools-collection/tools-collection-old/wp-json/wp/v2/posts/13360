And on the Facebook side of things, your prospects will soon have the ability to keep you from using off-Facebook behavioral data to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/04\/facebook-retargeting\">retarget them on the platform<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s discuss each of these changes in turn.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Google to\u00a0sunset accelerated delivery next month<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As of September 17, 2019, <strong>you\u2019ll <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/9448876\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">no longer have the option<\/a> to select accelerated ad delivery for new search or Shopping campaigns<\/strong>; instead, you\u2019ll have to opt for standard delivery. As for your existing campaigns, Google will automatically migrate them to standard delivery on October 1. Accelerated delivery <em>will<\/em> remain available for display and video campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>When you select <strong>accelerated<\/strong> delivery, you tell Google to enter the ads within that campaign into every auction for which they\u2019re eligible until your daily budget runs out. Alternatively, when you select <strong>standard<\/strong> delivery, you tell Google to spread your budget out over the course of the day (or over the course of whatever period you\u2019ve scheduled your ads to run). Selecting standard delivery means withholding your ads from some of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/articles\/what-is-google-adwords\">auctions<\/a> for which they\u2019re eligible.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"69667fc7-e4a4-4729-869b-fa9146dab79a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-sunsets-accelerated-delivery.png\" alt=\"google-sunsets-accelerated-delivery\" width=\"800\" height=\"383\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here\u2019s what Google has offered as an explanation:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201c[Accelerated delivery] isn\u2019t effective for campaigns that aren\u2019t limited by budget. And for campaigns that are limited by budget, this method can increase CPCs due to increased competition early in the day, or unintentionally spend most of your budget in earlier time zones.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Auction prices fluctuate throughout the day due to changes in the level of demand for ad space; the greater the demand at a given time of day, the higher your cost per click will be. Because accelerated delivery means you\u2019re entered into every auction for which you\u2019re eligible until your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/19\/bids-versus-budget\">budget<\/a> runs out, opting for it substantially reduces your chances of capitalizing on the low-cost opportunities that emerge throughout the day\u2014something that small businesses with limited budgets should generally aim to do.<\/p>\n<p>Regarding early time zones, Google is referring to the fact that your ad schedule is based on <strong>your<\/strong> time zone\u2014not the time zones of the people you\u2019re reaching. If your Google Ads account is based in Nairobi and you\u2019ve set your ads to begin running at 9 a.m., your prospects in New York City can start seeing them at 2 a.m.<\/p>\n<p>These are valid arguments on Google\u2019s part; accelerated delivery can certainly lead to inefficient budget allocation for those who lack the bandwidth to meticulously manage their accounts. However, accelerated delivery definitely has its merits. For example, if you\u2019re running a limited-time sale and you want to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/06\/12\/bidding-on-competitor-brands\">get in front of your competitors\u2019 prospects<\/a>, accelerated delivery is a great way to quickly drive a high volume of impressions and clicks.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"8f8614ce-108f-4a7a-8f1c-3a79e9fdf14f\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-sunsets-accelerated-delivery-competitive-ad-example.png\" alt=\"google-sunsets-accelerated-delivery-competitor-campaign-example\" width=\"648\" height=\"553\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsewhere, if your Quality Score for a particular keyword is lagging behind (for whatever reason), accelerated delivery can function as a gas pedal that gets you in front of target users nonetheless.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What does this mean for you?<\/h3>\n<p>To many account managers, the retirement of accelerated delivery is yet another indicator that Google wants its advertisers to cede control and put faith in automation. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/31\/phrase-match-broad-match-modifier-close-variants\">Recent changes to phrase match and modified broad match keywords<\/a>, for example, will force advertisers to trust Google\u2019s ability to automatically recognize user intent. Not everyone is happy with these changes.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"8c3b32ab-3daa-442e-809a-1e24bd037b76\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-sunsets-accelerated-delivery-twitter-reaction.png\" alt=\"google-sunsets-accelerated-delivery-tweet\" width=\"592\" height=\"230\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\"><em>Via Twitter user <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/EricHeiken\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@EricHeiken<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the other hand, those of you working with limited budgets\u00a0probably weren\u2019t using this option anyway, as it&#8217;s\u00a0a really easy way to burn through your money. (We usually advise our small and midsize clients against it.)<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, we want to make sure that those of you who <em>have<\/em> been using accelerated ad delivery are prepared for its impending retirement. Alex Reardon, an account manager on our in-house agency team, recommends using positive bid adjustments earlier in the day to compensate for changes in when your ads are delivered. Alternatively, if you\u2019ve been using accelerated delivery to boost the visibility of a campaign with low daily search volume, you may want to shift some additional budget towards those keywords.<\/p>\n<h3>Update Sept. 11, 2019<\/h3>\n<p>To give you more time to prepare for the retirement of accelerated delivery, Google has <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/9484290\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">postponed<\/a> the sunset date from September 17, 2019 to <strong>October 7, 2019.\u00a0<\/strong>Make it a priority to update your campaigns accordingly!<\/p>\n<h3>Update January 30, 2020<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Starting April 2020, Standard delivery will be the only ad delivery method for any new Display, Video, App and Hotel campaigns<\/strong>. Accelerated delivery will no longer be available. All existing Display, Video, App and Hotel campaigns using Accelerated delivery will be automatically switched to Standard delivery starting May 2020.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Facebook to let users block third-party data usage<\/h2>\n<p>Following through on a <a href=\"https:\/\/marketingland.com\/mark-zuckerberg-announces-new-clear-history-option-more-at-facebooks-f8-conference-239346\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">promise<\/a> made by CEO Mark Zuckerberg at last year\u2019s F8 Conference, Facebook has <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.fb.com\/news\/2019\/08\/off-facebook-activity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced<\/a> the limited roll-out of the Off-Facebook Activity Tool. With it, users can see overviews of the information that third-party apps and websites (that\u2019s you) have uploaded to Facebook in order to reach them with targeted ads.
