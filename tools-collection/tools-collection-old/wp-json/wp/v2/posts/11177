Showcase your products<\/h3>\n<p>One of the best ways to promote your business and engage with your customers is by creating an Instagram Story Highlight promoting your products or services.<\/p>\n<p>According to Instagram, <a href=\"https:\/\/business.instagram.com\/blog\/500000-advertisers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">75% of users take an action<\/a>, such as visiting a website or making a purchase, after looking at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/instagram-ad-copy\">ads on the platform<\/a>. Whether or not active Instagram users have engaged with your business before, if they\u2019re browsing your profile and see a highlight dedicated to \u201cProducts,\u201d they might be more likely to click through the content included in your highlight versus scrolling through your entire feed.<\/p>\n<p>Your highlight will be an easier and faster way to find information about your offerings, and you can direct customers to your website, to sign up for a newsletter, or, ideally, to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/26\/instagram-stories-shopping\">make a purchase via Instagram<\/a>. By tagging products in your highlights with the Instagram Stories stickers (interactive elements that you can add to engage with your followers), you can showcase your products more creatively and in less direct or salesy ways.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at how <a href=\"https:\/\/www.letterfolk.com\/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIjMq6hLj16gIVCo7ICh1WWQ5VEAAYASAAEgIQD_D_BwE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Letterfolk<\/a>, a home decor company that offers unique paper goods and gifts, showcases its products.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Instagram-highlights-letterfolk.jpg\" alt=\"Instagram Highlights - letterfolk instagram profile\" width=\"370\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76767 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Instagram-highlights-letterfolk.jpg 370w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Instagram-highlights-letterfolk-185x300.jpg 185w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Letterfolk organizes its Instagram Story Highlights to showcase different products they offer\u2014tile mats, calendars, ABC prints, and more. This allows users to find more information about the specific products they\u2019re interested in.

Using a similar approach, depending on how many products your business offers, you might combine all product-related stories into a single album.<\/p>\n<p>A great way to include a CTA in these stories is to use the \u201cSee More\u201d link, engaging with your followers and directing them to find more exciting information about your offerings on your website.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Instagram-highlight-everyday.jpg\" alt=\"Instagram Highlights - example of an instagram story highlight\" width=\"397\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76768 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Instagram-highlight-everyday.jpg 397w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Instagram-highlight-everyday-199x300.jpg 199w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Letterfolk uses the \u201cSee More\u201d link on their \u201cNew\u201d Highlight.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>2.

Here are answers to a few more questions we hear a lot.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Can someone see if I view their Instagram Story Highlight?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, but only for the first 48 hours after the Story was posted.<\/p>\n<h3>2. How do Instagram Story Highlights work?<\/h3>\n<p>To create an Instagram Story Highlight, go to your profile, click \u201cStory highlights\u201d and pick a Story to add. To view an Instagram Story Highlight, go to the profile page of an Instagram account and click one of the Story Highlight Icons.<\/p>\n<h3>3. What is the difference between a Story and a Story Highlight on Instagram?<\/h3>\n<p>A Story displays at the top of an Instagram user\u2019s feed and is visible for 24 hours. A Story Highlight is a Story that\u2019s been added to an Instagram profile page and is visible permanently until the account owner removes it.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Can I add an Instagram Highlight without sharing it as a Story first?<\/h3>\n<p>Sort of. Make your account private, block all users from seeing your Stories in the Story settings, post your Story and add it to your Highlights. After 24 hours, once the Story disappears, return your account to its previous privacy settings.<\/p>\n<h2>Put these Instagram Highlight tips into practice today!<\/h2>\n<p>As we know, social media is constantly evolving, and Instagram and the many features it offers are growing with it.
