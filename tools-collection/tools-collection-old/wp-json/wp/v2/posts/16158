This rebrand aims to deliver a more holistic platform that encompasses all of Google\u2019s ad channels under one convenient umbrella.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, I will walk through what I consider to be the biggest changes that could impact <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/27\/how-to-scale-an-agency\">your agency\u2019s business operations<\/a>, allowing you to provide more value for clients as well as creating unique selling points for future prospects.<\/p>\n<h3>Something to Keep in Mind<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019ve been working with Google AdWords for a while, there is one thing that becomes abundantly clear: Their flashy new product features don\u2019t always live up to the hype, and what looks at first like a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d is sometimes a suggestion would actually be detrimental to the account.<\/p>\n<p>To be clear, I am not trying to diminish Google\u2019s innovations in any way. My intention is to advise those whose livelihoods rely upon the success or failures of their clients to take a careful and thoughtful approach when testing or adopting new technologies. Put your feet in the water before you dive in. You may find the temperature to be much different (for better or worse) than you expected.<\/p>\n<h2>#1. Responsive Search Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Having the ability to write creative expanded text ads has been advantageous for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/18\/state-of-the-agency-report\">agencies<\/a> taking on new clients with pre-existing dull or poorly performing ones. The luxury of some added headline room made a world of a difference when making suggestions on how to improve performance.<\/p>\n<p>Flash forward to 2018, and Google has now announced that they will be releasing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/10\/responsive-search-ads\"><strong>Responsive Search Ads<\/strong><\/a>. These responsive ads will allow you to write up to 15 different headlines and up to four descriptions. Once created, Google will run different combinations through its machine learning process and decide which combinations of copy perform best depending on keyword, device, and past browsing behavior. This differs dramatically from the trial and error of creating multiple stagnant versions of the ad and waiting for the data to play out.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ae2cffb0-20fa-43db-a43f-560f5037ea8d\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-responsive-search-ads-format.png\" alt=\"google-ads-responsive-search-ads-format\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Additionally, responsive search ads will be able to show up to three 30-character headlines and up to two 90-character description fields.<\/p>\n<p>On paper, the prospect has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/16\/grow-your-digital-marketing-agency\">agencies<\/a> salivating at the opportunity to put their expanded text ads on the shelf in favor of these larger, \u201csmarter\u201d ads. Once again, however, there are some reasons to proceed with caution. As anyone managing accounts has learned, even the smallest of changes can have a dramatic impact on performance.<\/p>\n<p>That said, I think this is an update to be very excited about. I have my reservations about the efficiency of \u201cmachine learning\u201d \u2013 a term that tech companies often use to make us believe their algorithms rival those from Westworld. The most important takeaway from responsive text ads for agencies is the added value of being able to test something entirely new for your client or prospect. These new ad types have the potential to completely revolutionize account performance by allowing for nearly endless testing and optimization.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a1de4354-1a27-4007-8c38-e9e2408dc641\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/testing-and-optimizing-photo.jpg\" alt=\"testing-and-optimizing-machine-learning-photo\" width=\"710\" height=\"473\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>#2. Lead Ads on YouTube<\/h2>\n<p>YouTube\u2019s audience reach is massive. Combine this with the ability to allow the user to never actually leave the site, and you\u2019ve got an ad type with a lot of potential.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/24\/facebook-lead-ads\">Facebook\u2019s lead ads<\/a> have proven to be a valuable strategic tool if executed correctly. The sheer number of advertisers using lead ads across Facebook most likely prompted Google\u2019s copycat idea to materialize, and to be honest I\u2019m really happy it did.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7fb5db98-3eab-41ba-990b-76a68648f3b3\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/lead-ads-animation.jpg\" alt=\"lead-ads-on-google\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The only immediate drawback that I can think of is exactly how Google plans on integrating this feature for businesses using services like Hubspot, Marketo, and Salesforce to process leads and pass them on to sales. If you have to download the leads directly from the Google Ads interface, then it may cause some issues for you and your clients. I don\u2019t anticipate this to be a problem in the long run, but early iterations of the feature may be somewhat limited.<\/p>\n<p>If you are currently running display ads for clients, I would suggest taking a quick look at the placements where those ads are showing. It may seem like a no brainer but if YouTube is a primary driver of clicks then it\u2019s something to keep in mind, especially if CPA\u2019s are too high. If the option is made available (as I assume it will) I would suggest testing out some remarketing audiences of non-converters first.<\/p>\n<p>If your client or prospect is currently using Lead Ads on Facebook with a fair amount of success, this may also be a great opportunity for you to pitch the concept of possibly replicating that success for them across a new platform. If future clients are looking to scale further and you\u2019ve reached a ceiling on Facebook, then having some experience using lead ads for Google can give you a leg up strategically.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLWebBlogInContentTextLink11WaystoClients.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_11WaystoClients_Download\"><em>&lt;&lt;Free Guide: How to Gain and Retain More Clients&gt;&gt;<\/em><\/a><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>#3. Smart Campaigns and Agencies for Small Businesses<\/h2>\n<p>Smart Campaigns are being billed as a new simplified way for small businesses to advertise on Google. I mention this not as something for you to capitalize on for smaller prospects, but as a lever to use to your advantage when attempting to bring them on as clients.<\/p>\n<p>If you come across a prospect who is using this service in the future, there are a couple strategies you can use to demonstrate your agency\u2019s capabilities.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d8d4722d-bbc9-486a-9f3c-aa9f7a478642\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/smart-campaigns-and-agencies-for-small-businesses.png\" alt=\"smart-campaigns-and-agencies-for-small-businesses\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>Scalability<\/strong>: If you find that your future prospect is using Smart Campaigns successfully it may be an indicator that scaling operations could benefit them dramatically. Alternatively, if they are running them with limited success, it\u2019s an opportunity to persuade them into the benefits of having a more detailed and complex account structure.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Expertise: <\/strong>I envision the average user of Smart Campaigns to be similar to those who have said to me \u201cyeah, we\u2019ve tried those Facebook ads, but they didn\u2019t do anything for us\u201d. Once I\u2019ve asked a few follow-up questions it\u2019s abundantly clear those folks just boosted a post or two and had never actually seen Ads Manager. This will allow you to truly explain the benefits of fully leveraging the platform in ways they have not.<\/p>\n<h2>#4. Smart Shopping for Ecommerce<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re like the vast majority of digital marketing agencies out there, then there\u2019s a high probability you manage ecommerce clients. Over the past couple months, Google has announced that its machine learning tech will now roll over into its shopping platform.<\/p>\n<p>Smart Shopping gives advertisers the option to select store visits and new customers as goals. After that, machine learning auto-magically takes care of the rest \u2013 bid adjustments, ad placement optimization, and which products are featured based on a variety of factors are now rolled into the mix.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ebe304df-bff4-44f1-9586-1f6a6c0a6dae\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/smart-shopping.gif\" alt=\"smart-shopping\" width=\"800\" height=\"410\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>I have poked fun at the machine learning quite a bit in this post, but I truly believe this is a revolutionary product update for ecommerce clients. Someone smart somewhere once said \u201ccompetition breeds innovation,\u201d and this could not be any more evident than with Google\u2019s attempts to top Facebook\u2019s advertising offerings. What\u2019s most interesting to me is the supporting data on how effective Smart Shopping has performed with its beta subjects, indicating a 20% increase in conversion value at a similar cost.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to Smart Shopping, the \u201cautomated feeds\u201d feature with be launched as well. This will allow advertisers to create product feeds seamlessly by pulling your products from your website directly into the UI. If you\u2019re currently running catalog ads campaigns for clients in Facebook with relative success, I strongly suggest trying out these features in Google. A valuable integration with Shopify significantly reduces my apprehension about adopting this new feature, something I mentioned was lacking with YouTube lead ads.<\/p>\n<p>So, what are the implications of all this for an agency with ecommerce clients?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Added Value to Existing Clients<\/strong>: If you\u2019re running successful shopping ads for clients, this will give you the opportunity to capitalize on that. As I mentioned above, there are fewer apparent drawbacks to adopting this early on. If your client\u2019s shopping ads are underperforming, this could also be your saving grace to get things back on track.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Selling Point for Prospects: <\/strong>If the prospect has had a rough go of it with their previous agency or account manager, these product updates will give you the opportunity to introduce some fresh ideas.<\/p>\n<h2>Final Takeaways<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Testing is the Key to Success: <\/strong>Just because a new feature doesn\u2019t work out initially doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it never will. I recall Gmail ad growing pains that lasted for quite some time. As Google has refined the ad type, adding new features to it, I\u2019ve found I\u2019m not as apprehensive as I once was about suggesting or implementing it for my clients. This goes for most new product launches where there is a period of testing and experimenting that will lead you to some conclusions early on. I suggest keeping up with features that failed for you to see how they evolve over time. Somewhere down the road they may become something you can try again and find success with the next time around.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Every Platform is Different:<\/strong> I\u2019ve made several comparisons to Facebook ad products in this post. Although Google is creating features that are similar to Facebook, you have to keep in mind that they are completely different entities. What works for a client in Facebook isn\u2019t necessarily going to work in Google and vice versa. This shouldn\u2019t deter you from testing new features in either platform, but try to keep your expectations separate and proceed cautiously.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Every Client is Different: <\/strong>You may find that some of these new features are fantastic for your clients, while others fall flat. Every client is different and every placement is different. YouTube lead ads may work while responsive search ads do not. Don\u2019t attribute a failure universally to a specific ad type or placement and project that on new clients<strong>. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>The Truth Lies in Experience: <\/strong>You never really know until you try it out.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Aside from the obvious name and logo changes, the rebranding of Google Adwords to Google Ads includes new must-know features for digital marketing agencies and their clients.
