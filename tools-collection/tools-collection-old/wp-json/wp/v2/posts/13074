Rather than seeing what your great aunt ate for lunch on Facebook or hearing someone yell about politics on Twitter, you can check LinkedIn to see what your contacts are up to and what topics are trending in your industry. For advertisers, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/25\/linkedin-interest-targeting\">targeting options<\/a> allow you to zone in on just about any part of your audience\u2019s profile, and since the platform also has many benefits for their users, it\u2019s in their best interest to keep their profiles up to date.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why LinkedIn is the place to be if you want to generate higher quality <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/17\/generate-leads-linkedin\">B2B leads<\/a>. But, if that\u2019s your goal, you need to know that not all strategies are created equal.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/linkedin-lead-generation.jpg\" alt=\"LinkedIn lead generation ad example\" width=\"744\" height=\"419\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Here, I want to talk about LinkedIn Lead Generation Ads and some best practices for you to leverage in your account. Let\u2019s dive in!<\/p>\n<h2>1. Have something valuable to offer<\/h2>\n<p>This is the biggest issue I see with advertisers on LinkedIn. Every business thinks what they have to offer is amazing\u2014and I\u2019m sure your product or service absolutely is. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s appealing for someone to start hard selling you on their offerings without generating any type of connection with you.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m sorry, but a demo for your software to a cold prospecting audience likely isn\u2019t going to do well with\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/05\/linkedin-advertising\">LinkedIn advertising<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If the content or offer you have isn\u2019t important, no one is going to want it no matter what type of campaign you\u2019re using. So you need to make sure you can offer something of value to your prospects.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/linkedin-lead-generation-offer-value.jpg\" alt=\"LinkedIn lead generation ad with ebook offer\" width=\"548\" height=\"552\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This could be anything from an industry report to a rundown of common issues your customer base faces and how to solve them, sometimes without your product involved. Do some research and know what your market wants, and then deliver something fantastic to them for the low, low price of one lead gen form fill.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Related<\/strong>: <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/19\/linkedin-company-page-features-examples\">10 Must-Use LinkedIn Company Page Features\u00a0<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>2. Integrate your CRM to follow up with leads right away<\/h2>\n<p>Depending on what platform you\u2019re using, LinkedIn might allow you to directly integrate with your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/09\/crm-for-small-business\">CRM<\/a> for lead gen ads submissions.<\/p>\n<p>Although you can manually export your leads, I highly recommend you integrate your CRM. It will make life so much easier for a couple reasons.<\/p>\n<p>First, it saves you time of logging in and manually exporting leads on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<p>Second, these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/18\/b2b-leads-facebook-ads\">B2B leads<\/a> are able to start working their way into your nurture flows immediately. There\u2019s nearly no lag time on when they user fills out the form to when they\u2019re now part of whatever follow-up sequence any other user would be after filling out the form directly on your site.<\/p>\n<p>Here is more information on how you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/help\/lms\/answer\/79636\/integrating-lead-gen-forms-with-your-marketing-automation-crm-system?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">link your CRM and LinkedIn<\/a> depending on the platform you use.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Give your form a useful, systematic name<\/h2>\n<p>I\u2019m a stickler for naming convention, as it always makes Future You\u2019s life much easier.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine troubleshooting a form issue or wanting to set up a test with new form settings and logging in and seeing a list of the following form names staring back at you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lead gen form #1<\/li>\n<li>Form 2<\/li>\n<li>New form 2<\/li>\n<li>Test form<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>What in the world does any of that mean? Literally nothing.<\/p>\n<p>Now\u00a0you\u2019re stuck clicking into each one of them and trying to figure out what\u2019s happening and forgetting what you just read between \u201cForm 2\u201d and \u201cNew form 2&#8243; if there even was a difference.<\/p>\n<p>Give your forms a meaningful name so you can figure out what is going on from the outset to help with future <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/27\/facebook-ad-copy-tests\">ad testing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For example, here\u2019s a real account of mine:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/linkedin-lead-generation-ad-naming-convention.jpg\" alt=\"LinkedIn lead generation ad naming example\" width=\"703\" height=\"617\" \/><\/div>\n<p>For this account, I know exactly what each of these forms has going on because we have a proper naming convention that might seem silly to an outsider but makes sense to me\u2014way more sense than a \u201cForm 2.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>4. Treat the LinkedIn lead gen form text fields like a landing page<\/h2>\n<p>Since the user doesn\u2019t usually end up going to your website until the confirmation page (if at all), it\u2019s important to treat the form text itself as if it\u2019s the landing page.<\/p>\n<p>In the same way you craft your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/23\/cool-landing-pages\">landing pages<\/a>, put some time and effort into your form content.<\/p>\n<p>The user is deciding if they\u2019re willing to give their information in exchange for what you\u2019re offering and if you undersell it, they\u2019re not going to, costing you the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/get-most-from-high-linkedin-cpcs\/262477\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">expensive <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/get-most-from-high-linkedin-cpcs\/262477\/\">LinkedIn CPC<\/a> while not netting any benefit.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve followed Tip #1, this should be pretty easy.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/linkedin-lead-generation-create-form_0.jpg\" alt=\"LinkedIn lead generation ad &quot;Create Form&quot; view\" width=\"777\" height=\"856\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Just like you would on any landing page, use the \u201cOffer Headline\u201d and \u201cOffer Details\u201d sections of the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/10\/linkedin-lead-gen-forms\">lead gen form<\/a> to tell the user what benefit they\u2019ll get from filling out the form. There are text limits, so be concise but appealing. Easy, right?<\/p>\n<h2>5. Balance volume and quantity<\/h2>\n<p>Just like any other form, you have to strike a balance between the questions you ask and the number of responses you want to get.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/linkedin-lead-generation-form-questions-graph.jpg\" alt=\"linkedin lead generation graph form completes vs. number of questions\" width=\"783\" height=\"348\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In most instances, this chart is going to hold true: The more questions you ask, the fewer\u00a0form fills you\u2019re going to get.<\/p>\n<p>And that\u2019s OK! Too many people are focused on getting as many form fills as possible without thinking of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/08\/lead-quality\">lead quality<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re out for a volume play, use the minimum number of questions you can get away with to still call that person a \u201clead.\u201d In my experience, that could be as little as just an email address and a first name.<\/p>\n<p>But if you\u2019re like most of the companies I work with and you want to have better quality leads rather than just anyone, it\u2019s now time to start curating your form questions to weed out the lower quality users.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re trying to get higher quality leads, here are my main suggestions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ask more questions.<\/li>\n<li>Leverage the custom questions .<\/li>\n<li>Force the user to type something in, don\u2019t use all \u201cautofill\u201d questions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Speaking of custom questions&#8230;this feature is particularly useful for collecting <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/12\/first-party-data\">first-party data<\/a>, which is becoming increasingly important as privacy measures are growing.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Leverage hidden fields if you need to<\/h2>\n<p>Just because you have your lead forms integrated with your CRM doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that all tracking is going to work perfectly. Depending on how you\u2019re tracking performance and have leads mapping in your CRM, it might make sense for you to leverage the hidden fields in the form.<\/p>\n<p>Essentially, these allow you to pass additional information into your CRM that isn\u2019t directly found within the form. These are GREAT for tracking sources, targeting, creative, and more in your CRM like we do for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/12\/startup-landing-page\">landing page<\/a> visits.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what the builder looks like:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/linkedin-lead-generation-form-hidden-options.jpg\" alt=\"LinkedIn lead generation ad hidden forms option\" width=\"752\" height=\"495\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In the \u201cField name\u201d portion, choose what portion for your CRM you want this form to map to. Is this a source, medium, campaign, etc.?<\/p>\n<p>The second portion is where you enter the actual value, like \u201clinkedin,\u201d \u201ccpc,\u201d or \u201clead-gen-ads.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re able to add up to 20 hidden fields\u2014this will likely be plenty, but use them wisely as that\u2019s all you get!<\/p>\n<h2>7. Tag your landing page URL with proper UTM tags<\/h2>\n<p>As mentioned above, with LinkedIn lead gen ads, users can fill out your form without ever visiting your landing page, but there are some ways they can and if they do, you should be ready to tag them just as you would if you were running regular sponsored content campaigns.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/linkedin-lead-generation-form-company-website.jpg\" alt=\"LinkedIn lead generation form &quot;company website&quot; in drop-down menu\" width=\"762\" height=\"586\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In the &#8220;Confirmation&#8221; section of the form builder, LinkedIn has you add a landing page to send users to your website. This could either be to get the information they just filled out the form for or it could be just to give them more information about your business.<\/p>\n<p>Either way, treat this just as a normal landing page and add all applicable UTM tags so you can create <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/17\/remarketing-audiences\">retargeting audiences<\/a> and track performance.<\/p>\n<h2>8. Give users two ways to get their information<\/h2>\n<p>Depending on what you\u2019re offering through your ads, it\u2019s important to remember that not all users are the same and they could have different intentions for when they\u2019re going to engage with your content.<\/p>\n<p>Specifically, for those offering a brochure, industry report, whitepaper\u2014something the user could want to read right that minute or something they could be wanting to come back to later\u2014I encourage you to give them multiple ways to engage with your offer.<\/p>\n<p>The first is to give the website link (if applicable) and the landing page URL in the Confirmation we discussed above. This way, if they want the content right away they can click through the URL and get it.<\/p>\n<p>Second, and regardless if they engage with the content immediately, have your CRM email them another route for getting back in. Even if it\u2019s a short note to say \u201cHere\u2019s the industry report you requested,\u201d it can go a long way for the person to continue to refer back to the information and continue to<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/27\/linkedin-stories\"> see your brand<\/a> as an educational source and create stronger ties for the future.<\/p>\n<h2>9. Use the Linkedin Website Demographics feature<\/h2>\n<p>This is a great way to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/25\/optimize-linkedin-ads\">optimize your LinkedIn ads<\/a>. Within the LinkedIn Campaign Manager is a very helpful yet little-known feature that allows you to segment visitors to your website from your LinkedIn ads based on their job function, company, company size, and more.
