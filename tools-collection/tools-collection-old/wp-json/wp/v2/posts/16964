What\u2019s top of mind?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Growth, growth, growth<\/strong> \u2013 Digital marketing agencies were successful in growing their paid search management under spend last year \u2013 but they\u2019re not stopping now! Most agencies are looking to drive further growth this year, whether through upsells or bringing on new clients.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Quality of service is key<\/strong> \u2013 With word of mouth and client referrals as the #1 way to acquire new accounts, delivering stellar results to existing clients is absolutely crucial. Agencies need to strike the right balance when it comes to dividing resources between maintenance and growth activities.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cross-platform advertising<\/strong> \u2013 Most agencies we spoke to are managing online ad spend across at least three different platforms, and offering a number of different services aside from paid search. Agencies get that businesses need to run cross-channel campaigns and diversity their marketing channels to succeed in 2018.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Hiring\/education\/training<\/strong> \u2013 You can\u2019t <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/06\/26\/grow-my-agency\">grow your agency<\/a> without adding more head count or adding new tools and software to make existing reps more efficient. With aggressive growth, both are needed \u2013 and either way, agencies need to set aside resources so they can hire and retain great talent and keep their staff trained on all platforms.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Over to you, agencies \u2013 how have your strategies changed in the past year?
