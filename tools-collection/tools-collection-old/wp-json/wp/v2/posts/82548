It\u2019s often broken up into four different stages, but the number of stages and names of those stages vary depending on who you talk to. One of the most widely accepted sets of stages is as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Awareness<\/li>\n<li>Interest<\/li>\n<li>Desire<\/li>\n<li>Action<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We\u2019ll talk more about each of these phases later in this post.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/marketing-funnel-wordstream-basic-funnel.webp\" alt=\"marketing funnel - basic marketing funnel graphic.\" width=\"625\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82558 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/marketing-funnel-wordstream-basic-funnel.webp 625w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/marketing-funnel-wordstream-basic-funnel-480x461.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 625px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The marketing funnel is shaped like a funnel because you naturally get drop-off along the way. Not everyone who becomes aware of your business, product, or service will complete the journey to becoming a customer.

This has always been the case to varying degrees for different industries. But it\u2019s more true than ever because consumers have so many options now and even more tools for researching and vetting.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s go over why the marketing funnel helps to account for this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/28\/behavioral-segmentation\">buying behavior<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Guides your content strategy<\/h3>\n<p>Because customers have different intents at each of the stages in the buying journey, the content that will be most effective at influencing them at each of those stages will be different. With a marketing funnel, you can then create a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/01\/content-marketing-funnel\">content marketing funnel<\/a> so that you\u2019re equipped to move your leads through the journey.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/marketing-funnel-wordstream-full-funnel.webp\" alt=\"marketing funnel - The full marketing funnel with examples.\" width=\"895\" height=\"579\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82559 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/marketing-funnel-wordstream-full-funnel.webp 895w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/marketing-funnel-wordstream-full-funnel-480x311.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 895px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Increases conversions<\/h3>\n<p>A marketing funnel increases conversions because, without one, you\u2019re asking people to make a massive leap from being <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/10\/brand-awareness\">aware of your brand<\/a> to becoming paying customers without guidance. This rarely happens, so your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/17\/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate\">conversion rates<\/a> with this approach will be super low.<\/p>\n<p>With a marketing funnel, you start with low-friction education. Each subsequent offer requires a little more commitment and buy-in than the last. Now, you\u2019re increasing conversion rates at each stage, bringing more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/12\/how-to-generate-leads\">leads<\/a> to the finish line.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/marketing-funnel-wordstream-basic-funnel-1.webp\" alt=\"marketing funnel - graphic showing the value of each marketing funnel stage.\" width=\"813\" height=\"583\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82560 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/marketing-funnel-wordstream-basic-funnel-1.webp 813w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/marketing-funnel-wordstream-basic-funnel-1-480x344.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 813px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Identifies problem areas<\/h3>\n<p>As we just covered, a marketing funnel takes your one conversion action (becoming a customer) and breaks it into a series of smaller conversion steps. This way, you can establish benchmark conversion rates at each stage, which will allow you to monitor and adjust accordingly. For example, if you\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/lead-generation-strategies\">generating many good-quality leads<\/a> but your demo conversion rate is lacking, you may want to revisit your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/01\/bottom-funnel-conversions\">bottom-funnel<\/a> and sales enablement content.<\/p>\n<div id=\"what-are-the-stages-of-the-marketing-funnel\"><\/div>\n<h2>What are the stages of the marketing funnel?<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you understand the marketing funnel and why it\u2019s important, let\u2019s review the different stages of the funnel and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/15\/lead-magnet-ideas\">best types of marketing strategies for each stage<\/a>. Note that you can produce the same content <em>formats<\/em> at any stage of the funnel: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/09\/how-to-write-a-blog-post\">blog posts<\/a>, downloadable PDFs, website pages, ads, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/03\/email-marketing-best-practices\">emails<\/a>, and videos\u2014what differs is the content topic.<\/p>\n<div id=\"awareness-stage\"><\/div>\n<h3>Awareness stage<\/h3>\n<p>In the awareness stage of the marketing funnel (also called \u201ctop of funnel\u201d or \u201cTOF\u201d), the consumer is aware of their pain points but not aware of your business. They may not even be aware of the product or service you offer. Your goal is to get them to understand the problem <em>behind<\/em> their symptoms, to learn that there are solutions, and to become aware that you exist.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What the consumer is doing:<\/strong> Searching online for information about their pain points. Their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-intent\">keyword intent<\/a> is informational, so they\u2019re searching things like \u201chow to increase\/decrease\/improve X\u201d and \u201cwhy is X happening.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Best strategies:<\/strong> Offer advice, be helpful, and educate people on the root problem in this content. Use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/05\/blog-post-templates\">blog posts<\/a>, ebooks, PR, events, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/25\/email-newsletter-ideas\">newsletters<\/a>, guest blogging, social ads for guides, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/23\/google-display-ads\">display ads<\/a>, and more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Example:<\/strong> My company, Hatch, is a text automation platform for contractors. But contractors in the awareness stage aren\u2019t looking for or interested in this. They\u2019re interested in their symptoms: leads not responding to their calls and sales representatives burning out.

Your goal is to get them interested in the solution <em>you<\/em> offer. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean your brand, just the type of solution.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What the consumer is doing: <\/strong>Searching for the best solutions to their problem. Their keyword intent is still informational, but the keywords are less about symptoms and more about solutions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Best strategies: <\/strong>Provide education on the different solutions and offer content illustrating why yours is the best. Try free trials, product guides, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/13\/explainer-videos\">explainer videos<\/a>, buying guides, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/ppc\">search ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Example: <\/strong>Continuing with the Hatch example, the customer in this stage of the funnel is now aware that the problem behind the symptom of leads not responding is that they\u2019re not reaching out fast enough.

Their keyword intent is commercial, which means they\u2019re searching with terms like \u201creviews,\u201d \u201ccompare,\u201d \u201cvs.,\u201d \u201calternatives,\u201d and \u201cbest.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Best strategies:<\/strong> Show what makes you different from competitors.
