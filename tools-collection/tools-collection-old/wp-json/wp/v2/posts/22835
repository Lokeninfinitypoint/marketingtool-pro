But as you start <a href=\"https:\/\/instapage.com\/best-landing-page-examples-chapter-1\">adding the necessary elements<\/a>, you see something amazing come alive.<\/p>\n<p>The finished building only looks great if you\u2019ve built it using the correct materials in the right places \u2014 the same is true for landing pages.<\/p>\n<p>Besides a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/27\/landing-page-forms\">lead capture form<\/a>, every landing page contains a mix of various elements. There\u2019s the headline, copy, image, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/05\/customer-testimonials\">customer testimonials<\/a>, trust seals, customer badges, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/20\/call-to-action-buttons\">call to action button<\/a>, and a video or gif. Each element plays its part to get the visitor to convert. For example, you can\u2019t pay less attention to the copy so that your headline becomes more noticeable, nor can you ignore the form to give the CTA button the spotlight.<\/p>\n<p>All elements deserve a noticeable place on your dedicated page because it\u2019s the balance between these elements that helps persuade the visitor to convert into a lead\/customer.<\/p>\n<p>When you don\u2019t maintain this balance, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.seerinteractive.com\/blog\/the-spin-test-for-ppc-landing-pages\/\">this is the kind of page<\/a> you can expect to see:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f20e208d-a3fc-49cb-a5a5-b077e5e3f2ff\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/landing-page-no-white-space.png\" alt=\"Landing Page Example\" width=\"544\" height=\"539\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>And when every element is given a chance to shine, <em>this<\/em> is the <a href=\"https:\/\/freshdesk.com\/free-help-desk-software\">kind of page<\/a> that you can create:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6119df31-8d6d-4a47-adf5-d74a29c5f896\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/freshdesk-landing-page-white-space.png\" alt=\"freshdesk landing page\" width=\"800\" height=\"390\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>So, what\u2019s the difference between these two landing pages? Both pages have the necessary elements needed to score a conversion. What the <a href=\"https:\/\/chatbots.org\/freshchat\">Freshdesk<\/a> page has that the TaxSlayer page doesn\u2019t have is an element often overlooked with landing pages \u2014 <strong>white space<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>What Is \u201cWhite Space\u201d Anyway?<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/uxmyths.com\/post\/2059998441\/myth-28-white-space-is-wasted-space\">Jan Tschichold had this to say<\/a> about white space: it \u201cis to be regarded as an active element, not a passive background.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.teamtreehouse.com\/white-space-in-web-design-what-it-is-and-why-you-should-use-it\">White space<\/a> (aka negative space) is any portion of a page that is left unmarked \u2014 the empty space on a page. In design terms, white space can be defined as the space between text, margins, columns, graphics, and any other page elements.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"835b5292-d8e6-4282-b26e-58feb97af124\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/white-space-design-beach.jpg\" alt=\"white space landing page\" width=\"700\" height=\"466\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s this open space that makes all other landing page elements look more pronounced and draws focus to them. It wouldn\u2019t be wrong to say that white space is the glue that holds a landing page together. Without white space, you\u2019re left with a messy page (like TaxSlayer above) that\u2019s not conversion-worthy.<\/p>\n<p>The space is called \u201cwhite\u201d and yet, it <a href=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/2015\/04\/30\/how-to-effectively-use-whitespace-in-web-design\/\">doesn\u2019t always need to be white<\/a>. You can have this space be any color as long as it looks natural with the page design and helps draw attention to each element (especially your CTA and form).<\/p>\n<p>You can include white space practically anywhere on a landing page to help everything stand apart and get your visitor to take notice.<\/p>\n<h2>The Four Types of White Space Design<\/h2>\n<p>There are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.printwand.com\/blog\/white-space-in-graphic-design-and-why-its-important\">four main types of white space design<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Micro white space<\/strong>: This is the negative space between smaller elements (e.g. the space between an image and a caption and between words and letters).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Macro white space: <\/strong>This is the blank space between main elements (e.g. the space between the headline and the copy).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Active white space: <\/strong>This kind of space is consciously added to the page in order to make it more structured. It is mostly asymmetrical and makes the page look dynamic.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Passive white space:<\/strong> This is natural occurring white space, and it\u2019s not added deliberately. It\u2019s the space between words on a line or the space around a graphic.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>All four types of white space are necessary for great landing page design to draw attention to your landing page elements.<\/p>\n<p>Negative space plays a major role in landing page design. Let\u2019s discuss some reasons why you should include this page element in all the <a href=\"https:\/\/instapage.com\/how-to-create-a-landing-page\">landing pages you create<\/a>.<a href=\"http:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLHowToMakeGreatLandingPagesGuide.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_LandingPages_HowToMakeGreatLandingPagesGuide_Download\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>White Space Design Enhances Readability<\/h2>\n<p>By using white space in your copy, you\u2019re able to de-clutter the text, allowing the visitor to have a more enjoyable reading experience. To demonstrate, let\u2019s look at this paragraph of copy that <a href=\"http:\/\/alistapart.com\/article\/whitespace\">doesn\u2019t have any whitespace<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"99dc65f0-3dbb-478c-8a9a-fa4171f599d8\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/text-lacking-white-space-design.png\" alt=\"text landing page\" width=\"565\" height=\"223\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>How many lines did you read?

White space is the reason why your visitors will first look at your headline, then move to the copy, proceed to the form and finally your call-to-action button.<\/p>\n<p>White space allows you to provide spatial relationships between each page element \u2014 allowing you to guide your visitors through the page.<\/p>\n<p>Look at this <a href=\"http:\/\/get.sendible.com\/\">Sendible landing page<\/a> as an example:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4e8d172f-206c-4ad5-a523-2e0e1e7b621c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sendible-landing-page-white-space-design.png\" alt=\"sendible landing page example\" width=\"800\" height=\"431\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The negative space on both sides of the page guides visitors\u2019 eyes to the middle, where they\u2019ll find the primary and secondary headline. This is not what <a href=\"http:\/\/clickripplesolutions.com\/web-designing-pattern-layouts-fz\/\">F and Z page patterns dictate<\/a> \u2014 yet due to white space, you are forced to start looking at the page from the middle.<\/p>\n<h2>White Space Design Makes Your Landing Page Upscale<\/h2>\n<p>White space can be used to add a sense of sophistication and elegance to your landing pages. Less white space generally gives off a low-quality vibe, whereas a page with generous negative space comes across as premium and luxurious.<\/p>\n<p>Take <a href=\"http:\/\/alistapart.com\/article\/whitespace\">these two ads<\/a> as an example:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f74faef1-6648-4a34-a55f-9b89e0d0e561\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/white-space-design-premium.jpg\" alt=\"black and white landing page\" width=\"540\" height=\"406\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Which one looks more premium?<\/p>\n<p>Landing pages are no different.

If the form isn\u2019t designed properly you can risk losing visitors who were ready to convert but got turned off by the form. White space eliminates this risk because you can easily format your form fields.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nngroup.com\/articles\/closeness-of-actions-and-objects-gui\/\">Gestalt principle<\/a> explains that visitors tend to overlook elements in proximity to each other.

It\u2019s not the section of the page you couldn\u2019t fill. It\u2019s the space on the page you deliberately left blank so that the remaining areas could draw more attention.<\/p>\n<p>White space gives your page elements room to breathe so what you design is a simple, sophisticated page that has the power to persuade visitors to convert \u2014 and that\u2019s what all landing pages are created to do.<\/p>\n<h3>About the author<\/h3>\n<p>Fahad Muhammad is a Content Marketer at <a href=\"https:\/\/instapage.com\">Instapage<\/a>.
