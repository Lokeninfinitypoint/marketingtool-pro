Before we get too far ahead of ourselves, let\u2019s rattle off the main tools you\u2019ll be using to start building your 2021 <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/seo\/elements-killer-seo-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO strategy<\/a>:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Keyword targeting<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"\/keywords\">Keywords<\/a> are phrases that are commonly searched for on Google, Bing, etc. and they are a crucial part of determining your website\u2019s rankings. Use the right amount of keywords in the right places and in time you\u2019ll see your pages climb up the leaderboards.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/seo-strategy-2021-keywords-1.png\" alt=\"SEO strategy 2021 keywords\" width=\"800\" height=\"452\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Keywords that a car dealership may be researching (using our <a href=\"\/keywords\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a>).<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Keyword strategy has changed a lot over the years, it used to just be stuff as many in there as possible, but lots of content then became spammy and sites were ultimately penalized by Google\u2019s algorithms. These days, you need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">do your keyword research<\/a>, use a wide variety of keywords, and fit them in naturally.

Metadata<\/h3>\n<p>You can think of metadata almost as your shop window. Your meta title and meta description are the first things a user sees in the SERP which influences whether or not they click.<\/p>\n<p>Also, Google uses what are known as \u2018crawlers\u2019 (imagine tiny robot spiders), to scan through websites and collect information that matches search queries. By including keywords in your meta data (including image tags and heading tags) Google can more quickly understand the relevance of your page.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/killer-seo-strategy-2021-meta-data_1-1.png\" alt=\"killer seo strategy 2021 meta data\" width=\"800\" height=\"666\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>3. Backlinks<\/h3>\n<p>As we move into the more technical side of things, another crucial factor in SEO performance is <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2010\/04\/01\/build-amazing-backlinks\">acquiring backlinks<\/a>. This is when another website links to yours in an article or blog post. Not only does this help you gain what is known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/12\/domain-authority\">domain authority<\/a>, but it also directly improves the chances of people clicking through to your website if it appears on other reliable domains.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/seo-strategy-2021-link-building-1.png\" alt=\"Seo strategy 2021 link building\" width=\"800\" height=\"417\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/link-building-strategies\/\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>You can earn organic links by simply <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/22\/marketing-copy\">writing engaging content<\/a>: the better your work and the more closely you match with a person\u2019s search intent, the more likely others in your industry are to reference your site. This overarching process is known as <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/10\/link-building-secrets\">link-building<\/a> and while you can simply reach out to other sites to trade links\u2014quid pro quo\u2014there a plenty of other activities that can help speed up this process:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Guest blogging.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/05\/customer-testimonials\">Testimonials<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Answering questions on sites like Quora.<\/li>\n<li>Creating\u00a0shareable content such as videos and infographics.<\/li>\n<li>Using industry contacts and sharing\u00a0on social (e.g. LinkedIn).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>4. Technical SEO<\/h3>\n<p>Carrying on from that, there are various other technical issues in the back end of your site that once addressed, can make a huge difference in your overall <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/search-engine-optimization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO results<\/a>. At the end of the day, if your website\u2019s UX isn\u2019t smooth and accessible, it\u2019s going to be hard for any visitor to do anything significant on your website. For context, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/277125\/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">over 50% of all online traffic is mobile<\/a>, so when it comes to things like UX, the technical stuff matters.<\/p>\n<p>Whether it\u2019s ensuring site speeds are quick, removing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/blog\/toxic-links-guidelines\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u2018toxic\u2019 backlinks<\/a> (links to websites that are deemed irrelevant or untrustworthy etc.), or creating a clear XML sitemap with a clean URL structure, all of these technical SEO tips can be huge when it comes to securing those higher rankings. You don\u2019t want anything to get in the way of SEO doing its job, which is allowing for people to find your website organically.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/localiq-grader?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Are you making SEO mistakes?

SEO metrics<\/h3>\n<p>You can&#8217;t do effective SEO if you don&#8217;t know what &#8220;effective&#8221; means! You&#8217;ll need to have a thorough understanding of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/27\/seo-metrics\">SEO metrics<\/a> in order to measure, analyze, and improve your SEO strategy.<\/p>\n<h2>Why is organic traffic and SEO important?<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for longevity and cost-effectiveness when it comes to your<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/04\/best-marketing-strategies-2021\"> digital marketing<\/a>, organic search strategies driven by SEO can\u2019t be beaten. Not only is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.activewin.co.uk\/blog\/top-five-benefits-of-seo-for-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO cheaper than paid advertising but its effects are\u00a0longer lasting<\/a>.\u00a0While PPC campaigns need to be renewed and bidding costs fluctuate, SEO tracking tools use organic data to compile lists of keywords and continue to throw up more content ideas the deeper you dig.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/seo-strategy-2021-keyword-tools-1.png\" alt=\"SEO strategy 2021 keywords ideas\" width=\"800\" height=\"426\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Admittedly, SEO can feel like a slow burn at first. Nevertheless, you can start to see serious<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> upturns in your overall traffic<\/a> and rankings after a few months. Furthermore, the longer you stay\u00a0at it, the more backlinks and site authority you build, meaning you can go for even bigger and better keywords, and so on and so forth.<\/p>\n<p>Even starting at the other end of the spectrum\u2014targeting <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/11\/07\/how-to-find-long-tail-keywords\">long-tail keywords<\/a> and more detailed variants\u2014especially when it comes to content and specific sub-topics, is an excellent way for SMBs to see results early and build a platform towards momentum. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/07\/google-search-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Over a third of Google\u2019s total search queries feature four or more words<\/a> (i.e. long-tail keywords). Not only are these keywords less competitive and\u00a0therefore easier to rank for, but they can also still drive plenty of cumulative traffic organically.<\/p>\n<h2>8 tips to build an effective SEO strategy<\/h2>\n<p>It isn\u2019t always about trying to go for the most popular search terms and expecting to be able to compete with the big fish right out of the gate. It\u2019s about knowing your audience and trying to provide the content, information, and overall service they want\/need. With that in mind, here are eight SEO tips that are just as effective now in 2021 as they have always been.<\/p>\n<p>You may also be interested in our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/24\/website-audit-checklist\">epic website audit checklist (with a six-tab Google Sheet)<\/a> to help you out with your strategy.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Write for humans first and\u00a0search engines second<\/h3>\n<p>As mentioned already, the Google algorithm gets smarter by the day and using constant human input, continues to better align with our thinking. That being said, there is no clever loophole or magic formula to outwit a search engine, so don\u2019t bother trying. Write for humans first and search engines second.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, your priority should always be to provide your audience with what they are looking for, and that only comes through writing engaging and\u00a0fundamentally naturalistic content. Anyone can spot a keyword that\u2019s been shoehorned in and stuffing is even more blatant, so fit them in where it makes sense and allow driving keywords to elevate your already informative and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/15\/quality-content-defined\">valuable content<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Use targeted keywords in all the right places<\/h3>\n<p>Whilst the motivation should always be humans first, search engines second, the bedrock of this whole process is keywords. Not only do they get to the heart of what visitors and Google are looking for by isolating common search terms, but <a href=\"https:\/\/videos.brightedge.com\/research-report\/BrightEdge_ChannelReport2019_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO also drives 1000%+ more traffic than organic social media<\/a>, which itself dominates over half of all online traffic. So, if keywords are at the heart of SEO, they should be at the heart of everything you do, too.<\/p>\n<p>However, once again, it isn\u2019t about just chucking them in left, right, and center. It\u00a0all starts with keyword research. Use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/14\/seo-tools\">SEO tools<\/a> like Google Ads, Ahrefs and even simple on-site search bars to identify broad search intent and your &#8220;seed&#8221; keywords. Then dig deeper to find more long-tail variants, study competitors to find keyword gaps, and don\u2019t forget to include them in your metadata as well as the anchor text for your links. Lastly, remember not to keyword stuff. Fit them in naturally so as not to disrupt the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/04\/seo-content-readability\">readability<\/a> of your copy.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/easy-guide-to-keyword-research-intent-funnel.jpeg\" alt=\"easy guide to keyword research: intent funnel\" width=\"720\" height=\"309\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-41498\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/easy-guide-to-keyword-research-intent-funnel.jpeg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/easy-guide-to-keyword-research-intent-funnel-480x206.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>3. Focus on user experience (UX)<\/h3>\n<p>There is nothing worse than having to navigate a site that you can barely use. In fact, after more than a few seconds of frustration, most people don\u2019t bother and Google will struggle to make the best out of it too. Things like dead links, error pages, and messy site structures will all impact what people take away from your website.<\/p>\n<p>Not only do users value a good experience and easy navigation, but this seamlessness also helps Google\u2019s crawlers scan your content and determine your SERP rankings. Use headings and short, easy to read paragraphs,\u00a0tidy up your sub-folders, and optimize for mobile. All of these things will help to\u00a0reduce your bounce rate, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/19\/get-on-first-page-google\">improve your rankings<\/a>, and\u00a0generate better conversion overall.<\/p>\n<p>And now that Core Web Vitals have become a ranking factor via the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/19\/core-web-vitals-google-page-experience-update\"> page experience update,\u00a0<\/a>you should be optimizing page speed more than ever.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/improve-core-web-vitals-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"536\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9016\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/improve-core-web-vitals-1.png 800w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/improve-core-web-vitals-1-480x322.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>4. Focus on building relevant links<\/h3>\n<p>As mentioned, another key aspect in building domain reputation\/site authority is link-building. We\u2019ve already touched upon why outbound\/external links are important: you not only enhance the information you are providing but you can receive reciprocal backlinks through outreach, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, links are a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/09\/google-ranking-factors\">key ranking factor<\/a>. Bots\/crawlers discover content by following links through to subsequent pages and judging how relevant they are to a search query. This goes for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/04\/internal-linking\">internal linking<\/a> as well, so don\u2019t be afraid to link to other useful pages on your site where necessary and where it feels natural. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aira.net\/state-of-link-building\/link-building-measurement-and-reporting\/\">51% of marketers notice an impact after one to three months<\/a> of implementing a link-building strategy<strong><em>.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We talk a lot about link building in our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/20\/seo-audit\">10-step SEO audit<\/a>\u2014check it out.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Format content for Featured Snippets<\/h3>\n<p>Featured snippets pretty much rule SERPs these days. It&#8217;s likely that you\u2019re familiar with them even if you haven\u2019t heard the term before. They are the highlighted answer boxes that appear at the top of the pages for most search queries. If you manage\u00a0to earn a featured snippet, you\u2019re doing something right.<\/p>\n<p>There are certain formatting and stylistic choices you can make to up your chances of landing a featured snippet: bullet points, numbered lists, infographics and answering question-based searches directly, to name a few. Whilst there is data that shows snippets don\u2019t always result in direct clicks, as the search query is answered in the Google preview itself, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/data-backed-ways-to-optimize-for-google-featured-snippets\/387928\/#close\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">over 19% of SERPs have featured snippets<\/a> and counting. They are great for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/10\/brand-awareness\">raising brand awareness <\/a>and getting your name out there.\u00a0Therefore, the clicks will still come.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/seo-strategy-2021-featured-snippet-1.png\" alt=\"Seo strategy 2021 featured snippet\" width=\"500\" height=\"455\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/hub\/seo\/featured-snippets\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>6. Remove anything that slows down your site<\/h3>\n<p>Once again, it can\u2019t be overstated how simple it is to get the technical stuff right in order for your website and specific content to speak for itself. Whether you\u2019re writing informative blogs, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/29\/how-to-promote-a-product\">selling a product\/service<\/a>, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, your site needs to be quick, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/5\/accessibility-inclusivity-advertising\">accessible<\/a>, and easy to use. These days, people expect instant information and instant results. If your site <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/22\/google-page-speed\">takes an age to load<\/a>, they\u2019ll simply move on.<\/p>\n<p>There are a number of ways you can improve site speed and the overall smoothness of your UX: delete old\/defunct plugins, clean up your code, optimize and compress your images, make sure your sub-folders flow and make sense, and use tools like Google Page Speed Insights or GTmetrix to continue monitoring in the future.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Pay attention to Google algorithm updates<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019ve briefly touched on this already but Google gets smarter and more intuitive by the day. The core updates and tweaks to the algorithm are constant and often unexpected, with sites either benefitting or being penalized for how closely they adhere to the most recent update.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/killer-seo-strategy-2021-core-algorithm-update-1.png\" alt=\"killer seo strategy 2021 core algorithm update\" width=\"500\" height=\"633\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Rankings and penalties are determined by a variety of factors: accessibility, speed, excessive advertising or spammy content, etc. Whilst it can\u2019t always be avoided, there are a few easy steps you can take to stay in touching distance. Firstly, subscribe to industry websites and forums to keep track of recent\/impending updates. Google\u2019s Search Console Community is a good start \u2013 and make sure to closely track your traffic using services like Google Analytics and SEMrush to see where updates may have occurred, so you can then adjust accordingly.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Improve existing content &amp; add missing subtopics<\/h3>\n<p>Lastly, you need to remember that there is no real finish line when it comes to your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/seo\/5-must-haves-your-seo-strategy\/\">SEO strategy<\/a>. Constant updates and battling with your competitors means that there\u2019s always work to be done, not to mention that you can still improve on what you\u2019ve done already. If you haven\u2019t been using SEO properly already, going back and updating content with keywords, backlinks, and better readability is a great way to get started. You can even ensure that pages that have been performing better maintain traffic growth or build upon that standard by regularly updating them.<\/p>\n<p>Circling back to your keyword research, this is a great opportunity to use these phrases and competitor analysis as the basis for a long-term content plan. Each keyword should branch off into a plethora of others and with that comes more ideas for content. Rather than writing, say, one piece of a specific topic, make it a \u2018cornerstone\u2019 article from which a number of other more specific ones spawn. A proper content audit can be done using tools like SEMrush and Yoast; <a href=\"https:\/\/neilpatel.com\/blog\/how-to-double-your-traffic-by-finding-the-low-hanging-fruit-in-your-blog-archives\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">adding and updating old content can double your traffic<\/a>\u00a0\u2014just try to make it as <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/10\/16\/guide-to-evergreen-content-marketing\">evergreen<\/a> as possible and be sure to use that internal and external linking we talked about.<\/p>\n<h2>Lock in SEO success<\/h2>\n<p>This post only scratches the surface of what SEO is all about.
