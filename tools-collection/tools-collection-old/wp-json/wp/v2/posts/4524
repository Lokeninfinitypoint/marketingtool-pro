To distinguish between popular sites and authoritative sites, he uses the examples of pornography and government websites. Porn sites are more popular than government sites, he says, but government sites are more authoritative:<\/p>\n<p>If you were to look at sites that are popular \u2013 for example porn sites are very popular \u2013 but people tend not to link to porn sites. On the other hand if you take something like the Wisconsin real estate board, probably not a ton of people go there, but quite a few people do link to government websites. And so popularity is in some sense a measure of where people go, whereas PageRank is much more a measure of reputation; it&#8217;s much more a measure of where people link.<\/p>\n<p>This is fascinating to me because of the admission he isn\u2019t focusing on \u2013 <strong>there are verticals (if we can call porn a vertical) where links are not important.<\/strong> This is probably why, as Cutts said in a recent Webmaster video, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/19\/search-without-links\">Google has tried ranking sites without consulting the link graph<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So the question becomes, if people don\u2019t link to porn, how does Google rank porn sites? People certainly use Google to search for porn (protip: turn &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/websearch\/answer\/510?hl=en\">safe search<\/a>&#8221; off), and they must have some method of ranking those sites. And in a space like porn, \u201csimple popularity\u201d <em>would<\/em> trump authority.<\/p>\n<h2>Do People Even Want Authority?<\/h2>\n<p>The thing is, I don\u2019t think porn is the only exception to the \u201cauthority\u201d rule. <strong>I\u2019d argue that there are a number of spaces where popularity should far outweigh links<\/strong>. Take restaurants for example. As a diner, I don\u2019t really care which restaurants have the most press, I care which restaurants serve the best food. There might be better ways of measuring the signals of true popularity for a restaurant (social buzz, brand searches, mobile check-ins, etc.) than links. These are the kinds of signals that would figure into a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/01\/24\/linkless-seo\">Quality Score\u2013type algorithm for organic rankings<\/a>, versus standard-issue, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/25\/pagerank\">link-based PageRank<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But restaurants are just one example. <strong>I think Google \u2013 at least in PR like Webmaster videos \u2013 is overselling the importance of authority to users.<\/strong> Assuming that people want authoritative content is kind of like assuming they want vegetables and whole grains, when in fact they\u2019d rather have junk food most of the time. In other words, people <em>want<\/em> porn.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"bf7437a9-7763-44a9-bb0e-eb9bf0e774e9\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/buzzfeed-journalism-porn-1.png\" alt=\"Journalism Porn\" width=\"545\" height=\"259\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>They want the porn equivalent of journalism (quizzes and listicles from BuzzFeed, for example) just as much, if not more, as they want the New York Times. And when they\u2019re looking for general information, they often want Wikipedia.<\/p>\n<p>We know Google knows people want Wikipedia for two reasons:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wikipedia ranks on the first page for HALF of Google searches<\/strong> (remember most <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2012\/12\/10\/three-types-of-search-queries\">search queries<\/a> are informational in nature)<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/28\/matt-cutts\">Google \u201cscrapes\u201d Wikipedia<\/a> all the time for its <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/02\/01\/knowledge-graph-conspiracy-confirmed\">Knowledge Graph<\/a><\/strong>, so users don\u2019t even have to click through to get fast \u201cfacts\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But the truth is, Wikipedia isn\u2019t really \u201cauthoritative,\u201d it\u2019s just popular. The content on Wikipedia is biased and always in flux. At any given time, any \u201cfact\u201d you find on Wikipedia could be utter bullshit. Plus, most of it is scraped, AKA copied and pasted, and &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Z13-yP3Zhns\">stitched<\/a>&#8221; from other sites, something Cutts has told us content creators is a no-no. Still, it\u2019s what people want (simple, familiar, to the point), so Google gives it to them. Of course, Wikipedia also happens to have a killer link profile, but this is somewhat circular \u2013 people keep clicking and linking because it\u2019s always one of the first five results.<\/p>\n<h2>Closing Thoughts<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Google is forced to rethink rankings in verticals where links aren\u2019t the going currency. I think it\u2019s inevitable that Google looks to ranking signals outside the link in other query spaces. <strong>However Google ranks porn is the future of search<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>When it comes to content, \u201cquality\u201d is defined by the people. Unless you\u2019re a government website (in which case you probably don\u2019t need to worry about SEO), define quality by what makes your users happy. If they are clicking, reading, sharing, and coming back, those are the quality signals you need, whether or not they\u2019re linking. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/10\/07\/content-marketing-for-service-professionals\">Be addictive<\/a>. <strong>Be like junk food to your audience<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In his latest Webmaster video, Matt Cutts answers the question: \u201cHow does Google separate popularity from authority?\u201d (This question came from a \u201cBlind Five Year Old,\u201d by the way!
