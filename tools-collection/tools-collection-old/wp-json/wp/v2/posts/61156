This is not surprising as click-through rates for these industries tend to run lower than others, which can drive up CPCs.

Simply put, CTR is the ratio of ad clicks to ad impressions. A CTR of 1% means that 1 out of every 100 people who see your ad click it.<\/p>\n<p><iframe height=\"644\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" title=\"Search Advertising Benchmarks \" aria-label=\"Column Chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-ySkth\" src=\"https:\/\/datawrapper.dwcdn.net\/ySkth\/1\/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><script type=\"text\/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();<\/script><br \/>\nMost of the industries we looked at have average click-through rates in the 6-7% range.

As <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/29\/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks\">search expert Mark Irvine has pointed out<\/a> in the past, there are unique advertising restrictions in the legal industry enforced by both search engines and government organizations, which have historically driven down CTRs in that industry, though this metric has also improved for legal advertisers over the years.<\/p>\n<p>Year over year, we've seen increases in CTR nearly across the board, suggesting that ads are feeling more relevant to users, which could be due to changes on both the advertisers' side and the search engines' side (such as more advanced AI and matching algorithms). The only industry that decreased in click-through rate was Shopping, Collectibles, &amp; Gifts\u2014by 13%. The highest increase in CTR was in Sports &amp; Recreation at 14%, potentially due to post-pandemic consumers feeling more comfortable returning to fitness centers.<\/p>\n<p><iframe height=\"575\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" title=\"Search Advertising Benchmarks\" aria-label=\"Range Plot\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-ILWGE\" src=\"https:\/\/datawrapper.dwcdn.net\/ILWGE\/1\/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><script type=\"text\/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();<\/script><\/p>\n<h3>How does your click-through rate compare?<\/h3>\n<p>If your click-through rates are lower than what you\u2019re seeing for your industry, you might want to refine your keyword list and make sure the keywords you're targeting are truly relevant to your business.

In particular, we can see that high cost per click doesn't necessarily equate to high cost per lead.<\/p>\n<p>For example, while Dentists &amp; Dental Services has a much higher average cost per click than Arts &amp; Entertainment ($7.00 vs $1.50), they both have an average cost per lead of $50. This is because the average conversion rate for Arts &amp; Entertainment (5%) is much lower than for Dentists &amp; Dental Services (5% vs 11%). Why? A person is more likely to book a dentist appointment they can always reschedule or fill out a contact form than to book, say, a non-refundable ticket to a show.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, click-through rate is much higher for Arts &amp; Entertainment, as people do more exploring of their options here while for Dentists &amp; Dental Services, the consumer has a clear picture of what they need.<\/p>\n<p><iframe height=\"600\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" title=\"Search Advertising Benchmarks\" aria-label=\"Scatter Plot\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-pYDh1\" src=\"https:\/\/datawrapper.dwcdn.net\/pYDh1\/1\/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><script type=\"text\/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();<\/script><\/p>\n<p>However, while high click-through rate is commonly associated with lower conversion rates, low click-through rate doesn\u2019t necessarily mean higher conversion rate. For example, Business Services has the same (relatively low) average CVR (5%) as Arts &amp; Entertainment, but a much lower average CTR (5% vs 11%). And while its average CTR is the same as Dentists, its average CVR is much lower (5% vs 13%).<\/p>\n<p>This makes sense since people seeking dental services and business services both have a clear idea of what they need, so they do less exploration than Arts &amp; Entertainment seekers, meaning lower average CTR. But since the B2B buying process often involves more than one decision-maker, there are more barriers to taking action for a business services customer\u2014and thus a lower conversion rate\u2014than for a dental customer.<\/p>\n<p><iframe height=\"600\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" title=\"Search Advertising Benchmarks\" aria-label=\"Scatter Plot\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-o5Wqo\" src=\"https:\/\/datawrapper.dwcdn.net\/o5Wqo\/1\/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><script type=\"text\/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();<\/script><\/p>\n<p>All of this goes to show how the variation in purchasing behavior by industry results in varying benchmark profiles\u2014which is why it's so important to understand performance norms in your industry specifically in order to get a true gauge on your performance.

Here's our explanation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The pandemic continues to impact the advertising space. <\/strong>This should come as no surprise since consumer priorities shift as the situation evolves. \u201cI think that the pandemic is at play here more than anything else,\u201d said Katia Hausman, VP of Ad Products at LOCALiQ. \u201cIf we look at the data by quarter and layer it over COVID waves, they match the dips in CPC and the spikes in CTR.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/search-advertising-benchmarks-by-quarter-2019-2022.png\" alt=\"search advertising benchmarks by quarter, 2019-2022\" width=\"486\" height=\"829\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61158\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/search-advertising-benchmarks-by-quarter-2019-2022.png 486w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/search-advertising-benchmarks-by-quarter-2019-2022-480x819.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 486px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Most businesses have increased their advertising budgets.<\/strong> Compared to 2020 and early 2021, most advertisers have increased their digital advertising budgets in the past year as the economy recovered from initial pandemic conditions. Higher budgets lead to higher costs per acquisition. This is a trade-off most businesses are willing to make for a higher number of leads to grow their business.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The search space continues to be competitive. <\/strong>Search advertising puts businesses in front of consumers when they have the highest intent to purchase. In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brafton.com\/news\/89-percent-of-consumers-use-search-engines-for-purchase-decisions\/#:~:text=89%20percent%20of%20consumers%20use%20search%20engines%20for%20purchase%20decisions,-February%202%2C%202012&amp;text=Businesses%20looking%20to%20improve%20their,recent%20report%20from%20Fleishman%2DHillard.\">89%<\/a> of customers begin their buying process with a search engine. Its success rate as a paid channel is also what makes it so competitive. As more businesses use this channel, and as more businesses recovering from the pandemic return to this channel, advertisers have to bid higher to keep up.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The buying funnel is evolving. <\/strong>The overall trends also point to changes in search behavior. \u201cPeople search differently now than in years past,\u201d explains Stephanie Scanlan, Vice President of Client Success at LOCALiQ.<\/p>\n<p>\u200b\u200b\u201cThey know there is option and variety now so they do more searches and look across more options before making buying decisions.\u201d As a result, ads get more clicks but fewer conversions as people explore their options. This will lower conversion rate and drive up cost per lead over time.<br \/>\n<a id=\"monetization\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>The SERP is changing. <\/strong>Another potential factor contributing to higher click-through rates is that the SERPs for queries with less commercial intent have more ads now than in years past.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe've seen a trend toward more aggressive monetization of traditionally less commercial, more informational SERPs,\u201d said Elisa Gabbert, Director of Content and SEO at LOCALiQ. \u201cThis reduces organic CTR, and could lead to a situation where advertisers are getting high CTR but lower conversion rates, because the visitors don\u2019t always have conversion intent.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>None of these trends change the fact that search advertising is one of the highest ROI paid marketing channels there is, with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/30\/business-email-templates\">32% of marketers<\/a> naming paid search as their top performing marketing channel, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/19\/digital-marketing-statistics\">PPC typically returns $2 for every $1 spent<\/a>.
