Here are a few ideas:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Create a landing page:<\/strong> Use it to highlight customers who use your product creatively.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Host an awards event on social media:<\/strong> create several categories, and share the winners daily for a week.

Turn Reddit into a reliable source of referral traffic<\/h3>\n<p>Sometimes, the surprisingly successful way to get found online isn\u2019t a single ad or asset; it\u2019s an entire marketing channel. That was the case for<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/megan-janan-j-54232b215\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Megan Janan<\/a>, a marketing associate at<a href=\"https:\/\/www.whalesync.com\/\"> Whalesync<\/a>, who told me that Reddit is their top referral source, driving lots of traffic to their website.<\/p>\n<p>Now, marketing on Reddit isn\u2019t new; we\u2019ve researched and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/reddit-marketing\">written about it<\/a> several times. But it is notoriously hard to get a foothold on the platform. Redditors are quick to call out any overt marketing tactics. So when Megan told me about their success, I wanted to know how they achieved it.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cReddit works because it\u2019s quite BOFU [bottom of the funnel],\u201d Megan said.\u201dUsers are either searching for a solution or are frustrated and venting. That\u2019s when you can come in with your comment and solve their problem.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example Megan shared. A Redditor asked about entering custom formulas in a Notion document\u2014a challenge that Whalesync can solve.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/get-found-online-wordstream-reddit.webp\" alt=\"Get found online -Reddit discussion.,\" width=\"762\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92304 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/get-found-online-wordstream-reddit.webp 762w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/get-found-online-wordstream-reddit-480x378.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 762px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Notion\/comments\/uyt693\/comment\/mihrt4i\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>The reply came from a Whalesync employee. It added more context to other Redditors\u2019 suggestions and then provided a link to a post that dug in further.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a tough balance, but when done correctly, the benefits will compound. \u201cReddit works due to just the sheer amount of views you can get on a comment or thread, especially if you post in the right sub,\u201d Megan said. \u201cBut I personally view Reddit as quite \u2018evergreen,\u2019 so even though these posts are quite old, if people are searching for something similar, chances are they\u2019ll stumble on this Reddit thread and see our comment, and this can lead to referral traffic.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Megan said they look for questions that directly relate to their product, like connecting two apps together. But they also have to get creative and find tangential challenges that their product may be able to solve. In the example above, for instance, the user just wanted to add custom formulas in Notion, and connecting to Sheets was a possible solution. In any case, Megan said the goal is to find ways to \u201cunblock users.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>How can you make Whalesync\u2019s Reddit success your own?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Find relevant subreddits:<\/strong> Start broad and narrow to niche topics. If you\u2019re marketing a physical therapy practice, find healthcare subreddits, but also look for specific running or exercise threads.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Link to your content organically: <\/strong>Look for opportunities to link out to your educational content, but make sure it tightly aligns with the question being asked. And if you don\u2019t yet have a post that answers the question, there\u2019s your next content idea!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Think creatively when answering:<\/strong> If you have a popular product, Redditors are probably already discussing it, so you can simply join in. If your product isn\u2019t a hot topic yet, you\u2019ll need to help people see how your product solves problems in ways they hadn\u2019t considered.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"post-podcast-snippets-on-youtube-shorts\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Post podcast snippets on YouTube Shorts<\/h3>\n<ol start=\"5\"><\/ol>\n<p>Some of the most popular <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-make-youtube-shorts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube Shorts<\/a> ever feature speed cleaning a house, a transforming \u201cCinderella\u201d dress, and a tutorial to make your very own squishy ladybug toy.

If you have blog posts, video yourself explaining the same content and try it on YouTube Shorts, TikTok, etc.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Run intentional tests:<\/strong> Set specific goals for things like traffic or leads, and set a timeline to assess the results.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use AI:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/best-ai-tools\">AI tools<\/a> are great for things like summarizing content or quickly editing video.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"use-tiktok-in-unexpected-ways\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. Use TikTok in unexpected ways<\/h3>\n<p>Small family-owned businesses can sometimes struggle to get found online. They usually don\u2019t have deep pockets or a team of marketing pros planning out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/24\/editorial-calendar\">months&#8217; worth of social content<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/reginaldpowell\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reggie Powell<\/a>, a <a href=\"https:\/\/theresultsphase.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">freelance tech and HR writer<\/a>, has unearthed a superpower these mom-and-pop shops have that\u2019s hard for big businesses to replicate.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cConsidering all the noise and unedited AI slop on the internet, the authenticity a local business can deliver is the new driver of the conversation on social media,\u201d Reggie said.<\/p>\n<p>By way of example, he pointed to Amici\u2019s Pizza, a local restaurant in Mesa, Arizona. \u201cA small business like Amici\u2019s Pizza can\u2019t compete on budget,\u201d he noted. \u201cWhat they did, which was really smart, was to use their TikTok account to pull back the curtain on what it\u2019s like to run a small business.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/get-found-online-wordstream-amicis-tiktok.webp\" alt=\"Get found online - Amici's TikTok\" width=\"937\" height=\"594\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92306 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/get-found-online-wordstream-amicis-tiktok.webp 937w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/get-found-online-wordstream-amicis-tiktok-480x304.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@amici.pizza\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>In the videos, \u201cWe get to meet the crew, see the good and bad of a long day making pies, and get to know what it takes to run a mom-and-pop pizza restaurant,\u201d Reggie said. \u201cThat\u2019s how a small pizza shop in Mesa, Arizona, got over 300K followers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Amici\u2019s TikTok triumphs are astounding. The most popular video has over 10 million views. People travel from thousands of miles and line up out the door for a buffalo chicken pizza or a plate of rigatoni. Even the local press is sharing the shop&#8217;s social success.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/get-found-online-wordstream-amicis-press.webp\" alt=\"Get found online - News report on Amicis\" width=\"937\" height=\"643\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-92307 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/get-found-online-wordstream-amicis-press.webp 937w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/get-found-online-wordstream-amicis-press-480x329.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.azfamily.com\/2024\/12\/02\/mesa-pizza-shop-becomes-national-sensation-after-videos-go-viral-tiktok\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Reggie said the strategy, if you can call simply showing up as yourself a strategy, has real staying power. \u201cThey&#8217;ve become so successful because people feel like they know them,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey can identify with their struggles, and they can see what it actually takes to run a small business. This kind of real-life presentation will beat viral trends every time because authenticity doesn&#8217;t go away after a week.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If you run a small business, you can leverage the power of personal connection to grow a following on social media in the same way. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Share a day in the life:<\/strong> Capture the challenges, wins, and even the mundane parts of running your business.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Share the inside jokes<\/strong>: Every industry has funny phrases and recurring themes specific to it. Create some videos highlighting them.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Share your greatest creations:<\/strong> Whether it&#8217;s a mega-pepporoni pizza, a perfectly poured concrete patio, or a dazzling smile you helped create, let people see your best work and the process it took to get there.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>How do you get found online in 2025? Be weird<\/h2>\n<p>Great marketing has always been about getting attention. Some marketers will attempt to do that with pure scale, using AI to flood the feeds of potential customers.<\/p>\n<p>But the examples we\u2019ve seen here go a different direction. They\u2019re publishing unexpected content in new places. They\u2019re breaking patterns, stopping scrollers, and building sticky brands that people remember and want to return to.<\/p>\n<p>In 2025 and beyond, it\u2019ll be a lot harder to get found online by being the same, so try to be a bit weird and see what happens.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Want to stand out in a crowded marketing field?
