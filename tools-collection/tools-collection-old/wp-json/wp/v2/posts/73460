I&#8217;ve liked and used them since way back in 2017.\u00a0But DSA campaigns operate differently than regular search campaigns, and sometimes I see people get tripped up on best practices that cause them to decide DSA isn\u2019t useful.<\/p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s a shame because they can deliver great results&#8211;when used correctly. Especially when run alongside regular search campaigns. But there are some adjustments you need to make to ensure you\u2019re getting the most out of both campaign types.<\/p>\n<p>Since I\u2019m a big fan of DSA, I want to use this article to highlight what you need to know about Dynamic Search Ads to make sure you get the best results when running them.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m covering:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#definition\">What Dynamic Search Ads are<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#howto\">How to set up Dynamic Search Ads<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#tips\">5 ways to make DSAs work for you<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Let\u2019s dive in.<\/p>\n<div id=\"definition\"><\/div>\n<h2>What are Dynamic Search Ads and how are they different from regular search ads?<\/h2>\n<p>Unlike regular <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/optimize-search-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search ads<\/a>, which include campaigns built around specific keywords, Dynamic Search Ads use the content from your website to fill in the blanks with targeting and (some) ad copy creation.<\/p>\n<p>With Dynamic Search Ads, the search engine will respond to a relevant query with a chosen landing page from your website and automatically-generated ad copy that closely aligns with or matches the query.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/how-dynamic-search-ads-work.jpg\" alt=\"how dynamic search ads work\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-73470\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/how-dynamic-search-ads-work.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/how-dynamic-search-ads-work-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/2471185?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">According to Google<\/a>, this can help you identify relevant searches you may be missing with your regular search campaigns and can also help you keep your ads relevant to what people are searching for.<\/p>\n<div id=\"howto\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to set up Dynamic Search Ads<\/h2>\n<p>When I started writing and grabbing screenshots, I realized the setup process for a Dynamic Search Ads campaign has changed, at least in Google Ads.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how to set up Dynamic Search Ads in Google Ads.<\/p>\n<p>First, start by creating a new campaign and choosing your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-plan-goals-objectives-for-small-businesses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing goal<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-setup-page-google.jpg\" alt=\"how to set up dynamic search ads in google - choose campaign goal\" width=\"936\" height=\"474\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-73464\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-setup-page-google.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-setup-page-google-480x243.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Dynamic Search Ads campaigns are compatible with all <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/05\/types-of-google-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">campaign objectives<\/a> that are compatible with search, so that limits you to these goals in Google Ads:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sales<\/li>\n<li>Leads<\/li>\n<li>Website traffic<\/li>\n<li>Create a campaign without a goal\u2019s guidance<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Then choose the search network and finish setting up your campaign-level settings.<\/p>\n<p>Now this is where things get a little goofy.<\/p>\n<p>Nowhere in the guided setup is there the option to create anything related to Dynamic Search Ads.

Identify if your site is right for DSA campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>To be successful with Dynamic Search Ads, you have to make sure it\u2019s actually going to work for you. This is one of the few areas where I agree nearly perfectly with <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/2471185?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google\u2019s suggested best practices for DSA<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-best-practices-google.jpg\" alt=\"dynamic search ads best practices from google\" width=\"936\" height=\"447\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-73471\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-best-practices-google.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-best-practices-google-480x229.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The moral of the story for this is to make sure your website has lots of meaningful text that accurately describes your company, product, and services and can be seen by Google\u2019s algorithm.<\/p>\n<p>If your website has minimal wording, poor page title and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/meta-description\">meta descriptions<\/a>, or relies mostly on photos, you might want to rethink DSA as part of your advertising approach.<\/p>\n<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>Are you missing out on opportunities to optimize your Google Ads account?

Understand how Google\/Microsoft picks your URLs<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s very important for you to know how the different search platforms get the URLs that they use for your Dynamic Search Ads campaigns.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-url-to-use.jpg\" alt=\"dynamic search ads - choosing which url to use\" width=\"936\" height=\"434\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-73472\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-url-to-use.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-url-to-use-480x223.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll remember when you visited the settings tab in your incomplete campaign that you had a few options after adding in your website URL.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s go through each of these in a little more detail.<\/p>\n<h4>Use all URLs Google knows about plus Page Feeds<\/h4>\n<p>This will be the default option for any new DSA campaign and means that any page Google can find on your site is eligible to be used for an ad. While this might sound a little scary, it\u2019s usually pretty safe to utilize.<\/p>\n<p>Personally, if I opt into this, I like to make sure that I have a few pages excluded in my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/01\/dynamic-search-ads\">Dynamic Targets<\/a> within the campaigns:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>About Us<\/li>\n<li>Terms of Service<\/li>\n<li>Privacy Policy<\/li>\n<li>Any Client Only or Platform Pages on a SaaS Site<\/li>\n<li>Customer Service Pages<\/li>\n<li>Online Help Documentation<\/li>\n<li>Blog Pages<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This isn\u2019t an exhaustive list, but it should help you start thinking about which pages are or aren\u2019t the right fit for a new potential client to land on.<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re ready to exclude pages from your DSA campaigns, the process is pretty simple:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-negative-dynamic-ad-targets.jpg\" alt=\"negative dynamic ad targets option in dynamic search ads\" width=\"343\" height=\"468\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-73473\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-negative-dynamic-ad-targets.jpg 343w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-negative-dynamic-ad-targets-220x300.jpg 220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 343px) 100vw, 343px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Under Dynamic Ad Targets, you can create a Negative Dynamic Ad Target that gives you all the same controls as a regular ad target, but for exclusions rather than specific targeting.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-exact-urls.jpg\" alt=\"dynamic search ads - use exact urls option\" width=\"936\" height=\"286\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-73474\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-exact-urls.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-exact-urls-480x147.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Use whichever controls feel right for you to exclude the most pages as easily as possible, whether that\u2019s using Exact URLs or using rules to narrow down pages.<\/p>\n<h4>Use only URLs from a Page Feed<\/h4>\n<p>The second option, and one I typically like better, is using URLs only from <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/7166527?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Page Feeds<\/a> that you provide.<\/p>\n<p>A Page Feed is just a CSV upload of URLs on your site that you want to use for Dynamic Search Ads. You can include as many or as few webpages on your site as you like and then by selecting the second targeting option at the campaign level, Google will ONLY be able to use the pages in those page feeds for DSA campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>Creating a Page Feed is pretty simple. I like to start by getting a sitemap of my website, then pulling out all the URLs I don\u2019t want included. (Depending on how large your website is, this might be a completely insurmountable task and you would be better served using all URLs as a target and creating extensive, but powerful exclusion filters in the process mentioned above.)<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-create-page-feed.jpg\" alt=\"dynamic search ads - create page feed\" width=\"936\" height=\"457\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-73475\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-create-page-feed.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-create-page-feed-480x234.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re ready to upload your list, you head to the top navigation menu, select Business Data under Setup and be sure you\u2019re on the Data Feeds page in the left-hand navigation.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-create-page-feed-tab.jpg\" alt=\"dynamic search ads page feed option\" width=\"486\" height=\"428\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-73476\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-create-page-feed-tab.jpg 486w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-create-page-feed-tab-480x423.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 486px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>From there, just click the blue \u201c+\u201d button, select Page Feed, and follow the instructions for uploading.<\/p>\n<p>The main thing to remember for your URL source is that Google will show whatever it wants within any list of URLs you\u2019ve given permission for.<\/p>\n<p>If you have pages on your site that should NOT be used for DSA, make sure you either have them excluded through Negative Dynamic Ad Targets or change your permission list to only Page Feeds and leave those URLs out of those lists.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Know how ad copy is generated for DSA campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>Unlike regular <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/search-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search ads<\/a>, Dynamic Search Ads only allow advertisers to input a portion of the ad copy: the two description lines.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-descriptions.jpg\" alt=\"dynamic search ads - expanded DSA option\" width=\"599\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-73477\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-descriptions.jpg 599w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-descriptions-480x479.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 599px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here, it\u2019s important to make sure you\u2019re sharing information with your potential customers that&#8217;s relevant, impactful, and compelling. Just like all other ads.<\/p>\n<p>But this also means that Google is making up some of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/03\/ad-copy-examples\">ad copy<\/a> for you, namely, the headlines associated with your ads.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-google-headlines-and-landing-pages.jpg\" alt=\"ad copy created by google in dynamic search ads\" width=\"936\" height=\"340\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-73478\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-google-headlines-and-landing-pages.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-google-headlines-and-landing-pages-480x174.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The good news is that you can review the headline copy Google is using for your ads. You just need to navigate to the Search Terms report under Dynamic Ad Targets, and while you can\u2019t make any specific adjustments, you can see the search terms and the headlines and landing pages Google used for your ads.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the screenshot above is for a live client account, so it has to be blurred out, as does the image below, but I want to show you where the headlines used for DSA ads usually come from.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-page-source.jpg\" alt=\"view page source\" width=\"615\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-73479\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-page-source.jpg 615w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-page-source-480x468.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 615px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If I navigate to the page associated with the search term and right-click, then View Page Source, I can see the code of the page.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-page-title-in-code.jpg\" alt=\"shows how meta title of page matches to dynamic search ads headline\" width=\"910\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-73480\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-page-title-in-code.jpg 910w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-page-title-in-code-480x315.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 910px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In that code, I find the page &lt;title&gt; and what do you know\u2026it matches up.<\/p>\n<p>Now, that\u2019s not to say that it will <em>always<\/em> match up, but more often than not, if you run DSA campaigns, you\u2019ll notice that the headlines Google uses are pretty close (if not identical) to the meta title or other meta information on your page. So keep a close eye on how your headlines look and, if needed, maybe think about tweaking the page titles to better suit your ads. (That\u2019s assuming your company\u2019s SEO team doesn\u2019t yell at you for it.)<\/p>\n<h3>4. Take steps to prevent cannibalization<\/h3>\n<p>One of the stated goals of Dynamic Search Ads is to find new queries outside of your existing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords\">keywords<\/a>. In fact, it\u2019s part of their Benefits section.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-prevent-cannibalization.jpg\" alt=\"dynamic search ads benefits from google\" width=\"936\" height=\"567\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-73481\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-prevent-cannibalization.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-prevent-cannibalization-480x291.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But here\u2019s the thing, that might sound nice in principle, but it\u2019s not how things always work in reality.<\/p>\n<p>In the majority of accounts I see running DSA and search campaigns, DSA is targeting many of the same search terms as the other campaign\u2019s keywords. This is supposed to be prevented from happening, according to Google, but it still does. And very, very frequently.<\/p>\n<p>The good news is that there\u2019s a very easy fix for this.<\/p>\n<p>Each time I launch a DSA campaign, I take all of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/exact-match\">Exact match<\/a> (and sometimes Phrase match) keywords from the existing search campaigns and add them all into a single <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/06\/negative-keyword-guide\">Negative Keyword List<\/a>. I then apply that list to ONLY the DSA campaign, ensuring that none of my existing keywords can be targeted in that campaign.<\/p>\n<p>It may sound a bit strange and some Google reps might tell you it\u2019s not needed, but trust me, you\u2019ll thank yourself for having much cleaner search terms reports later.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Add negative keywords<\/h3>\n<p>My last note might not be groundbreaking for many of you, but for some, this will be news.<\/p>\n<p>Just because you\u2019re not using keywords as your targeting method does NOT mean that you can\u2019t use negative keywords in DSA campaigns.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-add-negative-search-terms.jpg\" alt=\"how to add negative keywords in dynamic search ads\" width=\"419\" height=\"490\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-73482\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-add-negative-search-terms.jpg 419w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/dynamic-search-ads-add-negative-search-terms-257x300.jpg 257w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 419px) 100vw, 419px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Just like a regular search ads campaign, you can view the search terms in your Search Terms report, under Keywords, and add negatives as you see fit.<\/p>\n<h2>Make the most of Dynamic Search Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Dynamic Search Ads are still one of my favorite types of campaigns to use for full search advertising coverage, but they can be a bit finicky and require some attention to details not needed for regular search ads.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here are those five tips for effective Dynamic Search Ads:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Identify if your site is right for DSA campaigns<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Understand how Google\/Microsoft picks your URLs<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Know how ad copy is generated for DSA campaigns<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Take steps to prevent cannibalization<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Add negative keywords<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Hopefully, this article helps you make the most of your DSA campaigns by making sure you have the right setup and expectations on performance.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Did you know Dynamic Search Ads can help you capitalize on new opportunities and search queries to drive more leads?
