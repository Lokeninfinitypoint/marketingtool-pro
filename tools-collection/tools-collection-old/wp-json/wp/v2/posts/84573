This Privacy Sandbox project is the reason Google was originally going to phase out third-party cookies (in favor of first party data) in the second half of 2024.<\/p>\n<p>Moving forward, however, <strong>Google will be keeping third-party cookies<\/strong>. Instead, the platform will offer \u201copt in\/opt out\u201d options to Google Chrome users so they\u2019re able to make choices and adjustments to their web browsing tracking preferences.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the main statement from Google:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Instead of deprecating third-party cookies, we would introduce a new experience in Chrome that lets people make an informed choice that applies across their web browsing, and they\u2019d be able to adjust that choice at any time.

We&#8217;ll continue to make the Privacy Sandbox APIs available and invest in them to further improve privacy and utility.

At the same time, we recognize this transition requires significant work by many participants and will have an impact on publishers, advertisers, and everyone involved in online advertising,\u201d said Anthony.<\/p>\n<p>And some advertisers agree\u2014anything could be better than the sunset of third-party cookies. For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/SeoTudent\/status\/1815492760956493918\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this X post<\/a> below acknowledges that third-party cookie deprecation would have put a ton of businesses out of business.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/google-ads-no-longer-deprecating-third-party-cookies-x.webp\" alt=\"google ads privacy sandbox update - third-party cookie deprecation reaction\" width=\"597\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84580 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/google-ads-no-longer-deprecating-third-party-cookies-x.webp 597w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/google-ads-no-longer-deprecating-third-party-cookies-x-480x482.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 597px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But if you feel like you\u2019ve dedicated a lot of work to prepare for a cookie-less future, you\u2019re not alone.
