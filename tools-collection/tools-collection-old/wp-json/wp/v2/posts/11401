But, far too often, meetings are long, boring, or missing a clear purpose. What\u2019s more, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a shift in how many companies conduct meetings from afar.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-meetings-graph-1.jpg\" alt=\"graph indicating the surge of virtual work during COVID-19\" width=\"736\" height=\"381\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/microsoft-365\/blog\/2020\/04\/09\/remote-work-trend-report-meetings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>The good news, however, is best practices for marketing meetings are largely the same, whether they\u2019re in-person or virtual. Here\u2019s a closer look at precisely what steps to take to make sure your marketing meeting is effective and engaging\u2014so that you can ensure no one ever wishes your meeting was an email instead.<\/p>\n<h2>Tips for all marketing meetings<\/h2>\n<p>The first set of tips here will make all your marketing meetings more successful\u2014whether they\u2019re in person, online, or have mixed attendance.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Figure out who should be there<\/h3>\n<p>According to Lee Gimpel, founder of Better Meetings, a meeting design, facilitation, and training firm, one of the first steps in planning an effective meeting is to invite the right people. The ideal scenario includes the necessary decision-makers but does not cast such a wide net it ropes in individuals who don\u2019t really need to be there and wastes their time\u2014and company resources.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThink about sending invitations to a meeting like packing for a trip,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we pack for a trip, we lay out what we think we need and then we\u2019re instructed to ruthlessly cut out what we won\u2019t really need and what\u2019s duplicative with what we already have. The same goes for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/08\/client-meetings\">effective meetings<\/a>: Extra weight in the room will just serve to slow you down.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In addition, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/11\/amazon-advertising\">Amazon<\/a>\u2019s infamous two-pizza rule\u2014in which meetings never have more people than can be fed by two pizzas\u2014you should limit the number of participants to around five to ten, said Vince Fishbone, head of marketing at Kingpin Private Browser.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-meetings-two-pizza-rule.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon's two-pizza rule\" width=\"638\" height=\"359\" \/><\/div>\n<p>At the same time, Sam Harrison, Author of\u00a0<em>Creative Zing<\/em>,\u00a0<em>IdeaSpotting<\/em>, and\u00a0<em>IdeaSelling<\/em>, said to ensure invitees are diverse in terms of age, gender, talents, job levels, and backgrounds to elicit a range of perspectives.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe same old people keep coming up with the same old ideas,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Determine the meeting\u2019s purpose<\/h3>\n<p>Another early step is to figure out the purpose of your meeting. That, of course, helps avoid the dreaded meeting that could have been an email instead.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA classic pitfall of marketing meetings is to stuff them full of things to discuss and decide,\u201d Gimpel said. \u201cIn trying to cover a dozen things, none of them are given the time they really need or deserve \u2026 but if you pare back and focus on what\u2019s really important, it\u2019ll give you a more realistic meeting and a better chance at walking away thinking you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/16\/spend-less-time-in-google-ads\">spent your time effectively<\/a>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Establishing a purpose can help eliminate unnecessary recurring meetings, too.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor example, weekly status is not a purpose, it is an occasion and usually turns into a boring checklist of people&#8217;s to-do lists,\u201d said Maria Vorovich, founder of the consultancy Goodques.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-meetings-invite-with-purpose_0.jpg\" alt=\"example invite for a marketing meeting\" width=\"754\" height=\"259\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>An old example of a great meeting invite. All the facts, including the purpose.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>And, after you\u2019ve identified your meeting purpose, make sure attendees know what it is beforehand.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNote whether the purpose of the topic is to share information, seek input for a decision, or make a decision,\u201d said digital marketing strategist Muhammad Mateen Khan. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for team members to participate effectively if they don\u2019t know whether to simply listen, give their input, or be part of the decision-making process.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>3. State the meeting\u2019s goals<\/h3>\n<p>In order to have effective meetings, Gimpel said you also have to explicitly state your goals for a given meeting beyond the initial purpose. Here&#8217;s how he put it:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t know why you\u2019re meeting, it\u2019s hard to know if your time was well-spent or not. Just jotting down a simple statement at the top of your agenda or in your calendar invitation can go a long way.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This also helps attendees prepare\u2014and it helps the meeting stay focused.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI had found, after who knows how many meetings, it wasn&#8217;t always clear why we were meeting,\u201d said Neal Taparia, cofounder of business incubator SOTA Partners. \u201cNow, before every meeting, it must be stated in the invite the goal and action item of the meeting. For example, on a recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/search-engine-marketing\">SEM<\/a> campaign, we needed to understand why changes to our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/14\/ppc-ad-copywriting\">ad copy<\/a> did not improve click-through and our stated goal was to diagnose this issue\u00a0and solve it.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>4. Prepare an agenda<\/h3>\n<p>And, of course, once you have a purpose and goals, you need to set an agenda, which Gimpel said to think of as a plan for how a meeting will meet its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/15\/marketing-objectives\">objectives<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>When determining items to discuss, Domantas Gudeliauskas, marketing manager at website builder Zyro, said to make sure they directly relate to KPIs.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis helps keep focus and aims at actionable discussions that impact performance,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-meetings-agenda-meme.jpg\" alt=\"marketing meeting agenda meme\" width=\"271\" height=\"300\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Afton Brazzoni, founder of marketing and communications studio Scribe National, also recommends asking attendees if they have anything to contribute to the agenda ahead of time.<\/p>\n<p>Mateen Khan said you can even list agenda topics as questions for attendees to answer.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA question enables team members to better prepare for the discussion and to monitor whether their own and others\u2019 activities are on track,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Biland Sadek, regional commercial director for MEA and duty-free at tobacco company Philip Morris International, is also an advocate of the question method to maximize meeting effectiveness.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor example, instead of a general topic like \u2018Miscellaneous Updates,\u2019 I will try changing it to \u2018What key pieces of information do each of you have to share or need from one another?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cPreparing these questions before the meeting will make it easier to determine who should attend and how much time is needed. This approach to our agenda can bring focus, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/24\/facebook-engagement\">engagement<\/a>, and better performance to our meetings.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In terms of structure, Nate Nead, CEO\u00a0of content marketing and link-building firm SEO.co, said he likes the Entrepreneurial\u00a0Operating System&#8217;s Level 10 meeting structure popularized in Gino Wickman&#8217;s\u00a0book <em>Traction<\/em>.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/FDkKzqi8pK0?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>This, he said, ensures the meeting stays focused on items that are most relevant to the higher-level goals of the organization.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPerhaps my favorite aspect of the Level 10 meeting process is the fact that it follows the mantra, \u2018When performance is measured, performance improves. When performance is measured and reported back, the rate of improvement accelerates,\u2019\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Share the agenda early<\/h3>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve prepared the meeting agenda, circulate it to attendees with enough time for review.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDistribute the agenda \u2026 so the team can read background materials and prepare their initial thoughts for each agenda item ahead of time,\u201d Mateen Khan said.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Spencer Grover, senior product marketing manager at sales onboarding and training software LevelJump, said this helps prevent wasted time getting everyone in the room on the same page.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, this advanced distribution strategy allows for feedback from attendees prior to the meeting, Brazzoni said.<\/p>\n<p>It also allows attendees to submit their own topics and promotes more interactive meetings, said Angela Ash, digital marketing specialist at commercial real estate sales platform UpFlip. Even more, she explained:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThis gives everyone the feeling of actually being invested in the discussions that take place.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This is especially important if attendees need to present <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/14\/marketing-data\">data<\/a>, which is necessary in lots of marketing meetings.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe can&#8217;t analyze results without the metrics,\u201d said Tom De Spiegelaere, founder of affiliate marketing firm Tom Spicky. \u201cYour team should be ready to present data such as conversion rates, search engine rankings, leads generated, and other vital info.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>6. Appoint a facilitator<\/h3>\n<p>At some point, you\u2019ll also have to figure out who is going to lead the meeting. Ideally, that person has good processing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/17\/digital-marketing-skills\">skills<\/a> and will be able to call on attendees when more than one person wants to speak, according to business profitability expert Shel Horowitz.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Mateen Khan said the meeting host should identify who is responsible for leading each agenda topic.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone other than the formal meeting leader is often responsible for leading the discussion of a particular agenda item,\u201d he said. \u201cThis person may be providing context for the topic, explaining data, or may have organizational responsibility for that area.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>7. Rethink long meeting<\/h3>\n<p>This is key for marketing meetings: You should always strive to schedule the shortest meeting possible. Perhaps most importantly, that helps prevent attendees from getting bored or, worse, frustrated.<\/p>\n<p>Craig Griffiths, director of internet marketing company SearchUp, pointed to Parkinson\u2019s Law, which states, \u201cWork expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In other words, if you schedule two hours, attendees will inevitably find things to talk about to fill that time regardless of how relevant and helpful they are.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-meetings-parkinsons-law.jpg\" alt=\"Parkinson's Law\" width=\"480\" height=\"377\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cSetting shorter meetings, such as 30 minutes, means you&#8217;ll focus on the most important things due to the added time pressure,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>You can start by assigning realistic time estimates for each agenda item.<\/p>\n<p>This helps the meeting planner calculate how much time is needed overall and also allows attendees to adapt their comments to fit the time allotted\u2014or to suggest more time is needed, Mateen Khan said.<\/p>\n<p>During the meeting, Horowitz said the facilitator should appoint a timekeeper, who notifies the room when time for a given topic is up. \u201cIf the item is incomplete, attendees should vote on whether to give it a few more minutes immediately, return to it after other items or cut off the discussion,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>That also means if anyone starts talking off-topic, the facilitator can step in to get the conversation back on track.<\/p>\n<p>If, however, a meeting is unavoidably long, Horowitz said to incorporate some kind of stretching break at intervals, like every 30 to 40 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>And when it comes to the time of day, Brazzoni said to avoid lunch meetings\u2014but, if you can\u2019t, either provide food or allow attendees to bring their lunches.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt&#8217;s no fun wondering and being hungry\u2014and also doesn&#8217;t make for good productivity,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Include time for brainstorming<\/h3>\n<p>Marketing meeting agendas in particular should also incorporate time for<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/03\/brainstorming-techniques\"> brainstorming<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This, said Morgan Taylor, CMO of financial services firm LetMeBank, allows attendees to share ideas and feedback.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou never know when a different viewpoint will make something obvious that everyone else missed,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/brainstorming-techniques-established-groups_0.jpg\" alt=\"brainstorming-techniques-familiarity\" width=\"634\" height=\"423\" \/><\/div>\n<p>But it should also include time for attendees to gather their thoughts.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve all been in the same meeting where a handful of people sit around a table and someone asks the group for thoughts or ideas. And we\u2019ve all seen how just asking a room of people to throw out ideas often produces lackluster results,\u201d Gimpel said. \u201cA really simple tweak is to ask people to spend a minute\u2014truly 60 seconds\u2014jotting some ideas on their own first and then sharing with the group.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This moment of reflection typically results in more\u2014and better quality\u2014ideas than simply opening up the floor and watching what spills out, he added.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Set up equipment ahead of time<\/h3>\n<p>This tip is simple, and it probably isn&#8217;t a surprise to any of us. We\u2019ve all likely been in meetings in which we had to sit around and wait because of technical difficulties. Instead, Brazzoni said to make sure whoever is running the meeting arrives early to set up the necessary equipment so the meeting can start on time.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Make sure slides are legible<\/h3>\n<p>Also, remember slides with text can be hard to read\u2014and trying to read slides is a distraction for your audience.<\/p>\n<p>Taparia\u2019s recommendation is to cap slides at 60 words apiece.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe found\u00a0that when talking through marketing slides, no one would read all the text on the slide. When you do, you oftentimes don&#8217;t listen to the presenter,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we make\u00a0sure that slides have limited text, and are focused on visuals, leading to a more engaged audience.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>11. Set next steps before the meetings ends<\/h3>\n<p>In addition to purpose, goals, and an agenda, each meeting should have an action plan by the end.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of meetings steal defeat from the jaws of victory as things seem to be going along great and then the meeting just ends without a concrete plan about who\u2019s going to do what,\u201d Gimpel said. \u201cAs a cheat, you can add a section for action items at the end of the agenda as a reminder that the meeting isn\u2019t over until you\u2019ve actually made a decision or delegated tasks.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>An added benefit is accountability for attendees because everyone knows who is supposed to do what.<\/p>\n<p>Andrew Lamping, CEO of social media marketing agency Cyclone Social, even recommends attendees explain their action items at the end of the meeting.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/U1wuCLdyxJs?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t [establish an action plan], you will find you are talking about the same issues you covered in the last meeting, arriving at the same conclusions, wondering why nothing ever gets implemented,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cA marketing meeting without an action plan is just a friendly get-together.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Tips for better virtual marketing meetings<\/h2>\n<p>While best practices for virtual meetings include all of the above, there are a few additional tips to ensure success.<\/p>\n<h3>12. Turn on cameras<\/h3>\n<p>For starters, encourage\u2014or even mandate\u2014attendees to turn on their cameras.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt&#8217;s better when you can see people,\u201d Grover said.<\/p>\n<p>Allie Danziger, president of Integrate Agency, said she even sends reminders so attendees will be prepared to be on camera.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-meetings-virtual-meeting-with-cameras.jpg\" alt=\"example image of a virtual marketing meeting\" width=\"715\" height=\"477\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In addition, Syed Irfan Ajmal, founder and managing director of digital marketing and e-learning firm SIA Enterprises, said this helps maintain meeting norms.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you are invited to a meeting, you can\u2019t just show up in your pjs,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to understand the rules and responsibilities \u2026 [it] is the key to effective meetings.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And, said Norhanie Pangulima, a content ambassador at relationship site Hernorm, it helps the meeting planner gauge reactions and maximize <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/21\/client-communication-during-covid-19\">communication<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>13. Look at the camera<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s also important to make eye contact in virtual meetings by looking directly into the camera as often as possible, Sadek said.<\/p>\n<h3>14. Mute yourself<\/h3>\n<p>Because the facilitator\u2019s job is somewhat different in a virtual room and it can be hard to hear with multiple attendees speaking at once\u2014or even with background noise\u2014Brazzoni said another best practice to mute yourself if you&#8217;re not talking.<\/p>\n<h3>15. Avoid multitasking<\/h3>\n<p>And despite the temptation to check your inbox, Slack, or your phone, Amir Shahzeidi, digital marketing manager at video-on-demand platform Uscreen, said to avoid multitasking during virtual meetings because it can break the flow of conversation and you could miss out on important information.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt&#8217;s extremely important to avoid multitasking on video calls,\u201d he said. \u201cListen to your team. And share your input.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>16. Take advantage of technology platforms<\/h3>\n<p>There are also tons of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/04\/tech-stack\">technology<\/a> to help virtual meetings run smoothly.<\/p>\n<p>An online work management tool, such as Asana, can help put marketing pipelines and meetings together, for example.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI love Asana for keeping our projects organized and on track and\u00a0it\u2019s easy to use a work management tool to manage status check-in meetings or daily standups,\u201d said Erik Rivera, CEO of online mental health platform ThriveTalk. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to set an agenda if you\u2019re already familiar with the workflow tool you\u2019re using and the projects on it\u2014just use the list, board, team member, or other view you prefer as an agenda to go over projects in the marketing pipeline.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Shahzeidi recommended online collaboration boards.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe use [collaborative whiteboarding platform] Miro for virtual collaborations, it allows everyone to collaborate and brainstorm, from wireframing a new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/01\/homepage-design\">page design<\/a> to content marketing planning and team management,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the popular video communication platform Zoom, Sadek suggested using breakout rooms on Zoom to make virtual meetings more interactive.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/DYu_bGbZiiQ?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>\u201c[They] enable you to instantaneously beam small groups into their own virtual chat rooms before bringing everyone back to the overall meeting with a click of the mouse,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<h3>17. Use password-enabled meeting rooms<\/h3>\n<p>You should also conduct virtual meetings in password-enabled meeting rooms.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere are already countless reports of hackers getting into virtual meetings of remote teams,\u201d said James Miller, CMO of the online publication Minuteman Review. \u201cAs such, organizations must only use password-enabled sessions for each meeting to increase security levels. Otherwise, marketing teams are risking their privacy by boldly doing unprotected sessions inside online meeting rooms\u2014where sensitive and confidential information might get leaked.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>18. Record virtual meetings.<\/h3>\n<p>And one advantage to virtual meetings is they are easy to record\u2014and marketers probably should.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-meetings-virtual-meeting-record.jpg\" alt=\"record option for a virtual marketing meeting on Zoom\" width=\"817\" height=\"448\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>You can record easily on Zoom and other platforms.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs a manager, this will help you to get better in conducting your meetings more efficiently while inspiring your team more and more,\u201d said Joaquim Miro, founding partner and chief growth officer at social VR application Hoppin World. \u201cIt also keeps you and the team more accountable.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Agnieszka Kasperek, CMO of project management and automation tool Taskeo.co, agreed digital copies of not just recordings but also notes, files, and screenshots, can help make your marketing meetings more efficient.<\/p>\n<p>Just be sure to let all attendees know ahead of time that you\u2019re planning to record the session, and make sure to share how it\u2019ll be viewed and accessed.<\/p>\n<h3>19. Have a meeting about meetings<\/h3>\n<p>Finally, when it comes to both in-person and virtual meetings alike, you may want to take a step back and have a meeting about meetings to survey your own marketing meeting landscape.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s according to Ethan Taub, CEO of financial institutions Goalry and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.loanry.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Loanry<\/a>, who said it helps figure out whether to keep an existing meeting, cut it, or combine it with another.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis one meeting may take an hour or so, but it will cut off many hours from other meetings,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s advisable to rerun this meeting every six months to deal with the creep of more\/other meetings in that time.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Let&#8217;s face it: Marketing meetings aren&#8217;t always effective.
