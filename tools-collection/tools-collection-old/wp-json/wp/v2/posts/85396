To truly optimize your efforts and maximize your return on investment (ROI), you need to leverage the powerful reporting tools that Google Ads offers. These reports provide invaluable insights into various aspects of your campaigns, helping you make data-driven decisions to refine your strategies.<\/p>\n<p>In this guide, we&#8217;ll explore some of the most essential Google Ads reports that can significantly impact your campaign success.<\/p>\n<h3>Contents<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#search-terms-report\">Search terms report<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#call-reporting\">Call reporting<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ad-performance-report\">Ad Performance Report<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#distance-report\">Distance report<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#audience-performance-report\">Audience Performance report<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div id=\"search-terms-report\"><\/div>\n<h2>Search terms report<\/h2>\n<p>The search terms report in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-query-matching-updates\">Google Ads<\/a> is essential for keyword optimization. This report goes beyond the keywords you initially selected, revealing the actual search queries that trigger your ads. You can use this to refine and optimize your keywords in a couple of different ways.<\/p>\n<h3>Refine your keywords<\/h3>\n<p>By analyzing the data in the search terms report, you can discover valuable insights, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>High-performing keywords you might have missed:<\/strong> Unearth keywords that are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/21\/google-ads-not-converting\">driving conversions<\/a> but weren&#8217;t explicitly included in your initial list.<\/li>\n<li><strong>New keyword ideas:<\/strong> Gain inspiration for expanding your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/03\/13\/ppc-keyword-maintenance-tasks\">keyword strategy<\/a> to reach a wider relevant audience.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>With these insights, you can refine your keyword list to ensure your ads are shown to a more relevant audience, maximizing the effectiveness of your campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 <strong>Want a true picture of Google Ads performance?<\/strong> Find out with a free, instant audit &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\">Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Find and exclude negative keywords<\/h3>\n<p>Equally important is the ability to identify <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/06\/negative-keyword-guide\">negative keywords<\/a>. These are terms that you <strong>do not<\/strong> want your ads to trigger for, preventing <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/google-ads-spend\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wasted ad spend<\/a> on irrelevant traffic. The search terms report allows you to easily find these irrelevant search terms.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how it benefits your campaigns:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improved ad relevance and ROI:<\/strong> By adding negative keywords, you filter out unqualified traffic that is unlikely to convert. This focuses your budget on more relevant searches, increasing the return on your ad investment.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Boosted click-through rate (CTR) and Quality Score:<\/strong> Negative keywords ensure your ads are shown to a more targeted audience, leading to a higher click-through rate (CTR) and a better <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/19\/does-quality-score-still-matter\">Quality Score<\/a>. This ultimately translates to:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Higher conversion rates:<\/strong> A more targeted audience means more qualified leads, increasing the likelihood of conversions.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Improved ROI:<\/strong> By focusing on relevant searches and conversions, you achieve a better return on your overall ad spend.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/search-terms-report-negative-keywords.webp\" alt=\"search terms report for negative keywords video tutorial\" width=\"858\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85399\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/search-terms-report-negative-keywords.webp 858w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/search-terms-report-negative-keywords-480x335.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 858px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>I walk through how to use this report to add negative keywords <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7dIAlItL5ZY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in this video<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd0e <strong>Need help finding the right keywords?<\/strong> Try our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"call-reporting\"><\/div>\n<h2>Call reporting<\/h2>\n<p>For businesses that rely on phone calls, call reporting in Google Ads is an essential tool. This report goes beyond impressions and clicks, providing valuable insights into the performance of your call extensions. With call reporting, you can track key metrics like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Call length:<\/strong> See how long callers are typically engaged on the phone with your business.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Call time:<\/strong> Understand when calls are most frequent, allowing you to optimize campaign scheduling.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Call outcomes:<\/strong> Identify whether calls are connected, missed, or automatically directed to voicemail.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-call-details-report.webp\" alt=\"google ads call details report example\" width=\"844\" height=\"382\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-call-details-report.webp 844w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/google-ads-call-details-report-480x217.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 844px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>By analyzing this data, you can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Optimize your call extensions:<\/strong> Refine your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/10\/06\/google-adwords-call-extensions\">call extensions<\/a> to ensure clarity and encourage more qualified calls.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Adjust your bidding strategy:<\/strong> Focus your budget on times and keywords that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/10\/25\/google-ads-call-conversions\">generate the most valuable calls<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Drive valuable phone leads:<\/strong> Identify what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not to ensure you&#8217;re attracting high-quality leads through phone inquiries.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This is particularly useful for service-based businesses where phone interactions are a crucial part of the sales process. Analyzing call data allows you to streamline the phone experience for both you and your potential customers.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, for added convenience, call reporting can be exported to various formats like CSV or Excel. This allows you to easily share the data with colleagues or integrate it with other reporting tools. Additionally, reports can be saved within Google Ads for easy access by other authorized users within your account.<\/p>\n<p>And for even deeper analysis, you can even add relevant keywords to your call reporting. By including keywords that triggered your ads, you can see which terms are driving the most calls and optimize your campaigns accordingly. This additional layer of insight can help you identify high-performing keywords that generate valuable phone leads.<\/p>\n<div id=\"ad-performance-report\"><\/div>\n<h2>Ad Performance Report<\/h2>\n<p>The Ad Performance Report is a powerful tool in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ad-grants\">Google Ads<\/a> that helps you understand how your campaigns are performing.
