We\u2019ll get to more on this shortly.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"b42fdbe0-35d6-448b-937d-b5ea7d9eb75c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/freelancers-guide-to-taxes-savings-jar.jpg\" alt=\"Freelancer's guide to taxes money in a Mason jar\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1599\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Not sure what kind of savings account is right for you?

This will change depending on how much you earn, as well as the deductions for which you\u2019re eligible.<\/p>\n<p>Basically, virtually every aspect of paying taxes as a freelancer depends on dozens of variables and personal circumstances. Awesome, right?<\/p>\n<p>Not really.<\/p>\n<h2>Paying Quarterly Estimates as a Freelancer<\/h2>\n<p>Remember when we talked about how freelancers are on the hook for setting aside money to pay their own taxes?<\/p>\n<p>Most independent contractors and self-employed individuals are expected to pay what is known as quarterly estimates to the IRS four times per year. I say \u201cmost\u201d because \u2013 helpfully! \u2013 there are some exceptions.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you\u2019re expecting to owe less than $1,000 in taxes for the fiscal year after income tax withholding (income that is subject to automatic withholding of taxes, such as salaried earnings), you don\u2019t need to file quarterly estimates. Similarly, if your income tax withholding meets or exceeds 90% of your tax liability for that fiscal year, you don\u2019t have to make quarterly estimate payments.

Late fees will also vary depending on how much you owe and how late your payment is.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not your mom, so I\u2019m not going to tell you how to run your business. All I\u2019ll say is that personally, I find maintaining two separate checking accounts works best; one for \u201cregular\u201d stuff like food and shelter and other things in Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs, and another solely for quarterly estimates.<\/p>\n<h2>What Can I Write Off as Tax Deductions as a Freelancer?<\/h2>\n<p>A few years ago, I read an amazing story on a message board about an attorney who worked in Baltimore, Maryland. In addition to his regular office, this guy claimed to have bought a fax machine, installed it on his modest yacht, and wrote the entire thing \u2013 including the boat \u2013 off as a tax deduction because the addition of the fax machine allowed him to claim the yacht as \u201coffice space.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6123edeb-f8ca-49e5-9c02-2aaf0dfa2010\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/freelancers-guide-to-taxes-home-office-yacht.jpg\" alt=\"Freelancer's guide to taxes home office on a yacht\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>My kinda workspace.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Honestly, I don\u2019t particularly care whether the story is true. It could go either way, really. What I love about this story is that people try to pull this stuff all the time, well-intentioned or otherwise. There have been some truly hilarious and bizarre write-offs over the years, many of which were successfully upheld in tax court after initial rulings to the contrary by the IRS. However, knowing exactly what you can and cannot claim as a deduction is tricky.<\/p>\n<h3>How Tax Deductions Work for Freelancers<\/h3>\n<p>People tend to get excited about tax deductions, and for good reason \u2013 but what are they?<\/p>\n<p>Tax deductions are itemized reductions in the total amount of taxable income a person earns in a year.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you earn $40,000 per year and claimed no deductions. In this example, the IRS would expect you to pay taxes on the entirety of that $40,000. Now let\u2019s say that you\u2019re a freelancer earning $40,000 per year and pay for your own private health insurance, which costs $5,000 per year. Because you can deduct (or \u201cwrite off\u201d the expense, to use a common expression) the entirety of private health insurance costs, this means the IRS would only expect you to pay taxes on $35,000.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing you need to know about deductions as a freelancer is that most deductions are submitted as part of a form known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-pdf\/f1040sc.pdf\">Schedule C Form 1040<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d5d657e6-bb51-4f96-8d6f-116dae0fda91\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/freelancers-guide-to-taxes-schedule-c-form-1040.png\" alt=\"Freelancer's guide to taxes IRS Schedule C Form 1040\" width=\"749\" height=\"284\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Schedule C Form 1040 in all its glory<\/em><\/p>\n<p>As with virtually everything relating to the American taxation system, there are few hard-and-fast rules regarding deductions \u2013 almost everything has caveats attached.<\/p>\n<p>Take home offices, for instance. You can write off certain expenses as deductions, but for a home office to be a valid deduction, you need to use your workspace exclusively for business purposes. This means your workspace must be dedicated solely to work; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/home-office-deduction\">you can\u2019t write off a portion of your mortgage or rent if you work from your kitchen table<\/a>, for example.

The IRS allows freelancers and self-employed individuals to deduct up to 50% of meal expenses if they were for legitimate business purposes (think meeting a potential client for lunch), but trying to deduct more than that could flag you for an audit.<\/p>\n<h3>Business Expenses That Freelancers Can Deduct<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019ve established that everything with the IRS is conditional and that only some expenses can be deducted \u2013 but what, specifically, can you deduct in the first place? Below is a summary of the kinds of expenses you can legitimately deduct as an independent contractor (with relevant caveats).<\/p>\n<p>For the sake of ease, assume that any and all of the costs below are subject to the IRS\u2019 determinations, including the percentage of these costs that can be deducted.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Travel and accommodation<\/strong>: If you travel for work, you can deduct at least some of your travel and accommodation costs as business expenses. This includes costs related to flights, cabs\/ride-hail services, train fares, car rentals, and hotel\/motel rooms.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Meals<\/strong>: As noted above, a portion of meal expenses incurred for business reasons are deductible in many circumstances.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Website costs<\/strong>: Expenses associated with maintaining your online presence \u2013 including website hosting fees and domain registrations \u2013 are deductible.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Vehicle maintenance and mileage<\/strong>: If you use a personal vehicle for your business, you can deduct some of the expenses related to vehicle maintenance such as wear and tear on your vehicle, as well as some fuel costs (typically calculated by mileage). There are two ways to deduct these expenses; a standard mileage option and an actual expense option. The standard mileage option allows you to deduct up to $0.535 per mile, whereas the actual expense option allows you to deduct a percentage of all vehicle maintenance costs, including lease payments, repair, new tires, registration, and insurance, among other costs. For more on the nuances of these expenses, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/quickbooks.intuit.com\/r\/driver\/rideshare-mileage-deductions-standard-mileage-vs-actual-vehicle-expenses\/\">QuickBooks\u2019 excellent guide to vehicle deductions<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Software costs<\/strong>: As a freelancer, it\u2019s likely that you need at least a few software tools to run your business. Fortunately, such expenses are deductible. This can apply to the outright purchase of one-off licenses as well as subscription-based programs.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Utilities<\/strong>: Similarly to home office-related expenses, certain utility costs can be deducted if you work from home. Electricity, phone bills, broadband access, and other utilities can be written off (in part) depending on your circumstances.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Unpaid invoices<\/strong>: Every freelancer I know has at least one horror story of a client that outright refused to pay. Although this is one of the most infuriating aspects of working for yourself, the IRS does sympathize and allows independent contractors to write off unpaid invoices as lost income. Also, it\u2019s <em>amazing<\/em> how many freelancers I run into who don\u2019t know this.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Healthcare coverage<\/strong>: There\u2019s no getting around the fact that, for all the political rhetoric about \u201cfreedom of choice,\u201d searching for and buying private health insurance coverage as a freelancer <em>sucks<\/em>. Fortunately, you can deduct the entirety of your privately purchased health insurance premiums on your taxes. Note, however, that you cannot deduct health insurance premiums if your insurance is provided through your spouse\u2019s employer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are plenty of other things you can deduct, such as retirement contributions (ha), legal fees, and professional development expenses such as training programs and educational courses, to name a few. If in doubt, talk to a qualified tax professional.<\/p>\n<h2>What Happens If You Don\u2019t Pay Your Taxes as a Freelancer?<\/h2>\n<p>Now that we\u2019ve looked at paying quarterly estimates, deductibles, and what proposed tax reform could mean for independent contractors, it\u2019s time to ask the most scary question of all \u2013 what happens if you don\u2019t pay your taxes as a freelancer?<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"89966d57-9564-4a94-b7b3-e0d2f80e7516\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/freelancers-guide-to-taxes-monopoly-do-not-pass-go.png\" alt=\"Freelancer's guide to taxes Monopoly do not pass go\" width=\"475\" height=\"271\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Maybe don\u2019t go DIRECTLY to jail\u2026<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Firstly, remember when we talked about quarterly estimate payment deadlines? Well, if you miss these deadlines, the IRS will apply <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/uac\/newsroom\/eight-facts-on-late-filing-and-late-payment-penalties\">late payment fees and interest<\/a> on your total tax liability for that fiscal year i.e. the total amount owed. These fees will be levied against you even if you successfully filed for an extension, so don\u2019t assume that applying for an extension will spare you from late fees \u2013 it won\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>There are two main types of penalties that the IRS applies:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Failure to file<\/strong> \u2013 a penalty applied if you fail to file a tax return for a particular fiscal year<\/li>\n<li><strong>Failure to pay<\/strong> \u2013 a penalty applied if you file a return, but fail to pay, your tax liability for a particular fiscal year<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>According to the IRS, the penalty for filing your return late is typically 5% of the unpaid tax owed per month.

Similarly to the failure-to-file penalty, penalties for failing to pay your taxes by the due date begin to accrue the day after the payment deadline, and applies to each month or partial month that taxes are owed.<\/p>\n<p>As we\u2019ve established, there are few hard-and-fast rules when it comes to taxes. If you\u2019re due a refund, for example, penalties for late filing or late payments will usually be deducted from your refund. Similarly, there are certain circumstances that might mean you won\u2019t be subject to penalties at all. Again, if you\u2019re not sure, contact the IRS directly or speak with a qualified tax professional.<\/p>\n<h3>Entering into Payment Agreements with the IRS<\/h3>\n<p>So you\u2019ve filed your return (late or otherwise), calculated your liability, and \u2013 to your horror \u2013 have realized that you owe more than you can pay.

Check the IRS website for details on eligibility and how to apply.<\/p>\n<h3>Make an Offer-in-Compromise<\/h3>\n<p>Another option for repaying back taxes is making what is known as an \u201coffer in compromise.\u201d Basically, this is an offer to make a one-time, lump sum payment to the IRS that is typically lower than the total amount owed. For example, you could make an offer-in-compromise to pay $6,000 on a tax liability of $10,000.

However, filing for Chapter 13 is a last resort for all parties involved \u2013 including the IRS.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6d3dabfd-586b-4932-915c-7cb2f9155020\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/freelancers-guide-to-taxes-bankruptcy-court.jpg\" alt=\"Freelancer's guide to taxes bankruptcy court building exterior\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Try not to end up here.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Even if you don\u2019t care how declaring bankruptcy will affect your financial future, there are several clauses that taxpayers must meet before filing for Chapter 13:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Taxpayers must have filed returns for ALL tax periods for four years prior to filing Chapter 13<\/li>\n<li>During bankruptcy proceedings, taxpayers must continue to file (or apply for an extension) for all applicable returns expected<\/li>\n<li>All current taxes must be paid while a bankruptcy case proceeds through the courts<\/li>\n<li>Any failure to file the expected returns and pay current taxes owed may result in the case being dismissed<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Again, this is not a decision to be made lightly. Filing bankruptcy is a big deal, especially in today\u2019s society when virtually every metric of your perceived worth is tied to your credit score. If there\u2019s really no other option, though, it may be worth considering. If you\u2019re thinking about it, talk it over with a tax attorney first. In fact, if you\u2019re thinking about doing <em>anything<\/em> mentioned in this post, talk to a tax attorney first.<\/p>\n<h2>Helpful Tax Resources for Confused Freelancers<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of how potentially complex it can be to navigate taxation as a freelancer. To help you figure things out, here are some useful resources that you may want to check out:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>US Tax Center at IRS:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.com\/articles\/contact-the-irs\">This IRS website<\/a> offers a ton of information on virtually every tax-related topic you can think of, and the site is significantly easier to navigate than the main IRS site.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Freelancer\u2019s Union:<\/strong> Although this non-profit organization is based in New York City, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freelancersunion.org\/\">Freelancer\u2019s Union<\/a> has some really excellent advice for self-employed individuals, and makes complex topics accessible and easy to understand.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reddit:<\/strong> I know, I know, Reddit <em>can<\/em> be a five-alarm dumpster fire of online toxicity, but the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/personalfinance\/\">\/r\/personalfinance<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/tax\/\">\/r\/tax<\/a> subreddits can be valuable sources of information if you ask the right questions (and do a search of previously asked questions before asking your own, per the unspoken galactic laws of Reddit). As with everything else in this post, any and all advice you may receive from well-meaning redditors should <strong>NOT<\/strong> be taken as binding legal or financial advice, even if that person claims to be a lawyer or certified accountant.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Navigating the U.S. taxation system as a freelancer can be a nightmare.
