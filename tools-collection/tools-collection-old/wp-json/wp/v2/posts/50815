Well, there\u00a0are content types, like&#8230;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Core website pages<\/li>\n<li>Landing pages<\/li>\n<li>Blog posts<\/li>\n<li>Learning center articles<\/li>\n<li>Guides<\/li>\n<li>Webinars<\/li>\n<li>Videos<\/li>\n<li>One pagers<\/li>\n<li>Podcasts<\/li>\n<li>Success stories<\/li>\n<li>Benchmark reports<\/li>\n<li>Battle cards<\/li>\n<li>Slide decks<\/li>\n<li>Boilerplates<\/li>\n<li>Branded templates<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&#8230;and there are content conditions, like<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Since the dawn of man\u00a0or a specified date range.<\/li>\n<li>All of your content or just one format.<\/li>\n<li>All formats of content or just all formats on\u00a0a particular topic.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And what data might you want to\u00a0analyze? Anything you can find with Google Analytics and the human eye.<\/p>\n<p>My point? The sky&#8217;s the limit\u00a0with content audits, so the definition of yours depends on how much content you&#8217;re auditing, the tools\u00a0you have, and the purpose of the audit\u2014which we&#8217;ll get into soon.<\/p>\n<h2>Why conduct content audits?<\/h2>\n<p>Although content audits can be time-consuming and tedious, they are\u00a0essential for creating\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/15\/quality-content-defined\">high-quality content<\/a>, building your brand and reputation, and improving the overall output of your team. Let&#8217;s talk about each of these in more detail.<\/p>\n<h3>Inform your content marketing strategy<\/h3>\n<p>You should be using regular reporting to stay on track with your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/13\/content-marketing-strategy\">content marketing strategy<\/a>, but audits allow you to get\u00a0bigger picture information and\u00a0identify where to make adjustments, as well as to\u00a0drill down and solve a particular problem or optimize for a specific goal.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The result: <\/strong>The data and insights you gather in a content audit can be used to improve\u00a0SEO, reveal strengths and weaknesses,\u00a0discover new topics,\u00a0better understand your audience, identify opportunities to verticalize, scale, or repurpose.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/content-audit-repurpose-example.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"355\" alt=\"how to run a content audit\u2014example of repurposing content\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Build your brand and reputation<\/h3>\n<p>Every piece of content you put in front of your audience communicates something to them. Do you want to be communicating that you&#8217;re behind on the times, careless, or inept? Didn&#8217;t think so.\u00a0Your industry, products and services, and brand are constantly evolving, and you need to stay ahead.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The result: <\/strong>Content audits help you to maintain design and tone consistency, information accuracy, and a clean online presence. You can include comparisons to other brands to keep up with competitors and industry trends.<\/p>\n<p>Regular content audits help to ensure that every encounter with your content is a positive experience that communicates authenticity, expertise, and trust.<\/p>\n<h3>Improve organizational output<\/h3>\n<p>Comprehensive content audits are used to\u00a0create and maintain a content library for your business. And a shared content library is a goldmine.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The result: <\/strong>When other departments have access to the content team&#8217;s content, they can easily recycle and repurpose for their own materials\u2014which saves time and improves their content quality (think <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/21\/business-one-pager-examples\">one-pagers<\/a>, slide decks, sales enablement pieces).<\/p>\n<p>And if the content team has access to sales, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/12\/16\/product-marketing\">product marketing<\/a>, branding, and PR content (internal and external), they can find key themes to weave throughout their writing, important topics to cover, and have context for departmental requests.<\/p>\n<p>Another operational benefit of a content library is that it makes it easier for new team members,\u00a0whether they&#8217;re managing the content or using it, to get up to speed.<\/p>\n<h2>What should you include in a content audit?<\/h2>\n<p>Content audits can serve an infinite number of purposes, so there aren&#8217;t any cut-and-dry lists of data points to collect. Below, I&#8217;ve created a comprehensive list of information to potentially include in your content audit.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind, this is not an exhaustive list and some data points fall into more than one bucket. Also, some of them are action items in and of themselves. <strong>And you&#8217;re not supposed to collect all of them!<\/strong> So treat it\u00a0like a menu to pick and choose from based on your goals.<\/p>\n<h3>Informational content audit checklist<\/h3>\n<p>Informational data provides all of the objective facts about the content being audited.\u00a0Some of it will have to be pulled manually but there are also website plugins and tools that can export the data for you.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Summaries: <\/strong>This is a brief\u00a0synopsis of the piece of content. If you\u2019re including <a href=\"\/meta-description\">meta descriptions<\/a>\u00a0in your audit, this may not be necessary (or if you\u2019re not including meta descriptions, you can use these as your summaries).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Titles:<\/strong>\u00a0Page titles may be different than their SERP title; this is a good data point to consider for uniformity across your site and ensuring that your anchor text and CTA buttons align with the page for a better user experience<\/li>\n<li><strong>Meta title\/title tags:<\/strong>\u00a0This is the title of your URL as it appears on the SERP, and can be correlated with CTR.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Meta descriptions: <\/strong>This is the brief description of your\u00a0page that shows up on the SERP.\u00a0You\u2019ll want to include this in an SEO audit to make sure they include keywords and are aligned with the current Google meta description character count.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/content-audit-meta-title-description-example.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"76\" alt=\"example of meta title and description in the SERP\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Date published: <\/strong>Even if you have the publish date in the URL, include this data point so you can see traffic data in context and organize by date if needed. A post at the bottom of a top ten list may actually be crushing it if it was published more recently than the others.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Date last modified:<\/strong> This is mainly for guides or other more static content. This can help you easily pick out guides that were published before or after an important change (e.g., if you\u2019ve changed your guide offers, refreshed your branding, or if, say, Google changes its name from Adwords to Google Ads&#8230;)<\/li>\n<li>For blog posts, this is less important since there are so many minor modifications that you can make on any given week. However, if you\u2019re running a focused SEO content audit on a select number of posts, you\u2019ll definitely want to include the exact date you modified the post and exactly what you changed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Product or service supported: <\/strong>For blog posts, this might be built right in\u00a0through your categories and tags and can be generated with a website\u00a0export tool.\u00a0This is helpful for creating a library that other departments can refer to when they\u2019re looking for sales enablement material, email newsletter content, and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/02\/landing-page-copywriting\">landing page copy<\/a>.\u00a0It\u2019s also helpful for identifying if there are any products or services that need more supporting content.<\/li>\n<li><strong>URL: <\/strong>This is the public-facing link to the content (blog post, YouTube link, etc.)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Location:<\/strong> This is the link to\u00a0the media file on your server.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Keywords:<\/strong> This can include keyword targeted and volume and difficulty in separate columns. This way, if you\u2019re looking for optimization opportunities, you can prioritize by ease and impact. For example, it may not be worth it to spend time optimizing a post that targets a super low-volume keyword. Or if a post is not getting much traffic for a high-volume keyword, you may choose to retarget it for a lower volume variation. Better to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/19\/get-on-first-page-google\">show up on page one<\/a> for a keyword with 500 searches than\u00a0keyword than on page 5\u00a0for one with\u00a02,300 searches.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Word count:<\/strong> This is helpful for identifying short posts that can be combined into longer form content with a greater chance of ranking. It\u2019s also useful when you\u2019re looking at metrics like time on page. If you\u2019ve got a 2,500 word post and the time on page is 10 seconds, something is up.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Shares: <\/strong>No, you don\u2019t need to go into your social media platforms and start collecting those insights. But it might be good information for your audit if your blog posts have a share counter.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/content-audit-social-share-count.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"380\" alt=\"example of social share count in blog post\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Qualitative content audit checklist<\/h3>\n<p>Qualitative data is manually gathered, which can sometimes take a little time. But it is necessary for maintaining content quality, brand consistency, and reputation in an always-advancing world.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Images:<\/strong>\u00a0This could mean checking to see if the content has images, the quality of the images, if those images need a refresh (outdated screenshots), or the accuracy of information they provide.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Broken images or links:<\/strong> Broken images and links are unpleasant from a user experience and harmful to your SEO.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Tone: <\/strong>Is it aligned with your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/31\/brand-voice\">brand voice<\/a>?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Language:<\/strong> You may need to go back in and change terminology if your branded terms have changed, if you\u2019ve retired a product or service,<\/li>\n<li><strong>Forms:<\/strong> Test forms on your landing pages and elsewhere to make sure the user gets what they need in the most convenient way, and that the information gets passed through into your CRM and other automation platforms correctly.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Comments:<\/strong> A comment moderation tool is best for this but if you don\u2019t have one, this is something to look over when auditing your posts. Make sure there are responses to comments (good and bad) and that there are no spammy comments that could get you a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/30\/google-penalty\">Google penalty<\/a> for unnatural external links. You can also use comments to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/04\/unique-blog-ideas\">come up with unique blog post ideas<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Offers:<\/strong>\u00a0Check to see if popups, bottom rail, and side rail offers need a refresh or to make sure\u00a0they&#8217;re not appearing where they shouldn&#8217;t.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Readability:<\/strong>\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/04\/seo-content-readability\">Readability ranks<\/a>, but Grammarly and Yoast can only take you so far. Sometimes you need a human to scroll through to and make sure it&#8217;s <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/22\/marketing-copy\">compelling<\/a>, easy to read, and skimmable.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/seo-readability-yoast-seo_0.png\" width=\"734\" height=\"524\" alt=\"yoast seo reability score with suspicious emoji overlayed\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spelling\/grammar\/compliance with style guide:<\/strong> Not all content gets created by the content team! This may be useful for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/06\/26\/product-descriptions\">product descriptions<\/a>, pitch decks, one-pagers, and more.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Accuracy\/freshness:<\/strong> Is the information up to date? Could the stats be updated? Do the tools you\u2019ve included in your listicles still exist? Could the content use the addition of some more recent links?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Competitor equivalent: <\/strong>Provide links to similar content created by other brands or competitors that you can gain inspiration from.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ideas to improve: <\/strong>This is generally an open-ended item. The general idea is to leave a spot where auditors can leave any additional notes or ideas (that may part of our\u00a0outside the\u00a0goal of that particular audit.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Quantitative content audit data points<\/h3>\n<p>The numbers give you a single source of truth and allow you to set measurable goals and track them with<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/17\/content-marketing-kpis\"> content marketing KPIs<\/a>. They are also crucial when auditing for site health and performance.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on what you\u2019re measuring and how much content you\u2019re auditing, some of this information you can get from Google Analytics and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/16\/how-to-use-google-search-console\">Google Search Console<\/a>, and some of it you will need audit tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ahrefs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ahrefs<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.screamingfrog.co.uk\/seo-spider\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Screaming Frog<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>You can find more information about many of these data points in our\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/27\/seo-metrics\">SEO metrics post<\/a>.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Organic pageviews: <\/strong>Number of users entering that page from search engine.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bounce rate: <\/strong>Percentage of visitors who left without going to any additional pages.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Internal links: <\/strong>Number of internal links or checking to see if any are broken or could be replaced with newer content.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Incoming links:<\/strong>\u00a0Number of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/10\/link-building-secrets\">backlinks<\/a>; too many could mean something\u2019s up; you don\u2019t want to get a google penalty for unnatural links.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Linking sites: <\/strong>One site may link to one of your pages\u00a0several times throughout its content, so this number is lower than total backlinks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/content-audit-data-points-backlinks.png\" width=\"675\" height=\"377\" alt=\"how to run a content audit\u2014example of backlink report\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keyword volume\/keyword difficulty: <\/strong>See\u00a0the informational data section!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Page load speed:<\/strong>\u00a0This metric can involve <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/28\/technical-seo\">technical SEO<\/a>, but there are adjustments you can make on the content level. If you have a small number of pages, you can plug them into the free\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/speed\/pagespeed\/insights\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Page Speed Insights<\/a> tool, but if you&#8217;re auditing a long list of URLs, use an audit tool.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Average position: <\/strong>You can pull this manually from\u00a0Search Console, but this is another metric you might want to gather using an\u00a0audit or <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/14\/seo-tools\">SEO tool<\/a>. This can be especially useful if you\u2019re looking to identify pages that are within striking distance of the first page of Google that you can focus on.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Time on page: <\/strong>This metric can help you identify if something on your page isn&#8217;t working or is off-putting, or if the content doesn&#8217;t match the <a href=\"\/keyword-intent\">intent of the keyword.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Conversions: <\/strong>This is a better metric for landing page content audits, since conversions in Google Analytics can mean a number of things. But it could be helpful if you have goals set up in Google Analytics.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Conversion rate:\u00a0<\/strong>Conversion rate is, of course, necessary to get an accurate picture of top performing content. Also, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/03\/29\/ux-conversion-rates\">UX can impact conversion rate.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Bounce rate: <\/strong>This data point is helpful for many types of content audits. But remember that high bounce rates aren&#8217;t always bad. A blog post with a decent time on page and high bounce rate may indicate that it provides the exact information the searcher was seeking.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Exit rate: <\/strong>Exit rate shows you how often that page was the last one visited in a session.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Image size:<\/strong>\u00a0This includes the image&#8217;s dimensions as well as the file size.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are also sales metrics like CPA, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/17\/local-lead-generation-strategies\">leads generated<\/a>, leads nurtured, closes, and ROI, but that\u2019s not in the realm of the content audits\u00a0I&#8217;m discussing here.<\/p>\n<h2>How to conduct a content audit (successfully)<\/h2>\n<p>There are no right or wrong or finite steps to a content audit, but here are some tips to conduct yours successfully.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Have a specific\u00a0goal<\/h3>\n<p>Though needless to say,\u00a0content audits can become a black hole quick. There are infinite possibilities and metrics to gather. And you&#8217;ll almost always\u00a0discover additional metrics to collect once you start. So be sure to have a clear goal so you can collect only what&#8217;s needed. Too much information will make it difficult to glean clear insights.<\/p>\n<p>On that note, if you&#8217;re including open-ended qualitative data points in your audit, having a clear goal will help you to discern necessary changes from nice to haves (or great ideas to be revisited).<\/p>\n<h3>2. Stay organized<\/h3>\n<p>This will be\u00a0a spreadsheet. Here are some tips to stay organized:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep open-ended cells to a minimum, especially for large audits. This will make it easy to organize and sort your data in any way you want once it&#8217;s done.<\/li>\n<li>You may want to create drop down functionalities with specific options, especially if you have\u00a0multiple people auditing in the same sheet.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/content-audit-action-items-drop-down-1.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"352\" alt=\"example of content audit action items\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li>Color coding can be helpful when dealing with multiple content types and formats.<\/li>\n<li>Specify date ranges for quantitative metrics.<\/li>\n<li>Use tabs to keep large audits organized by content format.\u00a0You can always combine them into one sheet upon finishing. Just make sure every sheet has the exact same column format.<\/li>\n<li>Dedicate the first tab to instructions or checklists.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>3. Choose your format<\/h3>\n<p>There are different ways to format your content audit.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For some audits, the data points serve as\u00a0both the inventory and action items, meaning that completing the audit completes the goal.<br \/>\nThis format works if you&#8217;re doing a\u00a0basic QA audit to identify and make small but important changes that don&#8217;t need to be tracked.\u00a0Here, the first tab provides the action item checklist,\u00a0and the second tab simply has a title, link, and status column.<\/li>\n<li>For others, the audit is inventorying the data and then meeting with others to identify action items in accordance with the goal.<\/li>\n<li>For many, it&#8217;s a mix.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Regardless of how and when the action items are identified, make sure they are specific with a clear owner.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Use content audit tools<\/h3>\n<p>Some tools that are helpful with content auditing include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Google tools:<\/strong> Analytics, Search Console, <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/speed\/pagespeed\/insights\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Page Speed Insights<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>SEO and spider tools:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/semrush.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">semrush<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ahrefs.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ahrefs<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.screamingfrog.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Screaming Frog<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Inventory organization tools:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.airtable.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Airtable<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/sheets\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Sheets<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Content quality tools: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Yoast SEO Plugin<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grammarly.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Grammarly<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/hemingwayapp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hemingway editor<\/a>, and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.seoreviewtools.com\/bulk-web-page-word-count-checker\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bulk web page word count checker<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Image extractors\u00a0<\/strong>like <a href=\"https:\/\/extract.pics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">extract.pics<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>ROI tools <\/strong>like your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/09\/crm-for-small-business\">CRM<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Website graders: <\/strong>These <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/31\/website-graders\">website graders<\/a> can help you with everything from accessibility to SEO.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>5. Don\u2019t confuse auditing with reporting<\/h3>\n<p>Content audits should not replace regular reporting. Audits are typically comprehensive and conducted quarterly or even yearly (with the exception of those needed to troubleshoot\u00a0a specific problem).<\/p>\n<p>Regular reporting\u00a0is necessary to ensure you&#8217;re hitting KPIs with your content and to pick up on long-term patterns.
