For example, the average cost per click of a Facebook ad is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/facebook-ads-benchmarks-2024\">$1.88<\/a>.

Much of that work on Reddit falls to the people in the forum.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s accomplished through an upvote\/downvote system. When visitors see a post, they have the option to click an up or down arrow to say if it\u2019s useful and relevant.<\/p>\n<p>As a brand, you don\u2019t want to be on the business end of a pile of downvotes. That\u2019ll relegate your content to near invisibility and could even get you kicked off the forum (not to mention damaging the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/31\/brand-personality-messaging\">brand trust<\/a> you were hoping to build).<\/p>\n<p>Video game maker Electronic Arts (EA) is the unwitting poster child for how to rack up a ton of downvotes by not reading the room and giving a very unpopular answer.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Reddit-marketing-wordstream-semrush-1.webp\" alt=\"reddit marketing - EA downvoted post.\" width=\"284\" height=\"552\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87863 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Reddit-marketing-wordstream-semrush-1.webp 284w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Reddit-marketing-wordstream-semrush-1-154x300.webp 154w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Damnthatsinteresting\/comments\/1ble8ty\/this_comment_holds_the_world_record_for_most\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t worry; we\u2019ll explain how to avoid EA\u2019s fate and keep your content on the good side of upvotes.<\/p>\n<h3>Each subreddit has its own promotional rules<\/h3>\n<p>Subreddits are mostly community-run and have their own set of guidelines.

As we mentioned, when no one knows your name, there are fewer filters on what you\u2019re willing to say (the voting system keeps comments somewhat on the rails, though).<\/p>\n<p>As a marketer, this anonymity matters because you will get absolutely skewered if your post or comment comes off as anything but authentic and helpful.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also notice that users can name a subreddit anything they want.

You just need to follow a few strategies and best practices.<\/p>\n<h3>Find the right subreddits<\/h3>\n<p>Step one is to figure out where you want to engage. With over 100,000 subreddits to choose from, you shouldn\u2019t have a problem finding your people.<\/p>\n<p>Get started by entering some terms relevant to your business in the Reddit search bar. Try terms that describe your industry, people, and the ways your products are used.<\/p>\n<p>Say you sell marketing software, search for things like \u201cmarketing,\u201d \u201csocial media marketers,\u201d and \u201cmarketing tools.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Now, you don\u2019t just want to jump into the first group you stumble across. Here are a few other ways to narrow down the list:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Look at how many members the group has.<\/li>\n<li>See how active the group is (how many new posts there are from the last day, week, etc.).<\/li>\n<li>Look to see if another brand is active there and how they\u2019re received.<\/li>\n<li>Read the subreddit\u2019s community guidelines, especially the rules on promotion.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Be genuinely engaging<\/h3>\n<p>We can\u2019t stress this one enough: do not go into a subreddit and start promoting your product. Do not share links to your content. Don\u2019t even mention your company unless the conversation explicitly calls for it.<\/p>\n<p>What can you do? Share personal experiences and insights. Show your knowledge by contributing to conversations. Respond to other commenters with the intention to help and support the community.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a great example of a car salesperson jumping in to shine some light on a tricky question.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Reddit-marketing-wordstream-askcarsales.webp\" alt=\"reddit marketing - Reddit post with car salesperson answering a question.\" width=\"733\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87821 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Reddit-marketing-wordstream-askcarsales.webp 733w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Reddit-marketing-wordstream-askcarsales-480x393.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 733px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askcarsales\/comments\/1hg0sex\/comment\/m2fq44k\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Look for opportunities to learn and comment<\/h3>\n<p>There are millions of conversations happening on Reddit at any point.

The big difference is they\u2019re tagged as \u201cPromoted.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a discussion feed ad from tastytrade placed on a thread in the r\/personalfinance subreddit.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Reddit-marketing-wordstream-tastytrade-ad.webp\" alt=\"reddit marketing - Reddit post with ad embedded.\" width=\"733\" height=\"584\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87825 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Reddit-marketing-wordstream-tastytrade-ad.webp 733w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Reddit-marketing-wordstream-tastytrade-ad-480x382.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 733px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>See the \u201cAdd a comment\u201d bar?

Here are a handful of the best examples we found while digging through Reddit.<\/p>\n<h3>Semrush<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019re marketers, so of course we spent a fair amount of time on marketing subreddits, and it seemed like Semrush was ever-present in them.<\/p>\n<p>For starters, the brand has an active branded subreddit with over 4,000 members.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Reddit-marketing-wordstream-semrush.webp\" alt=\"reddit marketing - Reddit page for Semrush.\" width=\"839\" height=\"397\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87828 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Reddit-marketing-wordstream-semrush.webp 839w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Reddit-marketing-wordstream-semrush-480x227.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 839px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SEMrush\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Scroll through it, and you\u2019ll see users posing questions and sharing tips. You\u2019ll also see educational posts by internal Semrush influencers.<\/p>\n<p>Their work doesn\u2019t stop there. We lost count of the number of times we saw Semrush jump in and answer questions on other related subreddits.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Reddit-marketing-wordstream-similarweb.webp\" alt=\"reddit marketing - Reddit post about similar web.\" width=\"831\" height=\"586\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87829 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Reddit-marketing-wordstream-similarweb.webp 831w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Reddit-marketing-wordstream-similarweb-480x338.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 831px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SEO\/comments\/1hdega6\/comment\/m1vrs6i\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>This is how you promote your product on Reddit without being downvoted to oblivion!<\/p>\n<h3>Chevrolet<\/h3>\n<p>Many of the promos we saw look similar to what you\u2019d see anywhere else, meaning they were high-quality video ads like this one from Chevrolet.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Reddit-marketing-wordstream-chevy.webp\" alt=\"reddit marketing - Chevy ad.\" width=\"500\" height=\"589\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87830 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Reddit-marketing-wordstream-chevy.webp 500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Reddit-marketing-wordstream-chevy-480x565.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The use of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/27\/emojis-in-ad-text\">emojis<\/a> was a nice touch for a social media platform. But what stood out wasn\u2019t what was in this ad; it\u2019s where we saw it\u2014smack dab in the middle of a user-moderated Ford truck fan subreddit. That highlights one of the strengths of Reddit marketing: You can helicopter your ad right in front of just about any<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/28\/niche-marketing\"> niche<\/a> group you want.<\/p>\n<h3>Marketing for Founders<\/h3>\n<p>Here\u2019s proof that Reddit marketing isn\u2019t just for big brands with deep pockets. This marketing consultant built a significant presence on the platform just by being super helpful in marketing-related threads.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Reddit-marketing-wordstream-marketingforfounders.webp\" alt=\"reddit marketing - Reddit post form Marketing For Founders.\" width=\"782\" height=\"579\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87831 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Reddit-marketing-wordstream-marketingforfounders.webp 782w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Reddit-marketing-wordstream-marketingforfounders-480x355.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 782px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/MarketingForFounders\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Scroll through his comments, and you\u2019ll see how he cleverly adds links to his website and content, but only when it makes sense in the conversion.<\/p>\n<h3>Schwab<\/h3>\n<p>Matching your message to the subreddit topic is critical on Reddit. Not only will a mismatched ad get ignored, but it could also get downvoted and hurt your credibility.<\/p>\n<p>With that in mind, we didn\u2019t expect to see a promoted post from one of the largest financial services companies on a subreddit about outdoor travel and RV life. But the ad is perfectly aligned with the audience and topic, so it fits right in.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Reddit-marketing-wordstream-schwab.webp\" alt=\"reddit marketing - Reddit ad from Schwab.\" width=\"674\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87832 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Reddit-marketing-wordstream-schwab.webp 674w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Reddit-marketing-wordstream-schwab-480x427.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 674px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When you think about it, it makes a lot of sense. Many RVers are retired or headed that way. They\u2019ll be Schwab\u2019s target audience. This ad melds their need to protect finances with their love of the open road.<\/p>\n<h3>Peg City Car Co-op<\/h3>\n<p>We specifically looked around for unlikely brands hitting it big on Reddit. After all, it\u2019s not easy for most of us to emulate billion-dollar businesses. One of the best examples we found was this AMA session with the CEO of a carsharing company based in Winnipeg.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Reddit-marketing-wordstream-AMA-coop.webp\" alt=\"reddit marketing - Reddit post AMA from carshare co-op.\" width=\"521\" height=\"589\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87833 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Reddit-marketing-wordstream-AMA-coop.webp 521w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Reddit-marketing-wordstream-AMA-coop-480x543.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 521px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Winnipeg\/comments\/1dz4u6w\/ama_im_the_ceo_of_peg_city_car_coop_ask_me\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>The event garnered hundreds of upvotes and questions. Queries ranged from tips on car sharing to a deep discussion about the project\u2019s feasibility.<\/p>\n<p>The CEO held the AMA on r\/Winnipeg, so the audience was exactly who the business needed to connect with. The open communication helped him curb misunderstandings, reinforce value, and introduce the solution to more local drivers.<\/p>\n<h2>Make Reddit marketing work for you<\/h2>\n<p>Reddit marketing isn\u2019t like marketing on other social media platforms. There is more candor, quicker feedback, and a patchwork of promotion rules to contend with. That said, many brands are taking advantage of the platform&#8217;s high-intent fan bases and lower competition to find new followers and customers.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to give Reddit a try for your business, keep these tips and tactics in mind:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find the right subreddits<\/li>\n<li>Be genuinely engaging<\/li>\n<li>Look for opportunities to learn and comment<\/li>\n<li>Host an AMA session<\/li>\n<li>Create a branded profile page or user community<\/li>\n<li>Invest in paid ads<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Reddit marketing is both tricky and rewarding.
