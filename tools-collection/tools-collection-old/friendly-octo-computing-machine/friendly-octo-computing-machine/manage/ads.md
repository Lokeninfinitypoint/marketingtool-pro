### Managing your ads

* **Edit ad content:** Open an ad to update the headline, description, URLs, or ad extensions.
* **Pause or resume:** Quickly pause underperforming ads or resume successful ones.
* **Duplicate ads:** Create variations by duplicating an existing ad and tweaking the copy or targeting.

1. Navigate to the _Ads_ section under **Manage**.
2. Use the filters to find ads by campaign, ad group, or status.
3. Click on an ad to open the edit panel.
4. Update the text, URLs, or other settings.
