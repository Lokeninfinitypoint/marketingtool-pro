# Account organization

## Account organization

Organize your work in Waduit by using folders, labels, and clear naming conventions.

### Use folders and projects

Group related campaigns and assets into folders or projects for easier navigation and reporting.

### Apply labels

Tag your campaigns, ads, and keywords with labels to filter and segment your data quickly.

### Naming conventions

Establish clear naming conventions for campaigns and assets (for example, Client-Objective-Platform) so your team can identify them at a glance.
