# Quality score

### Quality score overview

Quality score is a diagnostic metric provided by advertising platforms that evaluates the relevance and quality of your ads, keywords, and landing pages. A higher quality score can lead to lower costs per click and better ad positions, while a low score indicates that your ads or landing pages may not be relevant to users.

#### What it does

* Rates each keyword on a scale (usually 1–10) based on expected click‑through rate, ad relevance, and landing page experience.
* Influences your ad rank and the actual cost you pay for each click.
* Provides insights on which components of your campaigns need improvement.

#### How to use it

1. Go to **Tools → Quality score** in your Waduit dashboard.
2. Review the quality scores for your keywords and ad groups.
3. Identify keywords with low scores and check the associated ads and landing pages.
4. Improve ad relevance by aligning ad copy closely with keyword intent.
5. Enhance landing page experience by ensuring fast load times, mobile responsiveness, and relevant content.
6. Use negative keywords to avoid showing your ads for unrelated searches.
7. Monitor quality score trends over time to assess the impact of your optimizations.

#### Tips

* Write compelling ad copy that matches the intent of your keywords and offers a clear value proposition.
* Regularly update your landing pages to maintain freshness and align with user expectations.
* Use keyword grouping to ensure each ad group targets a tightly themed set of keywords.
* Remember that quality score is a directional metric; focus on improving user experience rather than chasing a perfect score.
