# Keywords

### Keywords overview

Keywords connect your ads to the search queries your customers type. Choosing the right keywords ensures your ads are shown to the right audience. Waduit’s keywords management interface lets you add, edit, or remove keywords, and monitor their performance.

### Managing your keywords

* **Add new keywords:** Expand your reach by adding relevant search terms to ad groups.
* **Edit keywords:** Adjust match types or bids for existing keywords.
* **Pause or remove keywords:** Disable keywords that are underperforming or no longer relevant.
* **Add negative keywords:** Exclude search terms that are not relevant to prevent wasted spend.

### How to manage keywords

1. Navigate to **Keywords** under **Manage**.
2. Use filters to locate keywords by campaign, ad group, or match type.
3. Select keywords to edit bids or change match types.
4. Add new keywords using the ‘Add keyword’ button.
5. Review performance metrics like clicks, CTR, cost, and conversions to optimize your keyword list.

### Tips

* Use a mix of broad, phrase, and exact match types to balance reach and relevance.
* Regularly add negative keywords to filter out irrelevant searches.
* Monitor search term reports to discover new keyword opportunities and refine existing ones.
