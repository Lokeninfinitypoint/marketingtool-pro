# Search terms

### Search terms overview

Search terms are the actual queries people used to trigger your ads. Analyzing search terms helps you understand how users find your ads and uncover opportunities for new keywords or negatives.

### Using the search terms report

* **Discover new opportunities:** Identify high-performing search terms that are not yet in your keyword list.
* **Add negative keywords:** Exclude irrelevant or low-performing terms to improve efficiency.
* **Assess user intent:** Understand the intent behind searches to refine your ad copy and landing pages.

### How to analyze search terms

1. Go to **Search terms** under **Manage**.
2. Set a date range and filters to narrow down the list.
3. Sort by metrics like clicks, conversions, or cost to identify impactful search terms.
4. Select a term to add it as a new keyword or negative.
5. Repeat regularly to keep your keyword list fresh and your spend optimized.

### Tips

* Review search terms weekly or monthly depending on traffic volume.
* Focus on terms with high conversions or high spend when deciding on actions.
* Use insights from search terms to adjust ad copy and landing page messaging.
