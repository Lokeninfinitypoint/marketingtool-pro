- **Tools dropdown** powered by CMS categories
- **Auto-updating** when categories change

- **Scale up**: API bulk upload for all 155
- **Blog included**: SEO and content marketing

## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to know how to code?
**A**: No! We'll use:
- Webflow API (I'll write the scripts)
- Webflow visual editor (drag & drop)
- JSON data files (simple format)

### Q: Can I modify the design?
**A**: Absolutely! The Optimatia template is fully customizable in Webflow. We'll use it as a foundation.

### Q: How long will this take?
**A**:
- Phase 2: 2-3 hours (core setup)
- Phase 3: 3-5 hours (full content)
- Total: 5-8 hours of work

### Q: What if I don't have all 155 tools data yet?
**A**: Start with 10-15 tools. We'll build the system, test it, then you can add the rest later (even manually in Webflow).

### Q: Can I do this in multiple sessions?
**A**: Yes! That's why we have `feature-development-progress.md`. Each session picks up where we left off.
