										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Instagram is one of the most powerful social media platforms in the game right now. It has over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 billion</a> monthly active users, and that number will likely continue to climb year over year. But with so many active users scrolling through their feeds at all hours of the day, how in the world can a small business stand out with organic posts alone?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where Instagram advertising comes into play. It allows you to focus on the right people, at the right time, with the right message and imagery. Instagram ads tell visual stories through various formats, and many advertisers have seen this channel yielding higher ROI in comparison to their other advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>In this walkthrough, you’ll learn everything you need to know to get started with an Instagram advertising campaign.</p>

<h2>What is Instagram advertising?</h2>
<p>Instagram advertising is a method of paying to post sponsored content on Meta’s Instagram platform to reach a larger and more targeted audience. While there are many reasons a business or individual may decide to advertise, Instagram ads are often used to grow brand exposure, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drive website traffic</a>, generate new leads, and move current leads down the funnel (and hopefully towards conversion).</p>
<p>Since Instagram is such a visual platform, you’ll need a single image or video, or a set of images and videos, paired with a caption and a call-to-action (CTA) button to reach your audience with Instagram ads.</p>

<h2>Why advertise on Instagram?</h2>
<p>Consider these Instagram advertising statistics and facts when evaluating whether this strategy is right for your business.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instagram users spend about <a href="https://backlinko.com/instagram-users" target="_blank" rel="noopener">34 minutes</a> daily and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1294879/time-spent-instagram-app-selected-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 hours</a> monthly on the app on average.</li>
<li>Instagram is the <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/instagram-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most popular</a> platform for product discovery, with <a href="https://business.instagram.com/getting-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60%</a> of people saying they discover new products on Instagram. <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29%</a> of Instagram users make purchases directly from the platform.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1284484/social-media-platforms-highest-return-on-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29%</a> of businesses say Instagram yields them the highest <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-roi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing ROI</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/instagram-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">44%</a> of social media users wished that brands used Instagram more often (higher than any other network).</li>

<div id="types-of-instagram-ads"></div>
<h2>Types of Instagram ads</h2>
<p>Now that you know Instagram ads would be a slam-dunk strategy for your business, let’s explore the types of Instagram ads you could start taking advantage of.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Image or video ads:</strong> Ads that use a single image or video up to 60 seconds long, along with a CTA button and caption, to promote your offer.</li>
<li><strong>Carousel ads: </strong>Ads that compile multiple images and videos into slides viewers can scroll through. Although organic carousel posts can be up to 20 slides, carousel ads have a limit of 10 slides.</li>
<li><strong>Reels: </strong>Short-form video ads that take up the user’s full screen as they scroll through the Reels tab or Explore page on Instagram. These can be up to 15 minutes long, but typically, the best performing Reels are anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes long.</li>
<li><strong>Story ads: </strong>Ads on <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/instagram-story-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram Stories</a> can include images and videos and take up a user&#8217;s full screen as they scroll through the Stories section of the app. Organic Stories only stay up for 24 hours, but you can re-run Story ad campaigns for longer periods of time. Instagram Story video ads can only be 15 seconds max unless you are using the carousel format. With Instagram Story video carousel ads, you can select up to 10 cards with a maximum of 120 seconds of video content.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-types.webp" alt="instagram ads - types of instagram ads chart" width="900" height="800" class="aligncenter wp-image-95280 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-types.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-types-480x427.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>All Instagram ad formats include a CTA button, and you can include captions, hashtags, and more in your ad content. Every ad will appear with an automatically added “Sponsored” text when shown in user feeds, like you see at the bottom of this example Story ad below.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-story-example.webp" alt="instagram ads - example instagram story ad" width="340" height="650" class="aligncenter wp-image-95282 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-story-example.webp 340w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-story-example-157x300.webp 157w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /></p>
<p>Users can perform a few different actions once they see your ad. For instance, most ad formats allow people to like, share, comment, or replay your content, and they all have the ability to click your added links or CTA buttons.</p>
<p>With that comes tons of different metrics you could track within your Instagram campaigns, so check out this resource on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-media-audit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to audit your social media performance</a> to see which interactions on your ads might matter most for your business.</p>
<div id="how-to-run-instagram-ads"></div>
<h2>How to run Instagram ads</h2>
<p>Ready to run Instagram ads for your business? Follow these seven steps.</p>
<h3>1. Get your Meta Business Suite and Instagram accounts set up</h3>
<p>Instagram ads are configured directly on the Meta Ads Manager, which you can access and sync with your Instagram account via the Meta Business Suite. So, first, you’ll need both those accounts set up.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-create-a-new-instagram-account/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Instagram account</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Navigate to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instagram.com</a> directly and follow the prompts to create an account. Alternatively, you could download the Instagram app and sign up that way. Just be sure that you switch your new account to a professional account.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-professional-account.webp" alt="instagram marketing - professional account option" width="276" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94268 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-professional-account.webp 276w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-professional-account-138x300.webp 138w" sizes="(max-width: 276px) 100vw, 276px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meta Business Suite: </strong>You’ll access the Meta Ads Manager and connect your Instagram account through the Meta Business Suite. You can get your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-advertise-on-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">account set up on Meta Business Suite</a> via <a href="https://business.facebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://business.facebook.com/</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-create-account.webp" alt="instagram ads - meta business suite" width="843" height="650" class="aligncenter wp-image-95283 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-create-account.webp 843w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-create-account-480x370.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 843px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Note that you can boost organic Instagram posts and manage your Instagram ads directly from the Instagram app itself, too. Professional accounts will have access to <strong>professional tools</strong>, such as <strong>ad tools</strong>, under the <strong>creator tools </strong>menu, shown at the bottom of this screenshot here.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-professional-tools.webp" alt="instagram ads - professional creator tools menu screenshot" width="299" height="650" class="aligncenter wp-image-95281 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-professional-tools.webp 299w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-professional-tools-138x300.webp 138w" sizes="(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px" /></p>
<p>The steps we’ll continue to walk through will be creating your Instagram ads campaign from the Meta platform, which can be easier (and typically more popular) if you’re running ads on both Facebook and Instagram, or using a desktop to dig into all aspects of your ads.</p>
<h3>2. Create your campaign and select its objective</h3>
<p>Since you run your Instagram ads through Meta, it’ll basically feel like you’re creating a Facebook campaign until you select your Instagram page and placements in your ad set to turn your build into an Instagram-only strategy.</p>
<p>Click the green<strong> +Create</strong> button to create a new Meta Ads campaign and choose your campaign goal. Luckily, the goals are named in a self-explanatory manner. Need more traffic? Select the traffic objective. Looking to increase brand awareness? Choose the awareness objective. You get the gist.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-creating-new-campaign.webp" alt="instagram ads - create an instagram campaign" width="950" height="378" class="aligncenter wp-image-95284 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-creating-new-campaign.webp 950w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-creating-new-campaign-480x191.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 950px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>3. Configure your target audience</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve selected your objective, you need to target the appropriate audience to get your ads in front of the right people. This is the true beauty of Instagram ads since you’ll be using Facebook’s depth of demographic knowledge to reach the right people.</p>
<p>If you’ve done this for Facebook ads before, you likely already have several audiences built and are quite familiar with the process. If you’re new to this process, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-targeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here’s a run-down of your targeting options</a>, which you can layer to get a precisely targeted audience. (For instance, if you want to target women, in New York, between the ages of 19 and 65, who are interested in yoga and health food, you can do just that!)</p>
<h3>4. Choose your placements</h3>
<p>Now that you’re targeting your ideal demographic, it’s time to choose your placements! <strong>This is a critical step to only show ads on Instagram</strong>. If you choose to ignore this step, Facebook will allow your ads to appear on both platforms.</p>
<p>This isn’t necessarily a negative thing, but if you have content that you’ve created specifically for Instagram, you’ll have to opt into <strong>manual placements</strong> under the <strong>audience controls</strong> portion of the <strong>placements </strong>settings within your ad set.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-placements.webp" alt="instagram ads - manual placements" width="865" height="1021" class="aligncenter wp-image-95285 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-placements.webp 865w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-placements-480x567.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 865px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>5. Set your budget</h3>
<p>If you are familiar with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-budget" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how budgets work through Google Ads</a> or other digital advertising platforms, this step should feel familiar. If not, don’t fret; while you might not know exactly where to set your daily or lifetime budget when running your first Instagram ad campaign, this comes with trial and error, as well as experience. And the good thing is you have the control to pause or stop your campaign at any time if you feel your budget is not being properly allocated.</p>
<p>However, to start, check out <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ads-benchmarks-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">industry benchmarks</a>, like the example below, to see what you can expect for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ads-cost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average costs across Facebook and Instagram ads</a>.</p>

<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Download our free </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/facebook-benchmarks?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2025FBAdsBenchmarks_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Facebook Ads Benchmarks report</strong></a> to estimate average costs for ads in your industry across the Meta platform!</p>
<h3>6. Create and publish your Instagram Ad</h3>
<p>Now it is time to create your Instagram ad!</p>
<p>Hopefully, after taking the steps above, you already have some content in mind for the ad you are looking to promote. This part of the setup may look different depending upon your campaign objective, but you’ll always have a few ad format options to choose from, so don’t be afraid to test a few different ad variations.</p>
<h3>7. Measure your Instagram campaign performance</h3>
<p>Once you start advertising on Instagram, you’ll want to track your progress regularly to be sure you’re pacing towards your goals. You could rely on the campaign dashboard within Meta Ads, third-party tools, or Instagram insights to see how your ads are impacting your business growth.</p>

<h2>6 #winning Instagram ads tips</h2>
<p>Once your Instagram advertising campaigns are up and running, keep these tips in mind.</p>
<h3>1. Be careful using Advantage+</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/meta-advantage-plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advantage+</a> is a suite of AI-powered automated solutions you can apply to your Meta campaigns. You won’t be able to use certain <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/meta-advantage-vs-manual-settings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advantage+ features</a>, like Advantage+ placements, to have a true Instagram-only campaign. However, Advantage+ options could still be helpful when drafting your Instagram ad creative.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-advantage-plus-ad-catalog.webp" alt="instagram ads - advantage plus ad catalog option screenshot" width="704" height="393" class="aligncenter wp-image-95279 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-advantage-plus-ad-catalog.webp 704w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-advantage-plus-ad-catalog-480x268.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 704px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>2. Reinforce your brand in your Instagram ad creative</h3>
<p>When it comes to using images in your Instagram ads, incorporate the essence of your brand by using your brand guidelines, such as the colors, fonts, and your logo, so it is recognizable to your target audience. Use bright colors so that these visual features can stand out amidst the white or black background of the app.</p>
<p>If you are using a carousel with images, organize them with a common theme, such as a summer line of shoes, your best sellers, or have them tell a story in a linear fashion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-carousel-ads-copy.jpg" alt="Instagram carousel ad with bowl of food" width="327" height="432" class="aligncenter wp-image-11350 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-carousel-ads-copy.jpg 327w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-carousel-ads-copy-227x300.jpg 227w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-carousel-ads-copy-76x100.jpg 76w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-carousel-ads-copy-151x200.jpg 151w" sizes="(max-width: 327px) 100vw, 327px" /></p>
<p>Here’s a cheat sheet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use your brand guidelines (colors, fonts, logo).</li>
<li>Make sure your ad copy complements your images.</li>
<li>Keep a strong focal point using your logo or another element of your brand.</li>
<li>Organize carousel ads by theme or a linear storyline.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Create easy-to-digest video ads</h3>
<p>Instagram users love video—so much so that Instagram Stories seem to be engaged with more these days than in-feed posts, as <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/instagram-stories-statistics/#gref" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70% </a>of users view them daily. While static images can and do perform well in the various Instagram ad placements, video posts, Reels, and Stories are where it’s at. It’s a quick and easily digestible content format, and you don’t necessarily need high-end equipment or hire more staff to be able to create successful video ad content.</p>
<p>In most cases, you’ll want to create video ads that are 60 seconds or shorter. While that&#8217;s the max duration for a standard Instagram video ad, people tend to drop off after viewing the first 10 seconds, regardless of how interesting, entertaining, or helpful it is. While of course, a fraction do watch the entire video, it’s important to show your brand, logo, product, or service in those first 10 seconds so people clearly understand who you are and what you are advertising. Don’t leave it until the end of your video to show your product, as it’ll be too late to possibly capture more people engaging and taking action.</p>
<p>With any ad placement, if you are using video, make sure to also add captions. Many people view Instagram content on mute, and we also want to make sure our content is accessible to anyone who may be hearing impaired. You can easily do so right through Meta Ads Manager at the ad level when you are selecting your video creative.</p>
<p>If you opt to have Meta scan your video and provide captions, just be sure to review them and edit as needed; sometimes the system can miscaption words if they aren’t clear, if you have an unusual brand name or it has a unique spelling, or if you have someone speaking with an accent on your video.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-best-practices-captions.jpg" alt="instagram ads - video ad with captions" width="414" height="697" class="aligncenter wp-image-11351 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-best-practices-captions.jpg 414w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-best-practices-captions-178x300.jpg 178w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-best-practices-captions-59x100.jpg 59w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-best-practices-captions-119x200.jpg 119w" sizes="(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px" /></p>
<h3>4. Use testimonials and UGC for relatable ads that feel organic</h3>
<p>People enjoy looking at people and giving them an image that they can relate to, be inspired by, or yearn to be more like; it naturally boosts views, clicks, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization-marketing">conversions</a>. The more organic you can make it feel to the platform, the less it will stick out like an advertisement, and people will feel more inclined to act.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/user-generated-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Using user-generated content (UGC)</a> and appending testimonials, especially in retargeting campaigns, is a win. Pair them up to put a face with a real testimonial, and you are bound to increase your conversion rates.</p>
<p>Using images that your customers share is not only as authentic as you can get, but this type of content will also typically get better engagement since most people enjoy having brands share their content. Another benefit? It makes your brand look real and trustworthy, so it can help manage expectations for prospective customers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-best-practices-user-generated-content.jpg" alt="instagram ads - example instagram ugc ad by creator" width="414" height="829" class="aligncenter wp-image-11352 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-best-practices-user-generated-content.jpg 414w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-best-practices-user-generated-content-150x300.jpg 150w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-best-practices-user-generated-content-50x100.jpg 50w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-best-practices-user-generated-content-100x200.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px" /></p>
<h3>5. Be mindful of your Instagram placement options</h3>
<p>Currently, you can advertise in the Instagram Feed, Instagram Stories, and the Instagram Explore tab. However, you’ll likely find that certain ad formats or offers work best on one placement type versus another. You may need to test and customize your ad placements according to your different ad sets.</p>
<h3>6. Use polls in Instagram Story ads</h3>
<p>Instagram Stories ads with interactive polls are an excellent way to catch your target audience’s attention with your ads and to get them into your funnel.</p>
<p>If you want to use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/04/instagram-story-ads-polls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram Story ads polls</a> for added engagement, you’ll first have to be sure to select the Instagram Stories placement only. If you select any additional placements in the ad set level, then this feature will not be available at the ad level.</p>

<h2>What is Instagram marketing?</h2>
<p>Instagram marketing is the practice of using the social media platform, Instagram, to grow your business through tactics like organic (a.k.a. free) posts, Reels, Stories, follower interactions, account partnerships and more.</p>
<p>Instagram has different feeds available that allow users to browse and discover image and video content, which is how your customers can connect with your business on the app.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-example-home-feed.webp" alt="instagram marketing - home feed" width="297" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94273 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-example-home-feed.webp 297w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-example-home-feed-149x300.webp 149w" sizes="(max-width: 297px) 100vw, 297px" /></p>

<h3>What’s the difference between Instagram marketing and Instagram advertising?</h3>
<p>Instagram marketing includes all your free, organic efforts on Instagram.</p>
<p>Instagram advertising is done through the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-advertise-on-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Ads platform</a> and requires campaign budgets to pay for your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/08/instagram-ads-cost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ad placements across the Instagram network</a>. That said, though, <strong>you can always “boost” a single organic Instagram post with a smaller, one-time budget</strong>—which can be done directly from the Instagram platform.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-ad.webp" alt="instagram marketing - ad example" width="284" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94278 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-ad.webp 284w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-ad-142x300.webp 142w" sizes="(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Unlike organic Instagram posts, Instagram Ads and boosted posts will have a “sponsored” line as well as a CTA button attached to them, like </em><a href="https://www.creatopy.com/blog/instagram-ads-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>the above example</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>While Instagram marketing might still require some budget to really take off, it’s generally cheaper than Instagram advertising—making it a no-brainer for every business type out there.</p>
<p>However,<strong> Instagram advertising allows you to tap into more audiences </strong>that might not necessarily be following your business but are more likely to convert into customers. That’s why <strong>it’s best to use a combination of both Instagram marketing and advertising</strong> to maximize your brand’s success on the platform.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/instagram-advertising" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learn more about Instagram advertising</a> here, but for this post, we’ll be focusing on Instagram marketing. After all, your Instagram ads will be more impactful if you have your Instagram marketing solidified first.</p>

<h2>Why market on Instagram?</h2>
<p>Marketing on Instagram is a low-cost option for growth that any business can take advantage of. Aside from that, though, there are tons of other benefits to Instagram marketing. Consider these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/20/instagram-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram facts and statistics</a>.</p>
<h3>Instagram holds a captive audience</h3>
<p>Instagram has a captive audience ready to pay attention to your business’s marketing. In fact, users spend about <a href="https://backlinko.com/instagram-users" target="_blank" rel="noopener">34 minutes</a> daily and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1294879/time-spent-instagram-app-selected-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 hours</a> monthly on Instagram on average—which is part of the reason why Instagram marketing is such a popular strategy.</p>
<p><span>Instagram users like to interact with businesses </span></p>
<p>Did you know that <a href="https://business.instagram.com/getting-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20%</a> of Instagram users visit a business profile every single day? <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/social-media-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90%</a> of Instagram users follow at least one business on the platform. Not only that, but <a href="https://business.instagram.com/getting-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">33%</a> of the most popular Instagram stories are shared by business accounts.</p>
<p>Instagram isn’t just favored for brand discovery, either, as you can use the platform to address <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-pain-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer pain points</a> and improve the overall customer experience your business provides. In fact, <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/instagram-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">72%</a> of Gen Z consumers are most likely to use Instagram for customer service over any other platform.</p>
<h3>Instagram users are ready to convert</h3>
<p>Instagram is the <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/instagram-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most popular</a> platform for product discovery, with <a href="https://business.instagram.com/getting-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60%</a> of people saying they discover new products on Instagram. <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29%</a> of Instagram users make purchases directly from the platform, and <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">36%</a> of people say they use Instagram as a search tool like they would Google (although you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-posts-indexed-on-google">optimize your Instagram posts for Google Search</a>, too).</p>
<p>Needless to say, Instagram users are ready to convert. <a href="https://www.businessdasher.com/instagram-statistics-for-business/#:~:text=87%25%20of%20Instagram%20users%20say,23%25%20more%20engagement%20than%20Facebook." target="_blank" rel="noopener">87%</a> of Instagram users take action, like visiting a website or making a purchase, after seeing a business’s Instagram post.</p>
<h3>Your competitors are likely already marketing on Instagram</h3>
<p>Odds are, your competitors are already finding success on Instagram. After all, Instagram is the third <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most popular</a> social platform and the fourth most visited site in the world. Over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/259379/social-media-platforms-used-by-marketers-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80%</a> of small businesses market their brand on Instagram, and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1284484/social-media-platforms-highest-return-on-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29%</a> of businesses say Instagram yields them the highest <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-roi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing ROI</a>.</p>

<div id="instagram-marketing-types"></div>
<h2>Types of Instagram posts</h2>
<p>There are a few types of Instagram posts your business can use to market to potential customers. Let’s review:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standard Instagram image posts: </strong>The original Instagram post type, which requires an image in order to be published.</li>
<li><strong>Instagram Reels: </strong>A short-form video post type that can be up to 3 minutes long.</li>
<li><strong>Carousel posts:</strong> This post type can be a combination of up to 20 different images and videos in a row that viewers can swipe through.</li>
<li><strong>Stories: </strong>Stories are a temporary style of an image or video post that only stays up for 24 hours. They are accessible by clicking on an account’s profile picture. However, note that you can also <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/instagram-highlight-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">save a story as a “highlight”</a> that stays at the top of your page. Or, you can go live on your story, too, and save any live footage as a story later. Check out some <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/instagram-story-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram story ideas</a> here.</li>
</ul>
<p>All Instagram post types allow you to add a caption, hashtags, music, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-add-location-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">location</a>, stickers, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-tag-someone-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">user tags</a>, and more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-post-types.webp" alt="instagram marketing - types of instagram posts" width="885" height="775" class="aligncenter wp-image-94258 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-post-types.webp 885w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-post-types-480x420.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 885px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Where can your Instagram posts show up?</h3>
<p>All your Instagram posts (no matter the format) will be shown in your followers’ home feeds, which will look like the example we saw above.</p>
<p>Your business’s posts and Reels can also appear on the Instagram explore page, where people can view your content regardless of whether they follow you or not.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-explore-page.webp" alt="instagram marketing - explore page screenshot" width="277" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94274 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-explore-page.webp 277w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-explore-page-139x300.webp 139w" sizes="(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://about.instagram.com/features/reels" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Your Reels can also be viewed by both followers and non-followers in the Reels tab. The Reels tab is where users can scroll through Reels similarly to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/tiktok-algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-reels.webp" alt="instagram marketing - reels page screenshot" width="337" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94279 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-reels.webp 337w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-reels-169x300.webp 169w" sizes="(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.socialpilot.co/blog/instagram-reels-algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>Instagram post sizes and specs</h3>
<p>With so many options and flexibility when it comes to Instagram post placements, the sizing and specs you should aim for when creating images and videos will vary. Here’s a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-media-image-sizes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breakdown of Instagram sizing</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instagram profile photo: 320 x 320 px</li>
<li>Instagram image posts: 1080 x 1440 px</li>
<li>Instagram landscape image posts: 1080 x 566 px</li>
<li>Instagram portrait image posts: 1080 x 1350 px</li>
<li>Instagram Stories and Reels: 1080 x 1920 px</li>
<li>Instagram Reel cover image size: 420 x 654 px</li>
</ul>
<p>As a bonus, if you want to plan out your profile tiles for a top-tier account aesthetic, try testing out how your images might look in the 161 x 161 px thumbnail size.</p>
<p>Note that there is also some flexibility with sizing on Instagram. For example, the Instagram profile picture minimum size is technically 110 x 110 px. Or, when creating a carousel post of image and video slides in different sizes, there’s a square button that allows you to opt to have the slides stay in their original sizes rather than being automatically cropped to the same size. Also, <span data-teams="true">Instagram image posts used to be square but they have since <a href="https://help.instagram.com/1631821640426723" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated the display size</a>, although you can still upload square images as long as they&#8217;re 1080 height. </span></p>
<p>Instagram also tends to compress images in posts that are uploaded in a larger file size than allowed, so try saving your Instagram content files in the most compact format possible without sacrificing quality. Read on for some tools to help with this.</p>

<h2>How to get started with Instagram marketing</h2>
<p>Ready to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-drive-traffic-from-instagram" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jumpstart your business’s Instagram</a> marketing journey? Follow these six steps.</p>
<h3>1. Create your Instagram business account</h3>
<p>There are two ways you can <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-create-a-new-instagram-account/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create a new Instagram account</a>. The first option is navigating to <a href="https://www.instagram.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.instagram.com</a> directly and following the prompts to create an account. Alternatively, you could download the Instagram app and sign up that way.</p>
<p>For either of these two options, you could also sync your Facebook account to have your new Instagram account loaded up with your Facebook profile details. If you want to go this route, you’ll need an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-advertise-on-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">account set up on Meta</a> via <a href="https://business.facebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://business.facebook.com/</a>.</p>
<p>There’s no right or wrong account creation option, and they’re all equally popular, so it depends on what might be best for your Instagram marketing needs. For example, if your business is already well established on Facebook, it may be easiest to just sync your Facebook page. Or, maybe you’re launching a full Meta marketing strategy for a new brand, in which case you might want to get set up via the Meta Business Manager first.</p>
<p>Once you have your account, <strong>be sure it&#8217;s set as a business Instagram account </strong>by clicking the “edit profile” button at the top of your account’s page. Tap the <strong>switch to professional account</strong> prompt at the bottom of the edit profile page. From there, you can follow the prompts to select a category for your business, add contact details, and so on.</p>
<p>Here are some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/10/best-business-instagram-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">example Instagram business accounts</a> to get some ideas of how to arrange your own account.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-professional-account.webp" alt="instagram marketing - professional account option" width="276" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94268 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-professional-account.webp 276w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-professional-account-138x300.webp 138w" sizes="(max-width: 276px) 100vw, 276px" /></p>
<h3>2. Decide what to track and set your goals</h3>
<p>Your Instagram marketing goals will help you determine what types of Instagram content you want to focus on, how much of your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing budget</a> will be put towards your strategy, and more. The SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and timely) goal structure can <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/instagram-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guide your Instagram</a> goal planning during this step.</p>
<p>You might also want to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ads-benchmarks-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out industry benchmarks</a> to see the average performance for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/01/instagram-analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">key Instagram metrics</a> in your industry.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some Instagram marketing metrics to consider including in your goals:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Likes: </strong>Total number of users who clicked the “heart” button on your post.</li>
<li><strong>Comments:</strong> Total number of users who commented on your post.</li>
<li><strong>Shares: </strong>Total number of times a user sent your post to other users via <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-dm-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram direct messages</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Saves:</strong> Total number of users who saved your content to their archives.</li>
<li><strong>Views:</strong> The number of times your post or reel was displayed on a user’s screen.</li>
<li><strong>Profile visits: </strong>Total number of times users visited your business’s Instagram profile.</li>
<li><strong>Reach:</strong> Total number of unique accounts that saw your Instagram content at least once.</li>
<li><strong>Follower count: </strong>The number of accounts that follow your business’s page. Ideally, you want more or roughly the same number of accounts to be following you as you follow, known as your <strong>follower ratio</strong>. This makes your brand appear more desirable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there are a ton of other actions and engagements you can track to measure your Instagram marketing results—don’t forget about end-goal conversions like website visits, sales, or leads. The point is to add a bit of structure to your strategy here.</p>

<h3>3. Identify your target audience</h3>
<p>Now that you know your big picture goals for your Instagram marketing strategy, you can start thinking about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-ad-targeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who you want to tailor your content to</a>. Check out some <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/target-market-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">target market examples</a>, and don’t be afraid to creep on your competitors’ or ideal customers’ follower and following lists. That way, you can get an idea of what types of users might see your Instagram content and how to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/27/brand-messaging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adjust your messaging</a> accordingly.</p>
<h3>4. Plan your posts</h3>
<p>Time to start brainstorming what to post when. A social media <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-calendar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing calendar</a> can come in handy during this step. You may need to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/always-on-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">factor in seasonality</a>, upcoming product launches, events, promotions, and sales to get your post ideation and planning off the ground.</p>

<h3>5. Create and publish your posts</h3>
<p>This is arguably the most fun step in the Instagram marketing process: executing on your posts! You can <strong>click the plus sign </strong>at the bottom center of your Instagram screen to start posting.</p>
<p>Instagram allows you to create posts ahead of time and save them as drafts, or you can use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/17/best-free-social-media-management-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">third-party tools</a> and marketing partners to do the heavy lifting for you when it comes to post creation, scheduling and optimization.</p>
<h3>6. Track your performance</h3>
<p>As you continue to post and engage on Instagram to promote your business, you’ll need to keep a close eye on how everything is going. You’ll probably want to use third-party tools and marketing partners for complete Instagram reports, but the first place you should go during this step is directly into the <strong>dashboard</strong> of creator tools offered within the platform.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-creator-tools.webp" alt="instagram marketing -creator tools screenshot" width="304" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94255 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-creator-tools.webp 304w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-creator-tools-152x300.webp 152w" sizes="(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px" /></p>

<h2>Our top Instagram marketing tips</h2>
<p>Once you get up and running on Instagram, keep these tips in mind.</p>
<h3>Be active and engage with content</h3>
<p>A critical step in the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/instagram-marketing-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram marketing process</a> is interacting with your followers and the people you want to follow you.</p>
<p>If you’re already posting follow-worthy content, then start liking, commenting, and following others. For instance, search popular hashtags and like away! Write complimentary comments on people’s posts and repost from others to gain attention.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> You can opt to get notifications when accounts you’re targeting share a new post, so you can interact with it sooner rather than later.</p>
<h3>Test out different types of content</h3>
<p>You might find that certain post types resonate best with different audiences. Don’t be afraid to flex your content and test as needed. For example, Reels tend to <a href="https://www.socialinsider.io/blog/instagram-benchmarks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">double</a> your reach as opposed to standard posts. So, if you’re prioritizing reach, you could post more Reels instead of image posts.</p>
<h3>Set up an Instagram Shop</h3>
<p>For businesses promoting products, an Instagram Shop is a quick and easy way to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/15/selling-on-instagram" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sell on Instagram</a>. Users can click on your Instagram Shop to make purchases without having to leave the platform. You can learn more about Instagram Shops and how to set them up <a href="https://help.instagram.com/194353285783006/?helpref=breadcrumb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/introducing-shops-on-instagram" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<h3>Sync your Instagram strategy with other marketing channels</h3>
<p>Consider how your Instagram marketing could impact your other <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-channels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promotional channels</a>, and vice versa. For example, you’ll likely want to be promoting your business’s Instagram account across other placements like your website, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-promote-your-youtube-channel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube channel</a>, and more. Additionally, always be thinking about how you can recycle other marketing materials into Instagram posts.</p>
<p>You should be striving to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/22/cross-channel-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provide a seamless cross-channel experience</a> for your potential customers, so be sure that whatever you’re posting on Instagram aligns with what you’re promoting elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Use hashtags carefully</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-use-hashtags-with-hashtag-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hashtags</a> can be a game-changer when you’re trying to get found on Instagram. However, there are some outdated hashtag practices you’ll want to avoid. It’s best to prioritize only the most popular or relevant hashtags in your post captions, as stuffing your captions with tons of custom hashtags is a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Not only that, but you might consider moving your hashtags down in your post caption so they’re not as apparent. Today, users are much more aware of how hashtags help businesses gain more traction on social media. Using them too prominently in your post captions could come off a bit “desperate” for views and likes.</p>
<h3>Try using AI</h3>
<p>There are a ton of different <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-prompts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ways you can use AI to optimize your Instagram</a> creative, brainstorm captions, and more. Whether you’re using the Meta AI features within the Instagram platform or trying out third-party AI tools, be sure to give any AI-generated content an extra edit manually to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/brand-consistency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maintain brand consistency</a> and credibility.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years, Instagram has been treated like a closed ecosystem: what you post stays on the app, and the only way to grow was through hashtags, shares, and the ever-changing (and often ambiguous) algorithm. But now, Google is indexing Instagram content—meaning your posts can show directly in search results.</p>
<p>Why would Instagram do this? What’s the opportunity for business owners and marketers? Let’s break down what’s happening, and how you can take advantage of the update.</p>

<h2>What’s happening?</h2>
<p>On July 10, 2025, many users in the app received this notification:</p>
<p><em>“Your public photos and videos may soon appear in search engine results. From 10th July 2025, search engines will automatically be allowed to show all photos and videos on result pages.”</em></p>
<p>That’s right. Google has started pulling Instagram content from professional accounts into its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/serp">search results</a>. That means your posts are no longer confined to your followers’ feeds. They can show up<strong> right where people are actively searching for answers, ideas, and inspiration</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/best-coffee-near-me-google-search-results.webp" alt="best coffee near me google search with instagram post result" width="900" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93852" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/best-coffee-near-me-google-search-results.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/best-coffee-near-me-google-search-results-480x251.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Social and search have blurred considerably in recent years. Instagram joins the likes of TikTok, YouTube, and X (among others) to index content on Google. Think about it: that carousel of brunch spots in Austin, Reel on low-impact workouts, and static post showing minimalist office setups were all once siloed within the Instagram app.</p>
<p>Today? They can all surface when someone types similar semantic queries into Google.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f50e.png" alt="🔎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Need help understanding the modern rules for SEO?</strong> Download our free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/how-to-do-seo-right?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_SEOstrategies_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links/">How to Do SEO Right—Right Now!</a></p>
<div id="why-is-instagram-indexing-content-on-google"></div>
<h2>Why Instagram is indexing content on Google</h2>
<p>From Meta’s point of view, the business case for indexing content on Google is pretty clear. Instagram has been criticized for years for the short lifespan of its content. Feed posts peak in a day or two, Stories disappear in 24 hours, and Reels burn out quickly.</p>
<p>By making posts visible in the search results, Meta extends the shelf life of that content, giving creators and brands the ability to capture traffic <strong>long after the initial posting window has passed</strong>. This makes Instagram more competitive with platforms like YouTube, Pinterest, and TikTok, where videos and pins can rank and drive discovery for months or even years.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dance-trends-google-search-results.webp" alt="dance trends google search with tiktok result highlighted" width="900" height="487" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93853" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dance-trends-google-search-results.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dance-trends-google-search-results-480x260.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The value added is so obvious that it begs the question: Why did it take them so long? Over the last few years, Meta has been consciously reshaping itself as a discovery engine, not just a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">social platform</a>. Threads launched with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO-friendly</a> public posts, Facebook Marketplace has long been indexed by Google, and now Instagram joins the mix. Add in the clear competitive pressure of losing out on visibility to the other media platforms, and this move was really a no-brainer.</p>
<div id="how-does-this-impact-creators-businesses-and-marketers"></div>
<h2>How does this impact creators, businesses, and marketers?</h2>
<p>For creators and marketers, this move increases Instagram’s value prop<strong>.</strong> A single post can now generate both social engagement <em>and</em> organic search visibility, which means a higher return on the effort it takes to produce content.</p>
<p>Until now, an Instagram post’s reach was mostly determined by the platform’s algorithm, your followers, and a bit of luck with hashtags. That meant most posts had a <em>super</em> short shelf life, often peaking within 24-48 hours before fading into the background.</p>
<p>Contrast that with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-copywriting">SEO-optimized blog posts</a>, which can drive traffic for years, sometimes tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of hits per month. With Google indexing, that same Instagram post can live far beyond its initial boost. Suddenly, that Reel you produced for your business or client can potentially accrue a lot more value if it goes evergreen on Search.</p>
<p>This is especially powerful for small businesses and local brands. According to Think With Google, <a href="https://business.google.com/us/think/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">46%</a> of all Google searches have local intent. Previously, a boutique coffee shop’s Instagram post about a new seasonal latte would mostly be seen by followers. Now, that same post gains access to all that local traffic if it can rank in the search results.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/seasonal-latte-google-search-results.webp" alt="seasonal latte google search results" width="900" height="516" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93854" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/seasonal-latte-google-search-results.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/seasonal-latte-google-search-results-480x275.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Creators also gain a new level of leverage. Building an audience on Instagram has always carried risk: if your reach gets throttled by the algorithm, your content dies on the platform. But now, your best work is no longer trapped on Instagram. That means more visibility, more followers, and more opportunities for sponsorships and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/26/partner-marketing">brand partnerships</a>.</p>
<p>The generational trend makes this even more urgent. Google itself has acknowledged that nearly <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/gen-z-prefers-tiktok-google-searches" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40%</a> of Gen Z prefer searching TikTok or Instagram over Search for things like restaurants, products, and travel ideas. By allowing posts to rank in Google, Instagram bridges that gap: it keeps Gen Z happy with in-app discovery while also meeting Google searchers where they are.</p>

<div id="how-to-take-advantage-of-indexable-instagram-content"></div>
<h2>5 ways to take advantage of indexable Instagram content</h2>
<p>It all sounds great in theory (the theory being that by effectively search-optimizing your Instagram content, you can increase exposure many times over). But do creators actually have control over that kind of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">compounding traffic</a>, or is this still just a game of luck?</p>
<p>We think they do.</p>
<p>But, first, to give your posts the chance of showing up in Google, there are a few requirements: You must have a professional account, your account must be public, and you must have enabled the setting that allows your content to be indexed (you can find this in Settings &gt; Account privacy).</p>
<p>Now that that&#8217;s out of the way, here are five strategies that you can use to rank your Instagram content high in the search results and drive more value.</p>
<div id="treat-captions-like-mini-blog-posts"></div>
<h3>1. Treat captions like mini blog posts</h3>
<p>Writing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/23/instagram-captions">Instagram captions</a> has always been a fairly casual exercise. They’re typically short, witty, or emotional. That kind of brevity and wit still has a place, but now, consider the fact that captions are going to be a key signal for search engines. Just like Google scans the body content of a blog post, it will now do the same to the keywords in your caption to determine whether your post will provide value to users in the search results.</p>
<p>Keyword density will be important. Depth, maybe even more so.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-post-caption-finalstraw.webp" alt="long instagram post caption example from finalstraw" width="454" height="850" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93855" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-post-caption-finalstraw.webp 454w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-post-caption-finalstraw-160x300.webp 160w" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px" /></p>
<p>For example, imagine you’re a fitness coach posting a Reel on “5 at-home workouts for beginners.” Instead of a vague caption like “get moving with me today,” try either transcribing your video or actually detailing the five workouts you’re talking about.</p>
<p>Your caption should explicitly mention <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/keyword-mapping">keywords</a> that drive volume on Google: queries like <em>beginner workout</em>, <em>at-home exercise</em>, or <em>fitness tips</em>. You can use Google’s Keyword Planner, Ubersuggest, or even autocomplete in the Google search bar to identify keywords to weave naturally into your captions. (You can also try <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">WordStream&#8217;s Free Keyword Tool</a> for more ideas!)</p>
<div id="optimize-alt-text-for-seo-and-accessibility"></div>
<h3>2. Optimize alt text for SEO and accessibility</h3>
<p>Instagram quietly added an alt text feature a few years ago, primarily for accessibility. Most users let Instagram auto-generate alt text, but now, marketers have a bigger incentive to customize it. Just like with website images, alt text on Instagram gives Google context about what your post contains.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-alt-text.webp" alt="instagram alt text example" width="900" height="473" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93856" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-alt-text.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-alt-text-480x252.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Let’s say you post a carousel showcasing “Minimalist Office Setup Ideas.” Instead of letting Instagram auto-tag it as “Photo of a desk,” you could write: <em>“Minimalist office setup with standing desk, white monitor, and ergonomic chair. Modern home office inspiration.”</em> This not only helps visually impaired users but also gives Google exactly the keywords it needs to rank your post.</p>
<div id="geotag-for-local-seo"></div>
<h3>3. Geotag for local SEO</h3>
<p>Nearly half of all Google searches have local intent, and <a href="https://business.google.com/us/think/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">76%</a> of people who search for something nearby on their smartphone visit a business within a day. That’s massive for brick-and-mortar stores, restaurants, and service providers. With Instagram posts now indexable, a geotag could mean your content surfaces in those local searches.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/summer-instagram-captions-home-services.webp" alt="summer instagram captions - example home services caption for summer" width="781" height="557" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91466" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/summer-instagram-captions-home-services.webp 781w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/summer-instagram-captions-home-services-480x342.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 781px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This Instagram post is geotagged for Phoenix, Arizona, and includes Arizona-related hashtags.</em></p>
<p>The takeaway? Always use location tags when posting about <strong>events, products, or services tied to a physical place</strong>. And when possible, pair your geotags with localized keywords in your caption to maximize visibility.</p>
<div id="build-evergreen-content-themes"></div>
<h3>4. Build evergreen content themes</h3>
<p>As mentioned, one of the biggest challenges with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-marketing">Instagram marketing</a> has been its content treadmill. Posts spike in engagement, then disappear in the algorithm’s black hole. Indexing changes that dynamic.</p>
<p>For marketers, that means rethinking <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-plan">content strategy</a>. Instead of only chasing trends, try deliberately building a library of posts around evergreen themes relevant to your brand. For example, a skincare brand might post Reels about “morning skincare routines,” “how to apply retinol,” or “best sunscreens for sensitive skin.” Those topics get searched year-round, giving your posts long-tail relevance in Google.</p>
<p>As an added layer to your current trends strategy, try identifying 5–10 <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/10/16/guide-to-evergreen-content-marketing">evergreen themes</a> in your industry using keyword research. Create Instagram posts around these topics consistently, so you build a bank of content with lasting value in both places.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Get copy-and-paste social media posts ready for the whole year</strong> in our <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteMonthlySocialMediaCalendarTemplate.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Template_MonthlySocialMediaCalendar_Download">free social media template</a>!</p>
<div id="encourage-engagement-as-a-ranking-signal"></div>
<h3>5. Encourage engagement as a ranking signal</h3>
<p>While Google doesn’t use Instagram “likes” directly in its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-algorithm">algorithm</a>, engagement still matters. Posts that get more comments, shares, and saves are more likely to be surfaced by Instagram, and that visibility in turn boosts signals to Google that the content is relevant. In other words, an engaged audience still helps your post rank better.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/vuori-instagram-post-example.webp" alt="vuori instagram post example with lots of engagement" width="900" height="662" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93857" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/vuori-instagram-post-example.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/vuori-instagram-post-example-480x353.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Marketers should treat engagement prompts as part of their SEO strategy. Instead of ending a caption with “Thoughts?” try something more specific: “Which of these office setups could you see yourself working in? Comment below!” or “Tag a friend who needs a new at-home workout routine.” These <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/13/call-to-action-examples">calls-to-action</a> not only drive comments, but also send positive signals that your post is worth surfacing.</p>
<div id="prevent-instagram-indexing"></div>
<h2>How to keep your Instagram content from being indexed on Google</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve talked about what to do to get your Instagram posts found on Google, but what if you DON&#8217;T want your content to show there? You have a couple of options:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Set your profile to private.</strong> Google will not index private Instagram profiles (and they also are not currently indexing personal Instagram account posts&#8211;only professional ones). We don&#8217;t really recommend this approach for business accounts, because it will limit who can see your posts within the app and create a barrier to entry for growing your page.</li>
<li><strong>Disable the indexing setting.</strong> If you don&#8217;t want to set your account to private but you also don&#8217;t want your posts indexed, you can toggle this setting off. Simply go to Settings &gt; Account privacy and then toggle off &#8220;Allow public photos and videos to appear in search results.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-index-settings.webp" alt="instagram indexing settings" width="900" height="502" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93864" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-index-settings.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-index-settings-480x268.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>Drive cross-channel value on Instagram</h2>
<p>For years, Instagram has been a closed loop: your content lived and died within the app. With Google now indexing content, marketers finally have a way to extend the lifespan of Instagram content and connect with audiences beyond their followers.</p>
<p>While that doesn’t mean you should turn every post into a blog article, it does mean you should be intentional about your strategy. The marketers who learn to balance creativity with SEO will be the ones whose Instagram content not only trends but also earns a lasting spot on Google.</p>

<div id="what-is-the-instagram-algorithm"></div>
<h2>What is the Instagram algorithm?</h2>
<p>The Instagram algorithm is a set of instructions that decides when to display a particular <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-to-post-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">piece of content</a> to an individual user. It continuously reviews and assesses a user’s behavior with the goal of improving their experience on the platform.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-panel1.webp" alt="Instagram algorithm - Explore Page." width="644" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92638 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-panel1.webp 644w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-panel1-480x447.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 644px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Whether you’re searching or scrolling, the Instagram algorithm decides which content ends up on your screen.</em></p>
<p>In more practical terms, the Instagram algorithm acts like a personalized content curator, showing you what it thinks you&#8217;ll like most across your feed, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/instagram-story-ideas/">Stories</a>, Explore page, and Reels. It learns from how you interact with the content it shows you to predict which content and creators will keep you engaged and encourage you to spend more time on the app.</p>
<p>This is a really important concept for marketers to understand. The algorithm’s primary goal is to keep users engaged in the app. If your content serves that purpose, it’ll show it to more people more often. We’ll dig <em>way</em> into how to align your goals with the algorithm throughout this guide.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Not sure what to post on Instagram?</strong> Get the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/social-media-calendar-template?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Template_MonthlySocialMediaCalendar_Download">Copy &amp; Paste Social Media Calendar</a> for a year’s worth of ideas.</p>
<div id="how-does-the-instagram-algorithm-work"></div>
<h2>How does the Instagram algorithm work?</h2>
<p>In general terms, the Instagram algorithm uses a set of signals, or ranking factors, to prioritize the content it places at the top of a user’s feed.</p>
<p>But that’s not the whole story. There isn&#8217;t just one Instagram algorithm. It’s actually a collection of algorithms, processes, and classifiers that prioritize content. And increasingly, <a href="https://transparency.meta.com/features/explaining-ranking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI does the job</a> more than algorithmic code.</p>
<p>Each part of the app, such as your main feed, Stories, Explore page, and Reels, has its own method for selecting your content and sometimes uses different signals to do so. As you expand the type of content you post on Instagram, it’ll help to know how each one works.</p>
<div id="top-instagram-ranking-factors"></div>
<h2>Top Instagram algorithm ranking factors</h2>
<p>Things get real murky when you look under the hood of Instagram’s decision-making AI systems. For our purposes, the most important thing to remember is that it still relies on a set of ranking factors to inform its decisions. And that’s what we can use to nudge our content up to the top.</p>
<p>To that point, three ranking factors play the most significant roles in how Instagram prioritizes content.</p>
<h3>Relationship between creator and viewer</h3>
<p>If you’ve interacted with content from a creator, Instagram is more likely to place more of their content in your feed. As a marketer, that’s why it’s so important to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/27/how-to-increase-instagram-engagement">get engagement</a> on your content. The more likes, comments, and shares you get, the more often your posts will be visible.</p>
<h3>User interest</h3>
<p>This ranking factor is based on the type of content a user typically interacts with. If someone engages with content that’s similar to yours (or a creator that’s similar to you), the algorithm will show them your posts more often.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-yarn.webp" alt="Instagram algorithm - Instagram post about knitting." width="378" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92639 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-yarn.webp 378w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-yarn-189x300.webp 189w" sizes="(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Into knitting? Expect to see content from new knitters on Instagram.</em></p>
<h3>Relevancy</h3>
<p>Instagram assigns a relevancy score to every piece of content. It’s based on factors like recency and connection to trending topics. Consistent publishing and staying up-to-date with trends will help your content succeed.</p>
<h3>Adherence to guidelines</h3>
<p>While not officially a ranking factor, content that <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">violates Instagram’s<a href="https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Community Standards</a> will be withheld</span> from showing up on users’ feeds. It’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with what Instagram considers unacceptable content.</p>
<div id="instagram-ranking-factors-by-platform-feature"></div>
<h2>Instagram ranking factors by platform feature</h2>
<p>There are different rules and signals for each feature in the app. Notice, though, that they all fall into two buckets: How have other users treated this content so far? And how has this user behaved in the past?</p>
<h3>2025 Instagram Feed algorithm</h3>
<p>Instagram uses a dedicated AI called the <a href="https://transparency.meta.com/features/explaining-ranking/ig-feed/?referrer=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram Feed AI system</a> to select, rank, and deliver content to your feed.</p>
<p>Here’s how the system works. When you log in, the system gathers 500 posts from accounts you follow. Then it uses a model to predict which you’ll “find most relevant and valuable.” And finally, the AI assigns a relevance score to each post and places them in order by that score (with a little nudge to make sure you’re seeing a variety of content).</p>
<p>Here are some of the predictions the AI system makes and some of the signals that influence it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How likely are you to reshare a post?</strong>
<ul>
<li>How often you’ve shared that creator’s posts in the past.</li>
<li>How many times that post has already been shared.</li>
<li>How many times you’ve shared any post.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How likely are you to click on the profile of the post’s author?</strong>
<ul>
<li>How many times you’ve viewed the creator’s profile and posts in the past.</li>
<li>How many times the creator’s profile has been clicked by followers.</li>
<li>How many times users in general have clicked on the creator’s profile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How likely are you to spend 10 seconds on the first post? </strong>
<ul>
<li>How much time you’ve spent viewing the creator’s posts.</li>
<li>How many videos you’ve viewed.</li>
<li>How many times you’ve viewed the creator’s content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For marketers, the key takeaway is that if your content is generating clicks, shares, and views, it’ll likely receive more exposure on Instagram. Check out the tips later on to see how you can give that process a boost.</p>
<h3>2025 Instagram Reels algorithm</h3>
<p>For Reels, the AI system behind ranking and displaying content is called <a href="https://transparency.meta.com/features/explaining-ranking/ig-reels-chaining/?referrer=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram Reels Chaining</a>.</p>
<p>Just like with the Instagram Feed AI system, there is a similar list of predictions and influential signals for Reels. However, Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, recently provided a more impactful and succinct explanation of ranking on Reels.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-adam.webp" alt="Instagram algorithm - Instagram post from head of Instagram." width="671" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92640 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-adam.webp 671w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-adam-480x429.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 671px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFFyRp-pINJ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>In his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFFyRp-pINJ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram post</a>, Adam first explained the two types of rankings on Instagram:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connected reach:</strong> The accounts that follow you.</li>
<li><strong>Unconnected reach:</strong> The accounts that don’t follow you yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, he listed the three most important metrics creators should follow to improve their Reels rankings and why they’re important to Instagram.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Average watch time:</strong> The average amount of time a Reel is watched by all users. It tells Instagram how much of a video a user is likely to watch.</li>
<li><strong>Likes per reach:</strong> The ratio of likes a real received compared to the number of unique accounts that have seen it. This tells Instagram whether future users are likely to enjoy a video.</li>
<li><strong>Sends per reach:</strong> The number of times a video has been shared via direct message, compared to the number of unique accounts that have seen the Reel. This helps predict whether a user will share a video with other accounts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2025 Instagram Stories algorithm</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://transparency.meta.com/features/explaining-ranking/ig-stories/?referrer=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram Stories AI system</a> shares some crossover with the Feed AI system. Here are a few of the predictions and signals that are unique to how Stories are ranked:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How likely are you to click on a Story that appears at the top of your page? </strong>
<ul>
<li>How much time you spend viewing Stories.</li>
<li>How many Stories you’ve viewed from that account.</li>
<li>How often you view posts from the Story’s creator.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How likely is it that you and the Story’s creator are closely connected?</strong>
<ul>
<li>How many times you’ve reacted to the creator’s Stories in the past.</li>
<li>Your stated relationship to the creator.</li>
<li>The number of messages you’ve exchanged with the creator.</li>
<li>Your connection to the creator on Facebook.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How likely are you to click to reply to a Story after viewing it?</strong>
<ul>
<li>How much time you’ve spent viewing the creator’s Stories.</li>
<li>How many times you’ve interacted with the creator’s Stories.</li>
<li>How many Stories you have not seen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How likely are you to send a like?</strong>
<ul>
<li>How many of the creator’s posts you have clicked to like.</li>
<li>The first type of reaction you had to a post in the group.</li>
<li>The number of times you’ve viewed a Story by that creator.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2025 Instagram Explore Page algorithm</h3>
<p>And finally, there’s the<a href="https://transparency.meta.com/features/explaining-ranking/ig-explore/?referrer=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Instagram Explore Page AI system</a>. Since the Explore Page is where users go to find content from accounts they don’t follow yet, understanding this algorithm is crucial for follower growth.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-explore-panel.webp" alt="Instagram algorithm - Explore Page" width="365" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92641 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-explore-panel.webp 365w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-explore-panel-183x300.webp 183w" sizes="(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The Explore Page is where new viewers can spot your content.</em></p>
<p>Before content is scored and ranked for a user&#8217;s Explore Page experience, it undergoes an initial filtering process. Specifically, Instagram creates a list of 1,500 photos and videos for possible selection. Instagram’s AI then trims the list based on user behavior and features of the content. What ends up in the Explore grid is content that the user is most likely to engage with.</p>
<p>The Explore recommendation engine uses a very long list of predictions and ranking factors. Here are a few of the ones you should know about:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How much time will you likely spend watching a Reel?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The total amount of time people have spent watching the Reel.</li>
<li>The authors of videos you’ve watched in the past.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Are you likely to click “like” on a Reel?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Reels you’ve clicked to like before.</li>
<li>The authors you tended to give likes to before.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How likely are you to follow the author of a Reel?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Which authors you’ve followed in the past.</li>
<li>The number of followers the author received through the Reel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>8 tips to use the Instagram algorithm to your advantage</h2>
<p>When it comes to the Instagram algorithm, knowing is half the battle. Doing is the other half. So let&#8217;s apply what we’ve learned to some<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/09/instagram-marketing-strategy"> Instagram strategies</a> that’ll help your content reach more users’ screens.</p>
<h3>1. Post at the right time</h3>
<p>When you publish content on Instagram matters for two reasons.</p>
<p>First off, recency is an important ranking signal for the Instagram algorithm. So if you post around the times your audience is looking, yours will be the freshest content available.</p>
<p>Second, you’ll have a better chance of getting some initial engagement on new content early if you post at the right time. Since Instagram likes to show us content that other users have liked and shared, that early bump could snowball into more views.</p>
<p>Here’s a guide that’ll help you figure out the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/12/01/best-time-to-post-on-instagram">best time to post on Instagram</a> for your brand based on several studies.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-time.webp" alt="Instagram algorithm - when to post chart." width="897" height="424" class="aligncenter wp-image-92940 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-time.webp 897w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-time-480x227.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 897px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>2. Post for engagement</h3>
<p>Instagram mentions engagement in almost every discussion of how its algorithms and AI systems rank content. Getting more likes, shares, and comments should be a top priority for all the content you publish there.</p>
<p>Here are some ways you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/27/how-to-increase-instagram-engagement">boost the engagement</a> on your Instagram posts, Stories, and Reels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publish quizzes, questions, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/04/instagram-story-ads-polls">polls</a> that encourage a response.</li>
<li>Post current topics people want to talk about.</li>
<li>Review the<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/social-media-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> analytics</a> for various content types to determine which ones are most effective.</li>
<li>Use carousel posts, as they<a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/instagram-carousels/379311/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> tend to receive higher engagement</a> on average.</li>
<li>Run <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/giveaway-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contests and giveaways</a> for likes and shares.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-giveaway.webp" alt="Instagram algorithm - Giveaway post" width="382" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92642 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-giveaway.webp 382w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-giveaway-191x300.webp 191w" sizes="(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Use </em><em>giveaways like this to expand your following and quickly generate a high level of engagement.</em></p>
<h3>3. Loop your Reels</h3>
<p>Here’s a little hack to increase the time people spend watching your videos: loop them.</p>
<p>Looping a video means it automatically replays from the beginning without a pause. Many people who view it will let it roll a few times before moving on, effectively doubling or tripling your average view time.</p>
<p>To loop a Reel, make the end flow into the beginning so it seems to go on forever.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-loop-1.webp" alt="Instagram algorithm - Loop post on Instagram" width="277" height="489" class="aligncenter wp-image-92644 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-loop-1.webp 277w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-loop-1-170x300.webp 170w" sizes="(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px" /></p>
<h3>4. Be active in the comments</h3>
<p>Another way to multiply those engagement numbers and catch the algorithm’s attention is by jumping into the conversations happening on your content.</p>
<p>When someone comments on your post, reply to them as quickly as possible. Ideally, they’ll respond to you, and you’ll get credit for more engagement.</p>
<p>You can really go big here and tag another account in your caption or comments. That’ll encourage them to respond and maybe even pull in some of their followers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-questions.webp" alt="Instagram algorithm - Brand answering questions in Instagram." width="413" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92647 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-questions.webp 413w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-questions-207x300.webp 207w" sizes="(max-width: 413px) 100vw, 413px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Answering questions is good for engagement, ranking, and sales.</em></p>
<h3>5. Create content people want to share and save</h3>
<p>Sharing is another strong signal to the Instagram algorithm that people like what you publish. Plan to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/13/content-creation">create content</a> that&#8217;s designed to be shared, and watch your impressions soar!</p>
<p>What type of content is shared the most? That’ll depend on your specific audience. But humor is a great place to start. Find some inside jokes that your followers will relate to, and they’ll hit the share button on it hard.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-humor.webp" alt="Instagram algorithm - Real estate Instagram joke post." width="338" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92645 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-humor.webp 338w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-humor-169x300.webp 169w" sizes="(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A little inside humor will get shared amongst your followers.</em></p>
<p>Don’t forget about content saves—they also tell the algorithm to get your posts in front of more people. Think about the type of information you save for later. Sure, it could also be funny posts. But how-to content, such as recipes and DIY videos, is also a good option, as people often need to refer back to it as they work on the task.</p>
<h3>6. Use Instagram SEO</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/products/search-engine-optimization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO</a> isn’t just for Google (although you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-posts-indexed-on-google">optimize your Instagram posts</a> to get found on search). Instagram has a keyword search function, which means you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/07/instagram-seo">optimize your content and account</a> to take advantage of it. And if you’re the top post for popular searches, you’ll get more views and engagement, which feeds into Instagram’s content ranking process.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-bio.webp" alt="Instagram algorithm - Instagram profile." width="840" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92646 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-bio.webp 840w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-bio-480x343.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 840px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Work your most important keywords into your profile bio.</em></p>
<p>Here’s how to do SEO on Instagram:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keyword research:</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">Find broad and niche keywords</a> your audience would search for to find content like yours.</li>
<li><strong>Optimize your profile:</strong> Include relevant keywords in your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/09/instagram-bios"> bio</a> and, if possible, your username.</li>
<li><strong>Optimize your posts:</strong> Use more of those keywords in your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/instagram-captions-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">captions</a>, voiceover scripts, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags">hashtags</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Optimize your images: </strong>Add even more keywords to your image alt texts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Publish a variety of content</h3>
<ol start="7"></ol>
<p>As we’ve seen, Instagram has a different ranking system for every content type on the app, and they all interconnect (likes to posts can boost your Reels, for example).</p>
<p>To get the entire ranking machine working in your favor, keep a steady flow of different types of content in your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/social-media-marketing-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media</a> publishing calendar.</p>
<p>Tight on time? Try <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-repurposing">repurposing content</a>. Pull a still image from a Reel and use it as a static post. Or post part of a longer feed video to your Stories. With a bit of creativity, you can increase how often you publish on Instagram without a lot more work.</p>
<h3>8. Promote your Instagram account</h3>
<p>While your Instagram account will help promote your business, you can flip the script and use your business to<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-promote-your-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> promote your account</a> (and multiply your viewer and follower counts).</p>
<p>Here are several ways to get more eyes on your Instagram content:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In email: </strong>Let your subscribers know there’s more great content available on your Instagram account</li>
<li><strong>On your website: </strong>Add links to your account and preview some of the content there.</li>
<li><strong>On other social networks: </strong>Have a big Facebook or TikTok audience? Ask them to follow you on Instagram, too.</li>
<li><strong>In-person:</strong> If you have a physical location or local customers, post scannable signs or cards that link to your account.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-promote.webp" alt="Instagram algorithm - Instagram images on a website." width="936" height="472" class="aligncenter wp-image-92648 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-promote.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-promote-480x242.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>Make the Instagram algorithm work for you</h2>
<p>Believe it or not, you and Instagram are on the same team. The app wants to keep people scrolling and watching longer. You want more people to spend more time with your brand. Work with the app, instead of trying to game it, and you’ll have a much smoother road to success.</p>
<p>The key to success is momentum. If you can increase your follower count, views, and engagements early on, you’ll be aligned with Instagram’s mission, and your next round of content will be ranked higher. Follow the eight tips we provided, measure the results, make adjustments, and repeat. And get even better results if when you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-algorithm">understand the Facebook algorithm</a>.</p>

<p>The first distinction to make is how to target only Instagram. Instagram is owned by Meta, and its ads are placed on the same platform, which includes Facebook. By default, all campaigns will target both Facebook and Instagram together, so segmenting them out takes a little additional setup (read here if you’re interested in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/13/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-world">Facebook ad targeting options</a>).</p>
<p>During campaign creation, the platform targeting settings will live in the Placement section of the ad set builder. Start by hovering over the default setting of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/meta-advantage-plus">Advantage+</a> placements and click the edit pencil in the upper right.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-placements-1.webp" alt="Instagram-ad-targeting-Ads Manager screen for placement choice." width="833" height="346" class="aligncenter wp-image-86846 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-placements-1.webp 833w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-placements-1-480x199.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 833px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>From there, select manual placements, then uncheck the boxes next to all of the platforms other than Instagram. Now, your ads will only show on the Instagram feed, Explore, Explore home, Stories, Reels, and search results.</p>

<div id="instagram-ad-targeting-by-audience"></div>
<h2>Instagram ad targeting by audience</h2>
<p>The first type of targeting you come across in the ad set settings is audience controls, but to actually use them, we need to scroll down the page a little bit.</p>
<p>In the Advantage+ audience section, we need to turn off Advantage+ to leverage the individual targets. To do that, click “Switch to original audience options” at the bottom right. Meta will then ask if you’re sure, and yes, you’re sure.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-switch-audience.webp" alt="Instagram-ad-targeting-Ads Manager screen with Audience targeting shown." width="847" height="387" class="aligncenter wp-image-86848 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-switch-audience.webp 847w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-switch-audience-480x219.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 847px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Once you’ve done that, we can move on to the custom audiences section. This section actually leverages two types of audiences: <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/12/11/facebook-custom-audience-strategy">custom audiences</a> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-lookalike-audiences">lookalike audiences</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-custom.webp" alt="Instagram ad targeting Ads Manager screen for custom audiences" width="806" height="304" class="aligncenter wp-image-86849 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-custom.webp 806w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-custom-480x181.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 806px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>To cover those, we’re going to hop into the audiences section within Ads Manager. In the menu on the far left, either click the shortcut to audiences, or if that’s not listed in the shortcuts, you can find it in the far right column.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-all-tools.webp" alt="Instagram ad targeting Ads Manager screen with all audience options." width="877" height="490" class="aligncenter wp-image-86850 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-all-tools.webp 877w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-all-tools-480x268.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 877px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Custom audiences</h3>
<p>Let’s start with custom audiences. When you create a new custom audience, you’re grouping users based on actions they’ve taken in the past. This is similar to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/12/04/adwords-remarketing-best-practices-guide">remarketing</a> since you’ll be serving ads to people who have engaged with your brand already.</p>
<p>Website is the first option under sources. It lets you create a list of users who have visited your site and taken certain actions there.</p>
<p>There are many different actions to choose from depending on your chosen source. Since this is a post about Instagram targeting, let’s choose the Instagram account option to use as our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/target-audience-examples">example</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-audience-source.webp" alt="Instagram ad targeting Ads Manager screen with custom audience options." width="754" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-86851 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-audience-source.webp 754w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-audience-source-480x382.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 754px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>With Instagram, you can create audiences of users who have engaged with your profile, seen certain posts as ads, and a few other options. These custom audiences help you create lists of users to re-engage with and can narrow your audience to a very small group of people if you so wish.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-actions.webp" alt="Instagram ad targeting Ads Manager screen highlighting custom audience selection." width="574" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-86852 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-actions.webp 574w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-actions-480x502.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 574px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Lookalike audiences</h3>
<p>The second type of audience is called a lookalike audience, and it’s designed to be a true prospecting targeting type, meaning it’s intended to generate an audience of new users and not target anyone you could put in a custom audience.</p>
<p>In fact, the first thing you select when creating a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-lookalike-audiences">lookalike audience</a> is a custom audience source. The Meta Ads platform will analyze the source audience you provide, then put together a group of users that look and behave like those users on Facebook and Instagram. This is your lookalike audience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-lookalike.webp" alt="Instagram ad targeting Ads Manager screen for choosing a lookalike audience." width="700" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-86853 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-lookalike.webp 700w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-lookalike-480x411.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Once you’ve added your source audience, choose the country in which you will use the list. Lastly, you can determine the size of your Lookalike audience by choosing a percentage of the country’s population that you chose before. For the United States, about 280M people are on the Meta Ads platform, so a 1% model gives us about 2.8M users to target in the lookalike audience.</p>
<p>This type of targeting has been Meta’s bread and butter for a long time and has historically performed very well for them. It’s also a personal favorite of mine as it leverages advertiser-provided lists and Meta’s machine learning to find new customers.</p>
<p>After creating your custom or lookalike audience, you can return to it by selecting it from the custom audience drop-down menu in the ad set settings.</p>

<div id="manual-instagram-ad-targeting"></div>
<h2>Manual Instagram ad targeting</h2>
<p>As we move further down the page, we come to the targeting options that we can still choose manually but that aren’t audiences. Each of these sections is a group of users Meta provides based on information about them, their whereabouts, their interests, or their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/28/behavioral-segmentation">behaviors</a>.</p>
<h3>Location</h3>
<p>Instagram ads can be targeted to users based on their location. Advertisers can set the location by country, region, state, city, postal code, address, DMA, or congressional district level. Pretty much whatever your targeting preferences are, there’s an option to use that for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/instagram-advertising">Instagram ads</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-locations-map.webp" alt="Instagram ad targeting Ads Manager screen with location map." width="823" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-86856 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-locations-map.webp 823w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-locations-map-480x350.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 823px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Age and gender</h3>
<p>The next targeting setting is around the most basic demographic information: age and gender.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-gender.webp" alt="Instagram ad targeting Ads Manager screen for choosing age and gender." width="815" height="301" class="aligncenter wp-image-86857 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-gender.webp 815w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-gender-480x177.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 815px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For age, you can select any age from 13 to 65+ in single-year increments, meaning you can choose 17 to 56-year-olds, 23 to 27-year-olds, or whatever ages make the most sense for your target audience.</p>
<h3>Advantage detailed targeting</h3>
<p>The last section of manual targeting we have lets you target very <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/10/20/facebook-audience">specific audiences</a>. In this group, we’ll have three distinct types of targeting.</p>
<p>Click the browse button on the right side of the search bar, and you’ll see them at a high level.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-advantage-detailed-targeting.webp" alt="Instagram ad targeting Ads Manager screen for Advantage audience targeting choice." width="816" height="331" class="aligncenter wp-image-86859 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-advantage-detailed-targeting.webp 816w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-advantage-detailed-targeting-480x195.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 816px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Demographics</h4>
<p>This section has much more detailed demographic targeting than just the location, age, and gender options we had before.</p>
<p>If we click on the dropdown, we’ll see the high-level categories for education, finances, life events, parents, relationships, and work.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-demographics.webp" alt="Instagram ad targeting Ads Manager screen with demographic options." width="639" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-86860 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-demographics.webp 639w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-demographics-480x451.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 639px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here’s where you can target parents based on how old their kids are, whether someone is married or single, and if they have a birthday coming up.</p>
<h4>Behaviors</h4>
<p>I’m going to skip to the third option on the list for just a second. (We’ll come back to Interests in a minute.)</p>
<p>Behaviors are slightly different because the options will change based on your existing audience. Nearly all accounts I’ve looked at have different lists available, but this is where you’ll target users based on how Meta knows they act. This could include when their anniversary is coming up, whether they’ve started a business recently, or if they’re what Meta calls “Engaged Shoppers.”</p>
<p>One of my favorite behavior targeting options is travel. You can target users based on who commutes to work, who travels frequently, and how recently they got home from a trip. It&#8217;s a little wild but pretty cool if you’re in that space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-travel.webp" alt="Instagram ad targeting Ads Manager screen with travel audience options." width="854" height="453" class="aligncenter wp-image-86861 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-travel.webp 854w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-travel-480x255.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 854px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Interests</h4>
<p>Now, let’s pop back up to interest targeting. These are all topics that Meta users have shown an interest in based on the posts they’ve engaged with on Facebook or Instagram, as well as sites they’ve visited that are part of the Meta Ads Network.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-interests.webp" alt="Instagram ad targeting Ads Manager screen with interests options." width="852" height="457" class="aligncenter wp-image-86862 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-interests.webp 852w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-interests-480x257.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 852px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you open the dropdown, you can find many options to target here. They can be tough to sort through because there are so many, and some are pretty broad.</p>
<p>Instead, I’d suggest you use the search functionality in the bar at the top.</p>
<p>If I look for photography manually, I click through the arts and music section, then the hobbies and activities section. But if I search for it, it comes up with several variations.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-photography.webp" alt="Instagram ad targeting Ads Manager screen showing photography sub-groups." width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-86863 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-photography.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-wordstream-photography-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here, I can target people based on their interest in photography and choose a specific subtype of photography, whether for weddings, travel, or just digital photography in general. You’ll always have quite a few more options showing up if you use the search function, but it’ll also show you options for demographics, behaviors, and interests all in one view.</p>
<div id="instagram-ad-targeting-using-advantage-audience"></div>
<h2>Instagram ad targeting using Advantage+ audience</h2>
<p>The last type of targeting for Instagram ads leverages Meta’s machine learning. It’s the newest option for targeting, called Advantage+ audience, and there are two ways you can use it.</p>
<h3>Fully automated</h3>
<p>The first option is likely Meta’s preferred option, but it’s certainly not mine by default. With Advantage+ audience, you can simply create a campaign and ad set, add no additional targeting, and turn your ads on to let Meta handle all the targeting automatically.</p>
<p>The trick to this performing well is your goal and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/10/11/facebook-conversion-tracking">conversion tracking</a>. The first portion of the ad set builder will focus on conversion settings. Make sure your conversion event and conversion event location settings are correct, and ideally, you have a decent amount of performance volume coming through. This is likely in the 30-50 conversions per week range. If you have that, you have a much better chance of seeing decent performance with the Advantage+ audience without any guidance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-conversion.webp" alt="Instagram ad targeting Ads Manager screen with conversion event choices." width="643" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-86864 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-conversion.webp 643w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-conversion-480x448.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 643px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Advertiser guided</h3>
<p>I prefer the advertiser-assisted approach.</p>
<p>When you opt into Advantage+ audience, you’ll see an option to add an audience suggestion. Choose it, and you’ll be directed to use the exact same builder you were for all of the manual and audience targets we’ve already talked about. But rather than using these as the only audience you’ll reach on Instagram, Meta uses it as a starting point before searching more widely for similar audiences.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-advantage-audience-1.webp" alt="Instagram ad targeting Ads Manager screen with Advantage audience guided option." width="855" height="393" class="aligncenter wp-image-86865 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-advantage-audience-1.webp 855w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/instagram-ad-targeting-advantage-audience-1-480x221.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 855px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In my experience, Advantage+ audience with advertiser guidance performs pretty well and can be a great way to make sure you have your hand in the direction of your advertising. It also lets Meta’s intelligent machine learning find new users you might not have thought of before.</p>
<h2>Pick the Instagram Ad Targeting that suits you best</h2>
<p>There’s no right or wrong way to reach your audience on Instagram. You can be fully hands-on with the audience and manual targets or completely hands-off and use the fully automated Advantage+ audience. Like many advertisers, you could be somewhere in the middle and provide some guidance to Meta’s algorithms.</p>
<p>Which you choose and how you manage it will determine how well your ads perform on Instagram.

<h2>Why does Instagram ad copy matter?</h2>
<p>Instagram is primarily a visual platform, so it’s easy to wonder why you should be <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/19/copywriting-skills" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spending time improving your copywriting</a> rather than focusing on your videos, photos, and graphics.</p>
<p>Well, <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/long-instagram-captions-experiment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a study</a> on the impact of Instagram caption length found that a longer caption directly correlated with more engagement. This is in organic posts, rather than ads. But it goes to show that even on a platform dominated by visuals, your copy matters.</p>
<p>In terms of Instagram ads specifically, it&#8217;s also<a href="https://www.brafton.com/blog/social-media/social-advertising-benchmarks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> been found</a> that in-feed ads perform better than Stories ads. They found that the click-through rate (CTR) for feed ads on Instagram ranges between 0.22% and 0.88%, and the CTR for Stories ads varies between 0.33% and 0.54%. A big difference between in-feed and Stories ads? The copy requirements.</p>
<p>Still, users report that Instagram Stories with a narrative including photos, videos, and text are the most appealing—and the most likely to get them to keep clicking through.</p>

<h2>12 tips for writing high-converting Instagram ad copy</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s how you can start writing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/13/instagram-best-practices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram ads that guarantee increased conversion rates</a> for your business.</p>
<h3>1. Stick to Instagram ad guidelines</h3>
<p>The first step to writing Instagram <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/03/ad-copy-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ad copy that converts</a> is sticking to the guidelines. There’s no sense wasting your time writing a quippy narrative description that’s going to get cut off before the product is mentioned—or, say, name-dropping that celebrity if it isn’t going to make the strict character limit and grab some eyes in the feed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-name-drop.webp" alt="instagram ad copy example - cuddle and kind" width="402" height="604" class="aligncenter wp-image-85231 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-name-drop.webp 402w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-name-drop-200x300.webp 200w" sizes="(max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px" /></p>

<h3>2. Know your goal</h3>
<p>When you’re<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/03/how-to-write-exceptional-ppc-ad-copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> writing an ad</a>, it’s important to know your goal. Do you want to persuade a customer to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/15/selling-on-instagram" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> click a link and complete a purchase</a>? Do you want a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new customer to learn about your services</a>? The way you’d approach writing the copy for these two examples would be really different. That’s why<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/15/marketing-objectives" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> knowing your goal</a> before writing the copy is key.</p>
<p>When you’re advertising on Instagram, you’ll set objectives for your ads. This keeps the goal clear while you’re creating the ads, when Meta is serving them to viewers, and when you&#8217;re measuring their performance. Here are the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-objectives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ad objectives that Meta offers for Instagram</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Awareness:</strong> If you need more people to know your brand, this is your goal. When you select this, Meta will serve your ad to the largest number of people because it’s the least targeted.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic:</strong> You want people to click a link to a specific page—whether it’s your brand’s social profile, a specific piece of content, or a product page.</li>
<li><strong>Engagement: </strong>This ad objective directs Meta to serve the ad to Instagram users most likely to engage with your brand and your brand’s content in direct messages, comments, and likes.</li>
<li><strong>Leads: </strong>This objective collects email addresses and other information from people interested in your brand, your content, and your offering.</li>
<li><strong>App promotion: </strong>If you want people to download an app, you want them to be on their phones. When you select this objective, Meta will serve your ad only to Instagram users who are on their phones.</li>
<li><strong>Sales: </strong>You want people who are ready to buy to see your ad. It’s a smaller subset, but that’s because it’s more targeted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Selecting the right ad objective will direct Meta to serve the ads appropriately on Instagram. Keeping this goal in mind while you write will help you better persuade your audience into an action—whether it’s stopping a scroll to recognize your brand name, clicking a link, or even adding an item to a cart.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Are you using the right campaign objective and ad copy for your Facebook strategy?</strong> Find out how your ads are currently performing with our free <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-advertising?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FBGrader_FBGrader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Ads Grader</a>!</p>
<h3>3. Choose the right CTA</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing copywriting</a>, your goal is to prompt an action. When you’re writing an Instagram ad, you want to close with a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/powerful-call-to-action-phrases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compelling call to actio</a>n—so it’s important to choose the right one.</p>
<p>Now, we’re saying that you need to “choose” the right CTA here intentionally. When you’re creating an Instagram ad, you’ll have to select a call to action based on your designated ad objective. This is limiting, but luckily there are lots of options.</p>
<p>Some CTAs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn More</li>
<li>Listen More</li>
<li>Order Now</li>
<li>Send WhatsA Message</li>
<li>Send Message</li>
<li>Request Time</li>
<li>See Menu</li>
<li>Shop Now</li>
<li>Sign Up</li>
<li>Subscribe</li>
<li>Watch More</li>
<li>Get Quote</li>
<li>Apply Now</li>
<li>Book Now</li>
<li>Contact Us</li>
<li>Download</li>
<li>Get Showtimes</li>
</ul>
<p>The options that you’ll see for an individual Instagram ad will vary depending on your ad objective.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-cta-example-1.webp" alt="instagram ad copy - example instagram cta" width="412" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-85225 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-cta-example-1.webp 412w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-cta-example-1-206x300.webp 206w" sizes="(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A great example of a specific CTA with “Get quote” in this ad.</em></p>
<h3>4. Speak to your audience</h3>
<p>One of the biggest benefits of running ads on Instagram is the opportunity to reach your target audience. Instagram has over <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1882/instagram/#topicOverview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 billion active monthly users</a>, so your potential customers are definitely on the app. And with Meta’s ad targeting options for Instagram, you can make sure your ads get in front of the right people.</p>
<p>So when you’re crafting your copy, you need to write directly for your audience specifically. What are they worried about? What are they motivated by? What will make them stop scrolling and read your full ad? What key words do you want to appear first in that caption or even in the creative?</p>
<p>Take this example from <a href="https://piccalio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Piccalio</a>, which has been on my Instagram feed for months now since I’ve been shopping for toddler towers. This brand has a great description of on its website: “Piccalio is an online children&#8217;s part-toy, part-furniture shop designed for learning and play.” The part-toy, part-furniture pieces are pricey when compared to other options on the market, Green Guard certified, and available in neutral wood tones, which appear in almost all the photos. Some are also available in other colors, including black or mint green, but these rarely make the website photos or the Instagram feed—a commitment to the brand aesthetics.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that the copy in this Instagram ad is also an excellent commitment to the brand identity and speaks directly to its audience: Busy parents with some disposable income and a desire to help their toddler learn in a fun, safe setting. And maybe without adding any more bulking plastic clutter or garish bright colors to their home.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-example.webp" alt="instagram ad copy - example personalized instagram ad copy" width="399" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-85226 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-example.webp 399w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-example-200x300.webp 200w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /></p>
<p>The ad copy urges the reader to “find out” for themselves why the Helper Tower is beloved by so many parents who made the purchase for their own kids. It explains that this tower will help you teach your child valuable skills in the kitchen. Here, the wording is particular. It doesn’t say that this tower will help your kid learn—it promises the opportunity to spend quality time while accomplishing daily household chores. This connects directly to the brand’s promise to combine learning with play—and the ad copy is speaking directly to those busy parents.</p>
<h3>5. Use your brand voice</h3>
<p>There are more than <a href="https://business.instagram.com/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener">200 million business accounts</a> on Instagram. Most users follow multiple business accounts, according to the social media platform. And anyone who has logged into Instagram knows how often ads appear in your feed, Stories, and explore page content.</p>
<p>With so much brand content, you want to make sure yours stands out. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/27/brand-messaging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Using your brand voice</a> in your Instagram ad copy will help.</p>
<p>If you haven’t already, now is a great time to determine your brand voice. Is it silly or serious? Do you use emojis sparingly or all the time? Do you use phrases and slang, or are you a stickler for full sentences and punctuation, even on Instagram? These decisions all help create a sense of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/brand-personality-messaging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand personality</a>, which will help your audience connect with you and help you stand out on Instagram.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-brand-voice.webp" alt="instagram ad copy example - revival" width="405" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-85227 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-brand-voice.webp 405w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-brand-voice-203x300.webp 203w" sizes="(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.revivalrugs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Revival</em></a><em>’s brand voice is confident and casual, with the made up “everything-proof” and the “better” repetition.</em></p>
<h3>6. Focus on pain points</h3>
<p>If your goal is to<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/lead-generation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> generate leads</a> or encourage a sale, writing Instagram ads that highlight how your product or service will alleviate your potential customer’s pain points will help boost your conversion.</p>
<p>A pain point is a specific problem that your potential customers are grappling with. By identifying this problem, you can better position your solution as <em>the</em> solution.</p>
<p>I love this example from Trashie, a <a href="https://www.trashie.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clothes recycling program</a> with bright, youthful branding.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-trashie.webp" alt="instagram ad copy - small business example" width="357" height="558" class="aligncenter wp-image-85232 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-trashie.webp 357w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-trashie-192x300.webp 192w" sizes="(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px" /></p>
<p>The in-feed video ad shows how to easily open the bag, fill it with your clothing, and then send it back. But the caption? The recycle emoji. The camel case-like capitalization. The yelling ALL. It feels so casual, just like the chatty video. That copy speaks to a pain point many environmentally conscious consumers have with donating clothing—a very specific potential customer who would be motivated to click the CTA to order.</p>
<h3>7. Feature user-generated content</h3>
<p>Instagram is an amazing example of an app that’s built on <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/social-proof-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social proof</a> to drive sales. Influencers cultivate parasocial relationships by sharing personal content as well as brand or affiliate content, which can give their recommendation weight closer to that of a friend than a celebrity endorsement.</p>
<p>But influencer marketing isn’t the only <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-selling">social selling</a> that’s going on. Brands benefit from the engagement of their audience. Whether it’s enthusiastic comments on a new product post or tagged user-generated content.</p>
<p>When you have your customers selling your product or service for you? Use that. Get their permission, reshare, and write your Instagram ad copy to emphasize their points.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-user-generated.webp" alt="instagram ad copy - user generated content example" width="664" height="473" class="aligncenter wp-image-85235 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-user-generated.webp 664w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-user-generated-480x342.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Not an ad, but an adorable example of user-generated content on Piccalio’s Instagram.</em></p>
<h3>8. Leverage social proof</h3>
<p>Even if you don’t have great user-generated content yet, you can still use social proof in your Instagram ad copy to encourage leads, sales, or even engagement to learn more about your offering.</p>
<p>You could use the number of reviews or the number of purchases—these all imply the number of people using and benefiting from your offering. You could also call our specific happy customers, especially if they’re recognizable. (That Jessica Alba call-out above? Another example.) You could also feature your reviews or testimonials themselves.</p>
<p>Here’s a great example from Blueland.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-social-proof.webp" alt="instagram ad copy - social proof" width="664" height="492" class="aligncenter wp-image-85234 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-social-proof.webp 664w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-social-proof-480x356.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The graphic contains the review, which praises the company’s high-quality, plastic-free cleaning solutions. Then Blueland uses the Instagram ad caption to emphasize these two points by calling out its efficacy, ingredients, and elimination of single-use plastics.</p>
<h3>9. Get creative with AI</h3>
<p>It’s easy to get stuck when you’re writing copy for your brand. Whether you’re staring at a blank page and can’t figure out where to start or you’re churning out copy that all sounds the same, you can get some help from AI.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-copywriting-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI copywriting tools</a> are great ways to jumpstart your drafts and get some creative inspiration. With a tool like<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/08/chatgpt-prompts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ChatGPT, you can enter a prompt</a> with the object, the character limits, and the content to come up with a dozen starter ad captions. Or, if you’re already using a social media management platform that offers this, you can take advantage of the AI assistants to improve your copy or generate alternatives.</p>
<p>Just remember: You can’t quite copy and paste and call it a day. View this as a first draft. You still need to review, revise, and proof this copy.</p>
<h3>10. Skip hashtags—unless it’s for your brand</h3>
<p>When you’re writing Instagram ads, you don’t need to<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-use-hashtags-with-hashtag-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> include hashtags</a>. They’ll take up your character limit, and they won’t impact your reach. Because it’s an ad, it won’t show up organically when a user searches a given hashtag.</p>
<p>The only caveat? If using hashtags irreverently or enthusiastically is central to your brand. If it’s a part of your bubbly, Gen-Z-targeted personality, be sure to include them. If a hashtag is the perfect addition to your quippy one-liner in the ad caption? Put it in. Otherwise? You’re good to skip these.</p>
<h3>11. Test your Instagram ad copy</h3>
<p>These are all great strategies for writing Instagram ads that convert. But the ultimate deciding factor is going to be how your audience responds. That’s why it’s a good idea to test your Instagram ad copy.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-test.webp" alt="instagram ad copy - example copy test version a" width="241" height="444" class="aligncenter wp-image-85233 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-test.webp 241w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-test-163x300.webp 163w" sizes="(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-test-example.webp" alt="instagram ad copy - example copy test version b" width="243" height="447" class="aligncenter wp-image-85236 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-test-example.webp 243w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-test-example-163x300.webp 163w" sizes="(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Example copy test via </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/lessons/how-to-make-your-ads-more-effective" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Facebook ads</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Luckily, Instagram makes this easy to do within the platform. When you’re creating an ad, you can select an A/B test. Focus on testing the copy—the caption, the copy in the creative, or the CTA—to see which version performs better with your audience. Short, descriptive captions, or longer, voicey sentences. Clean copy or emojis and all-caps emphasis. The only way to determine which copywriting tactics will lead directly to more conversions is to test it out on your audience.</p>
<h3>12. Consider your Instagram ad copy in your creative process</h3>
<p>We’ve been talking a lot about how to improve your ad with stronger copy that’s speaking to your audience, emphasizing your brand voice, and more. But make sure that writing ad copy isn’t always just an afterthought. Whenever it’s possible, approach your ad holistically. How does the copy improve the visuals? How should the visuals be edited or arranged differently to echo the copy? These considerations will improve the end product.</p>
<p>Plus, one thing you’ll notice about all these examples is that copy appears in the creative—almost always.</p>
<p>Here are two Instagram ads with solid photos. One uses copy in the ad creative, and the other doesn’t.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-home-services-example.webp" alt="instagram ad copy - ad creative example" width="405" height="581" class="aligncenter wp-image-85228 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-home-services-example.webp 405w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-home-services-example-209x300.webp 209w" sizes="(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Lovely house color but as an ad? Unfortunately, so skippable.</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-creative.webp" alt="instagram ad copy - example copy over instagram story image" width="356" height="596" class="aligncenter wp-image-85230 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-creative.webp 356w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instagram-ad-copy-creative-179x300.webp 179w" sizes="(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The picture? Great. The picture and the copy? Chef’s kiss.</em></p>
<p>Take this as guidance when you’re developing your own Instagram ads. If you’re working on a marketing team with a designer or outsourcing creative development to a freelancer, work closely on the visuals and include copy as a part of the process. And you’re a one-person social media team (hat’s off to you), make sure when you’re taking photos or working on new ad creative, think about the copy appearing alongside the visuals.</p>
<div id="how-to-write-instagram-ads"></div>
<h2>Write Instagram ads that convert</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I spend way too much time scrolling on Instagram, there’s always evidence. Sure, the strain in my eyes that makes it clear I forgot about the 20-20-20 rule. But there’s also the saved recipes to try for dinners. A few screenshots of wallpaper or bedding or painted trim that I could see in my home. And, inevitably, a bunch of tabs for articles to read, websites to remember, and products to look at. Instagram is a platform for content and engagement, but it’s also an opportunity to drive traffic to your website.</p>
<p>According to Instagram, <a href="https://business.instagram.com/ad-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90%</a> of users follow at least one business account. When you have people following your account or interacting with your content, that’s a good indication that they’re interested in your brand. You need to make it easy for them to learn more. In this article, we’ll walk through 12 tips for driving valuable traffic from Instagram while keeping your engagement high.</p>

<p>Let’s dive into the details!</p>
<div id="add-link-in-bio"></div>
<h3>1. Add a link to your bio</h3>
<p>When you’re thinking about content on your Instagram <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-referral-traffic">driving traffic</a> to your website, you need to start with a good foundation. That’s a link in your bio.</p>
<p>Previously, there was one option to make the most of the limited link space: a link in bio. A link in bio is a specific landing page that you customize with links to direct your visitors where you want to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/limited-time-offers/">drive traffic</a>. This could include a link directly to your website, another to sign up for your newsletter, or another to start a demo with access to an exclusive offer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/branch-basics-instagram.webp" alt="example of instagram account with link in bio and CTA in description" width="808" height="285" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84319" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/branch-basics-instagram.webp 808w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/branch-basics-instagram-480x169.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 808px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There are different tools that you can use to create a link in bio. <a href="https://linktr.ee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linktree</a> is common and has a free tier, <a href="https://later.com/link-in-bio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Later </a>offers its own free version, and if you’re using <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/marketing/biosite" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Squarespace</a> for your website, you can create one there. The most important thing is to make sure to keep these updated.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/branch-basics-instagram-links.webp" alt="example of links in instagram bio" width="807" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84320" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/branch-basics-instagram-links.webp 807w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/branch-basics-instagram-links-480x357.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 807px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As of <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/instagram-now-allows-5-links-in-bio-heres-how-to-add-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2023</a>, Instagram allows up to five links in an Instagram bio. While many businesses still use a link in bio to aggregate the links and brand the experience, others simply add multiple links and CTAs right into their bio in the platform to avoid the additional step for visitors.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Using Google Ads to drive website traffic?</strong> Make sure it&#8217;s getting the best results with a free, instant audit &gt;&gt; <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Google Ads Performance Grader</a></p>
<div id="avoid-directing-people-to-link-in-bio"></div>
<h3>2. Avoid directing people to that link</h3>
<p>This is counterintuitive, I know, but such is life following the algorithm. You need to have a link in bio so that visitors can navigate to your website easily. But it’s worth noting that you don’t want to tell people to click the link in your bio explicitly, not by writing that in a caption or saying it in a video. Referring people to the link in your bio will actually get your post suppressed by the Instagram algorithm, limiting your reach and engagement and, by extension, your potential traffic.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/link-in-bio-captions-study.webp" alt="study showing results when using link in bio in caption vs not" width="901" height="582" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84321" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/link-in-bio-captions-study.webp 901w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/link-in-bio-captions-study-480x310.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 901px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1330069/instagram-engagement-rate-posts-link-in-bio-by-type" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>This makes sense—remember, Meta wants to keep its users on the platform. So to drive traffic from Instagram, you need to work with the social media platform.</p>
<div id="post-high-quality-content-often"></div>
<h3>3. Post high-quality content often</h3>
<p>The Instagram algorithm favors accounts that post high-quality content often. So to get in front of as many eyes as possible, you’ll need an active and appealing Instagram presence.</p>
<p><a href="https://later.com/blog/how-often-post-to-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Later</a> analyzed 19 million Instagram posts as well as 34,000 Instagram Stories and found that the frequency of posting on Instagram depends on the number of followers. Here are their findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nano accounts (0-10K followers) post an average of three Instagram Stories and two feed posts per week.</li>
<li>Micro accounts (10K-100K followers) post an average of four Instagram Stories and three feed posts per week.</li>
<li>Mid accounts (100K-500K followers) post an average of 15 Instagram Stories and five feed posts per week.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use this as a guideline to plan your posting schedule. Remember, high-quality content doesn’t mean high production value or even net new ideas. In general, Instagram loves videos, behind-the-scenes content, people with their faces in the frame, captions for voiceovers, and limited text. But if you’re looking to get more creative, well, that brings us to our next tip.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Get engaging copy-and-paste Instagram posts for the whole year in our <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteMonthlySocialMediaCalendarTemplate.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Template_MonthlySocialMediaCalendar_Download">free social media template</a>!</p>
<div id="experiment-with-instagram-content"></div>
<h3>4. Experiment with your content</h3>
<p>A good way to engage more people and encourage more website visits is to experiment with new types of content on Instagram, particularly the platform’s interactive features. Here are a few types to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Polls: </strong><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-do-a-poll-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Running a poll on Instagram</a> is simple. You select the sticker option for your Story and then wait for your audience to weigh in. Instagram encourages engagement in this type of content because you can’t see the results without voting.</li>
<li><strong>Q&amp;A boxes: </strong>This is another Story sticker, but this one encourages individual submissions from your audience. Running a Q&amp;A gives you a chance to dialogue with your followers—talk about the company, explain product features, and even respond to hard-hitting questions like Carrie or Samantha. In the answers, if it’s relevant, you can link to your website.</li>
<li><strong>Giveaways:</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/instagram-giveaways">Giveaways</a> are an excellent way to attract and engage an audience, and that’s true on Instagram, too. Content about a giveaway receives <a href="https://keyhole.co/blog/instagram-giveaway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3.5X </a>as many likes as other posts.</li>
<li><strong>Instagram Lives: </strong>These are live sessions where you can talk directly to your community, who have access to a real-time chat. This content can be saved in a grid post, too.</li>
<li><strong>Reels: </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/22/instagram-reels-ideas-for-businesses">Reels</a> are videos up to 90 seconds that can include music, filters, and text. These videos aren’t interactive, but compared to posts and Stories, Reels generate more than <a href="https://www.socialinsider.io/data-geeks/Instagram_content_performance_study_2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2X</a> the number of impressions.</li>
</ul>
<div id="customize-links"></div>
<h3>5. Customize your links</h3>
<p>If you’ve been an Instagram user for a few years, you remember the clunky option to swipe up on a link that was only available to businesses or influencers. In the <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/expanding-sharing-links-in-stories-to-everyone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fall of 2021</a>, Instagram allowed all accounts to include links in Stories as stickers. The functionality of the link sticker is so much better for all users—including your brand.</p>
<p>When you’re adding links to your stories, take the time to customize your links. This could be as simple as changing the text to a descriptive CTA like “Sign Up,” or “Read.” Or you could add a graphic or even a textbox overlay to match the design to your branding.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of examples from influencer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/marylauren/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Lauren</a>, who shares home design and renovation content, as well as style tips. The text overlay is simple but effective, making the link fit her content’s aesthetic.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mary-lauren-instagram-links.webp" alt="example of customized links in instagram Stories" width="502" height="576" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84322" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mary-lauren-instagram-links.webp 502w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mary-lauren-instagram-links-480x551.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 502px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you’re looking for more creative options to customize your links, you can create graphics to use for your brand’s account. Check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N26zGtilArY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tutorial</a> to get started.</p>
<div id="collaborate-with-influencers"></div>
<h3>6. Collaborate with influencers</h3>
<p>Another excellent way to expand your brand’s reach on Instagram is to collaborate with relevant influencers on the platform. If the insanely high sticker price for celebrity posts—like the <a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/instagram-highest-paid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2M per post</a> brands pay Kim Kardashian—-is out of your budget, you can opt for influencers with smaller followings. According to <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/influencer-pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sprout Social</a>, you can expect to pay about $10 per 1,000 followers. In this case, you want to find a sweet spot between maximizing reach and maintaining your budget.</p>
<p>In that case, you’re often better off with an influencer who has a smaller, more niche following. For instance, if you’ve just opened a food truck in New Hampshire, it might make more sense to partner with a smaller, focused account like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/whatsnewinnh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What’s New In NH</a> with around 45,000 followers than <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sistersnacking/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sisters Snacking</a>, which has nearly 500,000 but covers all of New England, New Jersey, and New York, with a bulk of content in NYC and Boston.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/traffic-from-instagram-partner-with-influencers.webp" alt="example of account partnering with influencers to drive traffic from instagram" width="678" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84323" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/traffic-from-instagram-partner-with-influencers.webp 678w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/traffic-from-instagram-partner-with-influencers-480x425.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 678px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>NH, nowhere to be seen in the grid view for Sisters Snacking.</em></p>
<p>Just make sure the link you’re pushing in the sponsored content is targeted to the influencer’s audience, like a custom <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">landing page</a> or a specific product page.</p>
<div id="save-stories-to-highlights"></div>
<h3>7. Save important Stories to your highlights</h3>
<p>Instagram Stories expire after 24 hours. But when you’re taking time to create high-quality content, you want to make the most it—-and maximize the potential traffic to your website. That’s why you’ll want to save important stories to your highlights.</p>
<p>The types of Stories that belong in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/06/instagram-story-highlights">highlights</a> depend on your brand. If your brand is an ecommerce company, you’ll want stories that feature your products with links to the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/06/01/product-pages">product pages</a>. If you’re offering a service, you’ll want to make sure you have links to client testimonials or your portfolio as well as links to book an appointment.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/photographer-instagram-profile-example.webp" alt="example of instagram photographer with customized highlights" width="878" height="482" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84324" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/photographer-instagram-profile-example.webp 878w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/photographer-instagram-profile-example-480x264.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 878px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Photographer Michelle K. Martin’s highlights feature examples of her work, and the booking highlight includes a link to book directly.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, you won’t be able to track interactions with the content in your highlights. After stories expire, the visibility into likes and views does, too. But saving a story to your highlight doesn’t take too long—and, plus, it’s a nice opportunity to build out your brand’s profile.</p>
<div id="update-bio-links-regularly"></div>
<h3>8. Update your bio links regularly</h3>
<p>Anyone looking at your brand’s links in your posts and highlights will see the date they were originally posted. So if there’s a link to a product from 111 weeks ago that doesn’t work, they won’t hold it against you. They might be disappointed that the item is out of stock or frustrated with a 404, but they know that the link is old.</p>
<p>If they’re clicking the link in your bio and hitting the same problems, though? That’s an issue. If you’re including promotions, discounts, limited products—anything that can expire—in your bio, you need to check regularly to make sure it’s up to date.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/az-small-business-association-instagram-links.webp" alt="example of instagram account using timely links in bio to drive traffic from instagram" width="783" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84325" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/az-small-business-association-instagram-links.webp 783w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/az-small-business-association-instagram-links-480x368.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 783px, 100vw" /></p>

<div id="grow-instagram-following"></div>
<h3>9. Grow your following—to a point</h3>
<p>There are a few things you can do consistently to attract more followers on Instagram: posting often, engaging with your active audience, collaborating with brands, and promoting your profile in other marketing channels.</p>
<p>But if you’re a small business, keep in mind that more followers doesn’t always mean more reach. <a href="https://www.bazaarvoice.com/blog/key-instagram-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Bazaar Voice </a>found that the audience reach rate for posts and stories is higher for brands with 10,000 followers or fewer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/instagram-post-and-story-reach-rates.webp" alt="instagram story and post reach rates by follower count" width="880" height="494" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84326" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/instagram-post-and-story-reach-rates.webp 880w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/instagram-post-and-story-reach-rates-480x269.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 880px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="run-instagram-ads"></div>
<h3>10. Run Instagram ads</h3>
<p>If you’re looking to reach users beyond your audience, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/15/why-advertise-on-instagram">running Instagram ads</a> is a good way to get in front of more people and drive them to your website. <a href="https://www.brafton.com/blog/social-media/social-advertising-benchmarks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brafton</a> found that the click-through-rate feed <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-ad-copy">ads on Instagram</a> varies between 0.22% and 0.88%. For Stories ads, the average CTR ranges between 0.33% and 0.54%.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pepperhome-instagram-ad-example.webp" alt="pepperhome instagram story ad example" width="335" height="575" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84327" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pepperhome-instagram-ad-example.webp 335w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pepperhome-instagram-ad-example-175x300.webp 175w" sizes="(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px" /></p>
<p>The thing to keep in mind here is your budget. Instagram recommends that you spend at least $5 per day on ads or about $150 per month. And Instagram ads cost per click to a destination URL is $0.50-0.95. You can learn more about the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/08/instagram-ads-cost">cost of Instagram ads here</a>.</p>
<div id="leverage-integrations"></div>
<h3>11. Leverage tools and integrations</h3>
<p>If you’re a solopreneur, a one-person marketing team, or even a social media manager with a bigger audience on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/17/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok">TikTok</a> and Linkedin, developing content and engaging with your audience on Instagram can be a lot to handle. The good news is that it doesn’t have to be time-consuming, or even hands-on. As long as you set clear expectations with your followers, you can use an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-copywriting-tools">AI tool</a> to manage DMs and even link-sharing for you.</p>
<p>And far from the only tool or integration you can use to make it easier on yourself. There are tons of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/04/social-media-optimization">social media optimization tools</a> that you can test out, including content design support, scheduling platforms, and automated analytics (and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-posts-indexed-on-google">optimize your posts for search</a>).</p>
<p>Remember, the best way to drive more traffic to your website is to be more active and reach more people on Instagram.</p>
<div id="prepare-website"></div>
<h3>12. Make sure your website is ready</h3>
<p>This is the last tip, but it’s probably the most important item on this list. To successfully drive traffic from Instagram, you need to make sure your website is ready to make a great first impression <em>and </em>convert your visitors. That means staying on top of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/18/website-maintenance">website maintenance</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-maintenance-checklist-wordstream.webp" alt="website maintenance checklist" width="886" height="551" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84328" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-maintenance-checklist-wordstream.webp 886w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-maintenance-checklist-wordstream-480x299.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 886px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This includes technical maintenance, like ensuring the page loads quickly, the images aren’t too heavy, and your forms still work. It also means checking on your copy and design every so often. Are your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">CTAs</a> still compelling or feeling dated? Is your color contrast still meeting the ADA requirements for accessibility?</p>
<p>Make checking on your website a regular priority. The worst thing you could do would be to spend time, effort, and money <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/offset-lower-website-traffic">driving traffic</a> from Instagram, only to lose those leads with an avoidable error on your site.</p>
<h2>Drive more traffic from Instagram</h2>
<p>Your social media presence should build your brand and your following, but that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t also impact your bottom line.</p>
<p>To recap, here’s how to drive more traffic from Instagram:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add a link to your bio</li>
<li>Avoid directing people to that link</li>
<li>Post high-quality content often</li>
<li>Experiment with your Instagram content</li>
<li>Customize your links</li>
<li>Collaborate with influencers</li>

<li>Grow your following</li>

<h2>Witty Saint Patrick’s Day Instagram captions</h2>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s that time of year…the month of Shamrocks, leprechauns, and radioactive-green-dyed foods.<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f340.png" alt="🍀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
<li>Legend has it St. Patrick banished all the snakes from Ireland. We&#8217;ll drink to that.<br />
There are no signs of snakes in the country&#8217;s fossil record. We&#8217;ll drink to that.</li>
<li>Four-leaf clovers symbolize luck. Three-leaf clovers symbolize spring. [Business name/sale] symbolizes both.</li>
<li>&#8220;Something special happened today. I got green lights all the way.&#8221; —Aloe Blacc</li>
<li>St. Patrick’s Day is the only day you can/when it’s acceptable to…</li>

<h2>Cute St. Patrick’s Day Instagram captions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Any limerick!<br />
A limerick is a humorous verse of three long and two short lines that follow the a-a-b-b-a-rhyming pattern.<br />
There once was a runner named<br />
Who had too many blisters to count<br />
Then she found our shoes<br />
And<br />
And now she&#8217;s got</li>
<li>Fun Irish drinking songs.<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f37b.png" alt="🍻" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />
(Be sure to read all the lyrics of the songs, as some are not appropriate!). For example:<br />
I&#8217;m looking over a four-leaf clover<br />
I overlooked before<br />
One leaf is sunshine, the second is rain<br />
Third is the roses that grow in the lane<br />
No need explaining, the one remaining<br />
Is somebody I adore<br />
I&#8217;m looking over a four-leaf clover<br />
I overlooked before</li>
<li>Create a recipe for luck.<br />
How to make your own luck: Mix one part preparation with two parts hustle, sprinkle in some perspective and store in fridge until opportunity arises.</li>
<li>Share Irish-themed greeting messages.
<ul>
<li>May your troubles be less and your blessings be more. And nothing but happiness come through your door.</li>
<li>Lucky, blessed, and all the rest. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f308.png" alt="🌈" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
<li>Hills as green as emeralds cover the countryside. Lakes as blue as sapphires and Ireland&#8217;s special pride.</li>

<li>A [measurement] of [product that rhymes with luck] is worth a [bigger measurement] of luck.</li>
<li>A [tiny amount] of [product/offer that rhymes with old] is worth a pot of gold.</li>

So when I came across this Smudge pie Thanksgiv<em>meme</em>, I was deeply, deeply grateful for humanity. <img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/thanksgiving-instagram-captions-smudge-pie-meme.png" alt="thanksgiving instagram captions - smudge pie meme" width="554" height="451" class="size-full wp-image-66125 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/thanksgiving-instagram-captions-smudge-pie-meme.png 554w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/thanksgiving-instagram-captions-smudge-pie-meme-480x391.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 554px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Speaking of creativity and the annual day of gratitude, we need to talk about Thanksgiving Instagram captions. If you&#8217;re looking for creative ideas, you&#8217;re not going to find any in the generic &#8220;Time to pumpkin spice it up&#8221; or &#8220;Gobble til you wobble&#8221; lists the internet is rife with.</p>
<p>But you will find them in this post because I&#8217;ve compiled a collection of ideas, prompts, and original examples you can steal or use as a springboard.</p>

<div id="thanksgiving-quotes"></div>
<h2>Thanksgiving quotes</h2>
<p>You can always use a Thanksgiving quote for your Thanksgiving and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/november-content-ideas">November-themed content</a>, but similar to the above section, you&#8217;ll lose some of the originality factor unless you respond to or comment on it in your own way.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Be present in all things and grateful for all things.”—Maya Angelou</li>
<li>“The thankful heart opens our eyes to a multitude of blessings that continually surround us.” —James E. Faust</li>
<li>“It’s not joy that makes us grateful but gratitude that makes us joyful.”</li>
<li>&#8220;When it comes to life, the critical thing is whether you take things for granted or take them with gratitude.&#8221; —Gilbert K. Chesterton</li>
<li>&#8220;Gratitude is a currency that we can mint for ourselves and spend without fear of bankruptcy.&#8221; —Fred De Witt Van Amburgh</li>
<li>“Thanksgiving was never meant to be shut up in a single day.” —Robert Caspar Lintner</li>
<li>&#8220;Gratitude is the inward feeling of kindness received. Thankfulness is the natural impulse to express that feeling. Thanksgiving is the following of that impulse.” —Henry Van Dyke</li>
<li>&#8220;Thankfulness is the quickest path to joy.&#8221; —Jefferson Bethke</li>
<li>&#8220;Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what is.&#8221; —Ernest Hemingway</li>
<li>&#8220;Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more.&#8221; —Melody Beattie</li>
<li>&#8220;Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it.&#8221; —William Arthur Ward</li>
<li>&#8220;Give thanks not just on Thanksgiving Day, but every day of your life.&#8221; —Catherine Pulsifer</li>
</ul>

<h2>Inclusive Thanksgiving Instagram captions</h2>
<p>While Thanksgiving is a time for us to gather with friends and family and count our blessings, it isn’t a positive day for everyone. Consider the following inclusive Thanksgiving Instagram captions:</p>
<ul>
<li>On this Thanksgiving, it’s important to express gratitude but to remember that it can be a hard day for some. To those of you observing the <a href="http://www.uaine.org/">National Day of Mourning</a>, to those of you who are without family, friends, or a roof over your head, and to those of you who struggle in your relationship with food, we want you to know that we see you today and our hearts go out to you.</li>
<li>As you gather and celebrate with loved ones today, don’t forget that many Native Americans are observing the National Day of Mourning—a day to mourn the suffering at the hands of the pilgrims and other European settlers, to honor Native resilience, and to protest against racism and oppression. Take a minute today to reflect on racism,  resilience, and respect.</li>
<li>Happy Thanksgiving everyone. It’s easy to get caught up in the typical chatter about feasting, but remember that there are many people out there who can’t afford a meal, are too sick or disabled to cook or eat, or who struggle with eating disorders. So on this day, we encourage you to focus less on spreading messages about food and more on messages about gratitude and gathering with those who matter most.</li>
</ul>
<ul></ul>
<div id="words-for-thanksgiving-instagram-posts"></div>
<h2>Words to use in your Thanksgiving Instagram captions</h2>
<p>And finally, here are some words to use or spark inspiration for your Turkey Day Instagram captions:</p>
<ul>

<h2>What are Instagram Highlights?</h2>
<p>Instagram Story Highlights, also known simply as Instagram Highlights, are collections of pictures, videos, and posts that you’ve posted to your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/instagram-story-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram Story</a> in the past. These curated collections are often referred to as “albums,” and these albums are usually different categories of topics.</p>
<p>Unlike<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/16/instagram-stories-analytics"> Instagram Stories</a> which vanish after 24 hours, Instagram Highlights live permanently on your profile, allowing you to add or delete content from them at any time. These albums sit right underneath your profile bio section and above your regular feed.</p>

<h2>How to create and add Instagram Highlights</h2>
<p>Before you can start sharing great content on your Highlights, you must first learn how to create them! The first step to this process is to make sure that Instagram’s auto-archiving feature is turned on. This feature automatically archives and saves each Story you post to your Instagram feed or story to the cloud, eliminating the worry of losing any valuable content. Once this feature is turned on, you can share and repost any content that you’ve posted even after it disappears from your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/07/instagram-story-ads">Instagram Stories</a>. To locate the archive feature, follow these steps:</p>
<h3>1. Navigate to the settings of your Instagram account</h3>

<div id="nine-ways-to-use-instagram-highlights-to-grow-your-business"></div>
<h2>9 ways to use Instagram Highlights to grow your business</h2>
<p>You could just include all your Instagram Stories in an Instagram Story Highlight, but that isn’t very appealing to your followers, and it certainly won’t encourage customer <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/07/customer-engagement-strategy">engagement</a>. This feature is much more effective if you have multiple highlights that feature the different types of Instagram Stories you create. So here are nine Instagram Highlights ideas you can use to get your followers and customers engaged.</p>
<h3>1. Showcase your products</h3>
<p>One of the best ways to promote your business and engage with your customers is by creating an Instagram Story Highlight promoting your products or services.</p>
<p>According to Instagram, <a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/500000-advertisers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">75% of users take an action</a>, such as visiting a website or making a purchase, after looking at <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-ad-copy">ads on the platform</a>. Whether or not active Instagram users have engaged with your business before, if they’re browsing your profile and see a highlight dedicated to “Products,” they might be more likely to click through the content included in your highlight versus scrolling through your entire feed.</p>
<p>Your highlight will be an easier and faster way to find information about your offerings, and you can direct customers to your website, to sign up for a newsletter, or, ideally, to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/26/instagram-stories-shopping">make a purchase via Instagram</a>. By tagging products in your highlights with the Instagram Stories stickers (interactive elements that you can add to engage with your followers), you can showcase your products more creatively and in less direct or salesy ways.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at how <a href="https://www.letterfolk.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIjMq6hLj16gIVCo7ICh1WWQ5VEAAYASAAEgIQD_D_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Letterfolk</a>, a home decor company that offers unique paper goods and gifts, showcases its products.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-letterfolk.jpg" alt="Instagram Highlights - letterfolk instagram profile" width="370" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76767 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-letterfolk.jpg 370w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-letterfolk-185x300.jpg 185w" sizes="(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px" /></p>
<p>Letterfolk organizes its Instagram Story Highlights to showcase different products they offer—tile mats, calendars, ABC prints, and more. This allows users to find more information about the specific products they’re interested in. This is a good way to make separate product highlights focused on seasonal collections, new releases, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">product promotions</a>, and more. Using a similar approach, depending on how many products your business offers, you might combine all product-related stories into a single album.</p>
<p>A great way to include a CTA in these stories is to use the “See More” link, engaging with your followers and directing them to find more exciting information about your offerings on your website.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlight-everyday.jpg" alt="Instagram Highlights - example of an instagram story highlight" width="397" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76768 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlight-everyday.jpg 397w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlight-everyday-199x300.jpg 199w" sizes="(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Letterfolk uses the “See More” link on their “New” Highlight.</em></p>
<h3>2. Promote events</h3>
<p>As we all know, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/19/social-media-for-small-business">social media</a> is a great place to promote events and build brand awareness, especially because users look for information there. se the Stories feature to showcase past events, promote upcoming ones, and help raise awareness about others. This will allow followers to get a better idea of what the events your business actually hosts are like—and increase interest for future ones!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-boston.jpg" alt="Instagram Highlights - boston women instagram page." width="373" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76769 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-boston.jpg 373w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-boston-187x300.jpg 187w" sizes="(max-width: 373px) 100vw, 373px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://bostonbusinesswomen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boston Business Women</a> has a highlight showcasing all events organized by the group.</em></p>
<p>If your business hosts events, workshops, or training experiences (all can be virtual, too), dedicating an Instagram Story Highlight exclusively to event promotion is a strategic, fun, creative way to share more of your brand’s personality while also increasing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">brand awareness</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-events.jpg" alt="Instagram Highlights - example of an event story highlight" width="369" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76770 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-events.jpg 369w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-events-185x300.jpg 185w" sizes="(max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px" /></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to include your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/st-patricks-day-greetings">holiday events</a>!</p>
<h3>3. Show what you’ve been up to</h3>
<p>Keeping clients informed is always one of the most important <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/15/marketing-objectives">objectives</a> of businesses, and offering a behind-the-scenes look at what your business has been up to is a great idea for an Instagram Story Highlight.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlight-chobani.jpg" alt="Instagram Highlights - Chobani example" width="386" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76771 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlight-chobani.jpg 386w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlight-chobani-193x300.jpg 193w" sizes="(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Chobani shows off interesting ways to use its containers.</em></p>
<p>With Stories like these, your followers—and your customers—are able to picture people at your company or new initiatives, and both of these help <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/12/23/humanize-brand">humanize</a> your brand.</p>
<p>Here are some great ways your business can do this today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tease viewers by giving them an inside look at some of your new products.</li>
<li>Share pictures, videos, or screenshots taken during company meetings.</li>
<li>Show where your employees have been working recently.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Interact with customers using interactive polls</h3>
<ol start="4"></ol>
<p>Using ad interactive polls on your Instagram Stories not only allows you to engage with customers, it also allows you to collaborate with customers. You can gain a greater understanding of your audience and insight into their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/28/pain-points">pain points</a>, as well as ask them fun, different sorts of questions, inviting them to interact with your brand.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-farmrich.jpg" alt="Instagram Highlights - farmrich example" width="314" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76772 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-farmrich.jpg 314w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-farmrich-157x300.jpg 157w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /></p>
<p>Even more, the results you get from Instagram Story polls can help you reframe your marketing and advertising campaigns more effectively. Creating a highlight including all the ad polls you’ve posted on your Instagram Stories is a great way for followers and users to see that you’re interested in their opinions and feedback on your products or conversations.</p>
<h3>5. Answer your followers’ questions</h3>
<p>Another interactive feature you can use to capture your followers’ attention is an Instagram Story Highlight with answers to common questions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-remote-year.jpg" alt="Instagram Highlights - Remote year story highlight" width="403" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76773 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-remote-year.jpg 403w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-remote-year-202x300.jpg 202w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Remote Year’s Q&amp;A Instagram Story Highlight.</em></p>
<p>A good place to start is by asking common questions about business hours, new products, features, or location, and begin by answering those. Put yourself in your customers’ shoes and think of what you’d like to know if you clicked through your business Q&amp;A highlight. A restaurant may ask, “What’s something you’d like to see on our menu? Or an agency might ask, “What’s your favorite social ad we’ve created for you?” Or a realtor could ask, “Is proximity to mass transit important to you?” Users can also type an answer instead of asking a question.</p>
<h3>6. Feature product tutorials</h3>
<p>Creating an album specifically for tips and tutorials for using your product or service helps to establish your credibility and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/27/trust-signals">build trust</a> in your brand. Part of the album can be showcasing actual customers using your product or service to demonstrate the ease of product use.</p>
<p>This Instagram Story Highlight also allows you to show a more in-depth look at the functionality of your product or service and gives customers an inside look, an idea of what to expect when they (hopefully) make a purchase.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlight-tagwalk.jpg" alt="Instagram Highlights - Tagwalk instagram highlight" width="397" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76774 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlight-tagwalk.jpg 397w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlight-tagwalk-199x300.jpg 199w" sizes="(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Tagwalk has a collection of “How to Guides” in one of their Highlights.</em></p>
<p>For businesses selling higher price points or lesser-known brands, there’s a longer <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/04/nurture-marketing">consideration phase</a> before people buy. You can cut straight to the chase with your prospects (or at least try to) by giving them a sneak peek of what they get when they buy!</p>
<h3>7. Highlight your customer testimonials</h3>
<p>We all know the importance of sharing <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/get-google-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer reviews</a>, so be sure to share your company’s reviews with your followers, too! Creating a highlight dedicated to reposting screenshots or testimonials of your customers’ experiences using your product, service, or brand, and highlighting these on your Instagram account is a great way to share the stories of your happy customers. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/19/customer-testimonial-examples">Customer testimonials</a> are valuable to emphasize the benefits customers have received from your products or service.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-supplyhouse.jpg" alt="Instagram Highlights - supply house instagram story" width="506" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76775 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-supplyhouse.jpg 506w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-supplyhouse-480x569.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 506px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Supply House uses an Instagram Highlight to show off its great </em><i>reviews.</i></p>
<p>These customer testimonials are also a great opportunity to use the “See More” button, allowing followers to swipe up and shop the product your customers were raving about.</p>
<p>Just be sure to ask customers if they’d be willing to be featured on your business’s Instagram profile, but hopefully you’ll have trust built with them already and they’ll say yes!</p>
<h3>8. Share sales and discounts</h3>
<p>One of the most effective ways to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/05/instagram-ecommerce">boost sales on Instagram</a> and attract followers to engage with your content in some way is through offering discounts or giveaways.</p>
<p>Offering discounts and sales on your products provides greater visibility to your brand and has the potential to increase sales, generate leads, and boost traffic to your website.</p>
<p>Creating an Instagram Story Highlight dedicated to sharing current sales, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/21/ecommerce-discounts">discounts</a>, and promotions is a great idea. Discounts or giveaways naturally attract prospects, prompts them to engage with the content on your Story, and then encourages them to buy your product or services.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Sales promotions are a fantastic way to drum up new business.

<h3>9. Start a series</h3>
<p>You’ve now read many tips on how to promote your products and services, advertise your events and highlight past ones, and communicate sales and discounts you’re having right now. Another creative way to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/13/ugc-instagram">engage</a> with your customers on Instagram Stories and earn extra visibility is by creating a highlight dedicated to posting fun, relatable content. This can be related to your company’s offering, your company’s mission—or, it doesn’t necessarily have to be related to your particular business or industry.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-smile.jpg" alt="Instagram Highlights - Califa farms story" width="388" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76776 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-smile.jpg 388w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-smile-194x300.jpg 194w" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Califa Farms has a Story Highlight named “Smile” dedicated to sharing daily moments of joy.</em></p>
<p>You can do this by creating a story album dedicated to sharing motivational quotes related to your business, jumping on current trends happening on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/30/social-media-engagement">social media</a>, or dedicating a highlight to sharing your content, like a blog or video series.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlight-cheese.jpg" alt="Instagram Highlights - Curds and co story highlights" width="374" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76777 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlight-cheese.jpg 374w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlight-cheese-187x300.jpg 187w" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Curds &amp; Co. has a Story Highlight created for their website blog.</em></p>
<p>You can also share with your followers non-business motivational quotes, and funny quotes (humor goes a long way in engaging an audience). The key here is to stay consistent. Post those quotes regularly for the duration of your campaign or make a story every time you’re posting a new blog or video. This consistency keeps your customers coming back!</p>
