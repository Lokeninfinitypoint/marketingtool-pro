										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social listening helps businesses monitor and analyze online conversations to gain insights into customer opinions, preferences, and trends by tracking mentions, feedback, and discussions across various social media platforms and online forums. And in 2025, smart small business owners are using this tactic as their secret weapon to better understand customers, outsmart competitors, and grow their businesses faster than ever before.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re still thinking social listening is just for big corporations with massive marketing budgets, think again. By tuning in online, small businesses now have access to the same powerful insights that Fortune 500 companies use to make million-dollar decisions.</p>

<h2>What is social listening?</h2>
<p>Social listening is the process of monitoring online conversations to understand what people are saying about a business, topic, industry, and more.</p>
<p>But, it’s not just about tracking mentions and comments. Social listening also entails analyzing the tone, sentiment, themes, and trends behind what people are saying online.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2b50.png" alt="⭐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Get all the tips you need to collect more reviews in this free guide download &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/how-to-get-more-reviews?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_howtogetreviews_Download&amp;itm_source=localiq&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links">How to Get More Reviews: 8 Tips to Boost Ranking, Reputation, &amp; Revenue</a></p>
<div id="benefits-of-social-listening"></div>
<h2>Why social listening matters more than ever in 2025</h2>
<p>It can be nearly impossible to keep up with what customers and prospects are saying about your business online in this day and age. <strong>But understanding sentiment about your business, common complaints, and what people love about you can help you improve almost every aspect of your business</strong>, so it’s something you can’t just ignore.</p>
<p>Businesses can use social listening to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Track and understand <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reputation-management">brand reputation</a></li>
<li>Identify customer pain points and needs</li>
<li>Monitor competitors and spot industry trends</li>
<li>Find potential micro-influencers or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/user-generated-content">UGC providers</a></li>
<li>Gather insights to streamline processes and build consumer-coveted offerings</li>
<li>And so much more</li>
</ul>
<p>Data shows <a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/social-media-listening-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">61%</a> of businesses have already implemented social listening systems to monitor keyword mentions, but most small businesses are still missing out on this goldmine of customer intelligence. While your competitors are guessing what customers want, you could be listening to <em>exactly</em> what they&#8217;re saying.</p>
<div id="social-listening-landscape"></div>
<h2>The 2025 social listening landscape: What&#8217;s changed</h2>
<p>The social listening market is expected to reach $9.61 billion in 2025. That&#8217;s not just growth; that&#8217;s explosive demand from businesses that&#8217;ve discovered that tuning into their customers online can unlock important insights and early trends, giving them a competitive edge.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/social-media-listening-market-growth.webp" alt="social media listening budget growth" width="644" height="775" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94505" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/social-media-listening-market-growth.webp 644w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/social-media-listening-market-growth-480x578.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 644px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/social-media-listening-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>The shift we&#8217;re seeing isn&#8217;t just about technology—it&#8217;s about moving from reactive customer service to proactive <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/07/customer-engagement-strategy">customer engagement</a>.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and advanced analytics have completely transformed what&#8217;s possible with social listening. We&#8217;re not talking about simple keyword alerts anymore. Today&#8217;s tools can understand context, detect sarcasm, identify emerging trends, and even predict customer behavior patterns.</p>
<p>The technology can now tell you not just that someone mentioned your brand, but how they felt about it, what specific aspect they were discussing, and whether their sentiment is improving or declining over time. It&#8217;s like having a team of market researchers working 24/7, analyzing every conversation about your industry.</p>
<p>This is important, considering that global advertising spending is expected to exceed $276 billion in 2025. With so much competition for attention, every marketing dollar needs to work harder, and social listening helps prove ROI on social media investment through concrete metrics like engagement rates, share of voice, and sentiment improvements.</p>
<div id="how-to-do-social-listening"></div>
<h2>The new rules of social listening for small businesses</h2>
<p>Now that you understand why social listening is so important, let’s move on to some of the new rules that are shaping success for businesses of all sizes.</p>
<h3>Rule #1: Focus on micro-virality over mass appeal</h3>
<p>Forget about trying to create the next viral TikTok dance. Today, successful brands are focusing on smaller-scale, audience-focused virality within their specific niches. This means tracking trends that matter to your actual customers, not chasing whatever&#8217;s trending globally.</p>
<p>Instead of blindly following mainstream trends, start tracking conversations that provide actionable insights specific to your niche. A local coffee shop doesn&#8217;t need to know about the latest celebrity drama, but they absolutely need to know when their customers starts talking about matcha or gluten-free options.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sprout-social-listening.webp" alt="sprout social listening word cloud" width="900" height="548" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94506" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sprout-social-listening.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sprout-social-listening-480x292.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2023/10/wordcloud-1024x624.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Get copy-and-paste social media posts ready for the whole year</strong> in our <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteMonthlySocialMediaCalendarTemplate.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Template_MonthlySocialMediaCalendar_Download">free social media template</a>!</p>
<h3>Rule #2: Listen beyond your brand</h3>
<p>This is where most small businesses make their biggest mistake: they only monitor mentions of their own brand name. The real goldmine, however, is in listening to industry conversations, competitor mentions, and emerging customer needs that haven&#8217;t been addressed yet.</p>
<p>For example, a clothing boutique might discover that conversations about sustainable fashion are increasing in their target demographic, even when their brand isn&#8217;t mentioned. This insight could inform everything from product development to marketing messaging, giving them a significant competitive advantage.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/social-listening-example-fordays.webp" alt="social listening example for days" width="900" height="594" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94507" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/social-listening-example-fordays.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/social-listening-example-fordays-480x317.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Rule #3: Act on unexpected discoveries</h3>
<p>Social listening can uncover surprising opportunities (if you’re paying attention.) For example, suppose you own a small business that sells a supplement designed to help alleviate migraines. If you were monitoring general wellness conversations, you may learn that people who have hobbies requiring intense focus, like knitting or Sudoku, frequently mention eye strain and migraines in online communities.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/social-listening-example-knitting.webp" alt="social media listening example about knitting" width="900" height="371" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94508" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/social-listening-example-knitting.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/social-listening-example-knitting-480x198.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This discovery could help your business lean into targeted product positioning and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-plan">content strategy</a> focused on this specific audience. What started as general health monitoring could quickly become a targeted campaign that resonates with a passionate, underserved community.</p>
<h3>Rule #4: Integrate multiple data sources</h3>
<p>Social listening isn&#8217;t meant to exist in isolation. The most successful small businesses combine social listening data from various sources with sales information, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/customer-data">customer surveys</a>, and website analytics to create comprehensive customer journey maps.</p>
<p>This integrated approach helps you understand not just what customers are saying but also how those conversations connect to actual purchasing behavior. For example, you might discover that negative sentiment about a competitor&#8217;s customer service correlates with <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased traffic to your website</a> or that conversations about specific features predict seasonal sales patterns.</p>

<h2>Creating your 2025 social listening action plan</h2>
<p>Here’s a practical guide to make social listening an easy part of your marketing strategy.</p>
<h3>Week 1: Foundation setting</h3>
<p>Define your listening objectives and key performance indicators. Choose a tool that fits your budget and needs, and then set up initial monitoring for your brand name, key competitors, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-research">primary industry keywords</a>.</p>
<h3>Weeks 2-4: Data collection and analysis</h3>
<p>Focus on gathering baseline data across all relevant channels. Identify patterns in mention volume, sentiment trends, and conversation topics. Create your first response protocols and train team members on escalation procedures.</p>
<h3>Months 2-3: Optimization and integration</h3>
<p>Based on initial findings, refine your keyword lists. Integrate insights into your marketing strategies and product development discussions. Establish regular reporting rhythms that align with your business planning cycles.</p>
<h3>Ongoing: Scale and sophistication</h3>
<p>As your business grows and your understanding deepens, add new monitoring categories. Invest in more advanced tools and features that provide predictive capabilities and deeper analytical insights.</p>

<h2>Your social listening advantage in 2025</h2>
<p>Social listening has evolved from a nice-to-have marketing activity into a business-critical intelligence system.

<li>Build flexible monitoring frameworks that can adapt as new platforms and conversation formats emerge.</li>

</ul>
<p>The key is starting with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/smart-goals-examples">clear objectives</a>, choosing the right tools for your budget, and building systematic processes that turn insights into action. You don&#8217;t need a Fortune 500 budget to compete with Fortune 500 insights&#8211;you just need to start listening to what your customers are already telling you.</p>
<p>The businesses that thrive in 2025 won&#8217;t just be listening. They&#8217;ll be hearing, understanding, and acting on what their customers are saying.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years, the unwritten pact between you and search engines was simple: You publish useful content. Google sends you strangers. Some of them become customers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that pact is breaking up now.</p>
<p>Today, we’ll cover the realities of web traffic and share surefire ways to mitigate the impact of lower traffic, so you can continue to reach your most important goals.</p>

<h2>Website traffic is decreasing: Why?</h2>
<p>Today, more of your potential visitors are stopping short. They are getting their answers from an AI-generated paragraph, a Google AI Overview, or a Perplexity card, without ever touching your site.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ai-overviews-example-overview-screen.webp" alt="google ai overviews - screenshare" width="806" height="373" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92053" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ai-overviews-example-overview-screen.webp 806w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ai-overviews-example-overview-screen-480x222.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 806px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>It’s not a blip. It’s systemic:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.similarweb.com/blog/marketing/seo/zero-click-searches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Over 65%</strong></a> of AI answers never link back to their sources.</li>
<li>Informational clicks are <a href="https://nonprofitnewsfeed.com/resource/new-search-data-show-why-nonprofit-traffic-is-screwed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>down 18–30%</strong></a> across multiple industries.</li>
<li>Zero-click searches now account for <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-search-zero-click-study-2024-443869" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>more than 60%</strong></a> of queries (and that number is still climbing).</li>
</ul>
<p>But here’s the thing most “<a href="https://searchengineland.com/if-ai-killed-your-seo-strategy-you-didnt-have-one-455946" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI is killing SEO</a>” takes miss: the traffic disappearing fastest isn’t your most valuable traffic. It’s the top-of-funnel, low-intent visitors; the ones looking for definitions, generic comparisons, and quick fixes.</p>
<p>The clicks that drive revenue (the ones from people ready to buy, book, or sign up) are still there. The challenge now is to defend that ground, squeeze more value from every visit, and open new channels that AI can’t take away.</p>
<p>What follows is not a list of band-aid tips. It’s a <strong>strategic, field-tested playbook</strong> for replacing the low-intent traffic AI has taken, maximizing what remains, and building a pipeline that’s resilient no matter how search changes next.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f50e.png" alt="🔎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Need help understanding the modern rules for SEO?</strong> Download our free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/how-to-do-seo-right?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_SEOstrategies_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links/">How to Do SEO Right—Right Now!</a></p>
<div id="how-to-get-more-out-of-the-traffic-you-still-have"></div>
<h2>How to get more out of the traffic you still have to hit your goals</h2>
<p>When acquisition gets harder, efficiency becomes the growth lever.</p>
<p>Every visitor now carries more weight because there are fewer of them—and the proportion arriving with genuine purchase intent is higher than it was in the “big top-of-funnel” days. If they click and you can’t convert them, you’ve wasted the most expensive part of the funnel.</p>
<p>The first step isn’t to replace lost visitors. It’s to <strong>audit the revenue path for the visitors you still have</strong> and extract every bit of value before you spend a dollar or an hour chasing new clicks.</p>
<h3>1. Run a conversion rate optimization (CRO) audit</h3>
<p>If traffic is harder to win, every visit has to work harder for you. That’s where CRO comes in. Doubling your conversion rate doesn’t just give you more leads; it means you can hit the same revenue with half the traffic. Yet too many businesses treat <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization-marketing">CRO</a> as a one-off project instead of an ongoing discipline.</p>
<p>The stakes are higher now. As AI eats into low-intent clicks, the visitors who do make it to your site are more likely to be ready to buy. If your page loads slowly, your layout confuses them, or your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">CTAs</a> aren’t clear, you’re wasting the most valuable traffic you have—and replacing those lost conversions costs far more than fixing them.</p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p><a href="https://convertica.org/ecommerce-case-study-36-increase-in-revenue-per-visitor-on-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Convertica</a> published a case study on a supplement ecommerce brand that redesigned its mobile product table into a slider to reduce endless scrolling. That one change lifted order completions by 43.9% and increased revenue per visitor on mobile by 36%, with results statistically significant at a 98% confidence level.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/landing-page-cro-example.webp" alt="example of landing page mock up from convertica to increase conversion rate" width="452" height="850" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94236" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/landing-page-cro-example.webp 452w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/landing-page-cro-example-160x300.webp 160w" sizes="(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A mock-up of the landing page tweaks Convertica made to increase conversion rate.</em></p>
<p>Tom Winter, CGO &amp; Co-Founder of <a href="https://seowind.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEOwind</a>, has seen similar gains from small tweaks: <em>“Adding one dead-simple intent question to our signup form boosted completion rates by over 35%. Once users started, they felt invested in finishing. That tiny psychological nudge made all the difference.”</em></p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Don’t focus only on aesthetics&#8211;a new button color here, a fresh font there&#8211;without tackling the friction that’s actually costing you sales. A systematic CRO routine, especially on mobile, is what keeps the pipeline healthy.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use tools like Hotjar, Microsoft Clarity, or FullStory to identify where users scroll, linger, or drop off.</li>
<li>Audit mobile load speeds and resolve performance bottlenecks.</li>
<li>Test CTA placement, visual weight, and copy clarity.</li>
<li>Reduce required form fields based on submission data.</li>
<li>Make CRO reviews a monthly routine rather than an annual project.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Turn blog posts into lead magnets</h3>
<p>AI can summarize your posts, but it can’t give readers your unique resources. That’s where <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/15/lead-magnet-ideas">blog-specific lead magnets</a> shine. When the download or template is directly tied to the article’s topic, you’re meeting the reader at their exact moment of intent and pulling them deeper into your funnel.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/blog-lead-magnet-example.webp" alt="blog lead magnet example from lawn care company" width="900" height="703" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94238" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/blog-lead-magnet-example.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/blog-lead-magnet-example-480x375.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.getsunday.com/shed/lawn/how-to-start-caring-for-your-lawn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This blog post</a> about caring for your lawn and finding a custom plan is accompanied by a form to get a custom plan.</em></p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamara-omerovic-058775200/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tamara Omerovic</a>, Marketing Consultant at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/get-marketing-advice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marketing Advice</a> agency, has seen this play out firsthand: <em>“At Databox, we published articles teaching users how to build complex dashboards. After explaining the process, we offered a free, pre-built template. Because it solved the exact problem readers had, it converted exceptionally well.”</em></p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Offering the same generic lead magnet site-wide. A vague “join our newsletter” box doesn’t feel like a logical next step—it feels like a distraction. A better approach is to treat every high-traffic article as its own conversion opportunity and match the offer precisely to what the reader needs next.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<p>Start with your top 20 posts. Ask yourself: <strong>what tool, template, or shortcut would help readers take action on the advice they just read? </strong>Build that resource, place it right in the article, and test different placements and headlines to see what drives the most signups.</p>
<h3>3. Install exit-intent offers and popups</h3>
<p>As overall traffic drops, capturing email or interest from departing visitors becomes essential for maintaining the pipeline. An <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/22/popup-examples">exit-intent popup</a> is your final chance to engage visitors who are about to leave. It can turn a loss into a lead or even a sale.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/exit-intent-pop-up-example-madewell.webp" alt="exit intent popup example from madewell" width="900" height="542" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94239" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/exit-intent-pop-up-example-madewell.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/exit-intent-pop-up-example-madewell-480x289.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.madewell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p>Wisepops reports that the top-performing exit-intent popups (the top 10%) achieve conversion rates as high as <a href="https://wisepops.com/blog/exit-popup-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19.6%</a>, while the average exit-intent popup still converts about 2.9% of abandoning visitors into customers or subscribers.</p>
<p>But numbers only tell half the story. As <a href="https://oskarduberg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oskar Duberg</a>, a freelance content specialist, points out, “Exit popups don’t have to be digital guilt trips. I’ve always treated them like a friendly concierge: ‘Before you go, here’s something that might help.’ Done well, they catch fence-sitters in a helpful way and lift conversions without leaving a sour taste.”</p>
<p>The takeaway: The framing of the offer matters as much as the trigger itself. Treat the pop-up as helpful guidance, not a desperate grab for attention.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Test exit offers with real value (discount, resource, free trial).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/personalized-marketing">Personalize</a> based on user behavior (e.g., cart abandoners vs. blog readers).</li>
<li>Exclude logged-in users or recent customers to avoid friction.</li>
<li>Keep copy conversational and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/21/features-vs-benefits">benefit-driven</a> instead of pushy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Use dynamic CTAs based on user intent</h3>
<p>If you’ve lost some top-of-funnel visitors, the traffic you still get is more varied—and more precious. Serving each segment the next most logical step increases the odds they’ll take it.</p>
<p>A single static CTA assumes every visitor wants the same thing. They don’t. Dynamic CTAs adapt to who’s on your site and why they’re there, increasing relevance and clicks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/personalized-cta-examples-dentist.webp" alt="personalized cta examples dentist" width="835" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94240" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/personalized-cta-examples-dentist.webp 835w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/personalized-cta-examples-dentist-480x460.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 835px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.turtlecreekdental.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This dentist</a> uses different CTAs depending on the intent of the section or page of their website.</em></p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p>HubSpot changes CTAs based on user history.</p>
<ul>
<li>Returning visitors who’ve downloaded a guide get invited to a webinar or trial.</li>
<li>First-time blog readers get offered free templates.</li>
<li>Product page visitors get a “Talk to Sales” option.</li>
</ul>
<p>This progression ensures the CTA is contextually relevant, reducing friction.</p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Over-personalizing without enough data. If your segments are too narrow or based on incomplete signals, you risk showing mismatched offers that confuse visitors.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use tools like RightMessage, ConvertFlow, or HubSpot Smart CTAs.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/04/customer-segmentation-models">Segment</a> by traffic source, page type, or previous activity.</li>
<li>Test different offers for each segment and measure CTR and conversion rate lift.</li>
</ul>
<p>You cannot win the low‑intent game against AI. Instead, focus your resources where humans still click: specific, nuanced, commercial searches. These keywords reflect real purchase signals and give you an opening that AI cannot easily replicate.</p>
<h3>5. Target long-tail, specific, purchase-ready keywords</h3>
<p>AI summaries dominate at broad levels. But when queries get specific, AI cannot easily generalize, and users often click through to compare nuanced options.</p>
<p>Think of “best CRM” as a wide net, and “best CRM for freelance designers with client portals” as a precision spear. Volume might be lower, but the value of each click is much higher because the searcher has a clear intent to convert.</p>
<p>“Everyone’s chasing head terms. I’m hunting for bottom-of-the-funnel searches with verbs like ‘compare,’ ‘best for X,’ or ‘vs.’ That’s where the wallet opens,” said Tom. “AI might answer the ‘what,’ but it struggles with the ‘which one should I buy?”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/long-tail-keywords-example-mattress-comparison.webp" alt="example of long tail high intent keyword targeting for mattress brands comparison" width="900" height="670" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94246" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/long-tail-keywords-example-mattress-comparison.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/long-tail-keywords-example-mattress-comparison-480x357.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>“To find high-intent keywords AI hasn’t saturated, I go straight to the voice of the customer on sales calls. Prospects don’t use broad marketing lingo; they describe specific <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/28/pain-points">pain points</a>. That’s how I discovered winning terms like ‘signs of a disgruntled employee’ for an employee monitoring software client,” Tamara said.</p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p><a href="https://alphametic.com/hubspots-seo-crash-ai-overviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alpha­metic analyzed HubSpot’s steep SEO traffic loss</a> and concluded that optimizing transactional content—such as product pages and use-case–specific landing pages—is more profitable and stable than relying on blog content. That reflects the shift toward targeting high‑intent, bottom‑of‑funnel queries.<a href="https://www.hotjar.com/customers/the-good/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> </a></p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Treating long‑tail targeting as a one‑time effort. As AI representations evolve, niche phrases can quickly become competitive, so stay agile and keep updating.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use tools like Ahrefs or Semrush to discover specific, high-intent queries.</li>
<li>Look for terms with words like “buy,” “compare,” or “for [use case].”</li>
<li>Create one highly focused <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/landing-page-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">landing page</a> per target keyword.</li>
<li>Review performance quarterly to identify new opportunities or saturation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Update content to emphasize commercial intent</h3>
<p>AI can summarize basic information. However, when content provides clear pathways toward decision-making—features broken down, outcome-oriented comparisons, tangible tools—readers are more likely to click and convert.</p>
<p>If a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post">blog post</a> ranks but attracts the wrong type of reader, reframe it with mid- or bottom-of-funnel intent. Add tools, comparisons, concrete use cases, or interactive elements that guide readers from curiosity to action.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/commercial-intent-blog-example-real-estate-agent.webp" alt="commercial intent blog example from real estate agent" width="900" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94241" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/commercial-intent-blog-example-real-estate-agent.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/commercial-intent-blog-example-real-estate-agent-480x427.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>

<h4>Real-world examples</h4>
<p>VenturePact, a software development service, tapped into a common audience question: “How much will an app cost?” By publishing an interactive cost calculator via Outgrow, they gave readers a direct, personalized answer. In two weeks, <strong>traffic rose <a href="https://outgrow.co/blog/interactive-case-study-venturepact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15%</a>, conversion rates jumped 28%, and the campaign generated more than 11,500 qualified leads.</strong></p>
<p>The same principle works on more traditional blog posts. Oskar shared that one of his clients had a DIY guide pulling heavy traffic but producing zero leads. By reframing the piece into “DIY strategies (and when to get expert help),” adding common pitfalls, and naturally positioning the service as the solution, the article began generating conversions. “Traffic dipped slightly, but leads doubled,” he explained.</p>
<p>Together, these cases show that content isn’t just about volume. It’s about intent. Even small structural shifts—like adding an interactive tool or reframing advice to highlight next steps—can transform high-traffic dead ends into steady lead sources.</p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Dropping product-focused CTAs into content that doesn’t address the reader’s next step. If the offer feels out of sync with the context, you lose trust instead of gaining leads.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/10/content-audit">Audit blog posts</a> that get high traffic but low conversions.</li>
<li>Identify activation opportunities: places where a calculator, comparison, or widget fits naturally.</li>
<li>Use tools like Outgrow to build simple, relevant interactive assets (estimators, checklists, ROI calculators).</li>
<li>Reframe advice-driven content to highlight when your product/service is the natural solution.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Build pages that solve complex problems</h3>
<p>AI is quick but lacks depth. Content that offers thorough, multi-step frameworks, deep analysis, or industry-specific recommendations still wins clicks—and converts.</p>
<p>Complex queries require context, nuance, and depth. AI is not there yet, and readers will click into content that truly solves their layered questions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/problem-solving-page-example-education.webp" alt="problem solving page example from education company" width="900" height="502" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94247" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/problem-solving-page-example-education.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/problem-solving-page-example-education-480x268.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>

<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p>Swiss Gear partnered with conversion agency The Good. By integrating Hotjar heatmaps and user journey data, they optimized their mobile navigation and improved revenue per visit on mobile by <a href="https://capturly.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">28%</a>, reduced bounce rate by 8%, and increased time-on-site by 84%.<a href="https://www.hotjar.com/customers/the-good/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> </a></p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Creating long content without clarity. Complexity without structure becomes noise, not value.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Choose problems that cannot be resolved in a few paragraphs.</li>
<li>Layer text with visuals, videos, interactive flows, or downloads.</li>
<li>Interlink to relevant product or service pages to capture intent.</li>
</ul>
<div id="how-to-own-more-of-your-audience-with-retention-channels"></div>
<h2>How to own more of your audience with retention channels</h2>
<p>When low-intent traffic drains away, relying on discovery channels like search becomes a liability. The smartest marketers are shifting part of their focus from acquisition to ownership—building direct, durable connections with their audiences that no algorithm can sever.</p>
<h3>8. Double down on email marketing</h3>
<p>With <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/zero-click-searches">zero-click search</a> behavior on the rise, email gives you a direct, reliable line to your audience. It also lets you shape engagement into an ongoing experience rather than a one-off interaction.</p>
<p>Email is an owned channel that cannot be bypassed by AI. If someone is on your list, you control how and when they receive your content—without summaries, algorithm filters, or visibility risk.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-email-marketing-wordstream-true-classic.webp" alt="AI email marketing - email from True Classic" width="461" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93693" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-email-marketing-wordstream-true-classic.webp 461w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-email-marketing-wordstream-true-classic-231x300.webp 231w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px" /></p>
<h4>Real-world examples</h4>
<p>AirDNA used behavioral data synced with HubSpot to trigger targeted onboarding campaigns. The result: churn dropped by <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/case-studies/airdna" target="_blank" rel="noopener">45%</a> and onboarding completion rose 38%.</p>
<p>Oskar saw similar success by changing the <em>format</em> of email itself. “When search traffic dipped for a client, we launched a 5-day email mini-course. Each email was a short, punchy lesson, and open rates nearly doubled because people looked forward to the next one. It turned email from a broadcast into an event.”</p>
<p>Both cases show how <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/email-marketing-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email marketing campaigns</a> can carry more weight than just newsletters or promotions. Whether through behavioral triggers or serialized learning experiences, the key is to make emails feel relevant and worth anticipating.</p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Treating email as purely transactional. Over-promotion wears out subscribers quickly. Build value before you sell.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Audit opt-in points and make them visible in high-traffic areas.</li>
<li>Design email experiences (courses, serialized reports, themed content) instead of one-off blasts.</li>
<li>Use behavioral data to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-email-marketing">personalize campaigns</a> that reduce churn and improve activation.</li>
<li>Experiment with frequency and measure engagement closely before scaling.</li>
</ul>

<h3>9. Build a retargeting funnel</h3>
<p>As traffic volume falls, maximizing the value from existing visitors is critical. Few visitors convert on first touch. Retargeting creates follow-up paths to re-attract visitors who left without action.</p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p>While not tied to a single brand’s campaign, performance benchmarks from recent data show the effectiveness clearly: service-based businesses recover <a href="https://www.whatconverts.com/blog/retargeting-ad-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5–15%</a> of abandoned interactions and can cut abandonment by up to 26% using sequential messaging aligned to the funnel stage.<a href="https://www.whatconverts.com/blog/retargeting-ad-examples/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> </a></p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>One-size-fits-all messaging. A visitor who viewed pricing needs a different message than one who visited a blog post.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Build segmented audiences in ad platforms (e.g., users who visited pricing pages vs. blog content).</li>
<li>Create distinct messaging for each segment: reminder, social proof, then offer.</li>
<li>Use frequency caps to avoid ad fatigue.</li>
</ul>
<h3>10. Launch a free tool or calculator</h3>
<p>Tools don’t just drive traffic. They generate engagement, leads, and backlinks over time. Unlike static articles that AI can summarize away, interactive tools give users a reason to stay and return.</p>
<p>A lightweight tool offers interactive value that AI cannot replicate. It gets bookmarked, shared, and remembered.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/renovation-calculator-example.webp" alt="ai free tool example - renovation calculator" width="900" height="580" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94248" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/renovation-calculator-example.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/renovation-calculator-example-480x309.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This <a href="https://www.remodelum.com/renovation-cost-estimator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation calculator</a> helps homeowners budget their home projects.</em></p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p>BEMO, a cybersecurity partner for SMBs, embedded an Outgrow cost calculator into their Intercom chat widget. Instead of forcing every prospect to request a quote, the tool delivered instant custom pricing. The result: <a href="https://outgrow.co/blog/interactive-case-study-bemo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4 million in pipeline value, with an average deal size of $12,000</a>.</p>
<p>Tom highlights another key success factor: alignment. “Free tools work best when they’re tightly aligned with your core product. Otherwise, they grab attention but never translate into adoption. That’s why we built our E-E-A-T Score Checker—every use case led naturally back to our platform.”</p>
<p>The common thread is focus. BEMO’s calculator funneled prospects toward buying decisions, while SE Ranking’s checker funneled users into product adoption. Tools succeed when they shorten the path from curiosity to action.</p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Overbuilding. Chasing complexity slows you down. A simple MVP validates faster, and feedback shows where to improve.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pinpoint a calculation or estimate that your audience frequently seeks.</li>
<li>Build a lean version with a no-code platform like Outgrow.</li>
<li>Make it visible across the site, chatbot, email signatures, and social.</li>
<li>Tie the tool’s outputs directly to your product or service, so the next step is obvious.</li>
</ul>
<h3>11. Use SMS and push notifications for promotions</h3>
<p>As user attention fragments, a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/sms-marketing-examples">well-targeted text message or notification</a> bypasses email and search filters to deliver timely offers directly to the user’s device.</p>
<p>Mobile notifications deliver messages instantly to the user’s screen, bypassing search entirely. Their immediacy can drive rapid engagement.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sms-example-stratia-come-back-text-png.webp" alt="sms marketing example from stratia to come back" width="488" height="244" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89712" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sms-example-stratia-come-back-text-png.webp 488w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sms-example-stratia-come-back-text-480x240.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 488px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p>Nadine Merabi, a fashion brand, <a href="https://www.attentive.com/case-studies/nadine-merabi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched SMS marketing via Attentive in May 2024</a>. Their goal was to grow an engaged subscriber list and drive conversions with personalized, timely messages while respecting regulatory compliance.<a href="https://www.attentive.com/case-studies/nadine-merabi?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> </a></p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Over-messaging or poorly segmented messaging. These channels demand relevance; otherwise, they annoy instead of convert.</p>
<h4>Action Step</h4>
<ul>
<li>Offer a compelling opt-in—like early access or exclusive discounts.</li>
<li>Segment messages by behavior or geography for relevance.</li>
<li>Keep messages short, timely, and actionable.</li>
</ul>
<div id="how-to-diversify-your-acquisition-beyond-search"></div>
<h2>How to diversify your acquisition beyond search</h2>
<p>Relying solely on Google right now is like relying solely on organic Facebook reach in 2015—it works until it doesn’t. Expanding your acquisition mix not only offsets traffic losses but also exposes you to entirely new audiences.</p>
<h3>12. Use paid search to fill in the gaps</h3>
<p>While informational clicks are declining, commercial intent in paid search remains strong. With <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-audience-targeting">precise targeting</a>, you can “buy back” some of the high-value visitors you’ve lost.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-benchmarks-example-ads-on-serp.webp" alt="google ads benchmarks - example ad serp" width="800" height="379" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91526" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-benchmarks-example-ads-on-serp.webp 800w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-benchmarks-example-ads-on-serp-480x227.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p>SmartRecruiters ramped up its Google Ads campaigns with tighter optimizations and targeting. The result: a <a href="https://www.growthmarketingpro.com/case-study-smartrecruiters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">37x increase</a> in leads and an 89% reduction in CPA.</p>
<p>The lesson here is focus. Paid search only works when campaigns zero in on bottom-funnel intent. Tamara explains it bluntly: “Don’t waste budget trying to replace lost informational traffic. Paid search thrives when you target bottom-of-funnel queries that signal a clear intent to buy.”</p>
<p>That’s why SmartRecruiters’ wins weren’t about volume: they were about efficiency. They invested in the keywords closest to revenue, aligning ad copy and landing pages to the exact intent behind the search.</p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Throwing money at broad keywords to chase volume. This dilutes returns and often brings in visitors with no purchase intent.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use Google Ads Keyword Planner to identify bottom-funnel, high-conversion keywords.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-copy">Write ad copy</a> that mirrors the searcher’s specific intent.</li>
<li>Route traffic to landing pages tailored to that intent, not a generic homepage.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/08/google-ads-conversion-tracking-mistakes">Track conversions</a> closely and prune wasted spend aggressively.</li>
</ul>
<h3>13. Experiment with social ads and influencer seeding</h3>
<p>Platforms like TikTok act as discovery engines. Short-form video and influencer content allow you to reach new audiences—and drive traffic—without relying on Google.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-amicis-tiktok.webp" alt="Get found online - Amici's TikTok" width="937" height="594" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92306" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-amicis-tiktok.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-amicis-tiktok-480x304.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Real-world examples</h4>
<p>Natural skincare brand Naked and Thriving ran a campaign using Brandbassador to manage micro-influencers and crowd-generated content. In just a few months, they had <a href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/crazy-100000-investment-that-turned-into-a-multimillion-dollar-empire/news-story/849ae5a4c296df7173a99c0c576d037f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">350 ambassadors with a total reach of 8.68 million, delivering a 215 % ROI</a>.<a href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/crazy-100000-investment-that-turned-into-a-multimillion-dollar-empire/news-story/849ae5a4c296df7173a99c0c576d037f?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> </a></p>
<p>Beauty brand Naturium, originally built on “clean beauty,” pivoted to a more clinically backed positioning. Co-owner and influencer Susan Yara leaned into micro-influencers across TikTok, Reddit, and X—contributing to explosive growth, international reach, and nearly <a href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/beauty/how-naturium-pivoted-from-clean-to-clinical-beauty-to-reach-dollar100m-in-sales" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$100 million in retail sales by 2023</a>.<a href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/beauty/how-naturium-pivoted-from-clean-to-clinical-beauty-to-reach-dollar100m-in-sales?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> </a></p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Overinvesting in a single influencer without testing—you risk low ROI and a misfit audience. Instead, start small.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Deploy micro-influencer batches to test performance.</li>
<li>Boost top-performing content with <a href="https://localiq.com/products/social-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social ads</a>.</li>
<li>Track ROI with UTM links or unique promo codes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>14. Distribute content in non-Google channels</h3>
<p>Audiences are discovering content outside of Google in places like LinkedIn, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reddit-marketing">Reddit</a>, Quora, and niche communities. When people search for expertise instead of keywords, they often start on these platforms. Showing up there expands reach and builds credibility before they ever reach your site.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-reddit.webp" alt="Get found online -Reddit discussion.," width="762" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92304" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-reddit.webp 762w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-reddit-480x378.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 762px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p>A CPA firm revitalized its marketing by syndicating blog posts, guides, and videos across multiple channels. The strategy generated 950 form submissions, increased organic traffic from about <a href="https://mike-hardy-thumbwind.medium.com/4-proven-flipboard-traffic-strategies-that-reduce-dependence-on-google-and-seo-drudgery-47a4043f1bb1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">300 to 2,000–3,000</a> visits per month, and delivered nearly $1 million in recurring revenue.</p>
<p>Tom explains how this works in practice: “For B2B SaaS and SEO, LinkedIn has been surprisingly effective. It’s not just distribution, it’s where credibility compounds. By the time prospects book a call, they’ve already seen our content, and half the selling is done.” His perspective shows the difference between blasting content everywhere and placing it where trust naturally builds.</p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Treating distribution as copy-paste. Dropping blog links into communities without adapting to each platform’s norms makes you look out of touch and gets ignored.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Select 2-3 channels where your audience is already active (LinkedIn for B2B, Reddit for niche verticals, Quora for problem-driven searches).</li>
<li>Rewrite content natively so it matches the platform’s style and expectations.</li>
<li>Use light-touch CTAs (profiles, signatures) rather than pushing links into every post.</li>
<li>Track engagement across channels to refine where credibility compounds fastest.</li>
</ul>
<h3>15. Publish on aggregator and syndication platforms</h3>
<p>Even high-quality content may never be discovered if it lives solely on your site. <a href="https://revnew.com/blog/top-content-syndication-vendors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syndication on platforms</a> with massive distribution can significantly amplify reach—especially when AI systems tap those platforms prominently.</p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-media-trends-37509e40-f215-11ef-b600-130450024a29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dow Jones expanded its content reach by syndicating to over 5,000 partners through its Factiva platform</a>. This AI-aligned distribution ensures trusted content is surfaced in Smart Summary outputs, improving visibility and use in AI-driven search and enterprise queries.</p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Syndicating without proper canonical links, attribution, or strategic alignment can diminish SEO value and reduce your content’s credibility.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Identify reputable syndication platforms or marketplaces (like Factiva or niche vertical aggregators).</li>
<li>Ensure your content is properly attributed back to your site (via canonical tags or byline links).</li>
<li>Tailor content formats to fit syndication needs—briefs, summaries, or multimedia-rich snippets.</li>
<li>Use tracking parameters to monitor <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/11/29/referral-traffic">referral traffic</a> from syndicated placements.</li>
<li>Leverage AI sourcing—content available on trusted platforms is more likely to be included in AI summaries and outputs.</li>
</ul>
<div id="how-to-adjust-your-content-strategy-for-the-ai-age"></div>
<h2>How to adjust your content strategy for the AI age</h2>
<p>If AI can summarize your content without a reason to click, you need to give it—and human readers—something it can’t replicate.</p>
<h3>16. Create “AI-resistant” content</h3>
<p>Generic, derivative content is what AI handles best. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-differentiate-content">Proprietary data, original frameworks, and first-hand insights</a> are much harder to scrape and summarize. Tamara puts it simply: “The most defensible content is original research backed by proprietary data. AI is a synthesizer; it can’t create new information. That’s your competitive moat.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-survey-1.webp" alt="" width="936" height="523" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91825" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-survey-1.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-survey-1-480x268.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.contentconnect.site/blog/state-of-ai-in-content-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h4>Real-world example:</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/mar/06/bbc-news-ai-artificial-intelligence-department-personalised-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BBC News launched a Growth, Innovation, and AI department in early 2025</a> with a focus on producing hyper-personalized and uniquely valuable content for under-25 audiences. By prioritizing bespoke insights instead of clickbait or generic pieces, they created material that is distinct and much harder for AI aggregators to replicate.</p>
<p>The principle applies to any business. If you create content that originates from your own data, your customers’ experiences, or your team’s perspectives, AI cannot replicate it. That uniqueness becomes the foundation for authority and long-term visibility.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Conduct surveys, run experiments, or compile <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2025-google-ads-benchmarks">industry benchmarks</a> that no one else has.</li>
<li>Integrate expert quotes and contrarian opinions to create perspective-driven content.</li>
<li>Publish unique definitions or frameworks that others in your field will cite.</li>
<li>Package findings in ways that can be referenced by both humans and search engines.</li>
</ul>
<h3>17. Move conversion elements to the top</h3>
<p>If AI tools scrape only your intro, that’s prime real estate. Put your most compelling CTAs, data points, and USPs where they can’t be missed.</p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p>Human Interest, a 401(k) provider for SMBs, relocated a contact form above the fold—placing it among the first things visitors saw. This adjustment led to a <a href="https://www.marquiz.io/blog/conversion-optimization-case-studies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">75.84%</a> increase in conversion rate, boosting overall form submissions significantly.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rebrandly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebrandly</a> took a similar approach with content. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-yoder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stephanie Yoder</a>, their Director of Content, reviewed which posts drove the most traffic and conversions. She then redesigned those posts to include large CTA boxes in the first third of the article. The result: a 10%+ lift in conversions from blog readers. This shows that early placement of conversion elements isn’t just for landing pages—it works for editorial content too.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Add a concise, benefit-driven CTA in the first 100 words.</li>
<li>Front-load your most compelling proof points.</li>
<li>Use clear, non-generic headlines above the fold.</li>
</ul>
<h3>18. Optimize for rich snippets and structured data</h3>
<p>Structured data helps both Google and AI parse your content more effectively, increasing the chances of visibility in rich snippets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/featured-snippet-example-dog-brushing-png.webp" alt="featured snippet example for how often to brush dogs teeth query" width="1758" height="728" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90176" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/featured-snippet-example-dog-brushing-png.webp 1758w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/featured-snippet-example-dog-brushing-1280x530.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/featured-snippet-example-dog-brushing-980x406.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/featured-snippet-example-dog-brushing-480x199.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1758px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p>Vidio, one of Indonesia’s largest OTT streaming platforms, implemented VideoObject structured data at scale and fixed unstable media URLs so Google could consistently fetch and parse their videos. Within a year, they saw about <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/case-studies/vidio-case-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3x more</a> video impressions and nearly 2x more video clicks from Google Search.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Add schema markup (FAQ, HowTo, Review) to key pages.</li>
<li>Use descriptive headers, bullet points, and numbered lists.</li>
<li>Answer related sub-questions directly within your content.</li>
</ul>
<h3>19. Focus on topics that AI can’t answer fully</h3>
<p>AI often delivers surface-level responses. It struggles with nuance, brand voice, and niche complexity, especially in areas where local insights, cultural context, or brand differentiation matter most. That gap is an opportunity for content that goes deeper and answers what AI cannot.</p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p>DreamGen, a creative AI storytelling platform, had to compete with giants like Character.AI and AI Dungeon in late 2024. With little organic traffic or domain reputation, they carved out visibility by focusing on niche but intent-rich queries such as “Best AI Character Apps” and “How to Jailbreak ChatGPT.” These <a href="https://www.embarque.io/case-studies/dreamgen-case-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeted angles aligned with their brand strengths and produced meaningful search traction even against larger players</a>.</p>
<p>This strategy is echoed by Oskar, who says, “I look for queries where AI answers are all surface and zero depth. If the response is just ‘step 1: collect data, step 2: analyze it,’ that’s my cue to create a detailed, step-by-step guide with screenshots and real advice. AI leaves people hungry; our job is to feed them.” His insight underlines why specificity wins. Where AI stops at the outline, your content can become the full meal.</p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Targeting broad, AI-saturated keywords like “AI writing tools” or “AI storytelling.” These spaces are already flooded with generic content and rarely produce returns.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Audit AI-generated answers in tools like Google SGE or Perplexity to spot where responses are shallow.</li>
<li>Identify gaps where expert insights, local examples, or brand-driven nuance can elevate the content.</li>
<li>Produce detailed, practical content in those niches even if the search volume looks modest.</li>
<li>Track performance for early signs of traction from long-tail and referral traffic.</li>
</ul>
<h3>20. Contribute to high-authority sources</h3>
<p>Even if AI tools extract answers from your site, they prioritize quoting or summarizing content from trusted domains—citation equity matters.</p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p>Writesonic discusses how strategic PR placements (getting branded insights featured in respected media) can <a href="https://writesonic.com/blog/pr-for-ai_search-visibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener">directly influence visibility in AI-generated search results</a>. These authoritative citations improve the likelihood that AI summaries will include your name, even if not clicking through to your site.</p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Only publishing on your own site and hoping AI will discover it naturally. Instead, leverage placement on trusted external platforms.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pitch guest articles or expert commentary to top industry blogs and media outlets.</li>
<li>Respond to journalist requests via HARO, Qwoted, or similar platforms.</li>
<li>Ensure your author bio includes links and references back to your owned properties.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Less traffic? No problem with these tips</h2>
<p>The loss of low-intent traffic is a signal, not a sentence. AI is filtering out the fluff, and that forces us to sharpen our strategies—focusing on conversions, owned channels, high-intent acquisition, and content AI can’t replicate.</p>
<p>Audit your current content this week. Flag what’s losing traffic. Then decide: rework it, redirect it, or retire it. Fill the gaps with assets and campaigns that win in the AI-shaped search landscape.</p>
<p>The marketers who make this shift now won’t just recover lost ground—they’ll build a more resilient, more profitable engine for years to come.</p>

<h2>What is reputation management for small businesses?</h2>
<p>Reputation management is the ongoing process of shaping how customers perceive your business, both online and in your community, by monitoring reviews, responding to feedback, and<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/27/trust-signals"> fostering trust</a> through positive interactions. For small businesses, it means making sure that when people search for you—or hear about you locally—they find honest, positive, and consistent stories about your brand.</p>
<p>Cultivating your reputation is both proactive and reactive. It includes actions like positioning yourself as an expert online, as well as responding to public feedback from customers.</p>
<p>Take a local HVAC repair shop, for example. It will get <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/07/22/yelp-reviews">Yelp reviews</a>, a Google Business Profile, and some word-of-mouth awareness, whether or not the team actively manages the business’s reputation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-review-example.webp" alt="Reputation management - Google review." width="937" height="605" class="aligncenter wp-image-93879 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-review-example.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-review-example-480x310.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If the business monitors its mentions, takes proactive steps to build a good standing, and responds to feedback, it’ll cultivate a much better reputation than its competitors.</p>

<h2>How does reputation management help your business?</h2>
<p>For small businesses, your reputation is a superpower that helps you compete with much larger competitors. Coupled with a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/17/increase-online-presence">strong online presence</a>, a stellar reputation makes you the obvious choice to anyone searching for what you sell.</p>
<p>Reputation management:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Helps you get more customers:</strong> <a href="https://upfirst.ai/blog/17-online-review-statistics?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">94%</a> of consumers are likely to try a business that has at least a four-star rating.</li>
<li><strong>Helps you get found online:</strong> <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/local-seo-small-business/454910/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google uses review count</a> and rating as a factor when ranking your website for relevant searches.</li>

<h2>Small business reputation management challenges</h2>
<p>Small businesses have some unique hurdles to overcome when it comes to keeping their reputation squeaky clean. Here are several of the most common challenges and tips to overcome them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limited time and resources:</strong> Focus on a few high-impact actions—like monitoring Google reviews weekly and replying promptly—rather than trying to do everything.</li>
<li><strong>Low social media engagement:</strong> Consistency beats all on social media. Publish<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/10/facebook-post-ideas"> new content regularly</a>, highlight customer stories, and ask questions that invite simple responses to spark interaction.</li>
<li><strong>Difficulty generating reviews:</strong> Build <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">review requests</a> into your sales or service process, such as sending a quick follow-up email or text with a direct review link.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of local positive press coverage:</strong> Create your own buzz by sponsoring small <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/04/25/event-marketing">community events</a>, sharing local success stories, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/04/how-to-write-a-press-release">pitching to neighborhood news outlets</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Too many negative reviews:</strong> <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-respond-to-negative-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Respond quickly and professionally</a>, fix issues where possible, and actively encourage happy customers to share their experiences to balance out the negativity.</li>
<li><strong>Competing with larger businesses:</strong> Lean into your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/unique-selling-proposition">unique selling proposition</a> and emphasize authenticity, local roots, and customer relationships that big brands can’t match.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to manage your business’s reputation (online and beyond)</h2>
<p>You don’t need a 100-page strategy to manage—and improve—your business’s reputation. You can build an effective and efficient reputation management strategy using these steps and the following tips.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/900x800-1-1.webp" alt="Reputation management - Checklist" width="739" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93916 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/900x800-1-1.webp 739w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/900x800-1-1-480x390.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 739px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>1. Establish a presence across all relevant listings</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/01/business-directory-listings">Business directories</a> are often the first place a potential customer will encounter your brand. That’s because platforms like Yelp, Google Business Profile, and Angi spend a lot of money to get in front of people searching for solutions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-yelp-google.webp" alt="Reputation management - Google result with Yelp in it." width="937" height="523" class="aligncenter wp-image-93880 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-yelp-google.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-yelp-google-480x268.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Business directories often sit at the top of Google results pages.</em></p>
<p>Here’s the tricky part: Some of these directories will automatically create a listing for your business, and it can be filled with incorrect or incomplete data.</p>
<p>We recently reviewed 100 home services business listings and found that <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/home-services-business-listings-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">85%</a> of them were completely missing, incomplete, or incorrect.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-pie-chart.webp" alt="Reputation management - chart from listings study." width="869" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93881 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-pie-chart.webp 869w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-pie-chart-480x331.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 869px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>So your first job is to claim your business listings on the directories that matter and review them for complete and correct information. Here’s how to claim your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-claim-a-business-on-google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Business Profile</a> and your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/angi-business-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angi listing</a>.</p>
<p>You can check each one individually. But it’ll be a lot easier and faster to use<a href="https://localiq.com/free-business-listings-grader/?cid=Web_WS_InContentTextLink_Freemium_Listings&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> LocaliQ’s Free Business Listing Grader</a>. Simply connect your Google Business Profile, and it’ll automatically review your presence across more than 20 top business directories.</p>
<h3>2. Actively monitor reviews</h3>
<p>Online reviews have a<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-online-reviews-impact-your-business"> significant impact</a> on your ability to get new customers.<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/19/digital-marketing-statistics"> 93%</a> of people read online reviews before making a purchase, so it’s crucial to your business growth to understand what your reviews say.</p>
<p>Like listings, you can monitor the review platforms that matter (like Google, Facebook, etc.). Or you can <a href="https://localiq.com/products/listings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use a solution</a> that collects them in one place and displays them on a single dashboard.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/liq-free-tool-business-listings-grader-feature-section.webp" alt="" width="1000" height="1000" class="aligncenter wp-image-74471 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/liq-free-tool-business-listings-grader-feature-section.webp 1000w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/liq-free-tool-business-listings-grader-feature-section-980x980.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/liq-free-tool-business-listings-grader-feature-section-480x480.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1000px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Pro tip: Set an alert to notify you when new reviews come in so you can take the next step in this strategy and reply.</p>
<h3>3. Respond to every review</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.shoutaboutus.com/blog/over-half-of-consumers-wont-use-businesses-that-ignore-their-reviews-survey-finds?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Over half of consumers</a> won’t use a business that ignores reviews. Plus, people spend <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/19/digital-marketing-statistics">50%</a> more with businesses that respond to reviews. And 53% of customers expect a brand to respond to a negative review within seven days.</p>
<p>That’s compelling evidence showing why responding to reviews is a crucial step in successful reputation management.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-positive-review.webp" alt="Reputation management - a good reply to a positive review." width="673" height="448" class="aligncenter wp-image-93882 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-positive-review.webp 673w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-positive-review-480x320.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 673px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Keep in mind, the wrong response—especially to a bad review—can make things worse. Here are a few tips to win over current and future customers when you <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-respond-to-negative-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reply to a negative review</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set your goal: </strong>Before typing a response, imagine what outcome you want. If you want to win back the dissatisfied customer and demonstrate to others reading the review that you’re a trusted partner, then approach the response with that in mind.</li>
<li><strong>Personalize your response:</strong> This isn’t the time for a generic note. Confirm that you’ve taken the feedback to heart, reiterate the concern, and offer a specific solution.</li>
<li><strong>Apologize: </strong>A swift apology is a strong foundation for your response.</li>
<li><strong>Offer a resolution and take it offline:</strong> Give a brief synopsis of how you’ll make things right and offer to discuss details in DMs, by email, or on the phone.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Encourage more customer reviews</h3>
<ol start="4"></ol>
<p>You can always ask for customer reviews as often and in as many ways as possible. That’s how you build up a solid foundation of great reviews that overwhelms any occasional negative ones.</p>
<p>This guide will show you dozens of ways to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">generate more reviews</a> from your best customers. At the very least, include a review link on your website and set up an automated text or email to request reviews after each purchase.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f31f.png" alt="🌟" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Good reviews solidify your reputation.</strong> Download <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/how-to-get-more-reviews?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_howtogetreviews_Download&amp;itm_source=localiq&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links">How to Get More Reviews: Tips to Boost Ranking, Reputation, &amp; Revenue </a></p>
<h3>5. Set up social listening</h3>
<p>The next item on our reputation management task list is to track the instances of people mentioning your brand online. And for that, we’ll use a tactic called <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/20/social-listening">social listening</a>.</p>
<p>Social listening is the practice of tracking what people say about your business on social media, in forums, and through other digital outlets. Here’s how to use social listening to spot those mentions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use a social media management tool:</strong> Enter your business name and other relevant keywords into a<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/17/best-free-social-media-management-tools"> social media management tool</a> like Sprout Social or Crowdfire, and they’ll seek out places your brand is mentioned.</li>
<li><strong>Search the platforms:</strong> Type your business name or relevant hashtag into the query bar of a social media app or online forum (like Quora or Reddit) to see if it’s mentioned.</li>
<li><strong>Set up a Google Alert: </strong>Set up a<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/04/10/google-alerts"> Google Alert</a> for your business or product name and receive notifications when it’s mentioned on the web.</li>
</ul>
<p>When those conversations pop up, be prepared to jump in and answer questions, add context, or just have fun with your customers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-fun.webp" alt="Reputation management - Tweet reply from KFC." width="504" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93883 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-fun.webp 504w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-fun-480x571.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 504px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://x.com/billyboxing2/status/1961391703673196632" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>6. Create a crisis triage process</h3>
<p>Stay in business long enough and you’re bound to have some sort of reputation crisis. It could result from a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/12/28/marketing-fails">poorly timed ad</a> or an unfortunate customer experience. It may even be something completely out of your control, like a vindictive competitor review bombing your business on Google.</p>
<p>No matter the cause, if you have an action plan in place, you’ll respond more quickly and thoughtfully. Your specific crisis triage process will be unique to your business, but here are a few foundational actions to include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assess: </strong>Review the incident (who, what, where, when, why), including the potential impact.</li>
<li><strong>Assign:</strong> Designate a crisis response team and note who should be alerted, who needs to review, and who needs to approve actions.</li>
<li><strong>Respond:</strong> Set rules around employee communications, handling incoming messages, and creating an official response.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor:</strong> Ramp up your social listening for a while to see how your response fared and be prepared to pivot if future action is needed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Measure success</h3>
<ol start="7"></ol>
<p>The goal is to improve your business’s reputation. The best way to know if you’re succeeding is to set some benchmarks and measure the change over time. Here are three basic measurements to track:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Volume:</strong> Total number of reviews and number of brand mentions.</li>
<li><strong>Sentiment:</strong> The percentage of positive mentions versus negative ones.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback rate:</strong> How often you can reply to reviews and brand mentions, and how fast you do it.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s best to set regular review intervals and create a scorecard for easy reference.</p>

<p>We have the playbook. Now, let’s take your reputation to the next level with some practical tips.</p>
<h3>Crush local SEO</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-seo-in-2024">Local SEO</a> is how you get your website to rank on search engines when people in your area need you most. Getting more positive reviews and filling out your Google Business Profile will help a lot.</p>
<p>However, you’ll also want to conduct some<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/local-keyword-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> keyword research</a> to understand how people search for businesses like yours. Then use those keywords on your product or service pages and in blog content.</p>

<h3>Get involved in the community</h3>
<p>Seeing you out in the community will go a long way to establishing credibility. That could mean sponsoring a local baseball team or a 5k run. But it doesn’t have to cost money. Try showing up to share your expertise at running clubs, community service events, and how-to clinics.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-brc.webp" alt="Reputation management - Instagram post from a running club." width="454" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93885 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-brc.webp 454w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-brc-227x300.webp 227w" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px" /></p>
<h3>Encourage customer referrals</h3>
<p><a href="https://firework.com/blog/referral-marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">52%</a> of small businesses say that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/06/referral-marketing">referrals</a> are their top source of new customers. And those referred customers are <a href="https://cropink.com/referral-marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more profitable and loyal</a> compared with those acquired through other sources.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/14/referral-program-ideas">Referral programs</a> are how you motivate more current customers to recommend your business to their friends, coworkers, and family members.</p>
<p>Here’s how to create a high-performing referral program:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Offer a valuable incentive:</strong> Give discounts in exchange for new customer referrals.</li>
<li><strong>Keep it simple:</strong> Don’t add too many rules or steps to your program.</li>
<li><strong>Promote it everywhere:</strong> Share your referral program on social media, on your website, in emails, on invoices and receipts, and in person (referral cards are a great option).</li>
<li><strong>Run a referral contest:</strong> Let people enter a contest or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/giveaway-ideas">giveaway</a> by referring a friend.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-refer.webp" alt="Reputation management - referral program." width="479" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93886 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-refer.webp 479w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-refer-240x300.webp 240w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px" /></p>
<h3>Be a thought leader on social media</h3>
<p>A big part of reputation management is building trust. One way to do that is by sharing helpful, expert advice on social media.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-plumber.webp" alt="Reputation management - Post from a plumber." width="683" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93887 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-plumber.webp 683w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-plumber-480x422.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 683px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Are you a plumber? Post a video on how to clear a clogged sink. Do you teach yoga? Share the five poses everyone should do to warm up in the morning.</p>
<p>You can do the same thing in your blog. Building<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/topical-authority"> topic authority</a> in this way is also great for SEO. Search algorithms will recognize you as a trusted expert in your field and reward you with<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-rank-higher-on-google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> higher rankings</a>.</p>
<h3>Pay attention to Reddit</h3>
<p>If you’ve spent any time on<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reddit-marketing"> Reddit</a>, you know Redditors tell it like it is. So if you’re a topic of conversation there, you’ll want to know about it or risk a hidden hit to your reputation.</p>
<p>The great news is that Reddit recently launched a free way to track keyword trends called <a href="https://www.business.reddit.com/blog/reddit-pro-trends-launch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reddit Pro Trends</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-reddit-trends.webp" alt="Reputation management - Reddit pro trends." width="937" height="568" class="aligncenter wp-image-93888 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-reddit-trends.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-reddit-trends-480x291.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Just enter the name of your business or product (or any other related keyword), and you can see how often and where it’s mentioned in Subreddits.</p>
<p>A word of caution. Tread lightly if people are talking about you on Reddit. A defensive reply to a negative comment could make things way worse. Instead, consider going in with a learning mindset and either offer a solution or take the feedback and improve what you do.</p>

<h2>Reputation management examples (successful and unsuccessful)</h2>
<p>There’s nothing better than seeing what solid reputation management looks like in the wild, except, perhaps, seeing where it has failed. We’ve got examples of both.</p>
<h3>Successful reputation management examples</h3>
<p>Let’s start off with a few businesses that know how to build an excellent reputation.</p>
<h4>Taking personal responsibility for a bad review</h4>
<p>Bad reviews happen. Here, a returning customer shares their frustration at a bad experience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-negative-review.webp" alt="Reputation management - reply to a negative review." width="937" height="435" class="aligncenter wp-image-93892 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-negative-review.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-negative-review-480x223.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The business owner did so many things right. They apologized immediately, showed they investigated the issue, provided a resolution, and even offered a personal conversation.</p>
<h4>Proving expertise</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/23/tiktok-marketing">TikTok</a> wasn’t traditionally a place people went to learn about dental hygiene. But this dentist has amassed a massive following on the platform by sharing tips to keep teeth strong and healthy.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-dentist.webp" alt="Reputation management - Dentist TikTok" width="308" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93893 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-dentist.webp 308w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-dentist-154x300.webp 154w" sizes="(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px" /></p>
<p>The takeaways here are to be creative in how you reach your audience and to show up with helpful content consistently.</p>
<h4>Owning your business listings</h4>
<p>There are many ways to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/03/google-my-business-optimization"> optimize your business listings</a> beyond verifying business hours and phone number (although that’s a great start).</p>
<p>This HVAC business does a lot to make sure its Google Business Profile gets found and stands out.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-hvac.webp" alt="Reputation management - HVAC Google Business Profile." width="389" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93894 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-hvac.webp 389w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-hvac-195x300.webp 195w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></p>
<p>Note the collection of images showing the team, their capabilities, and their completed projects. Then, scroll down and you’ll see an active Q&amp;A section. Those answered questions give the business additional opportunities to add keywords to their listing and show off the team’s knowledge.</p>
<h3>Unsuccessful reputation management examples</h3>
<p>Sometimes, businesses try to build up a reputation in ways that ultimately fail. Here are a few cautionary tales.</p>
<h4>Using fake reviews</h4>
<p>It takes time to build up a collection of positive reviews. But as important as they are, encouraging fake reviews will cost you a lot in the long run.</p>
<p>Yelp, for example, has <a href="https://www.fox26houston.com/news/yelp-publishes-list-of-5000-businesses-it-suspects-of-fake-or-compensated-reviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cracked down</a> on businesses offering free products, cash, or raffle entries in exchange for five-star reviews. Businesses caught in the act are dropped from the popular site, losing out on a lot of future business.</p>
<h4>Offering an insincere apology</h4>
<p>Mistakes happen. And when they do, you have an opportunity to turn the mishap into a learning and building opportunity.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, one thing that will end any hope at redemption—and crush your reputation—is a cold, impersonal apology.</p>
<p>Take the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/21/business/kyte-baby-ceo-apology-marissa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyte Baby kerfuffle</a>. An employee was denied her request to work remotely so she could stay near her prematurely born adopted baby. The business’s CEO reversed the decision, but then gave what appeared to be a scripted, half-hearted apology.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-apology.webp" alt="Reputation management - Video still of Kitebaby CEO" width="937" height="676" class="aligncenter wp-image-93895 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-apology.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-apology-480x346.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2024/01/22/kyte-baby-ceo-issues-apologies-bernal-cnntm-vpx.cnn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>The social media backlash was swift, and the CEO posted a more personal response that helped soothe the situation.</p>
<h4>Missing opportunities</h4>
<p>Reddit is filled with people looking for help on everything from mowing their lawn to growing their social media following. What’s sad is how many times these questions go unanswered by brands that could help—and gain some solid reputation points in the process.</p>
<p>Consider this question from a small business seeking a solution to its social stagnation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-reddit-missed-opp.webp" alt="Reputation management - Reddit post." width="422" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93896 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-reddit-missed-opp.webp 422w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-reddit-missed-opp-211x300.webp 211w" sizes="(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px" /></p>
<p>The right <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/02/strategies-to-grow-your-digital-marketing-agency">agency</a>, social media freelancer, or social media software provider could step in and help sort out this small business. Sure, they may not get a customer directly, but they’ll show off their expertise and generate positive awareness for their brand.</p>
<div id="free-review-reply-templates"></div>
<h2>Review reply templates</h2>
<p>Replying to reviews is a tricky balance between remaining professional and making it personal. We’ve created two templates—one for positive reviews and one for negative—so you’re ready to reply no matter the situation.</p>
<h3>Positive review template</h3>
<p>Here’s a base template you can fill in to say, “Thanks for your amazing review.” Notice how it allows space to mention a new product or service.</p>
<p><em>Hi [Customer Name],</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you so much for sharing your experience with us! We’re glad to hear that you enjoyed [specific product/service mentioned in review]. Our team works hard to [insert brand value, e.g., “provide quick, friendly service” or “deliver quality you can count on”], so it’s wonderful to know it made a difference for you.</em></p>
<p><em>We’d love to welcome you back anytime, whether it’s to try [another product/service to suggest] or to enjoy [seasonal offer, event, or special]. Thanks again for your support!</em></p>
<h3>Negative review template</h3>
<p>This template is designed to bring an unhappy customer back and show other viewers that your business stands behind its products and services. It has plenty of empathy and accountability to make it extra effective.</p>
<p><em>Hi [Customer Name],</em></p>
<p><em>We’re genuinely sorry to hear about your experience with [specific product/service mentioned in review]. That’s not the level of [service/quality] we aim to provide, and we appreciate you taking the time to let us know.</em></p>
<p><em>Your feedback helps us improve, and we’d like the chance to make this right. Please reach out to us at [contact info] or stop by [location] so we can discuss how to resolve this for you. We value your business and hope you’ll give us the opportunity to provide the experience you deserve.</em></p>
<h2>Make reputation management your new growth hack</h2>
<p>Reputation management isn’t just about being on the defensive. It’s a growth strategy that helps you generate leads and sales from just about every marketing channel out there.</p>
<p>And as a small business, your unflappable reputation is a business moat that’ll keep even your biggest competitors at bay. It just takes a little strategy to make sure your rep stays solid.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Getting found online is no easy task in 2025. AI has both increased the competition for attention and reduced the opportunities to get it (hello, AI Overviews!).</p>
<p>That’s why it’s worth reviewing unexpected wins. What can we learn from that silly blog post or new marketing channel that struck a nerve or reached a new audience, generating 100x the traffic and awareness of anything else you’ve created?</p>
<p>I asked six marketing pros to share a surprising strategy they used (or have seen others use) to get found online and offer an analysis of why it worked. With a little luck and creativity, we can all learn from their experience and replicate the magic.</p>

<h2>6 surprising ways the pros use to get found online</h2>
<p>These marketers found ways to beat the tsunami of content flooding our feeds and gave some tips so you can do the same.</p>
<div id="let-your-fun-flag-fly-on-linkedin"></div>
<h3>1. Let your fun flag fly on LinkedIn</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/generating-leads-on-linkedin">LinkedIn</a> has always been the stuffy cousin of the social media family. The rule of thumb is to keep it professional there and hold the fun for other platforms. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/verydemanda/">Amanda Nielsen</a>, B2B creator and founder of <a href="https://thotleaderlabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thot Leader Labs</a> has found a surprising amount of success by doing, well, the opposite.</p>
<p>“One of my most viral LinkedIn posts used the smiley badge graphic people always post for promotions or major milestones,” she told me. “But I paired it with the caption ‘tried my best’ and listed everyday wins like ‘took constructive criticism without crying’ and &#8216;didn’t accidentally say love you bye at the end of the Zoom.’”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-amanda-1.webp" alt="Get found online - LinkedIn post from Amanda." width="428" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92297 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-amanda-1.webp 428w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-amanda-1-214x300.webp 214w" sizes="(max-width: 428px) 100vw, 428px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/verydemanda_happy-to-announce-i-feel-like-we-should-activity-7239299389364518913-HFgU?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAfpBUkBZn1g_3AT-AQ7-zTMTBRIIDRYtto" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Amanda said the post was meant to “poke fun at how overused that graphic had become and how people were using it for everything.”</p>
<p>It’s a little bit of a gamble to make fun of something so many people do, but the wager paid off. “The post ended up with 9 million impressions, 106K reactions, 3K comments, and 2.4K reposts,” Amanda said. “It got way more traction than my typical audience, helped me grow my following significantly, and sparked conversations with tons of new people I wouldn’t have otherwise met. It even inspired me to turn it into a sticker on <a href="https://thotleaderlabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thotleaderlabs.com</a>.”</p>
<p>Handclap emoji.</p>
<p>The tone in this example isn’t a one-off. Scrolling Amanda’s feed is like flipping through a stand-up comedian’s set notes—if the comedian only played to an audience of B2B professionals.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-amanda-2.webp" alt="Get found online - LinkedIn post from Amanda." width="502" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92298 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-amanda-2.webp 502w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-amanda-2-480x574.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 502px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/verydemanda_yes-they-call-it-waiting-for-procurement-activity-7341868577169297409-h6Dq?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAfpBUkBZn1g_3AT-AQ7-zTMTBRIIDRYtto" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>The lesson here is that getting found online is about standing out, not blending in. If everything around you is boring B2B content, a little sass in the SaaS will snap people out of scrolling—and make your brand a heck of a lot more memorable. As Amanda put it, “It was a good reminder that sometimes the simplest ideas—especially the ones that play with familiar formats—are what resonate most.”</p>
<p>Stepping out of our comfort zones can feel a little sketchy. Here are a few ways I’ve seen marketers do it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create non-traditional content:</strong> Would anyone expect you to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-generation-ideas">publish a comic strip</a> about cybersecurity? Probably not, so it’ll definitely stand out.</li>
<li><strong>Have fun with your own foibles:</strong> We all have missteps in our professional lives. Share yours, especially the ones everyone experiences, and you’ll be a lot more relatable and memorable.</li>
<li><strong>Mismatch the medium and the message:</strong> Most of us don’t want LinkedIn to become Facebook, but one of my most successful LinkedIn posts was a photo from my vacation. An occasional personal post can shake things up in the best way.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Create your own industry awards</h3>
<ol start="2"></ol>
<p>Winning an industry award is a great way to get some attention for your brand. But what would happen if you created an entire awards program that recognized businesses in your field of excellence?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deesha-a-laxsav/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deesha Laxsav</a>, senior brand marketing manager at <a href="https://clutch.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clutch</a>, knows the answer to that question.</p>
<p>“One tactic that significantly increased engagement and traffic for Clutch was our Clutch Global Awards program,” she told me. The program led to “a more than 100% week-over-week increase in <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/social-media-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organic social engagement</a> and an over 55% increase in referral traffic.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-clutch-post.webp" alt="Get found online - LinkedIn post from Clutch." width="492" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92299 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-clutch-post.webp 492w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-clutch-post-480x585.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 492px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/clutch-co_clutchglobal-activity-7331363244789424130-Eg7V?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAfpBUkBZn1g_3AT-AQ7-zTMTBRIIDRYtto" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Clutch is an online directory of B2B service providers from “advertising agencies in Amsterdam to mobile app developers in Mumbai.” The Clutch Global Awards program recognizes the highest-performing providers in various categories.</p>
<p>Deesha said the program&#8217;s success is bolstered by the “strong focus on the promotional support we offered to the winners.” Specifically, Clutch provides award winners with a promotional toolkit featuring social media graphics, badges, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/04/how-to-write-a-press-release">press release templates</a>, messaging, and more “to help them easily share their recognition across their channels.”</p>
<p>Here’s where this strategy gets really cool. Much of the traffic and engagement comes from the award recipients linking back to their Clutch profiles. It’s like they’ve created a whole bunch of partners drumming up <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/11/29/referral-traffic">referral traffic</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-applied-tech.webp" alt="Get found online - LinkedIn post from Applied Tech." width="485" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92301 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-applied-tech.webp 485w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-applied-tech-480x594.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 485px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/applied-tech_clutchglobal-msp-itservices-activity-7338588348258598915-m1_l?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAfpBUkBZn1g_3AT-AQ7-zTMTBRIIDRYtto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>Deesha said they’ve invested in scaling that benefit. “For the first time this year, we were able to <a href="https://clutch.co/agencies/digital-marketing#clutch-global-winners" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce winners directly</a> within their respective categories on our directories,” she explained. “This gave providers even more incentive to share their recognition and link to a specific, relevant page, enhancing both our visibility and SEO performance.”</p>
<p>“We’re always thinking about how to evolve and strengthen this campaign to not only recognize top-performing providers but also to drive greater awareness, engagement, and authority for the Clutch brand,” Deesha added.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be too difficult to replicate aspects of Clutch&#8217;s awards program for any business. Here are a few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create a landing page:</strong> Use it to highlight customers who use your product creatively.</li>
<li><strong>Host an awards event on social media:</strong> create several categories, and share the winners daily for a week. In any case, do as Clutch does and make it easy for winners to celebrate their awards publicly, linking back to your website in the process.</li>
<li><strong>Design a rating system:</strong> Sort of like Michelin stars for restaurants, give your customers a rating for things like sustainability, creative use, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Agitate a fear and provide a real solution</h3>
<p>When you publish a lot of content and one particular asset bests everything else you create for almost every important metric, you take a beat to figure out why it worked so well. That’s exactly what <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/einav-mor-4810613/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Einav Mor</a>, freelance copywriter and content creator, said happened when she published a guide titled “You don&#8217;t know what you don’t know—The true cost of data inaccuracies” while still with her former employer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-appsflyer-guide.webp" alt="Get found online -Appsflyer guide." width="660" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92302 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-appsflyer-guide.webp 660w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-appsflyer-guide-480x436.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 660px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/resources/guides/data-inaccuracies-true-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>“This was a pretty extensive guide I&#8217;ve prepared back at AppsFlyer,” Einave explained. It was “one of the most successful guides we’ve put out. It outperformed anything else we published during that quarter for unique views, time on page, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/03/organic-traffic">organic traffic</a>.”</p>
<p>The guide was underpinned by a common fear among marketers: How can you drive growth when you can’t trust your data? But Einav said that was just one piece of the puzzle. “The goal was to create a sense of FOMO that was backed up by hard numbers and practical steps to avoid costly data discrepancies.”</p>
<p>The result was a guide that made the problem feel real by highlighting the cold, hard costs of inaccurate marketing data. And Appsflyer promoted those facts to drive people to the content.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-appsflyer-fb.webp" alt="Get found online -Appsflyer Facebook post." width="937" height="536" class="aligncenter wp-image-92303 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-appsflyer-fb.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-appsflyer-fb-480x275.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/AppsFlyer/videos/the-true-cost-of-data-inaccuracies/433394551927600/?_rdr" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>“It effectively touched a nerve for any marketer out there and clearly explained the implications of relying on dodgy data for predictions and measurement,” Einav said. “But it wasn&#8217;t just about sowing fear, which would&#8217;ve been a cheap trick. It was about giving tools for marketers to deal with daily uncertainty. And I believe our readers appreciated that.”</p>
<p>While the success of the guide may have been a little surprising, the formula isn’t hard to replicate:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Find a fear that your customers face: </strong>Take a survey and ask what vexes them most.</li>
<li><strong>Make it real with facts and data:</strong> Calculate the results of the survey or figure out the cost of the problem.</li>
<li><strong>Ease the tension with accessible solutions:</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-write-an-ebook">Publish a guide</a> that solves the problem with your product at its center.</li>

<h3>4. Turn Reddit into a reliable source of referral traffic</h3>
<p>Sometimes, the surprisingly successful way to get found online isn’t a single ad or asset; it’s an entire marketing channel. That was the case for<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/megan-janan-j-54232b215/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Megan Janan</a>, a marketing associate at<a href="https://www.whalesync.com/"> Whalesync</a>, who told me that Reddit is their top referral source, driving lots of traffic to their website.</p>
<p>Now, marketing on Reddit isn’t new; we’ve researched and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reddit-marketing">written about it</a> several times. But it is notoriously hard to get a foothold on the platform. Redditors are quick to call out any overt marketing tactics. So when Megan told me about their success, I wanted to know how they achieved it.</p>
<p>“Reddit works because it’s quite BOFU [bottom of the funnel],” Megan said.”Users are either searching for a solution or are frustrated and venting. That’s when you can come in with your comment and solve their problem.”</p>
<p>Here’s an example Megan shared. A Redditor asked about entering custom formulas in a Notion document—a challenge that Whalesync can solve.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-reddit.webp" alt="Get found online -Reddit discussion.," width="762" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92304 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-reddit.webp 762w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-reddit-480x378.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 762px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/uyt693/comment/mihrt4i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>The reply came from a Whalesync employee. It added more context to other Redditors’ suggestions and then provided a link to a post that dug in further.</p>
<p>It’s a tough balance, but when done correctly, the benefits will compound. “Reddit works due to just the sheer amount of views you can get on a comment or thread, especially if you post in the right sub,” Megan said. “But I personally view Reddit as quite ‘evergreen,’ so even though these posts are quite old, if people are searching for something similar, chances are they’ll stumble on this Reddit thread and see our comment, and this can lead to referral traffic.”</p>
<p>Megan said they look for questions that directly relate to their product, like connecting two apps together. But they also have to get creative and find tangential challenges that their product may be able to solve. In the example above, for instance, the user just wanted to add custom formulas in Notion, and connecting to Sheets was a possible solution. In any case, Megan said the goal is to find ways to “unblock users.”</p>
<p>How can you make Whalesync’s Reddit success your own?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Find relevant subreddits:</strong> Start broad and narrow to niche topics. If you’re marketing a physical therapy practice, find healthcare subreddits, but also look for specific running or exercise threads.</li>
<li><strong>Link to your content organically: </strong>Look for opportunities to link out to your educational content, but make sure it tightly aligns with the question being asked. And if you don’t yet have a post that answers the question, there’s your next content idea!</li>
<li><strong>Think creatively when answering:</strong> If you have a popular product, Redditors are probably already discussing it, so you can simply join in. If your product isn’t a hot topic yet, you’ll need to help people see how your product solves problems in ways they hadn’t considered.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Post podcast snippets on YouTube Shorts</h3>
<ol start="5"></ol>
<p>Some of the most popular <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-make-youtube-shorts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube Shorts</a> ever feature speed cleaning a house, a transforming “Cinderella” dress, and a tutorial to make your very own squishy ladybug toy. It’s not the first platform most marketers head to when they need to boost the performance of their B2B podcast.</p>
<p>To be fair, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sneh-ratna-choudhary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sneh Choudhary</a>, Chief Repurposer at <a href="http://scalingradcontent.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scaling Rad Content</a>, was a little skeptical of it, too. “I help repurpose the podcast <a href="https://www.thefrictionlessexperience.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Frictionless Experience</a>,” Sneh said. “It was barely getting any views on YouTube, which is understandable because YouTube may not be the right platform for a B2B podcast. Isn’t LinkedIn a better platform for this?”</p>
<p>But then they ran an experiment, chopping up full-length podcast episodes and running them as Shorts. “And well, this worked better than I expected,” Sneh said.</p>
<p>The Shorts racked up over 30K views and lifted full-episode views by 48%. “And the best part,” Sneh said, “was the full-length episodes that weren’t getting enough views started getting noticed.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-shorts.webp" alt="Get found online - YouTube channel." width="937" height="572" class="aligncenter wp-image-92305 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-shorts.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-shorts-480x293.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheFrictionlessExperience/shorts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>To run the experiment, the team commissioned their video editors to create three or four clips. “But that wasn&#8217;t going to be enough of a sample size to test our hypothesis,” Sneh said. “Will more short-form content shipped consistently help with the podcast&#8217;s visibility?” Sneh used OpusClip—an AI video clipping and editing tool—to scale that production, and so far, it’s working like a charm.</p>
<p>“It’s still early days, but this is exciting. I&#8217;m now running a second experiment where we chop up the podcast into 10 to 15-minute clips, the ideal length for YouTube videos. We&#8217;ll see how that goes.”</p>
<p>The lesson here is not to overlook marketing channels, even if they don’t seem to be the right fit at first. You don&#8217;t want to waste too much time on non-performing channels, though. Here are a few ideas to make the process more efficient:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-repurposing">repurposed content</a>:</strong> Don&#8217;t start from scratch. If you have blog posts, video yourself explaining the same content and try it on YouTube Shorts, TikTok, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Run intentional tests:</strong> Set specific goals for things like traffic or leads, and set a timeline to assess the results.</li>
<li><strong>Use AI:</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-ai-tools">AI tools</a> are great for things like summarizing content or quickly editing video.</li>
</ul>
<div id="use-tiktok-in-unexpected-ways"></div>
<h3>6. Use TikTok in unexpected ways</h3>
<p>Small family-owned businesses can sometimes struggle to get found online. They usually don’t have deep pockets or a team of marketing pros planning out <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/24/editorial-calendar">months&#8217; worth of social content</a>.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reginaldpowell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reggie Powell</a>, a <a href="https://theresultsphase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freelance tech and HR writer</a>, has unearthed a superpower these mom-and-pop shops have that’s hard for big businesses to replicate.</p>
<p>“Considering all the noise and unedited AI slop on the internet, the authenticity a local business can deliver is the new driver of the conversation on social media,” Reggie said.</p>
<p>By way of example, he pointed to Amici’s Pizza, a local restaurant in Mesa, Arizona. “A small business like Amici’s Pizza can’t compete on budget,” he noted. “What they did, which was really smart, was to use their TikTok account to pull back the curtain on what it’s like to run a small business.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-amicis-tiktok.webp" alt="Get found online - Amici's TikTok" width="937" height="594" class="aligncenter wp-image-92306 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-amicis-tiktok.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-amicis-tiktok-480x304.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@amici.pizza" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>In the videos, “We get to meet the crew, see the good and bad of a long day making pies, and get to know what it takes to run a mom-and-pop pizza restaurant,” Reggie said. “That’s how a small pizza shop in Mesa, Arizona, got over 300K followers.”</p>
<p>Amici’s TikTok triumphs are astounding. The most popular video has over 10 million views. People travel from thousands of miles and line up out the door for a buffalo chicken pizza or a plate of rigatoni. Even the local press is sharing the shop&#8217;s social success.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-amicis-press.webp" alt="Get found online - News report on Amicis" width="937" height="643" class="aligncenter wp-image-92307 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-amicis-press.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-amicis-press-480x329.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.azfamily.com/2024/12/02/mesa-pizza-shop-becomes-national-sensation-after-videos-go-viral-tiktok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Reggie said the strategy, if you can call simply showing up as yourself a strategy, has real staying power. “They&#8217;ve become so successful because people feel like they know them,” he explained. “They can identify with their struggles, and they can see what it actually takes to run a small business. This kind of real-life presentation will beat viral trends every time because authenticity doesn&#8217;t go away after a week.”</p>
<p>If you run a small business, you can leverage the power of personal connection to grow a following on social media in the same way. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Share a day in the life:</strong> Capture the challenges, wins, and even the mundane parts of running your business.</li>
<li><strong>Share the inside jokes</strong>: Every industry has funny phrases and recurring themes specific to it. Create some videos highlighting them.</li>
<li><strong>Share your greatest creations:</strong> Whether it&#8217;s a mega-pepporoni pizza, a perfectly poured concrete patio, or a dazzling smile you helped create, let people see your best work and the process it took to get there.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How do you get found online in 2025? Be weird</h2>
<p>Great marketing has always been about getting attention. Some marketers will attempt to do that with pure scale, using AI to flood the feeds of potential customers.</p>
<p>But the examples we’ve seen here go a different direction. They’re publishing unexpected content in new places. They’re breaking patterns, stopping scrollers, and building sticky brands that people remember and want to return to.</p>
<p>In 2025 and beyond, it’ll be a lot harder to get found online by being the same, so try to be a bit weird and see what happens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your Google Business Profile (formerly called Google My Business profile) can be one of your most important marketing (and even business) assets. For some businesses, more calls will come through the company&#8217;s GBP than the company website.</p>
<p>If you’re a local business owner or are in charge of all marketing activities, you may feel overwhelmed by all of the options available in your Google Business Profile. Where do you start? What’s important, and what can you afford to skip or spend less time on?</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll walk through the key features businesses should focus time and effort on to drive more calls, leads, and sales from their GBP.</p>

<h2>10 Google Business Profile features to use</h2>
<p>Let’s walk through each option you should take advantage of in your Google Business Profile.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-features.webp" alt="google business profile features homescreen" width="691" height="244" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91901" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-features.webp 691w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-features-480x169.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 691px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="business-information"></div>
<h3>Business information</h3>
<p>Obviously, as you <a href="https://business.google.com/create/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set up your GBP</a>, you want to make sure you have the most important “blocking and tackling” items taken care of on your profile:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use your legal business name (don’t try to cram keywords into your business name that aren’t consistent with your actual business name).</li>
<li>Make sure that the information you provide for your business name, address, and phone number is consistent with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-citations">any citations you have built or will build</a>.</li>
<li>Provide as much detail as you can within your profile, including hours, amenities, etc.</li>
<li>Pay particular attention here to your service areas, these will be the surrounding areas where your ideal customers can be found. Make sure that you’re including any city or town where you’d find an ideal prospect or customer, but not towns where you’d be reluctant to service an account (even if you may have in the past).</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-business-information.webp" alt="google business profile business information" width="678" height="421" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91902" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-business-information.webp 678w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-business-information-480x298.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 678px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As a general approach here, you want to be comprehensive and accurate—make sure the information in your profile matches information about your business elsewhere on the internet, and fill out every form you possibly can here.</p>
<div id="services"></div>
<h3>Services</h3>
<p>You want to take control of the services you offer on your profile: if you don’t, Google can make adjustments to your profile based on user feedback or other sources.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-services.webp" alt="google business profile services" width="676" height="124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91903" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-services.webp 676w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-services-480x88.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 676px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Generally, you want to be as aggressive as you can with adding services that you offer, while making sure that your primary category is your core service offering.</p>
<p>For instance, if you are a roofing company that also does roof cleaning, gutter cleaning, and skylight installations, you’d want to use roofing as your primary category and add the rest as services. If you don’t see a specific service you offer, you can create a custom service:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-custom-service.webp" alt="google business profile custom services" width="679" height="184" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91904" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-custom-service.webp 679w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-custom-service-480x130.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 679px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You don’t want to add things you don’t offer, however. For example, if you don’t offer gutter cleaning, don’t list it.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure which services to list here, a few options include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at your top competitors&#8211;particularly the competitors ranking well for the search queries you want to rank for&#8211;and see which services they have listed.</li>
<li>Do <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide">keyword research</a> and think about the services you offer to customers.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-ai-tools">AI tools</a> like ChatGPT to generate ideas for possible services based on your business and competitor profiles.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do choose to use an AI tool, make sure to review its output before adding any inaccurate services to your Google Business Profile.</p>

<div id="reviews"></div>
<h3>Reviews, reviews, reviews</h3>
<p>Reviews are the lifeblood of your GBP. In the same way that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/10/link-building-secrets">acquiring external links</a> to your website helps indicate to Google that your site should be trusted and should show in response to key search results, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-online-reviews-impact-your-business">positive reviews</a> help suggest to Google that your GBP should be trusted to show in response to your target keywords.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-reviews.webp" alt="google business profile reviews" width="672" height="159" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91905" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-reviews.webp 672w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-reviews-480x114.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 672px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Reviews are a massively important part of driving rankings, traffic, calls, leads, and sales through your GBP.</p>
<p>Every business with a focus on driving growth from its GBP should have a strategy for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/16/get-more-google-reviews">getting more Google reviews</a> and should be responding as quickly as possible to every individual review.</p>
<p>A member of your team with the bandwidth to respond quickly should be getting emails for every new review. You can see if you have a new review in your Google profile by looking for the notification icon in your GBP:</p>
<p>Google also gives businesses an “ask for reviews” tool, which you can use to request reviews from your customers:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-get-reviews.webp" alt="google business profile request reviews feature" width="644" height="431" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91906" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-get-reviews.webp 644w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-get-reviews-480x321.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 644px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>A few specific tips for using this feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to get a device into the hands of a service provider on your team and ask for feedback on the service immediately after completion.</li>
<li>Ask for feedback and ensure that the customer is happy before requesting a review&#8211;this way, if they have any lingering issues or questions, you can address them before asking for the review, ensuring that the review will be as positive as possible.</li>
<li>Offering money or services in exchange for a positive review is against Google’s guidelines, but you can mention that positive reviews help your business. And, if you have an incentive program for the service provider based on positive reviews, you can also mention that to help encourage the customer to leave a positive review. Again, asking on-site, in person, with a device ready to go to make it as easy as possible will greatly increase your odds of receiving a positive review.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve been in business a long time and have a database of customer information, you can also put together a strategy for going back through your existing and previous customer lists and asking for reviews.</p>

<div id="posts-photos-and-qna-sections"></div>
<h3>Posts, photos, and Q&amp;A sections</h3>
<p>Having specific elements of your profile frequently updated and making those updates specific to your target services and service areas can improve your GBP rankings for specific phrases in specific areas. Two major opportunities here are photos and posts:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-photos-updates.webp" alt="google business profile photos and updates or posts" width="699" height="153" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91907" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-photos-updates.webp 699w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-photos-updates-480x105.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 699px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Regardless of your business, you can find new opportunities to create updates (daily is frequently a good cadence) and add new photos to your profile, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>For service-based businesses, jobs you’ve completed, including information about the location of the job.</li>
<li>For a restaurant, photos of your restaurant, food you’re making, patrons enjoying your food (with permission of course).</li>
<li>For a dentist’s office, photos of your facility, equipment, before and after photos, happy customers, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also post updates about local businesses you partner with, updates on your business, jobs you’re completing, customer profiles, profiles of your employees, etc.</p>
<p>Similarly, building out and periodically updating your Q&amp;A section of your profile with relevant questions and answers is another means of keeping your profile fresh and comprehensive.</p>
<p>Consistently updating your photos and posts and making sure that you’re mentioning the services you offer, along with the areas you’re servicing, helps you show up in response to relevant searches.</p>
<div id="offers-and-events"></div>
<h3>Offers and events</h3>
<p>Similarly, adding information about events you’re having and special offers you’re running helps you get specific search results real estate for your business.</p>
<p>You don’t want to “fake” offers, and this may not be applicable to every small business, but if you run specials and host events, it’s smart to make sure those are represented consistently on your GBP profile.</p>
<div id="performance-metrics"></div>
<h3>Performance metrics</h3>
<p>You should be using multiple tools (Google Analytics 4, Search Console, and call and lead tracking software) to track your overall <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-seo-in-2024">local SEO efforts</a>, but the performance report in GBP gives you specific access to data about your profile, like interactions, calls, etc.</p>
<p>Some of this data can be found in other tools, but it’s helpful to understand how visitors are interacting with your profile and to make sure your optimization efforts are growing desired actions (particularly calls, bookings, and website clicks).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-performance-metrics.webp" alt="google business profile performance metrics example" width="900" height="335" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91908" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-performance-metrics.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-performance-metrics-480x179.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="specialized-gbp-features"></div>
<h3>Specialized GBP features</h3>
<p>Many of the features above apply to several or even all locally focused businesses, but several GBP features are specific to certain types of businesses.</p>
<p>It’s important to be aware of these if you’re a business owner or marketing professional in one of those categories.</p>
<div id="booking"></div>
<h4>Booking</h4>
<p>Bookings allow your customers to book directly from your GBP&#8211;if you’re showing up prominently and getting views of your profile, this could be a great way to get customers who don’t want to engage via phone or your website to book an appointment with you right online.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-booking.webp" alt="google business profile booking feature" width="640" height="417" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91909" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-booking.webp 640w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-booking-480x313.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 640px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>It’s important to understand, however, that you need to be able to accommodate and respond to booking inquiries. If you’re using a third-party system to manage your bookings, you can find out if they integrate with GBP by looking at Google’s <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/reserve/partners?ihs=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Reserve with Google” integration list</a> to see if your provider is listed (and can even request an addition if they’re not yet).</p>
<div id="products"></div>
<h4>Products</h4>
<p>You can also list products on your GBP&#8211;even if you’re a service provider (e.g., if you’re a salon that also sells select hair care or beauty products).</p>
<p>When adding products, you want to optimize them as you would any product listing: have compelling photos and product descriptions, include deep links to the place on your site where they can purchase the product, and keep information on your GBP accurate and up to date (pricing, availability, etc).</p>
<div id="api-and-multi-location-tools"></div>
<h4>API and multi-location tools</h4>
<p>If you have multiple locations, you can use tools like adding a store code or a label to your profile. You can also access the <a href="https://developers.google.com/my-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">API</a> if you have specialized needs and access to a developer.</p>
<p>Google also offers integration with other tools&#8211;such as Google Ads&#8211;which can be valuable if you’re running ads or want the data from your GBP piped into a reporting tool you’re using.</p>
<div id="menu-updates"></div>
<h4>Menu updates</h4>
<p>In addition to bookings and products, GBP allows restaurants to make menu updates. That’s not relevant if you’re not a restaurant. Still, it’s a great opportunity to both show in response to specific searches (e.g., “the best cheeseburger near me”) and give potential customers more information about pricing and what you offer.</p>
<h2>How to think about Google Business Profile features</h2>
<p>Google offers a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfK7mx2knZUBZYE9iGB4AN6uRKawYfMP5NbGFhGU4PX3QONRg/viewform?visit_id=638826603544046897-2053364266&amp;p=subscribe&amp;rd=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monthly newsletter</a> that includes feature updates <a href="https://support.google.com/business/thread/343006067/what-s-new-in-google-business-profile-may-2025?hl=en-GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like these</a> each month and has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/googlebusinessprofile/featured" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube channel</a> dedicated to Google Business Profile updates and tutorials.</p>
<p>As Google introduces new features and tools like AI writing assistants, it’s useful to keep in mind a few things as you determine which makes the most sense for your business:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Be fresh and comprehensive</strong>. Generally, having your information updated frequently and filling out your profile as completely as possible is the best way to show up more frequently. So as niche-specific features are rolled out, it’s usually worthwhile to take the time to complete them.</li>
<li><strong>Remember that tools aren’t features</strong>. While it’s generally a good idea to make sure your information is accurate, to use features like posts or niche-specific features like menus when they’re relevant to you, you don’t need to make use of every AI tool Google rolls out. Often, those tools are made available for businesses who wouldn’t complete their profiles otherwise, and you or someone on your team may be able to write better descriptions, fill in information more accurately, etc. Just because Google offers a specific tool doesn’t mean you have to leverage it.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor news, filter noise</strong>. It’s great to stay on top of features and push relevant, localized information about your business to those features, but you also don’t need to keep track of every minute update Google makes that doesn’t apply specifically to your business.</li>
</ol>
<p>And generally, approach your Google Business Profile like your website or even your storefront: it’s an asset that can help introduce and connect you with customers and potential customers.</p>

<h2>5 reasons you’re not getting website traffic (+what to do about it!)</h2>
<p>Here, we’ll walk through each of the top reasons you’re <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/offset-lower-website-traffic">not seeing traffic</a> to your site and what you can do to fix it.</p>
<div id="your-reporting-is-messed-up"></div>
<h3>1. You’re having reporting issues</h3>
<p>The first question to ask yourself is whether the tool you’re using to report on organic traffic is accurate (and if you’re using it right).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what to do about it.</p>
<h4>Check Google Analytics 4</h4>
<p>A lot of people <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/75-are-not-happy-with-google-analytics-4-ga4-35843.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t like GA4</a>, and if you’re not used to using that tool, you may be using filters incorrectly.</p>
<p>You can quickly check for the existence of organic traffic from search engines by going to reports &gt; acquisition &gt; user acquisition and looking at the First user primary channel group:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-analytics-user-acquisition-organic.webp" alt="google analytics 4 acquisition report for organic search" width="1235" height="438" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91767" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-analytics-user-acquisition-organic.webp 1235w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-analytics-user-acquisition-organic-980x348.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-analytics-user-acquisition-organic-480x170.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1235px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In any view where you’re expecting to see organic search traffic but aren’t, make sure it’s not being filtered out:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-analytics-user-acquisition-all-users.webp" alt="google analytics 4 acquisition report check for all users" width="836" height="253" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91768" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-analytics-user-acquisition-all-users.webp 836w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-analytics-user-acquisition-all-users-480x145.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 836px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you’re looking at an exploration in GA4, the same principles would apply: make sure you understand the way the report is set up and are aware of any filters being applied.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Looking for ways to drive people to your site?</strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website</a></p>
<h4>Check Google Search Console</h4>
<p>If you’re not seeing traffic in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/16/how-to-use-google-search-console">Google Search Console</a>, the filtering issue won’t be traffic source (as it’s showing you only Google-specific traffic), but could be another issue:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-brand-filter.webp" alt="google search console filters" width="1061" height="326" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91769" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-brand-filter.webp 1061w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-brand-filter-980x301.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-brand-filter-480x147.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1061px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Make sure you’re not filtering by queries, page, etc.</p>
<div id="your-website-isnt-getting-indexed"></div>
<h3>2. Your website isn’t getting indexed</h3>
<p>Assuming you’ve checked the tools with which you’re measuring traffic and have confirmed that you are legitimately not getting traffic from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/outdated-seo-tactics">SEO</a>, the first thing to confirm is that your pages are actually getting indexed.</p>
<p>Here’s what to do about it.</p>
<h4>Confirm your site is (or isn’t) getting indexed</h4>
<p>First, check to see if your site is getting indexed. You can do that in two ways:</p>
<p><strong>1. Site search operator:</strong> You can quickly see if your site has pages indexed by using a site search operator. Go to Google and type in site:yoursite dot com and see what results are showing. You should see results like this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/site-search-site-indexed-example.webp" alt="example of google site search for indexed website" width="833" height="396" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91770" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/site-search-site-indexed-example.webp 833w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/site-search-site-indexed-example-480x228.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 833px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And not results like this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/example-site-search-site-not-indexed.webp" alt="example of site not indexed in google search results" width="836" height="605" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91771" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/example-site-search-site-not-indexed.webp 836w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/example-site-search-site-not-indexed-480x347.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 836px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you have Google Search Console set up, you can receive even more robust reporting on which pages on your site are indexed and their current status.</p>
<p><strong>2. Google Search Console:</strong> Once you see the breakdown of not only the pages on your site that aren’t indexed, but also the reason, you can start to address issues:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-pages-report.webp" alt="google search console pages report" width="1222" height="444" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91772" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-pages-report.webp 1222w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-pages-report-980x356.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-pages-report-480x174.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1222px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In this screenshot, we see a few different problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broken links (a page may have been deleted or have another issue) and server errors.</li>
<li>Pages that have been redirected or excluded by a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/meta-tags#:~:text=index/-,noindex,-%E2%80%93%20This%20tells%20the">noindex tag</a> (more on this shortly).</li>
<li>Pages have been crawled, but are not indexed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pages that have been crawled and not indexed or “discovered but not crawled” are often the result of Google not deeming your site sufficiently authoritative and/or not deeming those pages valuable and unique (more on addressing these issues later as well).</p>
<h4>Check for technical issues</h4>
<p>If you’ve found that your site isn’t getting indexed, there are a few particularly common issues that could lead to pages on a site not being indexed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meta noindex tags</strong><strong>: </strong>Often times when a developer is building a staging version of your site they’ll add <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/block-indexing">meta noindex tags</a> to the entire site, to keep Google from crawling and indexing the site before it’s pushed live. It’s also not uncommon for the dev team to fail to remove those tags. If you see a large volume or spike of pages not indexed for this reason in Search Console, this is something to investigate.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/no-index-html-code-example.webp" alt="no index in html code" width="1074" height="244" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91773" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/no-index-html-code-example.webp 1074w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/no-index-html-code-example-980x223.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/no-index-html-code-example-480x109.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1074px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>You can look at the source code of a page and search for the noindex tag.</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/no-index-directives.webp" alt="noindex directive found in screaming frog tool" width="883" height="212" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91774" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/no-index-directives.webp 883w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/no-index-directives-480x115.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 883px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>You can also use a tool like Screaming Frog to crawl your site and identify pages that are noindexed.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Robots directives: </strong>Your site’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/intro#:~:text=A%20robots.txt%20file%20tells,web%20page%20out%20of%20Google." target="_blank" rel="noopener">robots.txt file</a> could also be blocking search engines from crawling (and ultimately indexing) your site. You can check the file itself (yoursite dot com/robots.txt) or look for more information in Google Search Console:</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-robots.webp" alt="google search console robots directives" width="1240" height="434" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91775" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-robots.webp 1240w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-robots-980x343.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-robots-480x168.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1240px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Canonical tags:</strong> A third issue you could be encountering is that a site’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidate-duplicate-urls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canonical tags</a> may be pointing to a different site entirely. Again, you can check these by looking at the source code on a page, or crawling the site with a tool like Screaming Frog:</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/canonicals-set-up.webp" alt="canonicals set up in screaming frog" width="546" height="194" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91776" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/canonicals-set-up.webp 546w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/canonicals-set-up-480x171.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 546px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of crawlable content: </strong>If your content is hidden behind a login, JavaScript, or an element Google isn’t able to interact with, you may not be giving that content a chance to rank in search results.

<h3>3. You have no (or few) backlinks</h3>
<p>If you’ve confirmed that you’re reporting traffic correctly and that there aren’t specific technical issues preventing your site from being indexed and showing in search results, another issue may be a lack of links to your site.</p>
<p>If you’re hoping to get any kind of significant search traffic to your site, you’re going to need to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/05/24/link-building-now">build links</a> over time. As your site first launches, you may not be showing in any search results because your site has zero or very few links. This can be particularly likely if your brand name is something generic that existing companies already have as a name (e.g., Apex), as you may not rank for even your own brand name.</p>
<p>A quick way to address this is to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-citations">build local citations for your business</a>, and then start to work on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/link-building-strategy">different link-building tactics</a> if you’re hoping to grow your site’s organic traffic.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/local-citations-example-unrefined-bakery.webp" alt="examples of local citations in google search for unrefined bakery" width="900" height="663" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91870" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/local-citations-example-unrefined-bakery.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/local-citations-example-unrefined-bakery-480x354.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>

<div id="not-targeting-the-right-keywords"></div>
<h3>4. You’re not targeting the right keywords</h3>
<p>If your site already has a baseline of some links, and you’re still not seeing any traffic from SEO, keyword targeting could be the issue.</p>
<p>Again, if you don’t have a unique brand name, your pages may be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Targeting search terms that don’t have sufficient search volume.</li>
<li>Targeting search terms that are too competitive for the site to rank for.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re using GA4 and not seeing any <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/03/organic-traffic">organic traffic</a>, you can use Google Search Console to see not just clicks but also impressions:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ahrefs-sample-report.webp" alt="google search console report for keyword targeting" width="1031" height="358" class="aligncenter wp-image-91871 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ahrefs-sample-report.webp 1031w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ahrefs-sample-report-980x340.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ahrefs-sample-report-480x167.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1031px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And of course, you can use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">third-party keyword research tools</a> to identify keywords that have search volume as well.</p>
<p>As you identify relevant keywords, you want to build content that provides value while looking for internal and external linking opportunities to those pages to help drive organic traffic to them.</p>
<div id="site-has-been-penalized"></div>
<h3>5. Your site has been penalized</h3>
<p>If you do have links pointed to your site as well as relevant content that targets low competition keywords with search volume, there’s a chance your site has been penalized and will be unable to rank.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what to do about it.</p>
<h4>Check for manual penalties</h4>
<p>The most clearly identifiable penalty is a <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-penalties-manual-actions-notifications-guide-388509" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manual penalty</a>, which is the result of a manual review of your site where a Google Quality Rater flagged your site as spam. You can identify these in Google Search Console:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-manual-actions.webp" alt="google search console manual actions" width="702" height="390" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91872" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-manual-actions.webp 702w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-manual-actions-480x267.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 702px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you do have a manual action, there will typically be some information about the nature of the penalty, example URLs of the offense, and you’ll have an opportunity to submit a request for re-inclusion.</p>
<p>Manual penalties can often be difficult to remove and require significant time and effort, but there is at least a feedback system and some indication directly from Google as to why your site has been penalized.</p>
<h4>Look into recent algorithm updates</h4>
<p>If your site is adversely impacted by an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2024-google-algorithm-updates">algorithm update</a>, on the other hand, you won’t be given any information by Google and will have to try to self-diagnose the issue with your site.</p>
<p>If your site had been receiving traffic and then it dropped off, you can start by trying to correlate the drop with Google’s algorithm updates, which they list <a href="https://status.search.google.com/products/rGHU1u87FJnkP6W2GwMi/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>The most common causes of traffic drops to zero when it comes to being penalized are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low-quality links, particularly at scale.</li>
<li>Low-quality content, again, particularly if you were generating it and having it indexed at scale.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you were using a vendor or someone inside your organization was doing SEO for you and you weren’t exactly sure what tactics they were using, investigating the links they were building and the content they were creating on your behalf is a good place to start.</p>
<h4>Look at your domain history</h4>
<p>If you investigate the activities you’ve taken on your site and there’s no manual action, you may have a historical issue with your domain. If you purchased this domain and there are existing links pointed at it, those may be causing you an issue. Third-party tools like Semrush and Ahrefs allow you to see the links pointed to your domain&#8211;looking at these to determine if this may be the cause of an issue is again a good place to start.</p>
<h2>Monitoring and addressing SEO issues moving forward</h2>
<p>Getting zero SEO traffic can be frustrating, but as we&#8217;ve seen, there are often clear, identifiable reasons for this problem. The key is to work through a systematic diagnosis process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Verify your reporting tools are correctly set up and not filtering out organic traffic.</li>
<li>Confirm your pages are being indexed by Google.</li>
<li>Address any technical barriers like noindex tags, robots directives, or canonical issues.</li>
<li>Build a foundation of quality links if your site lacks authority.</li>
<li>Ensure you&#8217;re targeting realistic keywords with actual search volume.</li>
<li>Investigate potential penalties or domain history problems.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s also important to keep in mind that even after fixing these foundational issues, it may take time for Google to recrawl your site and for rankings to improve.</p>
<p>Set up regular monitoring through Search Console and GA4 to catch any new issues early and consider implementing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/28/technical-seo">technical SEO audits</a> to ensure your site remains healthy from an SEO perspective.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re stuck troubleshooting a particularly challenging SEO issue, you may want to consider <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/marketing-services?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Demo_Blog_Demo">consulting with a professional</a> who can do additional troubleshooting and provide more targeted guidance based on your specific situation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Getting a Google Knowledge Panel is like earning your business a big blue shiny checkmark in the search results—an official stamp of credibility that instantly builds trust. But it’s not like a listing that you can just set up and publish.</p>
<p>Your Knowledge Panel gets created by Google as a result of other activities across the web, and it can be a little tricky. So in this article, I’m going to share exactly what it takes to get a Google Knowledge Panel for your business.</p>

<h2>What is a Google Knowledge Panel?</h2>
<p>A Google Knowledge Panel is the collection of information that appears on the upper right-hand side of your search results page (on desktop) when you search for a business, person, place, brand, or organization.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-ads-knowledge-panel-example-png.avif" alt="google ads knowledge panel example" width="693" height="484" class="aligncenter wp-image-91098 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-ads-knowledge-panel-example-png.avif 693w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-ads-knowledge-panel-example-300x210.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-ads-knowledge-panel-example-480x335.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px" /></p>
<p>The Knowledge Panel is part of Google’s Knowledge Graph, which uses existing, trusted data sources to surface quick, factual answers in the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-trends-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SERP</a>.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Ready to secure a Google Knowledge Panel for your business?</strong> Start with our<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/how-to-get-more-reviews?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_howtogetreviews_Download&amp;itm_source=localiq&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> free guide on how to get more reviews</a>, complete with tips to boost ranking, reputation, and revenue!</p>

<h3>Benefits of a Google Knowledge Panel</h3>
<p>A Google Knowledge Panel gives your brand an official and<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/06/online-reputation-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> credible presence</a> in search results, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-make-your-business-stand-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helping you to stand out</a>, take up more real estate on the page, and surface key information at a glance. For businesses looking to build trust and visibility, it’s a powerful asset. Here are some quick benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhances trust and authority</li>
<li>Controls<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/11/02/brand-keywords" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> branded search</a> results</li>

<li>Improves discoverability across platforms</li>
</ul>
<div id="google-knowledge-panel-vs-google-business-profile"></div>
<h2>Google Knowledge Panel vs. Google Business Profile: What’s the difference?</h2>
<p>Your Google Knowledge Panel is not the same as your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-business-profile-features">Google Business Profile</a> (GBP), which is your listing that also appears on the right-hand side of the SERP. Here’s a chart that helps to illustrate their differences, thanks to ChatGPT:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-knowledge-panel-benefits-png.avif" alt="google knowledge panel - google business profile comparison" width="785" height="431" class="aligncenter wp-image-91099 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-knowledge-panel-benefits-png.avif 785w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-knowledge-panel-benefits-300x165.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-knowledge-panel-benefits-768x422.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-knowledge-panel-benefits-480x264.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px" /></p>
<p>While Google may use information from your GBP in its Knowledge Graph, having a GBP doesn’t guarantee you’ll have a Knowledge Panel. A Knowledge Panel requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong online presence</li>
<li>Structured data</li>
<li>External authority sources (like Wikidata, news, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s dive into that.</p>
<div id="google-knowledge-panel-how-to-get"></div>
<h2>How to get a Google Knowledge Panel for your business</h2>
<p>If you’re trying to get a Google Knowledge Panel for your business, you’ve got your work cut out for you in five key areas:</p>
<h3>1. Request a Knowledge Panel claim</h3>
<p>For starters, search your business name and see if a panel already exists. If it does, click the three dots next to your company category and choose “Claim this knowledge panel.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-knowledge-panel-examples-png.avif" alt="google knowledge panel - example knowledge panel on serp" width="496" height="504" class="aligncenter wp-image-91095 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-knowledge-panel-examples-png.avif 496w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-knowledge-panel-examples-295x300.avif 295w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-knowledge-panel-examples-480x488.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px" /></p>
<p>From there, follow the steps to get verified.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> This<a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLTheDefinitiveGuideBrandAwareness.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_BrandAwareness_Guide_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> definitive guide to brand awareness</a> can help you build your online presence for an optimized Google Knowledge Panel!</strong></p>
<h3>2. Claim and optimize your Google Business Profile</h3>
<p>As we mentioned above, your Google Business Profile doesn’t guarantee a Knowledge Panel, but it does influence it. Here’s what you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-claim-a-business-on-google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Claim your Google Business Profile</strong></a><strong>. </strong>This will allow you to edit your business information, respond to reviews, and more. Use our post for more detailed tips and instructions.</li>
<li><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/optimize-google-my-business-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Optimize your Google Business Profile</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Provided you’ve claimed your profile, you can optimize it with reviews, photos, and regular updates.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Build your online presence</h3>
<p>There are a few <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/05/seo-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buckets of SEO</a> to focus on to help secure your Google Knowledge Panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your listings.</strong> This is essentially your local SEO, which means making sure your business name, contact information, and descriptions are consistent across listings. Our <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/local-seo-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local SEO checklist</a> can help with this.</li>
<li><strong>Keyword-targeted content. </strong>Use our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/06/on-page-seo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on-page SEO</a> guide to make sure you’re writing quality, authoritative content that ranks.</li>
<li><strong>About us page.</strong> A strong About us page that includes your founding date, founders and leadership, location, products and services, industry, and other key milestones can help legitimize your business as well as other profiles across the web.</li>
<li><strong>Schema markup. </strong>This is a type of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/15/what-is-schema-markup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structured data</a> that you add to your website’s HTML to help search engines understand the meaning behind content as opposed to just the words on the page. Schema types that will help the most here are Organization, LocalBusiness, Person, SameAs, Logo, URL, ContactPoint, and Address.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s an example of schema markup for my company (Hatch):</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-knowledge-panel-example-schema-png.avif" alt="google knowledge panel - example schema code" width="583" height="469" class="aligncenter wp-image-91097 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-knowledge-panel-example-schema-png.avif 583w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-knowledge-panel-example-schema-300x241.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-knowledge-panel-example-schema-480x386.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px" /></p>
<p>You can use a tool like <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a> to generate schema markup.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f50d.png" alt="🔍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Find the right keywords to target in your SEO strategy with our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free Keyword Tool</a>!</strong></p>
<h3>4. Build your online authority</h3>
<p>In addition to building up your own content, you’ll also want to get featured in other trusted content. This is where networking and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/digital-marketing/influencer-marketing-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">influencer marketing</a> come into play. Here are some ways to get featured in content across the web:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press releases</li>
<li>Interviews</li>
<li>Podcasts</li>
<li>Backlinks</li>
</ul>
<p>Use our <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/influencer-outreach/">influencer outreach email templates</a> or these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/10/link-building-secrets">backlinking strategies</a> to get started.</p>
<h3>5. Get listed on key sites</h3>
<p>This tactic is similar to the one we just talked about, since it’s about getting mentions on websites other than your own, but this time we’re referring to specific sites that have heavy influence on Knowledge Panel information. We’re also referring to official listings or profiles, as opposed to a featured article or mention in a blog post. Sites to get listed on include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page"><strong>Wikidata</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Google pulls information directly from here. It’s like a giant fact sheet, all written in Google’s love language (structured data)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/"><strong>Wikipedia</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Google also loves Wikipedia. This is like the human-friendly version of Wikidata, which helps keep Google’s Knowledge Panel readable.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/"><strong>Crunchbase</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Google doesn’t pull from here as directly, but it’s still a trusted source. Think of it as your business resume — third-party validation that helps build your credibility.</li>
<li><strong>Industry directories</strong> (for example,<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/angi-business-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Angi</a>, Houzz, and Thumbtack for home services or Avvo, Martindale-Hubbell, and Justia in the legal field.)</li>
</ul>
<p>A few notes: Just as we mentioned earlier when talking about SEO, it’s important to ensure that your information is consistent and accurate across each of these sites. Also, don’t try to game the system with these sites, especially the Wikis. They have strict guidelines in place precisely so these platforms can remain a trusted source of information.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick chart on Wikipedia vs Wikidata to help you understand their differences and how they impact your Knowledge Panel, thanks to ChatGPT.</p>

<h2>Google Knowledge Panel FAQs</h2>
<p>Here are answers to some other questions you might have about getting a Google Knowledge Panel.</p>
<h3>Can you edit your Google Knowledge Panel?</h3>
<p>You can’t directly edit your Knowledge Panel like you would a Google Business Profile, but you can influence it using the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-tactics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO strategies</a> mentioned above.</p>
<h3>How long does it take to get a Google Knowledge Panel?</h3>
<p>This varies from weeks to months, depending on how much web authority, citations, and structured data already exist in relation to your business.</p>
<h3>Who can get a Google Knowledge Panel?</h3>
<p>Businesses, public figures, artists, and organizations. You don’t have to be a celebrity or major brand either—local businesses and microinfluencers can get Knowledge Panels too.</p>
<h3>Does having a Wikipedia page guarantee a Google Knowledge Panel?<strong><br />
</strong></h3>
<p>No, but it helps a lot. <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-create-a-wikipedia-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Wikipedia page</a> will increase your business&#8217;s credibility and notability in Google&#8217;s eyes, especially when combined with the other strategies in this post, like structured data and other citations.</p>
<h3>Do I need a PR agency to get featured in external sources?<strong><br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Not necessarily. While a PR agency can help, you can also land mentions on your own through guest posting, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/04/how-to-write-a-press-release">press releases</a>, podcast interviews, and backlink outreach.</p>
<h3>What should I do if incorrect info appears in my Knowledge Panel?<strong><br />
</strong></h3>
<p>You can suggest edits after claiming your Knowledge Panel, but changes aren&#8217;t guaranteed. Your best bet is to edit the information at the source (like Wikidata or your Google Business Profile) and make sure it&#8217;s consistent across the web.</p>
<h3>Can I have both a Knowledge Panel and a Google Business Profile?<strong><br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Yes, and you should! The two often complement each other and work together to improve your visibility in both branded search and local results.</p>
<h2>Get working on your Google Knowledge Panel now</h2>
<p>A Knowledge Panel is a powerful trust signal that can boost your brand’s visibility, authority, and SEO. While you can’t control every aspect of how Google displays it, you <em>can</em> control how your business shows up across the web. By taking care of those details with the strategies in this post, you’re setting yourself up to earn that coveted spot in the search results.

<h2>What is website speed?</h2>
<p>Website speed is the amount of time it takes for a web page to load <em>fully</em> in a user&#8217;s browser. It encompasses a number of factors, including the time it takes for the browser to receive the first byte of information from the server (i.e. Time To First Byte), the time needed to render and display content, and the overall responsiveness of a website or web page to various interactions by the user.</p>
<p>Web speed is critical for user experience (UX) and can significantly impact user satisfaction, engagement, and conversion rates. Studies have shown that <a href="https://www.portent.com/blog/analytics/research-site-speed-hurting-everyones-revenue.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sites that load in 1 second</a> have conversion rates <em>3 times higher</em> than sites that load in 5 seconds.</p>

<div id="why-is-website-speed-important"></div>
<h2>Why is website speed important?</h2>
<p>From a tech perspective, website speed is influenced by multiple factors, including server performance, network latency, code efficiency, and file size optimization. That may seem like a headache, but as discussed above: the benefits can be huge. Here are just a few of the reasons that website speed is critical:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>User experience</strong>. Faster loading times lead to better user experiences, reducing bounce rates and increasing engagement. Per Google, as page load time goes from one second to ten seconds, the probability of a mobile <a href="https://www.adlift.com/blog/impact-of-google-web-page-speed-on-user-experience/s/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20study%20by,one%20to%20ten%2Dsecond%20range." target="_blank" rel="noopener">site visitor bouncing <strong>increases by 123%</strong></a>.</li>
<li><strong>Conversion rates.</strong> We cited one conversion rate stat above, and here’s another: Walmart reported a <a href="https://www.cloudways.com/blog/impact-of-website-speed/#:~:text=Case%20Study%201%3A%20Walmart,their%20conversions%20increased%20by%202%25." target="_blank" rel="noopener">2% increase in conversions</a> for every 1 second improvement in page load time.</li>
<li><strong>Better rankings.</strong> As discussed above, site speed <em>is a ranking factor for search engines like Google</em>, and studies by site like Backlinko have proven this out.</li>
<li><strong>Increased revenue.</strong> It stands to reason, but we should spell it out here anyway: improved site speed directly impacts revenue. Amazon, for instance, reported a <a href="https://www.conductor.com/academy/page-speed-resources/faq/amazon-page-speed-study/#:~:text=Back%20in%202006%2C%20Amazon%20found,a%20fast%20site%20is%20important." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>1% increase in revenue</em></a> for every 100 milliseconds improvement in page load time.</li>

<h2>How to increase website speed</h2>
<p>We’ve talked about the what and the why, now let’s discuss the <em>how </em>of site speed optimization. Here are my top six strategies for increasing speed on your site.</p>
<h3>1. Compress and convert (i.e. “optimize”) your images</h3>
<p>If you’ve had any exposure to the site speed optimization game, you probably know that this is the easiest, and often the most productive, step you can take to reduce latency and increase <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PageSpeed Insights</a> scores. Let’s take a look at one such report, from a brand I like called Den that sells beautiful but egregiously overpriced cabin plans.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-insights-for-den.webp" alt="pagespeed insights for den" width="881" height="524" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85354" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-insights-for-den.webp 881w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-insights-for-den-480x285.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 881px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>First of all, I should mention: if you’re trying to increase site speed, PageSpeed Insights and <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GTmetrix</a> are hands down the best diagnostic tools you can use to do so. They’re free, fast (usually), and they provide easy-to-follow lists of action items (and approximate bandwidth savings) that you can knock out to reduce page load time. These two tools are your best friend in this quest.</p>
<p>The first thing you’ll notice in this report is that Den’s homepage passes the Core Web Vitals assessment (if you want to learn more about Core Web Vitals, read our post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/19/core-web-vitals-google-page-experience-update">here</a>.) Each of the Core Web Vital metrics, except for Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), relates to page speed, and as such, we need to pay attention to them. And insofar as Core Web Vitals are a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/09/google-ranking-factors">ranking factor</a>, and help determine how high in the search results Google ranks your website, they are super important. But you should view them more as benchmarks that you can use to measure performance as you optimize for speed. That is to say: don’t freak out if you’re not passing, and there is nothing in these numbers themselves that you can actually use to improve your site speed.</p>
<p>Where the report gets juicy is when you scroll down to the performance section.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-insights-performance-report.webp" alt="pagespeed insights performance report" width="879" height="517" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85355" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-insights-performance-report.webp 879w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-insights-performance-report-480x282.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 879px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here you’re going to get a snapshot, on a scale of 1-100, of how fast your page is. As you can see, Den’s homepage has strong scores for Best Practices, SEO, and Accessibility, but is lacking a bit on the Performance front, with a score of 66 out of 100. Not bad for a fairly dynamic and image-intensive page, but with definite room for improvement. This performance score is what you need to pay attention to, as it takes into account all speed-related factors that <em>Google</em> takes into account when determining speed (and consequently, ranking your site).</p>
<p>Scroll down a bit more, and we can start digging into the various factors that are causing Den’s suboptimal website performance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-website-performance-factors.webp" alt="pagespeed website performance factors" width="890" height="597" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85356" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-website-performance-factors.webp 890w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-website-performance-factors-480x322.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 890px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As you can see, items related to images occupy the number two and three spots on Google’s list of most actionable inputs. In my fairly extensive experience, that is where you should expect to be when you run this report on your website. For the purposes of this section, we’re going to focus on “properly size images” (we’ll get to “defer offscreen images” in the next section). Let’s pull down the tab and see what Google tells us.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-insights-image-sizes.webp" alt="pagespeed insights image sizes" width="894" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85357" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-insights-image-sizes.webp 894w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-insights-image-sizes-480x322.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 894px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For reference, anything above 500 KiB (kilobytes) is pretty damn big. And really, in today’s age of next gen image formats, you should really never be above 250 KiB. So there’s a lot for Den to to work on here, with some potentially big savings available.</p>
<p>How would one optimize these images? There are a few ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run the image through a free compression tool, like TinyPNG or <a href="https://compressor.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compressor.io</a>, then re-upload the image to your web page or CMS.</li>
<li>Convert the image to a next-gen image format (specifically, WebP) using a free tool like <a href="https://cloudconvert.com/png-to-webp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cloudconvert.com</a>. WebP is inherently served in the most compressed version, so if your CMS can accept it, I would highly recommend using this method.</li>
<li>Use your CMS to either bulk compress your PNGs and JPGs, or bulk convert your images to WebP. Webflow, for instance, has an out-of-the-box feature that allows for this conversion in bulk. If you’re using WordPress, you can download any number of extensions that allow you to accomplish the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>Image compression is really the lowest-hanging fruit in site speed optimization. Leverage the above methods, and you’ll see your speed scores climb quickly.</p>
<h3>2. Lazy load your images</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/08/lazy-loading-seo">Lazy loading</a> is number two on this list because, once again, I often find it at or near the top of Google’s reports. Remember that “Defer offscreen images” recommendation from above? Anytime you see that, know that Google is referring to <em>lazy loading</em>.</p>
<p>Lazy loading, as I discuss in this <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/08/lazy-loading-seo">excellent post on the topic</a>, is defined as the following:</p>
<p><em>“Lazy loading, in a nutshell, allows you to defer slow-loading page elements until after your page has rendered. It’s a way of making sure a user “gets” to your site (and doesn’t bounce) before doing the heavy work of loading some of the bigger, non-critical, below-the-fold elements on your web page.”</em></p>
<p>So let’s revisit that PageSpeed Insights report and see what it says under the “Defer offscreen images” tab:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-defer-offscreen-images.webp" alt="pagespeed insights report - defer offscreen images" width="890" height="575" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85358" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-defer-offscreen-images.webp 890w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-defer-offscreen-images-480x310.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 890px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Would you look at that: it’s all the same culprits that we found in the prior section! This is actually great news. Because depending on what kind of CMS you’re using, be it Shopify, WordPress, Bigcommerce, or Webflow, you’ll often be able to knock out image compression and lazy loading in one fell swoop. WordPress, for instance, has a great extension called Smush that implements lazy loading and bulk compression for you.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/smush-report.webp" alt="smush report" width="884" height="561" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85359" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/smush-report.webp 884w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/smush-report-480x305.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 884px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/lazy-loading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shopify</a>, on the other hand, will require some very specific (but very doable) CSS tricks that you can pass on to your developer. <a href="https://sqskits.com/plugins/lazy-loading-images-for-squarespace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Squarespace</a> has its own plugin that you can work with. And <a href="https://webflow.com/feature/new-images-set-to-lazy-load-by-default" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Webflow</a>, bless its heart, sets all of its images to lazy load by default. Whatever backend you’re working with, simply research the implementation they recommend and attack from there.</p>
<h3>3. Optimize for mobile first!</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve seen the power of Google’s PageSpeed Insights in action, and before we move onto the next section, I’d be remiss to mention: <strong>do not sleep on the Mobile tab of this report</strong>!</p>
<p>Depending on your business model and the nature of your site, you may (and may likely, in some cases) be getting more mobile traffic than desktop traffic. Take a quick peak into Google Analytics to find the exact percentage. Even sites with strong desktop scores often score poorly on mobile, because mobile has its own specific set of requirements you need to fulfill for optimal speed. And we can use Den’s scores as a case in point here.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-mobile-report.webp" alt="pagespeed mobile report" width="852" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85360" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-mobile-report.webp 852w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-mobile-report-480x337.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 852px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>33 looks pretty brutal on its face, and I’m sorry to say that if you’ve never worked on mobile speed, you’re likely to see something similar. Most site owners neglect this area, and consequently see scores in the 30s and 40s. But guess what? That probably means your competitors haven’t dug into this area either. You can and should use this report as an opportunity to forge and spring ahead.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f495.png" alt="💕" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Want more tips and ideas?</strong> We&#8217;ve got 130+ for you!

<h3>4. Reduce unused JavaScript</h3>
<p>Number three on our list is, you guessed it, another recommendation that Google often lists at or near the top of its PageSpeed Insights reports. Because if we’re going to do the work, why not go after the most profitable outcomes, right? In this case, we’re talking about reducing unused JavaScript.</p>
<p>A quick note: you’ll often see code <em>compression </em>(as opposed to reduction) also listed in this report, but in my experience, the potential savings are generally far lower. Den, for instance, can save a mere 4 KiB of data from compression, compared to reduction, which can save them 332 KiB.</p>
<p>In my experience, the biggest offenders here are nearly always third-party scripts. Scripts from Google Tag Manager, various ad platforms, Google Analytics, and the like, can really hinder speed (when they are not needed). Let’s check out the report.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-javascript-savings.webp" alt="pagespeed insights report javascript" width="856" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85361" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-javascript-savings.webp 856w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-javascript-savings-480x336.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 856px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For their part, you can see that most of Den’s issues are coming from the variety of snippets they are firing through Google Tag Manager. Now, the idea is not to remove all of these. It’s simply to go through and see what you really need and what you don’t. For instance: are you firing a Facebook pixel on a landing page you specifically set up for a Google Ads campaign? Are you firing a HotJar pixel on your product page, despite not including it in the split test you’re running? Are you firing an instance of Google Analytics from Google Tag Manager when you already have it hard-coded into the header of your site?</p>
<p>For their part, Google has some <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/unused-javascript/?utm_source=lighthouse&amp;utm_medium=lr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">useful documentation</a> on how to reduce JavaScript in a given situation, depending on the CMS. Again, the idea is not to remove everything, just the stuff you’re not using.</p>
<p>Keep in mind: saving 332 KiB of bandwidth is great, but it’s possible that you just accomplished that by compressing a single image. That is not to dissuade you from tackling this step, but simply to hammer home that you should be spending your time on the items in the report that are going to yield you the greatest savings.</p>
<h3>5. Leverage a Content Delivery Network (CDN)</h3>
<p>A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of distributed servers placed in data centers across various geos. Its primary purpose is to deliver content and other assets (think: images, videos, scripts, stylesheets, etc.) to users <strong>more efficiently and reliably.</strong></p>
<p>CDNs work by<strong> caching content in edge servers located closer to end-users</strong>. This reduces the physical distance data needs to travel, which thereby decreases latency and improves speed. Here’s a quick visual of what that looks like in practice:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/content-delivery-network.webp" alt="how content delivery network works" width="843" height="378" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85362" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/content-delivery-network.webp 843w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/content-delivery-network-480x215.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 843px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Implementing a CDN provides several benefits that contribute to improving site speed. Here are the top 3:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reduced latency.</strong> By delivering content from servers closer to the user&#8217;s location, CDNs minimize the time it takes for data to travel, significantly reducing latency and improving page load times.</li>
<li><strong>Load balancing.</strong> CDNs distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers, preventing any single server from becoming overwhelmed and ensuring consistent performance even during periods of high traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Caching static content.</strong> CDNs cache static content like images, CSS files, and scripts, storing them on edge servers for faster retrieval. This reduces the load on the origin server and speeds up content delivery.</li>
</ol>
<p>To set up a CDN, all you have to do is choose a reputable provider, configure the settings to specify which content to cache and how it should be delivered, and integrate it with your site.</p>
<h3>6. Enable browser caching</h3>
<p>Browser caching is the process of <strong>storing resources locally</strong> on a user&#8217;s device the first time they visit a website. These resources are then <strong>reused for subsequent visits</strong>, rather than being downloaded from the server again. Caching is a huge lever for increasing site speed, and it can provide the very pleasant double whammy of reducing hosting costs.</p>
<p>To set up browser caching, the first thing you need to do is configure your server to include cache-control headers in HTTP responses. These headers specify how long a browser should cache resources before checking for updates. Here&#8217;s a basic approach:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Edit server configuration.</strong> Access your server&#8217;s configuration file (such as .htaccess for Apache servers or nginx.conf for Nginx servers).</li>
<li><strong>Add cache-control headers. </strong>Include directives like &#8220;Cache-Control&#8221; or &#8220;Expires&#8221; to specify the caching duration for different types of resources. For example, you can set a longer expiration time (i.e., one year) for static resources like images, CSS, and JavaScript files, and a shorter expiration time for dynamic content like HTML pages.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/cache-control-headers.webp" alt="cache control headers" width="871" height="438" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85363" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/cache-control-headers.webp 871w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/cache-control-headers-480x241.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 871px, 100vw" /></li>
<li><strong>Check your status.</strong> After making changes, pop your website back into PageSpeed Insights to see how much of an improvement was made!</li>
</ol>
<p>By implementing browser caching effectively, you can enhance your site&#8217;s performance, reduce server load, and provide a faster and smoother browsing experience for your visitors.</p>
<h2>Increase your website speed, increase your revenue</h2>
<p>It’s really that simple. Speed was important before Google ever made it a ranking signal because of its impact on the user experience. But now that Google is actively using signals like Core Web Vitals to determine where your site should rank in comparison to your competitors, it’s no longer something business owners and marketers can ignore. <em>Especially</em> in today’s age of mobile proliferation and instant gratification, where consumers want the information they want, where they want it, right now.</p>
<p>So the next time you dive into a PageSpeed Insights report, think not about how mundane or overly technical it all seems; think about how much money you’re going to make by taking these three simple steps. Good luck!</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a recap of how to increase website speed:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Compress and convert (i.e. “optimize”) your images</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Lazy load your images</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Optimize for mobile first!</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Reduce unused JavaScript</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Leverage a Content Delivery Network (CDN)</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Enable browser caching</span></li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At this point, pretty much everyone is aware that Google is the biggest search engine in the world. With a nearly <a href="https://www.proceedinnovative.com/blog/search-engine-market-share-2023-2024/#:~:text=The%20following%20are%20the%20worldwide,YANDEX%20%E2%80%93%201.84%25" target="_blank" rel="noopener">92%</a> global market share, it’s pretty obvious that if you want to attract new customers, it’s a safe bet that many of them are on Google.</p>

This is a series of Google marketing strategies you can use to take advantage of getting on the world&#8217;s largest search engine, some free, some paid.</p>

<h2>Free Google marketing strategies</h2>
<p>First, let’s talk about some Google marketing strategies that you can run for everyone&#8217;s favorite price: zero dollars!</p>
<h3>Google Business Profile</h3>
<p>There are a ton of ways a <a href="https://www.google.com/business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Business Profile</a> can be a great asset to any company, and the best news is that it’s free!</p>
<p>From the highest level, Google Business Profiles are <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/best-free-business-listing-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free business listings</a> that you get to customize about your company.</p>
<p>Better yet, there are specific solutions depending on what type of business you have.</p>
<h4>How to get started</h4>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/09/edit-update-google-business-listing">set up or claimed your Google Business Profile</a>, that&#8217;s going to be your first step. Then, you&#8217;ll want to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/optimize-google-my-business-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optimize your listing</a> to give your business the best chance of showing for relevant local searches.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.google.com/business/restaurants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restaurants</a>, you can have menu highlights, show your dining options, accept reservations, and take online orders all directly from your GBP page.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-marketing-google-business-profile-button-options.webp" alt="google business profile for restaurant" width="607" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84525" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-marketing-google-business-profile-button-options.webp 607w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-marketing-google-business-profile-button-options-480x474.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 607px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you’re a <a href="https://www.google.com/business/services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">service</a>, like the roofing companies shown above, you can show your credentials easily, handle quotes, users can schedule appointments directly from these listings and more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-business-listings-for-roofer.webp" alt="google business listings for roofers" width="858" height="414" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84526" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-business-listings-for-roofer.webp 858w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-business-listings-for-roofer-480x232.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 858px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Lastly, if you’re a <a href="https://www.google.com/business/retail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retailer</a>, you can show off your products and let customers know how they’re able to shop your store, whether in-store, curbside pick up, delivery, and more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-marketing-products-on-google-business-profile.webp" alt="products for sale on google business listing" width="607" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84527" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-marketing-products-on-google-business-profile.webp 607w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-marketing-products-on-google-business-profile-480x474.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 607px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>No matter what your business is, there’s an option for you on Google Business Profiles.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4cd.png" alt="📍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Are your listings outdated? </strong>Find out with our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/free-business-listings-grader?cid=Web_WS_InContentTextLink_Freemium_Listings&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent"><strong>Free Business Listings Grader</strong></a><strong>!</strong></p>
<h3>Google Analytics/GA4</h3>
<p>Another free Google marketing strategy I have for you is the free website analytics tool <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Analytics 4</a>, or its more colloquial name in the industry, GA4.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/23/google-analytics-4-vs-universal-analytics" rel="noopener">GA4</a> allows you to add some small snippets of code to all of the pages of your website and then see how those users engage on your website. There are lots of different insights you can gain, some I’ll mention below, and GA4 is a very powerful tool if you set it up from day one and monitor performance over time.</p>
<p>It even helps you understand how your Google marketing strategies are working. You’re able to segment users whether they came from your organic, paid listings, or Google Business Profile listings, plus you’ll better understand if your site and its content are compelling by how users engage.</p>
<p>Lastly, you can create Events, Key Events, and Conversions based on actions users can take on your site, then you can monitor how those specific actions are taken. This is pretty similar to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/07/google-analytics-4-event-tracking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conversion tracking</a> in Google Ads, but with quite a bit more customization.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-marketing-google-analytics-4-dashboard.webp" alt="google analytics 4 dashboard" width="872" height="453" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84528" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-marketing-google-analytics-4-dashboard.webp 872w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-marketing-google-analytics-4-dashboard-480x249.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 872px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>How to get started</h4>
<p>Here is an overview of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-analytics-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of the reports in GA4</a> you can use to see how people are engaging on your website to help you get enthusiastic about using this tool:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Realtime:</strong> This report does exactly what it sounds like&#8211;it tells you how many users are on your site right now, where they are in the world, what pages they’re on, and any events that they’ve executed.</li>
<li><strong>Engagement:</strong> These reports let you see how long users have been on your site, the number of pages they’ve viewed, which pages they’ve seen, and the events they’ve taken on those pages.</li>
<li><strong>Acquisition:</strong> Ever wondered how your users make their way to your website? The acquisition reports will tell you just that. You can see the source, whether organic, paid, or otherwise, as well as the campaign and term they used to find you in this section.</li>
<li><strong>Monetization:</strong> If you’re an ecommerce shop or if you sell anything of value on your site, you can track those purchases, the value sold, and how often users come back and make repeat purchases in this section.</li>
</ul>

<div id="&quot;low-cost-google-marketing-strategies”"></div>
<h2>Low-cost Google marketing strategies</h2>
<p>These strategies aren’t 100% free—they’ll likely incur some cost but it probably won’t be the biggest chunk of your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-budget/">marketing budget</a>.</p>
<h3>A compelling website</h3>
<p>While a Google Business Profile is a very valuable area of real estate on a search results page and a highly customizable space, that’s only a small range of impact you get to have on potential customers. Sometimes, you can’t fit everything you’d like to into those listings and you may not answer all the questions your customers will have. That’s where a <a href="https://localiq.com/products/websites-landing-pages/">compelling website</a> will come into play.</p>
<p>I’ll be pretty brief about this section because there are an infinite number of directions you can go with a website. You can have an out-of-the-box template where all you do is add in some info and pictures or you can go the fully custom-built route. Neither option is “right” or “wrong,” but there are some things you should keep in mind when getting your site set up.</p>
<h3>How to get started</h3>
<p>Here is my list of priorities for a compelling website in 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fast page load time:</strong> No one wants to wait more than five seconds for a website to load. I don’t care how pretty it ends up being. Invest in a site that loads quickly, no matter what internet connection users have, otherwise, you’ll lose a portion of your audience before you ever have a chance to convert them.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile compatible:</strong> We all have tiny computers in our hands at all times, but many sites are still not conducive to a seamless mobile experience. Just like load times, don’t frustrate your potential customers with a bad mobile experience. Even if you have to ditch some of the bells and whistles from the desktop version, I guarantee your customers won’t miss them as long as the site is still functional and informational.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/abercrombie-mobile-desktop-sites.webp" alt="example of mobile-optimized site from abercrombie" width="812" height="443" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84529" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/abercrombie-mobile-desktop-sites.webp 812w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/abercrombie-mobile-desktop-sites-480x262.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 812px, 100vw" /></li>
<li><strong>All product/service information included:</strong> Don’t skimp on the details. In this information age, shoppers are savvier than ever and they can tell when you’re hiding something. Don’t leave out any details of what you’re selling, even if you have to add it to additional pages where people can learn more information. Give specifications, compatibility guides, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/get-google-reviews/">customer reviews</a>, and lots of photos. Anything you would need to decide for yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Interesting images:</strong> Use images that actually show what you do or sell. So many sites only have stock images, and while that’s fine and an okay solution, you can do better. Not only do we all have tiny computers in our hands at all times, we also have cameras. And darn good ones at that. If you can’t afford a professional photographer, don’t be afraid to take photos using your phone. They might not be polished, but you’ll be surprised at how well realistic photos resonate with customers when they’re actually helpful.</li>
<li><strong>Clear calls to action:</strong> We all want to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/lead-generation-campaigns/">generate business</a> and this is where you do it. Make sure there are clear next steps for your potential customers at every step of the way. Include phone numbers on all pages if you want phone calls. Add forms to pages when you want people to submit inquiries. Provide a scheduling tool if you’re willing to let them book an appointment directly on your site. Make sure you can capitalize on the good site experience you’ve created with all the steps above and help your potential customers convert into actual customers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Search engine optimization</h3>
<p>Aside from the text on your site, be sure you’re employing at least the basics of search engine optimization. <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/seo/">SEO</a> is the practice of improving your website to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/online-presence/">be more visible on Google</a>.</p>
<p>There are a few ways you can do this through technical, on-site, and off-site practices. Since you don’t pay for organic queries, SEO is a very attractive strategy for many companies to employ and there are infinite resources for you to leverage, but it’s also one of the most competitive. You could either go the DIY route and read up on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/category/seo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO articles</a> around the web, or you could hire an agency to do the work for you.</p>
<h4>How to get started</h4>
<p>Here is a list of things to keep top of mind while looking into SEO practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technical SEO:</strong> Be sure your site is crawlable and can easily be read by Google. There are many different tactics to keep in mind for this, so just Google “<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/28/technical-seo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">technical SEO best practices</a>” and you’ll be answered by many sites that can tell you what to do, but that are also following the best practices themselves.</li>
<li><strong>On-site SEO:</strong> This refers to the content you have on your website. We already talked about having a compelling site, so this should go hand in hand, Make sure you cover relevant topics, your content is original to you, is up to date and accurate, is, ideally, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/competitive-insights/">better than your competitors</a>, and includes some specific formatting options like title tags, meta descriptions, and header tags to make the content easy to digest.</li>
<li><strong>Off-site SEO:</strong> While these practices might be a little further afield, they can still be highly valuable. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/13/off-page-seo">Off-site SEO tactics</a> include things like <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/listings-management/what-are-local-listings-and-why-do-you-need-listings-management/">listings management</a>, ratings and reviews, public relations, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/content-marketing-vs-social-media-marketing/">content and social media marketing</a>, and more. The goal is to show your business&#8217;s connectivity to other authorities in a space to gain relevancy and visibility.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/on-page-technical-off-page-seo.webp" alt="technical, off-page, and on-page seo graphic" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84532" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/on-page-technical-off-page-seo.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/on-page-technical-off-page-seo-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="paid-google-marketing-strategies"></div>
<h2>Paid Google marketing strategies</h2>
<p>So there’s only one strategy here—but it’s the most important paid Google marketing strategy to help you get new customers.</p>
<h3>Google Ads</h3>
<p>To support your organic strategies, you can utilize paid ads through the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/21/how-to-run-google-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads</a> platform. Similar to SEO, there are many different tactics you can take within the Google Ads system. That could include Search Ads where you bid for specific keywords and show up when users search those terms on Google. It could also include the Display Network where you show your ads on relevant websites to your product or services. Again, WordStream has a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/category/paid-search-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ton of articles</a> you can read about for this if you want to learn more, or you could hire an agency to do the work for you.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-marketing-google-ads.webp" alt="example of google ads for fathers day gift search" width="831" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84533" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-marketing-google-ads.webp 831w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-marketing-google-ads-480x347.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 831px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>How to get started</h4>
<p>Here are some things I encourage you to keep in mind when evaluating or getting started with Google Ads:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Have realistic expectations:</strong> There are many tools you can use to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/search-advertising-benchmarks/">estimate the cost and performance of Google Ads</a> for any business type. Use those tools to understand what a realistic outcome could be for you.</li>
<li><strong>Set aside enough budget:</strong> One of the biggest problems I see with companies getting started in Google Ads is not having enough budget set aside to run an effective test. They set aside a number they think is enough, then run a small test, not spending enough to actually see any real results, and then determine the platform to be worthless. Don’t be that person. You’ll then have spent your money and written off a powerful platform used by thousands of businesses with success. The amount you need will vary depending on your products/services and supported area, but use the research you did in the first step to understand what a realistic budget is before you get started.</li>
<li><strong>Use conversion tracking:</strong> Google Ads has great performance tracking available right within the platform. It just requires a couple of small code snippets to be added to your website to track performance. If you’re going to spend your hard-earned money, you should absolutely spend the small amount of time it takes to set up <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/30/google-ads-conversion-tracking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads conversion tracking</a> so you can know if your money is working for you or not.</li>
<li><strong>Understand the fundamentals:</strong> Unlike organic or Google Business Profiles, Google Ads cost money to run. You have to pay to play, if you will. All too often I see business owners start with only the bare minimal knowledge and then get burned for their ad spend. We already talked about this needing to be a reasonable budget and you’ve worked hard for that money. Don’t squander it by being too hasty to get campaigns up and running. Here are a few things I suggest you look into: <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-match-types" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keyword match types</a>, networks including search partners, drafting strong ad copy, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/15/smart-bidding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bidding strategies</a>, and budget controls.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re a business owner or marketer, you’ve probably seen a bunch of Reddit results in search results, and you might be wondering what the deal is. If you don’t know, Reddit is the internet’s collective subconscious, a platform where folks from all walks of life can go to talk about their experiences, post content, and learn about topics that interest them.</p>
<p>Because of its relative lack of structure compared to other social media platforms, Reddit doesn’t get a ton of love among business owners looking to promote their products and services. And that is a huge missed opportunity. Because when used correctly, Reddit can seriously buoy your marketing efforts and become a valuable stream of revenue for your business.</p>
<p>In this post, we’re going to discuss precisely that. Let’s walk through how Reddit works, then talk about five strategies you can use to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">drive traffic</a> from this unique platform.</p>

<h2>What is Reddit?</h2>
</div>
<p>With over <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/reddit-users">500 million</a> users, Reddit is perhaps the world’s biggest discussion board.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/number-of-reddit-users.webp" alt="chart showing number of reddit users through 2028" width="678" height="532" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83988" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/number-of-reddit-users.webp 678w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/number-of-reddit-users-480x377.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 678px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Number of past, current, and projected Reddit users by year. </em></p>
<p>You can separate Reddit’s value props into three main buckets: <strong>social news aggregation, content rating, and discussion</strong>. All of Reddit’s content is <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/28/user-generated-content">user-generated</a>, meaning users create their own posts, many of which contain links, images, and videos.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-user-generated-content.webp" alt="example of question in reddit subreddit with answer" width="871" height="491" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83990" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-user-generated-content.webp 871w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-user-generated-content-480x271.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 871px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>These posts are organized in user-created boards called &#8220;subreddits,&#8221; depending on their topic or theme. Subreddits typically include topics like technology, news, movies, and gaming, but really, a subreddit could exist for <em>virtually any subject imaginable</em>.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of Reddit’s key features:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Subreddits</strong>. As mentioned, these are individual communities within Reddit, each dedicated to a particular topic. They are denoted by the prefix &#8220;r/&#8221; followed by the topic name, r/memes, r/dankmemes, and r/WatchPeopleDieInside (we told you, there’s a subreddit for everything.)</li>
<li><strong>Posts and comments.</strong> Posts within subreddits include text, links, images, and videos. Users then comment on these posts to create threads.</li>
<li><strong>Voting system.</strong> Reddit uses an upvote and downvote system that allows users to “rate” content. Posts and comments with more upvotes appear higher on the page, increasing their visibility, while those with more downvotes become less visible.</li>
<li><strong>Karma</strong>. Users earn karma points when their posts or comments are upvoted. Karma serves as a rough measure of a user&#8217;s contributions to the community.</li>
<li><strong>Moderation</strong>. Each subreddit is moderated by a team of volunteers who enforce community-specific rules and Reddit&#8217;s overall content policies. They have the authority to remove posts, ban users, and manage discussions within their subreddit.</li>
<li><strong>Reddit Gold/Premium</strong>. Reddit offers a premium subscription service called Reddit Premium, which provides an ad-free experience, access to a private subreddit, and other perks.</li>
</ol>
<p>The main draw of Reddit is precisely that: it’s open. As long as users follow the rules of a given subreddit, they are allowed to post candidly about whatever topic intrigues them. For that reason, people not only flock to Reddit for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/19/brand-community">community</a>, but to find unfiltered answers to questions that they may not be able to find anywhere else on the internet.</p>
<p>Posing a question on Reddit is like posing it to an enormous, virtual living room of interested parties. The answer may not always be what you want, but you’ll get no shortage of opinions.</p>

<h2>Why is Reddit important?</h2>
</div>
<p>Because of its diverse user base and wide range of content, Reddit is an extremely popular platform for discussing current events, sharing personal stories, and seeking advice. Depending on your vertical and business, that means it can <em>also </em>be an extremely valuable platform from which to drive traffic.</p>
<p>And, not only that, but <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2024-google-algorithm-updates">Google’s recent algorithm update</a> has made Reddit even more prominent on the SERP. Many queries now contain a link to Reddit or a “Discussions and forums” section that typically includes links to subreddits.</p>

<h3>1. Find the subreddit where your customers are engaging</h3>
</div>
<p>Let’s say you’re a roofing company in California. You want to find potential customers who are actively searching for roof replacements or services. In all likelihood, you’re going to have a difficult time finding a subreddit where homeowners are <em>just </em>talking about roofs. Why? Because roofs on their own are not all that interesting.</p>
<p>That said, a quick Google search for “roofing california reddit” shows that there are some interesting subreddits upon which you, as the business owner, may lurk to search for customers:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-find-subreddit.webp" alt="example of subreddit showing in serps for roofing search" width="869" height="445" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83992" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-find-subreddit.webp 869w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-find-subreddit-480x246.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 869px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The first listing here is a post within a subreddit called r/Roofing. The forum description reads as follows: <em>Greetings! This sub is for questions, interesting pics or videos and stories about roofing. We welcome roofers, handy-people, homeowners and anyone else who is roof-curious.</em></p>
<p>As a roofing contractor, this is going to be a really interesting subreddit to hang out on. Granted, the group does not consist exclusively of homeowners (i.e. potential customers), but even posts from other contractors can help you glean information about the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/21/competitive-analysis-templates">competitive landscape</a>, pricing, and other useful information that can win you business.</p>
<div id="be-useful">

<h3>2. Be useful first; promote second</h3>
</div>
<p>Most subreddit moderators are extremely wary of users who are just in the thread to promote their products and services, and rightly so. As such, if you hop right into a discussion with a link to your website, and if you do this multiple times, you risk not only alienating yourself from the discussion but getting banned altogether.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-be-useful.webp" alt="example of banned user comment" width="936" height="353" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83993" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-be-useful.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-be-useful-480x181.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Breaking the rules is a surefire way to get banned from the sub, and the majority of subreddits contain rules prohibiting “excessive self-promotion.” But guess what? You’re not here to promote your products anyway. You’re here to be <em>useful </em>and <em>provide value. </em></p>
<p>Just like a door-to-door salesman, your job when you enter the subreddit is, first and foremost, to <em>help people. </em>Using our roofing example, that means that if a consumer wants some help pricing out a job, you don’t jump right in and offer them a quote and ask for an appointment.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-subreddit-tips.webp" alt="example of posting useful content, not promotional, on reddit" width="651" height="424" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83994" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-subreddit-tips.webp 651w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-subreddit-tips-480x313.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 651px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Instead, you might try giving them some insight into <em>why </em>the quotes they’ve gotten look the way that they do, how <em>you</em> would estimate their roof if you were doing the job, and <em>why</em> you would charge that much for the job. At that point, if the homeowner likes the value you have provided, he is likely to follow up with another question, at which point you can offer to have a call or come out for an in-person appointment.</p>

<h3>3. Post your own content</h3>
</div>
<p>The key to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-smart-bidding">driving traffic from Reddit</a> is being an <em>engaged user</em>. Being an engaged user doesn’t mean jumping into the platform every few weeks to post a link. It doesn’t even mean answering questions every now and again with a valuable tip. It means <strong>being frequently involved in, and contributing to</strong> the subreddits on which your customers are having discussions.</p>
<p>You want to be seen as a valuable member of the community. Someone who has experience and credibility in your vertical, and who people can turn to when they are looking for answers. The most straightforward way to do this is by posting your own content, rather than merely commenting on the posts of others.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-post-own-content.webp" alt="example of AMA post on reddit" width="473" height="388" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83995" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-post-own-content.webp 473w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-post-own-content-300x246.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px" /></p>
<p>Posts like this AMA (Ask Me Anything) show users that you are a dedicated member of the community first, and a business owner second. That you are not afraid to be seen leading a discussion about your vertical, not just participating in or commenting on one.</p>
<p>Consistently post your own useful content, and you won’t ever need to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">promote your services</a>; customers will ask you for them.</p>

<h3>4. Give your products and services away</h3>
</div>
<p>As we mentioned at the start of this post, Reddit is the internet’s collective subconscious. Its superego. And if there’s one thing the ego loves, it’s free stuff. The idea that you, the consumer, are worthy of receiving something of value in exchange for absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>If you’re going to promote your products and services in a subreddit, hosting a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/giveaway-ideas">giveaway</a>, sweepstakes, or contest is perhaps the most effective way to do so. This strategy allows marketers to deflect the ill will typically shown to users who self-promote while igniting a competitive interest among potential customers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-give-away-products.webp" alt="example of mod approved reddit giveaway" width="663" height="438" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83996" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-give-away-products.webp 663w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-give-away-products-480x317.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 663px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you’re a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/11/google-local-service-ads">service business</a>, this could mean giving away a free inspection or a discount on one of your services. If you’re an ice cream shop owner, it could mean going to your local subreddit and posting a two-for-one special. If you&#8217;re an ecommerce brand, it could mean driving traffic to an external <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">landing page</a>, where users can enter their names and email in exchange for entering to win a gift package from your brand.</p>
<p>However you choose to give your products and services away, you can rest assured that doing so will help you drive invaluable <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-competitors">traffic</a> and exposure for your business.</p>

<h3>5. Cultivate a following</h3>
</div>
<p>If you can find the right subreddit, you’ve already <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">found your audience</a>. But unless you’re <em>known</em> in the community, you haven’t yet captured your audience. And if you haven’t yet captured your audience, they’re not <em>your </em>audience.</p>
<p>If you want to cultivate a real following on Reddit, you need to be a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/09/21/thought-leadership-marketing">thought leader</a>. Thought leaders like Jason Calanicas and Elon Musk use Reddit to grow their brands by being thought leaders. They run companies and have business interests, but they use Reddit as a means of swiftly growing their engaged audience.</p>
<p>Pop over to Jason’s Reddit profile and you’ll see that he’s not just posting about his podcast. He’s actively engaging in a number of discussions on a variety of topics he is interested in.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-cultivate-following.webp" alt="example of Jason Calanicas reddit profile" width="665" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83997" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-cultivate-following.webp 665w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-cultivate-following-480x432.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 665px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Why would a guy worth $100 million spend his time perusing subreddits? One, because he enjoys being a part of the discourse, and he has a variety of interests.</p>
<p>But two, it’s because he understands the power that Reddit offers thought leaders when it comes to audience cultivation. The ability to pop into a thread at any time and offer a relevant fact, opinion, critique, or piece of advice, is what makes Reddit such a unique and useful platform for content creators and brands alike.</p>
<h2>Traffic on Reddit belongs to the most engaged and creative</h2>
<p>There you have it, in a nutshell. If you <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/limited-time-offers/">want to drive traffic</a> from Reddit, you need to be thoughtful, engaged, and creative.</p>
<p>Remember to post your own content, be useful above all, and give away your products and services. Follow these strategies to a tee, and you’ll see the rewards many times over.And if you&#8217;re interested in paid Reddit ads, check out this guide to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/generative-engine-optimization">see how much they&#8217;ll cost</a>.</p>
