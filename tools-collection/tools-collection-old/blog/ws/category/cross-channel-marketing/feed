<h3>How does programmatic advertising work?</h3>
<p>This sophisticated approach utilizes AI and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/28/machine-learning-applications">machine learning algorithms</a> to analyze vast amounts of user data. By processing information like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/28/behavioral-segmentation">browsing behavior</a>, demographic profiles, and even specific interactions with previous ads, programmatic systems can determine the most effective ad placements in real time.</p>

<h2>Pros and cons of programmatic advertising</h2>
<p>Curious about the benefits (as well as potential pitfalls) of programmatic advertising?</p>
<h3>Programmatic advertising benefits</h3>
<p>The transition to programmatic advertising brings many benefits, significantly enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/19/digital-marketing-statistics">digital marketing campaigns</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency and time-saving</strong></p>
<p>One of the most significant advantages of programmatic advertising is the automation of the ad buying process. Programmatic advertising eliminates the need for traditional, time-consuming negotiation and manual insertion orders. This automation streamlines the process, allowing marketers and advertisers to focus more on <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite7StepstoGrowthStrategy.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_GrowthStrategy_Download">strategy</a> and less on logistics.</p>
<p><strong>Improved targeting and personalization</strong></p>
<p>Programmatic technology goes beyond basic demographics, enabling hyper-targeted advertising. By leveraging real-time data and sophisticated algorithms, it can personalize marketing messages to individual users based on their online behavior, interests, and past interactions. This level of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing">personalization</a> leads to more relevant ads, increasing the likelihood of user engagement and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/11/increase-conversion-rates">conversion</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Real-time data and analytics</strong></p>
<p>The ability to access and analyze data in real-time is a game-changer. Advertisers can monitor campaign performance as it happens, allowing for immediate adjustments and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/23/optimize-performance-max-campaigns">optimization</a>. This real-time feedback loop ensures that campaigns are constantly refined and improved, leading to better performance and a higher return on investment (ROI).</p>
<p><strong>Cost-effectiveness</strong></p>
<p>Programmatic advertising often proves to be more cost-effective than traditional methods. By targeting specific audiences and utilizing real-time bidding, advertisers can control costs and ensure that their budget is being spent efficiently, reducing wasted impressions and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/10/04/adwords-roi">increasing overall campaign ROI</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Worried you&#8217;re wasting spend in Google Ads?

<p><strong>Scalability and flexibility</strong></p>
<p>Programmatic platforms offer unparalleled scalability and flexibility, allowing marketers to adjust campaigns quickly based on performance data or shifting market trends. This adaptability is crucial in the fast-paced digital environment.</p>
<p>These benefits collectively make programmatic advertising a potent tool for modern marketers, enabling smarter, more effective campaigns that resonate with the intended audience.</p>
<h3>Programmatic advertising cons</h3>
<p>While programmatic advertising offers numerous benefits, it also presents certain challenges and considerations that marketers need to navigate carefully.</p>
<p><strong>Ad fraud and privacy concerns</strong></p>
<p>A significant challenge in the digital advertising space is the risk of <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-ad-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ad fraud</a>, where the authenticity of ad impressions, clicks, or conversions is questionable. Combating fraudulent activities requires constant vigilance and the use of sophisticated tools.</p>
<p>Additionally, with increasing concerns about user privacy and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/22/customer-data-privacy">data security</a>, marketers must ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR and CCPA, balancing effective targeting with respect for user privacy.</p>
<p><strong>Complexity of the programmatic ecosystem</strong></p>
<p>The programmatic advertising ecosystem is complex, with multiple players including DSPs, SSPs, Ad Exchanges, and Data Management Platforms (DMPs). Navigating this complexity, understanding the roles of different entities, and integrating them effectively into a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-create-a-small-business-marketing-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing strategy</a> can be daunting, especially for beginners.</p>
<p><strong>Choosing the right platforms and partners</strong></p>
<p>The success of a programmatic campaign heavily depends on selecting the right technology platforms and partners. Marketers must choose platforms that offer transparency, robust targeting capabilities, and reliable analytics. Establishing partnerships with trustworthy and experienced vendors is crucial to ensure campaign success.</p>
<p><strong>Quality of inventory and brand safety</strong></p>
<p>There is a risk of ads appearing alongside inappropriate or irrelevant content, which can harm <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/06/online-reputation-management">brand reputation</a>. Ensuring brand safety and securing high-quality ad inventory is essential for maintaining brand integrity.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping up with rapid technological changes</strong></p>
<p>The rapid pace of technological advancements in programmatic advertising demands continuous learning and adaptation. Marketers must stay abreast of new trends, technologies, and best practices to remain competitive.</p>
<p>Addressing these <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/2024-marketing-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenges</a> requires a strategic approach, careful planning, and a commitment to continuous learning and adaptation in the ever-evolving digital advertising landscape.</p>
<div id="how-to-do-programmatic-advertising"></div>
<h2>How to get started with programmatic advertising</h2>
<p>For those new to the world of programmatic advertising, understanding certain fundamental aspects is crucial for successful navigation and implementation. Here are five key things every beginner should know to get started with programmatic advertising.</p>
<h3>Understand the ad ecosystem</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s essential to grasp the roles of Demand-Side Platforms (DSPs), Sell-Side Platforms (SSPs), and Ad Exchanges. DSPs allow advertisers to buy ad impressions across a range of publisher sites, targeting specific user demographics. SSPs enable publishers to sell ad space to the highest bidder, while Ad Exchanges act as the digital marketplace where these transactions occur.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/internet-advertising/internet-advertising-targeting/what-is-programmatic-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<h3>Define your audience targeting</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">Targeting the right audience</a> is vital for the success of your programmatic advertising campaign. This involves understanding user behavior, interests, and demographics to create more relevant and effective ad campaigns. Leveraging data effectively for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/04/customer-segmentation-models">audience segmentation</a> is key to successful targeting.</p>

<p>Beginners need to understand how to allocate budgets and use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/19/google-ads-automated-bidding">bidding strategies</a> effectively. Programmatic advertising typically uses a real-time bidding (RTB) process, where ad impressions are bought and sold on a per-impression basis in a real-time auction.</p>
<h3>Choose the right creative and messaging</h3>
<p>The content of the ads is just as important as where they are placed. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/21/emotional-ad-copy-examples">Creating engaging and relevant ad creatives</a> that resonate with the target audience is critical for campaign success.</p>

<h3>Measure and analyze campaign performance</h3>
<p>Finally, measuring and analyzing the performance of campaigns is crucial.

<p>Armed with these foundational insights, beginners can start navigating the programmatic advertising landscape more confidently and effectively.</p>

<p>The future of programmatic advertising points towards further integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning, enhancing targeting precision and efficiency. The rise of voice search and IoT devices will expand programmatic&#8217;s reach, necessitating new strategies and formats.</p>
<p>Privacy and data security will increasingly shape practices, driven by evolving regulations and consumer awareness. We&#8217;ll also see a shift towards more transparent and ethical advertising ecosystems, with a focus on combating ad fraud.</p>
<p>The continuous advancement in technology promises even more personalized and immersive ad experiences, solidifying programmatic advertising&#8217;s role as a key player in the ever-evolving landscape of digital marketing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your business needs customers to survive, and that starts by getting eyes on your products or services. If you haven’t started with organic SEO practices already, that’s a great way to build a foundation of future success. But, while organic is great, it takes time to build momentum. This is where ads, and knowing the best advertising platforms, comes into play.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll share the eight best advertising platforms and who should consider running ads on them.</p>
<h2>The best online advertising platforms (+ who should use them)</h2>
<p>No two <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/bandwagon-advertising">advertising</a> platforms are the same, just like no two businesses are the same. What works for one business may not work for you or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">your target audience</a>. But it&#8217;s important to know the best, most popular online advertising platforms and how they might work for your business to figure out where to start.</p>
<p><strong>Here are the best online advertising platforms for 2024:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#google-ads-platform">Google Ads</a></li>
<li><a href="#microsoft-advertising-platform">Microsoft Advertising</a></li>
<li><a href="#linkedin-advertising-platform">LinkedIn</a></li>
<li><a href="#youtube-advertising-platform">YouTube</a></li>
<li><a href="#facebook-advertising-on-meta-platform">Facebook</a></li>
<li><a href="#instagram-advertising-on-meta-platform">Instagram</a></li>
<li><a href="#tiktok-advertising-platform">TikTok</a></li>
<li><a href="#snapchat-advertising-platform">Snapchat</a></li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re feeling overwhelmed, fear not—with a little knowledge of each advertising platform and some <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/local-advertising-ideas-for-small-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original ad ideas</a>, you can start getting some traction ASAP.</p>
<div id="google-ads-platform"></div>
<h3>1. Google Ads</h3>
<p>When it comes to big fish in the search engine sea, Google is about as big as they get with <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/">83%</a> of the global market share. Through the Google Ads platform, you can run different types of ads, including search ads and display ads. Google uses a pay-per-click (PPC) model, meaning you pay only if someone clicks the ad.</p>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/google-ads-optimization-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google search ads</a> arguably benefit the most from Google’s share. Search ads are the sponsored search results that often appear at the top of the results page whenever you search a term. These text-only ads give businesses a chance to say a bit about their business while blending in with organic search, as seen below.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-google-ads.webp" alt="google ads advertising platform example" width="936" height="455" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81030" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-google-ads.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-google-ads-480x233.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Google display ads are shown via the Google Display Network (GDN). The GDN consists of <a href="https://ads.google.com/intl/en_us/home/resources/articles/reach-larger-new-audiences/#:~:text=Key%20takeaways,nearly%20all%20global%20Internet%20users." target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 2 million</a> websites across countless industries. These ads can vary, containing text and images, images only, or videos only.</p>
<p>Google display ads allow you to reach your audience in an organic browsing experience, as the ads will show up on various sites while the person is browsing. You can help determine where your ads show up by using keyword targeting, setting <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/topic-clusters-for-local-seo">topic clusters</a>, or even choosing specific sites. And make sure to catch up on how <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-use-google-bard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Gemini (formerly Bard)</a> can help.</p>
<h4>Who should run Google Ads?</h4>
<p>Google’s massive market share makes it especially enticing, and it’s absolutely at the top of the best advertising platform pack for a reason. But the large market reach of Google does make it somewhat of a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>Yes, you can get your business in front of a lot of eyes using Google Ads, whether you’re using search ads or display ads or both. (You should really try both.) At the same time, the large reach of Google also means you’re often in a more competitive space, especially if you’re in an already crowded and competitive industry.</p>
<p>Still, Google ads are ideal for just about every business out there. Test the waters, set a small budget to start with, and monitor your ad performance closely. If you can hire an ad professional, it can be money well spent. Otherwise, use your best judgment, dig into average ad performance for your industry, and don’t be afraid to halt ads if you’re not happy with the results.</p>

<div id="microsoft-advertising-platform"></div>
<h3>2. Microsoft Advertising</h3>
<p>Microsoft Advertising, formerly Bing ads, come in search and display varieties. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/01/microsoft-ads-optimizations" rel="noopener">Microsoft ads</a> are shown on top of Bing search results, as well as along the sides of the results page. Microsoft ads are also shown within the <a href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/microsoft-audience-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Audience Network</a>, which contains a number of Microsoft-owned businesses as well as partners.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-microsoft-ads.webp" alt="microsoft ads advertising platform example" width="862" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81031" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-microsoft-ads.webp 862w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-microsoft-ads-480x333.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 862px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Microsoft ads don’t have quite the same reach as Google ads, but they do allow you to reach a different audience. This is largely thanks to the other networks your Microsoft ads can show up on, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bing</li>
<li>Yahoo</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/what-is-duckduckgo" rel="noopener">DuckDuckGo</a></li>
<li>AOL</li>
<li>Ecosia</li>
<li>Outlook</li>
<li>MSN</li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft ads also benefit from Microsoft’s recent <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-cloud/blog/2023/11/07/come-build-with-us-microsoft-and-openai-partnership-unveils-new-ai-opportunities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnership with OpenAI</a>, which has helped pave the way for AI-powered search. This allows users to ask questions on Bing and get served more results, which means more opportunities for your ads.</p>
<h4>Who should run Microsoft ads?</h4>
<p>Microsoft ads use a PPC model like Google and feature similar ad formats. So, who should use them?</p>
<p>In short: Microsoft ads are a suitable ad platform for most businesses. Many claim the cost-per-click (CPC) is lower with Microsoft than Google for many keywords, so Microsoft can even make for a great testing ground. If something is performing well on Microsoft, consider doubling down and bidding for the same terms on Google!</p>

<h3>3. LinkedIn</h3>
<p>LinkedIn, the popular business social network and job platform, has more than <a href="https://about.linkedin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 billion</a> users. Unlike Microsoft and Google, LinkedIn provides the opportunity to focus solely on a business-oriented audience.</p>
<p>LinkedIn ads differ from Microsoft and Google, in that there are a ton of formats:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Carousel ads</strong>: Interactive ads with multiple slides users can click through</li>
<li><strong>Conversation ads</strong>: Ads sent via LI messaging that provide users with multiple choices</li>
<li><strong>Event ads</strong>: Ads formatted to promote events</li>
<li><strong>Follower ads</strong>: Ads for promoting your LI business page to grow followers</li>
<li><strong>Lead Gen Forms</strong>: Ads for lead gen that promote a pre-filled form for your content</li>
<li><strong>Message ads</strong>: Ads containing a pre-written message, sent to users directly via LI messaging</li>
<li><strong>Single image ads</strong>: A single image with light copy that appears on the LI feed</li>
<li><strong>Single job ads</strong>: Ads for promoting job postings, targeting candidates</li>
<li><strong>Spotlight ads</strong>: Ads that focus on a specific product or service of your choosing</li>
<li><strong>Text ads</strong>: PPC ads that drive traffic to your site</li>
<li><strong>Video ads</strong>: Video ads that appear alongside or in the feed of LI</li>
</ul>
<p>If your head’s spinning after looking at that list, you’re not alone. But, one of the perks of LinkedIn’s many ad formats, is that you can tailor the ad experience to fit your needs. If you’re not looking to attract candidates or hosting any events, you can immediately cross a few of the above ads off your list and focus on other formats.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-linkedin.webp" alt="linkedin ads advertising platform example" width="428" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81032" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-linkedin.webp 428w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-linkedin-215x300.webp 215w" sizes="(max-width: 428px) 100vw, 428px" /></p>
<p>Unlike other ad platforms, LinkedIn ads can also be targeted using industry and job title filters. This is especially helpful for B2B companies looking to sell to a particular industry. And for those with little-to-no ad experience, LinkedIn is testing a new campaign type, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-begins-testing-fully-automated-accelerate-ad-siddhi-mistry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accelerate</a>, which will help you with targeting and automatically optimize performance over time.</p>
<h4>Who should advertise on LinkedIn?</h4>
<p>LinkedIn ads are ideal for anyone with a professional audience and those looking to find new talent for their company. If you’re in a B2B space, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/05/linkedin-advertising" rel="noopener">LinkedIn ads</a> are especially great, as you can target by industry and job title.</p>
<p>LinkedIn also comes with the added bonus of allowing you to attach your business page or profile to everything. This is great for networking, which goes a long way when you’re a small business trying to grow.</p>
<div id="youtube-advertising-platform"></div>
<h3>4. YouTube</h3>
<p>When it comes to video, YouTube is at the top of the pile. In fact, there are more than <a href="https://www.demandsage.com/youtube-stats/#:~:text=YouTube%20Monthly%20Active%20Users,population%20uses%20YouTube%20every%20month." target="_blank" rel="noopener">2.7 billion</a> monthly users on YouTube. YouTube offers several types of ads:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skippable in-stream</strong>: Video ads that are skippable after 5 seconds</li>
<li><strong>Non-skippable in-stream</strong>: Thirty-second video ads that users can&#8217;t skip</li>
<li><strong>Bumper</strong>: Video ads that are six seconds or less, shown before, during, or after video</li>
<li><strong>In-feed</strong>: Video ads that appear on a user&#8217;s YouTube feed</li>
<li><strong>Outstream</strong>: Mobile-only video ads shown on Google video partner sites</li>
</ul>
<p>Along with a number of ad types, YouTube also offers two payment methods. The first is CPC, in which case you’re only charged when a user clicks on your video ad to go to your site. The other model is cost-per-view (CPV), which only charges you when someone watches your ad in its entirety.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-youtube-ads.webp" alt="youtube ads advertising platform example" width="918" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81033" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-youtube-ads.webp 918w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-youtube-ads-480x313.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 918px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>YouTube is owned by Google and benefits from the same massive network, meaning outstream YouTube ads can show up on a large variety of websites and reach a wide audience.</p>
<h4>Who should advertise on YouTube?</h4>
<p>Much like Google ads, YouTube ads are ideal for most businesses because of their reach and wide-ranging audiences. But, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/youtube-advertising-cost/">YouTube ads</a> do require more effort than typical display ads, as you have to make video. If you don’t have the budget or time for video ads at the moment, YouTube may not be the best option.</p>
<p>However, if you have the resources for videos, YouTube ads are a great way to reach your audience in a multimedia way. YouTube’s flexible payment types also add flexibility other platforms lack. If you’re looking to drive traffic to a particular page, the CPC model is ideal. If you want to build awareness and grow your audience, the CPV model is the ticket.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f331.png" alt="🌱" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Finding the right advertising platform is only one component of a successful growth strategy.

<div id="facebook-advertising-on-meta-platform"></div>
<h3>5. Facebook</h3>
<p>Meta, previously just Facebook, is home to nearly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/947869/facebook-product-mau/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4 billion</a> monthly users. Meta ads run across Facebook, Instagram, and their Audience Network. You can set a budget and bid, much like Google ads and other advertising platforms. Then, you set whether you want to pay for impressions or conversions.</p>
<p>It should come as little surprise that Meta ads are available in numerous formats:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Photo</strong>: Ads with an image and light text, along with a CTA</li>
<li><strong>Video</strong>: Video ads that vary in length, from brief to six minutes</li>
<li><strong>Messenger</strong>: Ads within the messenger app, focused on conversations</li>
<li><strong>Stories</strong>: Full-screen video ads that appear on Facebook stories</li>
<li><strong>Slideshow</strong>: An in-motion slideshow of images, sound, and text with CTA</li>
<li><strong>Playables</strong>: Playable ads that give users a chance to demo an app</li>
<li><strong>Collection</strong>: Showcase a collection of products in one ad, with purchasing links</li>
<li><strong>Carousel</strong>: Display 10 or fewer images or videos, each with a unique CTA</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the above ad types can vary in effectiveness, depending on audience, industry, and campaign goals. For example, if you’re looking to promote a sale, a carousel of various services or products with discount info can perform far better than a single image ad.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-facebook.webp" alt="facebook ads meta advertising platform example" width="436" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81034" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-facebook.webp 436w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-facebook-219x300.webp 219w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px" /></p>
<h4>Who should run Facebook ads?</h4>
<p>Ads across Meta are ideal for most businesses, largely because there’s such a huge audience and variety of ad types. The variety of ad types can also act as a curse, however, as there’s more testing required to figure out which ad type performs the best with your audience/for your use case.</p>
<p>No matter the case, consider testing out Meta ads for your business. Just make sure you take the time to track performance and experiment with other ad types.</p>
<div id="instagram-advertising-on-meta-platform"></div>
<h3>6. Instagram</h3>
<p>Instagram, the popular image and video social networking site, is home to more than <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/183585/instagram-number-of-global-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.3 billion</a> users. Not only is that a lot of cat and food photos, but it’s also a lot of opportunity to find an audience.</p>
<p>Although Instagram ads are run through Meta, we’ve broken it out as its own advertising platform to highlight some of the benefits and opportunities there.</p>
<p>Instagram ads are offered in numerous formats:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Image ads</strong>: In-feed image posts with text and a CTA</li>
<li><strong>Video ads</strong>: In-feed video ads that contain a CTA</li>
<li><strong>Carousel ads</strong>: Multiple images or videos users can swipe through, with CTA</li>
<li><strong>Story ads</strong>: Image or video ads that appear as users scroll through stories</li>
<li><strong>Collection ads</strong>: Image ads that showcase multiple products beneath an image</li>
<li><strong>Shopping ads</strong>: Ads that pull from your Instagram shopping catalog and send users to a product page</li>
<li><strong>Explore ads</strong>: Ads that appear in the Explore section of Instagram</li>
<li><strong>Reels ads</strong>: Short video ads that show while users scroll through Reels</li>
</ul>
<p>Because Instagram is owned by Meta, many of the above ads can even show up on Facebook as well. This allows for an even greater reach, but keep in mind this will eat into your budget.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-instagram.webp" alt="instagram ads meta advertising platform example" width="414" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81035" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-instagram.webp 414w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-instagram-207x300.webp 207w" sizes="(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px" /></p>
<p>Speaking of budget, Instagram ads are priced by <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-cpc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPC</a> model, or cost-per-impression. Pricing varies depending on the industry you’re in, the audience you’re going after, and so on.</p>
<h4>Who should run Instagram ads?</h4>
<p>Instagram ads aren’t quite as wide-reaching or general as Google, but this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t use them. For small businesses and entrepreneurs, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/instagram-advertising" rel="noopener">Instagram ads</a> can come across as genuine and resonate with potential audiences. This is especially true if your audience skews slightly younger, as <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/325587/instagram-global-age-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">61%</a> of Instagram users are 18-34 years old.</p>
<p>Instagram ads are also a great idea if you have an ecommerce store, as the shopping ads can pull straight from your <a href="https://business.instagram.com/shopping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram catalog</a> and give people a quick way to purchase.</p>
<p>Lastly, keep in mind Instagram is primarily accessed via mobile devices. If you want to reach your audience on the go, this is a  prime way to do it. But, if you have an audience that’s not as mobile savvy, Instagram may not be the best way to go.</p>

<h3>7. TikTok</h3>
<p>TikTok, the video-based social media platform sensation, has a large user base that’s estimated to be around <a href="https://viralyft.com/blog/tiktok-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.7 billion</a> monthly active users. Home to videos of everything from cats to recipes to alien conspiracies, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/11/advertising-on-tiktok" rel="noopener">TikTok is also a powerful online advertising platform</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-tiktok.webp" alt="tiktok ads advertising platform example" width="300" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81036" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-tiktok.webp 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-tiktok-150x300.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>TikTok is partnered with Shopify, Ecwid, WooCommerce, and BigCommerce, allowing for seamless integration of online purchasing directly into ads and your business profile.</p>
<p>For the ads themselves, you have a variety of formats to choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In-feed</strong>: Video ads up to 60 seconds long, which show up as users swipe</li>
<li><strong>TopView</strong>: Ads up to 60 seconds, shown at the top of the &#8220;For You&#8221; page when users open the app</li>
<li><strong>Branded Effects</strong>: Branded filters created for users to make videos with</li>
<li><strong>Branded Hashtag Challenge</strong>: A branded hashtag created with the intention of users sharing it</li>
<li><strong>Brand Takeover</strong>: A full-page ad, either an image or three-second clip</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are numerous formats, most of the above ads are geared toward video. Keep in mind TikTok is a video-heavy audience, so static images aren’t as expected on the platform.</p>
<h4>Who should run TikTok ads?</h4>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s integration with multiple ecommerce platforms makes it ideal for online B2C shops, as you can not only get eyes on your products, but also give people a quick way to purchase them.</p>
<p>TikTok features more than 100 templates for creators to help streamline the ad creation process. If you&#8217;re not familiar with video content or comfortable handling design, this could make TikTok ads especially enticing.</p>
<div id="snapchat-advertising-platform"></div>
<h3>Snapchat</h3>
<p>Snapchat has more than 750 million monthly active users, with <a href="https://thesocialshepherd.com/blog/snapchat-statistics#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%2C%20the,just%205%25%20of%20the%20platform." target="_blank" rel="noopener">78%</a> of users being Gen Z and Millennials.</p>
<p>As a social media platform, Snapchat primarily focuses on videos and images. While users can share private messages and videos, they can also scroll through story feeds.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s in these feeds that brands can have their ads appear in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single image or video ads</strong>: Image or video (3-180 seconds) featured via spotlight placement or between stories.</li>
<li><strong>Collection ads</strong>: Collection of several products with purchase CTAs</li>
<li><strong>Story ads</strong>: Images or videos that appear on the story feed, each with unique CTA.</li>
<li><strong>AR ads</strong>: Branded Snapchat lenses users can engage and post with.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-snapchat-ads.webp" alt="snapchat ads example" width="317" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81037" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-snapchat-ads.webp 317w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-snapchat-ads-159x300.webp 159w" sizes="(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px" /></p>
<p>For video ads, you can go up to three minutes in length. But, it’s generally advisable to keep videos much shorter, right around 10 seconds, as this is on par with many videos featured on Snapchat.</p>
<h4>Who should run Snapchat ads?</h4>
<p>Snapchat trends younger, with the bulk of users falling into the 15-35 age range. If your business has a younger audience, Snapchat offers a great way to reach your audience organically.</p>
<p>Snapchat also offers <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/snapchat-business-account/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free business profiles</a>. If you’re not interested in paying for ads at the moment, you can still create a business profile, feature your products and services, and start building a following ahead of any ad campaigns. But <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/snapchat-ad-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snapchat ads</a> are a great way to directly reach your audience and drive engagement.</p>
<h2>Get started with the right advertising platforms for your business</h2>

<h2>What is performance marketing?</h2>
<p>Performance marketing is a digital marketing strategy based on results in which the brands or businesses only pay the marketing agencies, advertising platforms, or affiliates when they achieve their specific campaign goals, typically in the form of sales, clicks, or leads.</p>
<div id="performance-marketing-vs-brand-marketing"></div>
<h3>What’s the difference between performance marketing vs. brand marketing?</h3>
<p>Performance and brand marketing are two different types of strategies that can be used to reach the intended audience.</p>
<p>While both forms have their benefits, the main difference between them is brand marketing aims to establish a long-term company&#8217;s reputation and awareness among potential customers; in contrast, performance marketing focuses on specific strategies to drive immediate sales without necessarily building an emotional connection with customers first.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f331.png" alt="🌱" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Download our <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite7StepstoGrowthStrategy.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_GrowthStrategy_Download">free, editable growth strategy template</a> to walk through seven simple steps for creating the right plan to grow your business.</p>
<div id="benefits-of-performance-marketing"></div>
<h2>What are benefits of performance marketing?</h2>
<p>Even though this marketing strategy can be challenging for some businesses, there are many benefits for those who dive in.</p>
<p>Here are three reasons why you should give performance marketing a try.</p>
<h3>Low risk</h3>
<p>Performance marketing is a low-risk method to introduce new strategies since it requires (relatively) little investment. If the campaign works, you can scale up and increase the budget; however, if it doesn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s easy to back up without a big loss.</p>
<h3>Targeted</h3>
<p>This marketing strategy allows you to target the right people with your message. You can focus on demographics and geographic locations or narrow your searches by interests and behavior, such as consumers who visited your site recently or who clicked on the ad in the last 24 hours.</p>
<h3>Increased ROI</h3>
<p>One of the biggest benefits of performance marketing is that it can result in higher ROI than other types of advertising because it&#8217;s focused on a specific goal.</p>
<div id="types-of-performance-marketing"></div>
<h2>What are types of performance marketing?</h2>
<p>Performance marketing can be done through various means. Here are some of the most common.</p>
<h3>Social media advertising</h3>
<p>Social media ads are one of the most popular forms of performance-based advertising. These ads can target people who have visited your website once or shown interest in similar products or services.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/facebook-video-ad-example.png" alt="facebook video ad example - zapier" width="720" height="696" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-68275" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/facebook-video-ad-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/facebook-video-ad-example-480x464.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Search advertising</h3>
<p>Search advertising, also known as PPC, is the practice where advertisers pay to have their ads placed above organic search results on search engine result pages (SERP) like Google and Bing.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Want to learn more about search engine marketing on Google?

<h3>Display advertising</h3>
<p>Display advertising is a type of advertising where ads are shown on web pages&#8211;typically in the form of banner ads. These ads show up on popular websites, news sites, and more and drive users to your website.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/display-ad-example-austin-statesman.webp" alt="display ad example from austin statesman" width="862" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-80412" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/display-ad-example-austin-statesman.webp 862w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/display-ad-example-austin-statesman-480x333.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 862px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Affiliate marketing</h3>
<p>Affiliate marketing is a performance-based marketing method in which businesses reward affiliates for each customer brought by their promotional efforts.</p>
<div id="how-to-measure-performance-marketing"></div>
<h2>How do you measure performance marketing?</h2>
<p>Performance marketing is the art of achieving your business goals through paid advertising. It’s not just about buying ads and hoping they work. It’s about getting a return on the money you spend, which means measuring performance and adjusting your strategy accordingly.</p>
<p>The following are some of the most important <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">metrics</a> you should track to ensure your campaigns are running smoothly and meeting goals.</p>

<h2>5 steps to build a successful performance marketing strategy</h2>
<p>Developing a successful performance marketing strategy takes time, dedication, and much trial and error. But the payoff can be huge if you can get it right.</p>
<p>Here are some steps to build a performance marketing strategy that will bring results.</p>
<h3>1. Define your objectives</h3>
<p>To create an effective performance marketing campaign, it is fundamental that you have a clear understanding of what you are trying to accomplish because it will help you define every other step.</p>
<p>Your targets should be specific, measurable, and achievable. It should also be aligned with your overall <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-plan-goals-objectives-for-small-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business goals</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/smart-goals-acronym.webp" alt="smart goals acronym" width="460" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-80522" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/smart-goals-acronym.webp 460w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/smart-goals-acronym-231x300.webp 231w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<p>For example, social media advertising is a great option if you want to sell a product or service. However, if your goal is to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drive traffic to your website</a>, then paid search might work better.</p>
<p>Once you have identified these goals, they should form the foundation of all your marketing activities. Every campaign should be designed to support them in some way.</p>
<h3>2. Choose the right digital channels</h3>
<p>One of the keys to being successful at performance marketing is using multiple channels. The reality is that not all channels are created equal, and some will work better than others for your particular business.</p>
<p>The best way to do this is by setting up a few channels, testing them with small amounts of money, and tracking the results over time so you can make better decisions in the future.</p>
<p>Here are some common types of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/26/marketing-channels">digital marketing strategies</a> you can choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content marketing: </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-marketing-trends-2024">Content marketing</a> is the process of creating, distributing, and promoting your company’s content to attract potential customers. It can build authority, trust, and loyalty with consumers.</li>
<li><strong>Social media marketing: </strong><a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/local-social-media-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social media</a> is an essential part of any online marketing strategy. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have become a place where your consumers spend the most time.</li>
<li><strong>Display ads:</strong> Display ads are typically placed on news sites, <a href="https://www.blogituplife.com/what-does-blog-stand-for/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blogs</a>, or e-commerce sites. These ads often appear in the form of pop-up banners that contain a link back to your website.</li>
<li><strong>Email marketing: </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/12/27/email-marketing-ios15">Email marketing</a> helps you build relationships with prospects so they trust your brand and buy from you when ready.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/black-friday-email-template-sale.webp" alt="black friday email template - example of black friday sale email to customers" width="336" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76986" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/black-friday-email-template-sale.webp 336w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/black-friday-email-template-sale-168x300.webp 168w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" /></p>
<h3>3. Identify partners</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge of managing a performance marketing campaign is finding the right partners to work with. The relationship you have with your partner can make or break your campaign.</p>
<p>You need to find partners with a vision and goals similar to yours who will help you reach people that matter.</p>
<p>The best partners have access to a large following and provide high-quality leads with a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics">strong conversion rate</a>, meaning they&#8217;re more likely to convert into paying customers.</p>
<p>When looking for partners, ensure they offer transparency about their work and methods. This will help you understand what kind of return on investment (ROI) you can expect from working with them over time.</p>
<h3>4. Launch and optimize campaigns</h3>
<p>Now that you have a budget and a target audience, it is time to launch your campaigns. You will need to set up a landing page and website where you intend to direct the traffic from these ads.</p>
<p>Once you have all the elements in place, you&#8217;ll want to optimize your campaigns for performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics">Optimizing for performance</a> means constantly tracking and improving the metrics that matter most to your business. You should be looking at how many customers are being acquired, how much they spend, and how long they stay engaged with your brand.</p>
<p>Optimization is a never-ending process because it&#8217;s not about finding and sticking with the winning strategy. Instead, you must constantly test new ideas and see which works best in different situations.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/23/optimize-performance-max-campaigns">optimize your ads</a> by changing their keywords or budgets to improve performance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-optimization.webp" alt="google ads location targeting bid optimization" width="936" height="532" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76522" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-optimization.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-optimization-480x273.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For example, if an ad gets clicks but not conversions (sales), you should make changes or remove the ad altogether. Or, if an ad isn&#8217;t getting any clicks, you&#8217;ll want to try a different approach, keyword, or title until you find something that works better.</p>
<h3>5. Monitor results</h3>
<p>Monitoring the results of your performance marketing campaigns is crucial to your success. The key is understanding what&#8217;s working, what&#8217;s not, and what can be improved.</p>
<p>The best way to track your performance is to use a dedicated software program to give you all the information you need in one place. This way, you&#8217;ll be able to see how each channel is performing and make adjustments as needed.</p>
<p>You should also pay attention to the quality of traffic that your campaigns send to your site. You can do this by looking at bounce rate, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/expected-ctr">click-through rate (CTR)</a>, conversion rate, and other metrics over time.</p>
<p>The results should be monitored daily, and you should also look at the data weekly or monthly. This will help you identify trends and evaluate the performance of your campaigns over time.</p>

<h2>What is a brand community?</h2>
<p>A brand community is a group of people who engage with a brand beyond simply buying its products. Like at Sephora, brand communities often interact with each other, creating an organic space to share inspiration, recommendations, and experiences that increase the group’s affinity for the brand.</p>

<h2>Why does building a brand community matter?</h2>
<p>Brand communities aren’t just a marketing exercise, though. They are a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/18/best-marketing-strategies">marketing strategy</a> that aligns with the goals of your business, fostering efficient growth in a variety of ways (and improving your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/brand-perception">brand perception</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/a-better-way-to-build-a-brand-the-community-flywheel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data from McKinsey</a>, for example, revealed that brands that succeed at building communities perform well across different metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 75% of content about the brand is user-generated.</li>
<li>The influencer engagement rate— i.e. the percentage of viewers who like, share or comment on the content—is more than 2%.</li>
<li>Over 4% of online traffic gets converted to sales.</li>
<li>Posts related to the brand that are shared by the brand or a consumer go viral at least 2x/year</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some more benefits of a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ads-brand-suitability-controls">brand</a> community to consider.</p>
<h3>Increases customer loyalty and sales</h3>
<p>A sense of belonging and connection with a brand often leads to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/11/10/customer-loyalty">increased loyalty</a>.</p>

<p>When customers feel they&#8217;re part of a community, they&#8217;re more likely to continue supporting the brand and advocate for it. Plus, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/brand-personality-messaging">loyal community members</a> are more likely to make repeat purchases and can play a crucial role in driving new customer acquisitions through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/06/referral-marketing">referrals</a>.</p>
<h3>Promotes authentic engagement</h3>
<p>A brand community encourages organic interactions between customers. These <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/07/customer-engagement-strategy">engagements</a> provide genuine insights and create a deeper emotional connection between the brand and its customers.</p>
<h3>Creates a valuable feedback loop</h3>
<p>Brand communities provide businesses with direct access to consumers&#8217; thoughts and feelings. This <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/24/customer-feedback">customer feedback</a> is invaluable for product improvements, innovation, and understanding market needs.</p>

<h3>Helps with crisis management</h3>
<p>A solid brand community can act as a support network should any <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/02/social-media-crisis-management">issues or crises arise</a>. The company can communicate with its most loyal customers, offering understanding and feedback, helping them navigate turbulent times.</p>
<h3>Lowers the cost of marketing</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/26/word-of-mouth-marketing">Word-of-mouth</a> and organic sharing within the community can significantly reduce the need for traditional marketing expenses. Community members become micro brand ambassadors, often promoting products and services without direct incentive. Plus, <a href="https://www.marketingcharts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">28%</a><a href="https://www.marketingcharts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> of</a><a href="https://www.marketingcharts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://www.marketingcharts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> customers</a> prefer finding out about new brands and products through word of mouth.</p>

<h3>Acts as an outlet for new ideas and improvements</h3>
<p>Engaged community members often offer fresh ideas, perspectives, and solutions that can lead to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/20/product-positioning">product or service improvements</a> or even entirely new offerings.</p>
<div id="how-do-you-build-a-brand-community"></div>
<h2>How to build a brand community</h2>
<p>Building a brand community is more than just setting up a platform. It&#8217;s about fostering relationships, offering value, and continually engaging with your audience. A thriving brand community requires methodical planning, incremental improvements, and consistently putting customers first.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-presence.webp" alt="Brand community - graphic showing how communities work." width="868" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-78745 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-presence.webp 868w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-presence-480x332.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 868px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>1. Ensure strategic alignment</h3>
<p>Ensure your brand community aligns with your business goals and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/12/21/customer-perceived-value">customer satisfaction</a> criteria.</p>
<p>A brand community shouldn&#8217;t just be an afterthought or a siloed initiative. For it to genuinely succeed, ensure you have a clear understanding of your end goals, whether they&#8217;re bolstering <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/11/10/customer-loyalty">brand loyalty</a>, gathering user feedback, or driving organic word-of-mouth marketing. The community should reflect the brand&#8217;s core values and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/02/how-to-write-a-business-mission-statement">mission</a>.</p>
<h3>2. Dedicate ample resources</h3>
<p>Effective community management demands resources—both in terms of time and personnel.</p>
<p>Whether you embed it as part of your marketing department or hire dedicated community managers, ensure clear accountability and responsibility. Choose individuals aligned with your brand values because they will actively shape brand perceptions and handle <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/24/customer-feedback">feedback</a>.</p>
<p>This example from HubSpot shows how to do community management the right way.</p>

<h3>3. Choose the right platform</h3>
<p>Your choice of platform can significantly influence the community&#8217;s trajectory.</p>
<p>While third-party platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or Reddit can be excellent due to their vast user base, there&#8217;s a growing trend and clear advantages to hosting communities directly on brand websites.</p>
<p>This example of a post on EA’s subreddit shows how quickly it can go downhill when communities are hosted on other platforms. This comment became the <a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/react-most-downvoted-comment-of-reddit-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most downvoted comment</a> in Reddit history.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-locked.webp" alt="Brand community - discussion in ES Sport's subreddit" width="909" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-78748 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-locked.webp 909w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-locked-480x317.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 909px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/reddit-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Direct integration offers more control, better access to user data, and can drive further engagement with other parts of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/12/31/basic-website">website</a>.</p>
<h3>4. Leverage your website</h3>
<p>Hosting your community on your site makes it easier to collect first-party data, ensures consistent branding, and potentially increases time spent on your site. This integration can lead to better customer insights and improve <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/conversion-rate#:~:text=Make%20sure%20your%20headline%20clearly,that%20entices%20people%20to%20act">conversion rates</a>.</p>
<p>Take a look at this example of Lululemon’s brand community hosted on its website.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-lululemon.webp" alt="Brand community - lululemon's brand community" width="936" height="555" class="aligncenter wp-image-78750 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-lululemon.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-lululemon-480x285.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://shop.lululemon.com/community" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<h3>5. Create a cross-channel experience</h3>
<p>A brand community isn&#8217;t limited to its primary platform. If your community thrives on your website, snippets of vibrant discussions, testimonials, or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/28/user-generated-content">user-generated content</a> can be highlighted on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/01/09/social-media-marketing-strategies">social media platforms</a>, creating a web of interconnected touchpoints that reinforce the brand&#8217;s messaging and values.</p>
<h3>6. Adopt a customer-centric approach</h3>
<p>The heart of any brand community is its members.</p>
<p>Their needs, desires, and feedback should be at the forefront. A successful brand community should provide a platform for users to voice their opinions and make <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/01/06/cater-to-your-customers">customers feel valued and heard</a>. Exclusivity, in terms of offers or information, can make community members feel like VIPs, fostering stronger brand allegiance.</p>
<h3>7. Act on customer feedback</h3>
<p>Open channels of communication mean customer feedback will flow abundantly. And what truly matters is the brand&#8217;s responsiveness and adaptability. Demonstrating that you value and act upon user feedback can turn casual users into brand evangelists, creating organic promoters within the community.</p>
<h3>8. Empower active participation</h3>
<p>Communities thrive on engaged participants.</p>
<p>Allow users to have a say in product development or other brand initiatives. This tactic will help you source fresh ideas and give users a stake in your brand&#8217;s journey, deepening their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">emotional connection</a>.</p>
<h3>9. Create tailored experiences</h3>
<p>Understanding the distinct makeup and preferences of your brand community can allow for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing">hyper-personalized experiences</a>. For instance, a fashion brand’s community can offer its members the opportunity to create their own designs, shop from exclusive designer lines based on their likes, and watch behind-the-scenes <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/03/video-marketing-ideas">videos</a> for upcoming collections.</p>
<p>While Uniqlo doesn’t have a “community,” it offers a unique look at new designer collections to fashion-conscious consumers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-unique.webp" alt="Brand community - Unique brand website" width="936" height="529" class="aligncenter wp-image-78751 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-unique.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-unique-480x271.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.uniqlo.com/in/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>10. Engage with members consistently</h3>
<p>Engagement goes beyond mere content updates. Hosting live Q&amp;A sessions, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/13/ugc-instagram">featuring user-generated content</a>, or spotlighting community members can generate buzz. Offering tangible benefits, such as discounts or early access to sales, can also bolster active participation.</p>
<h3>11. Extend engagement to the real world</h3>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget the power of real-world interactions. Workshops, meet-ups, or exclusive brand events can solidify the sense of community, making members feel even more valued.</p>
<p>Joining the IKEA Family gives members access to both free and paid offline workshops and events that they can attend with their entire family.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-Ikea.webp" alt="Brand community - IKEA community web page" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-78753 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-Ikea.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-Ikea-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/stores/events/ikea-atlanta-ga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>12. Make it extremely accessible</h3>
<p>Your community should be easily accessible. If hosted on your site, clear signposting from the homepage, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/06/01/product-pages">product pages</a>, or during the checkout process can direct more traffic, ensuring users know the community exists and its benefits.</p>
<h3>13. Run cross-promotion campaigns</h3>
<p>Employ branded <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags">hashtags</a> or initiate challenges that blur the lines between different platforms. This <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/22/cross-channel-marketing">cross-channel approach</a> not only maintains consistent brand messaging but also exposes a broader audience to your brand community, roping in potential new members.</p>

<h2>The best examples of brand communities in action</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/a-better-way-to-build-a-brand-the-community-flywheel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McKinsey’s research</a> found that brands that succeed at building brand communities employ five key strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand their communities</li>
<li>Craft engaging brand narratives</li>
<li>Highlight flagship products</li>
<li>Foster discussions across platforms</li>
<li>Simplify the buying process.</li>
</ul>
<p>These strategies collectively promote the creation of a self-sustaining community flywheel. Here are stellar brand community examples that epitomize this phenomenon in action:</p>
<h3>LEGO Ideas</h3>
<p><a href="https://ideas.lego.com/howitworks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LEGO Ideas</a> is a platform where fans can share their creations, enter challenges, and showcase their proposals for new LEGO sets. The most popular designs, determined by community votes, may get produced by LEGO.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-lego.webp" alt="Brand community - Lego online community" width="936" height="492" class="aligncenter wp-image-78756 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-lego.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-lego-480x252.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://ideas.lego.com/howitworks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The community provides a direct line for fans to be involved in product development, fostering a sense of ownership and collaboration.</p>
<h3>GoPro</h3>
<p><a href="https://gopro.com/en/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoPro’s</a> online community is centered around two concepts:creating user-generated content and offering community-led customer support.</p>
<p>User-generated content routinely gets shared on GoPro’s official Instagram handle with the hashtag #shotongopro.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-gopro1.webp" alt="Brand community - Screenshot of GoPro's social media page" width="702" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-78757 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-gopro1.webp 702w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-gopro1-480x410.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 702px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CwnFgO7rqrV/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>The brand encourages users to submit photos and videos to win cash prizes. GoPro subscribers get double the reward, encouraging more users to join the inner circle.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-GoPro2.webp" alt="Brand community - GoPro's discussion board" width="669" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-78758 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-GoPro2.webp 669w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-GoPro2-480x430.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 669px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://community.gopro.com/s/gopro-labs?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>Both of these strategies have helped GoPro become the go-to choice for adventurers and travel influencers.</p>
<h3>Peloton</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-peleton.webp" alt="Brand community - Woman riding a peleton bike" width="886" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-78761 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-peleton.webp 886w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-peleton-480x325.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 886px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://medium.com/swlh/peloton-proves-the-value-of-building-community-169a4d969aee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peloton</a>, technically a fitness business, wants to be known as a health and wellness brand amongst its audience. The brand’s meteoric growth during the pandemic can be largely attributed to its loyal user base sharing their personal experiences with the brand.</p>
<p>Peloton’s Chief Marketing Officer Dara Treseder shared their approach to brand building with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/07/how-peloton-builds-a-community-around-health-and-wellness.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNBC</a>:</p>
<p>“&#8230;for us, that intentional cultivation of community is really focused on finding where there are organic sparks of connection within our member base, and then kind of pouring fuel on that &#8230; shining a spotlight on those things.”</p>
<p>The company also uses its famous team of instructors to frequently connect with members across social <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">media platforms</a>.</p>
<h2>Transitioning to a &#8216;brand community-at-the-core&#8217; model</h2>
<p>By positioning your brand community at the heart of business operations and weaving it seamlessly into the customer support framework, you can enhance user experience. Use intelligent search tools to ensure that community-driven insights are easily accessible, often preempting the need for customer support channels.</p>
<p>But beyond these strategies, the key lies in genuine, wholehearted commitment. Remember these steps to build a brand community that your most important customers want to be a part of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure strategic alignment</li>
<li>Dedicate ample resource</li>
<li>Choose the right platform</li>
<li>Leverage your website</li>
<li>Create a cross-channel experience</li>
<li>Adopt a customer-centric approach</li>
<li>Act on customer feedback</li>
<li>Empower active participation</li>
<li>Create tailored experiences</li>
<li>Engage with members consistently</li>
<li>Extend engagement to the real world</li>
<li>Make it extremely accessible</li>
<li>Run cross-promotion campaigns</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As marketers and business owners, we’re often so focused on <em>getting</em> customers that we forget about the real lifeblood of scale: <strong>retention</strong>. The average monthly customer churn rate across industries is around 5%. That number doesn’t seem massive on its face, but consider your growth rate. Depending on your business type, 5% customer growth month-over-month is nothing to sneeze at. That means that in order to realize actual revenue from that growth, you would need to<strong> keep churn below 5%</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/customer-experience-strategy-customer-churn.webp" alt="customer experience strategy - graphic using fish to illustrate customer churn" width="936" height="572" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76344" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/customer-experience-strategy-customer-churn.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/customer-experience-strategy-customer-churn-480x293.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Churn is inevitable, but how do you keep more fish in the tank?</em></p>
<p>Unless you have strong net new customer growth, your bottom line is going to take a hit if 5% of your business leaves every month. That’s where customer experience comes in. Research shows that <a href="https://www.superoffice.com/blog/customer-experience-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">86%</a> of customers are willing to pay more for a better experience. That means that a better customer experience through the funnel can not only help you sell more, it can increase your ASP (average selling price), reduce churn, and even help you upsell satisfied customers.</p>
<p>In this post, we’re going to look at five ways to build a customer experience strategy and improve the customer experience–regardless of what kind of business you own, or what industry you’re in.</p>
<p>Those five strategies are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gather feedback and NPS scores</li>
<li>Leverage customer surveys</li>
<li>Personalize every touchpoint</li>
<li>Cultivate a strong company culture and employee satisfaction</li>
<li>Educate at every step of the customer journey</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s dive in.</p>
<h2>What is a customer experience strategy?</h2>
<p>Before we dig deeper into the five strategies to improve your customer experience, let&#8217;s talk about what a customer experience strategy is.</p>
<p>Customer experience (CX) refers to any engagement a customer has with your business&#8211;this includes pre-purchase experiences through marketing channels or touchpoints all the way through post-purchase and retention.</p>
<p>A customer experience strategy is the plan to create a seamless, positive experience for customers across <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/26/marketing-channels">marketing channels</a> and in any way they engage with your business.</p>

<h2>5 ways to build a customer experience strategy</h2>
<p>Use these tips to build a stand-out customer experience strategy.</p>
<h3>1. Gather feedback and NPS scores</h3>
<p>Our first actionable strategy to improve customer experience is arguably the most important: gather feedback and NPS scores. It’s nearly impossible to improve your business processes, products, customer service, and marketing without understanding where you stand with your existing customers.</p>
<p>NPS, or Net Promoter Score, is sort of a North Star <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-metrics/">metric</a> for customer satisfaction. It gauges how likely your customers are to recommend your products or services to their peers (read: <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/lead-generation-ideas/">get you more business</a>).</p>
<p>NPS is based on a simple survey question: &#8220;On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend our company/product/service to a friend or colleague?&#8221; Based on the responses, customers are classified into three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promoters (score 9-10): These are <strong>highly</strong> satisfied customers and brand advocates.</li>
<li>Passives (score 7-8): These are <strong>moderately</strong> satisfied customers who may or may not recommend your company.</li>
<li>Detractors (score 0-6): These customers are <strong>dissatisfied</strong> and unlikely to recommend your company.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/customer-experience-strategy-nps.webp" alt="customer experience strategy - nps scale and how to calculate" width="936" height="370" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76345" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/customer-experience-strategy-nps.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/customer-experience-strategy-nps-480x190.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Your aggregate NPS score is measured by the <strong>percentage of detractors, subtracted from the percentage of promoters</strong>. Resulting scores can range from -100 to +100.</p>
<p>What’s a good NPS? The creators of NPS, Bain &amp; Company, say that an NPS score above 0 is good, above 20 is great, and above 50 is amazing. Anywhere above 80 is the top percentile.</p>
<p>NPS is a great benchmark to get a feel for how positive an experience you’re providing for your customers, but it’s just one metric, and it doesn’t give you detailed insight into what needs to change. If you want to go deeper, you need to incorporate <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/10/best-online-survey-tools">customer surveys</a>.</p>
<h3>2. Leverage customer surveys</h3>
<p>Utilizing surveys can help you identify (and improve upon) both positive and negative trends in your customer service that, ultimately, determine whether or not your customers are satisfied.</p>
<p>Customer experience is too often a one-sided proposition. Between marketing and sales, it’s easy to spend 95%-100% of your time <em>telling</em> customers how they should feel about your business and its products.</p>
<p>Surveys open up a dialogue with your customers and make that proposition two-sided. Crucially, they give customers an anonymous platform through which to provide honest and valuable feedback–without which, it would be extremely difficult to make meaningful optimizations.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/customer-experience-strategy-customer-surveys.webp" alt="example of customer satisfaction survey" width="601" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76346" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/customer-experience-strategy-customer-surveys.webp 601w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/customer-experience-strategy-customer-surveys-480x478.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 601px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A simple and effective customer satisfaction survey.</em></p>
<p>Here are a few straightforward ways to leverage <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-feedback-questions/">customer feedback surveys</a> to solicit feedback:</p>

<li><strong>Website pop-ups</strong>. Use a tool like Hotjar (or any good pop-up tool) to add a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/02/banner-ads-examples">simple banner</a> that asks customers what would improve their experience with your website or brand.</li>
<li><strong>Email surveys</strong>. Sending surveys to your customers&#8217; inboxes in the form of a basic <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-email-examples-and-templates/">email marketing campaign</a> or post-purchase follow-up is a great way to connect directly with customers and ensure strong feedback numbers.</li>
<li><strong>In-app or in-product surveys</strong>. If you’re a SaaS business, or if you have a mobile app, there’s no better way to improve your product than to ask customers <em>in the product </em>what they would like to see more (or less) of.</li>
<li><strong>Customer service follow-ups.</strong> Once issues have been resolved, have your customer service team ask for feedback on their experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s no wrong way to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-get-customer-feedback/">ask for feedback</a>–the important thing is that you’re consistently giving customers the ability to provide a frank assessment of how well you’re serving them.</p>
<h3>3. Personalize every touchpoint</h3>
<p>It’s counterintuitive, but so much of customer satisfaction happens before your customer ever tries your product. Yes, it’s the job of your customer service team to assuage concerns that come in after the fact. Yes, it’s the job of your product team to take feedback that comes in and use it to make the product better.</p>
<p>But what about that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/18/welcome-email">intro email</a> that you sent to your customer before they purchased when they were still just a newsletter subscriber? Did you use the customer’s name in the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/email-subject-lines-for-sales/">subject line</a>? And what about the demo that your inside sales rep ran with them? Did your rep take a deeper look into the customer’s needs and cater the demo around features that they would find useful?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/customer-experience-strategy-personalization.webp" alt="example of personalized marketing touchpoint" width="585" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76347" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/customer-experience-strategy-personalization.webp 585w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/customer-experience-strategy-personalization-480x492.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 585px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Get to know your customers, and they’ll reward you in the long run.</em></p>
<p>This is why <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing">personalization</a> is so critical. From their first interaction with your brand, customers should feel like you know them and value them. Doing so ensures that your relationship gets off on the right foot, and makes customers feel as if you have their backs–even when things go wrong (and inevitably, they’ll go wrong!).</p>
<p>From your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/landing-page-best-practices/">landing pages</a> to your email copy, to the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/13/chatbot-examples">chatbot on your website</a>, your order confirmation emails, and more–if you take the time to personalize each touchpoint in the funnel, your customers will reward you with loyalty and advocacy.</p>

<h3>4. Cultivate a strong company culture and employee satisfaction</h3>
<p>It can be difficult enough for businesses to look inward and make adjustments based on the feedback they get from customer surveys and NPS scores. But even <em>more </em>difficult is realizing that company culture and employee satisfaction go a <em>very</em> long way in determining how satisfied your customers are going to be and in improving the customer experience.</p>
<p>That’s right–regardless of how many steps you put in place to offer customers the best experience, if your own employees’ experience is wanting, they’re not going to be able to offer the kind of service you need to succeed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/customer-experience-strategy-employee-satisfaction.webp" alt="employee review showing employee satisfaction" width="637" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76348" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/customer-experience-strategy-employee-satisfaction.webp 637w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/customer-experience-strategy-employee-satisfaction-480x452.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 637px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Cultivate strong employee satisfaction, and you’ll get a lot of reviews like this one. </em></p>
<p>How do you cultivate a strong company culture? <em>Lead by example. </em>Company leaders play a crucial role in shaping and embodying the desired culture. Leaders should consistently demonstrate the values and behaviors they expect from employees. If they make mistakes, they should always own them (rather than passing them down the chain). And if their employees perform positively, they should never hesitate to recognize them.</p>
<p>Also, consider your values. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/09/company-core-values" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Core values</a> should be clearly defined, continuously harped on, and should align with your mission. Communicating these values to your employees, and ensuring they understand how they relate to their work, will ensure that every customer interaction lives up to the standards you’ve set for the entire organization.</p>
<p>One final way to cultivate a strong culture? <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/recruiting-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hiring</a>. You can save yourself a <em>lot </em>of trouble by prioritizing candidates who not only have the necessary skills to succeed but also align strongly with your company&#8217;s values.</p>
<h3>5. Educate at every step of the customer journey</h3>
<p>We talked a bit about the importance of personalization <em>at every touchpoint. </em>Similarly, every member of your organization should have an eye on education first when they’re talking to prospects and customers.</p>
<p>Nothing stimulates churn like a customer who bought a product before they were ready, before they knew what they were buying, or before they knew how to properly use said product. Just making a sale is great. But making a customer for life is so much better. And you can ensure that each customer you earn has strong <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/10/cac-vs-clv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lifetime value</a> by educating at every step of the journey.</p>
<p>Just look at these statistics:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/customer-experience-strategy-customer-education.webp" alt="customer education statistics" width="936" height="551" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76349" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/customer-experience-strategy-customer-education.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/customer-experience-strategy-customer-education-480x283.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.northpass.com/customer-education-statistics#:~:text=A%20TSIA%20study%20found%20that,work%20more%20independently%20when%20trained." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>What does product education look like? Take the following examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>A thorough <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/06/irresistible-blog-post-titles">blog post</a> that details how your product solves a common problem experienced by your customers.</li>
<li>An active <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube channel</a>, support community, or forum that shows customers how to properly use, and troubleshoot problems with, your product.</li>
<li>A sales team that seeks to educate <em>while </em>they sell, giving prospects personalized and detailed demos that leave the customer confident they can use your product to improve their lives.</li>
<li>An up-to-date, and prominently displayed list of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resource-center">learning resources</a> on your website.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few examples, but each goes a long way in nurturing educated prospects and reducing churn. Taken together? That’s a strong recipe for customer satisfaction.</p>
<h2>The right customer experience strategy comes down to details</h2>
<p>That about does it for this post. If you read back through each of the above strategies, you’ll notice one common thread: effort. So much of customer experience comes down to just putting in the effort to make your customers feel nurtured and understood.</p>
<p>It’s an investment, but if you can make the changes necessary to positively color your customer’s impression of your business, you’ll limit churn, stimulate growth, and put yourself in a great position to scale.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think we can all agree that ice cream is great, but it’s even better with the right toppings. When it comes to promoting your small business, your marketing plan is the ice cream and your chosen channels are the toppings. Your foundation is great, but you need those layers on top to maximize results.<em></em></p>
<p>We’ll show you how building your strategy with the right marketing channels is like building the perfect ice cream sundae—trying some of each kind will bring in the sweetest success! Here is how we’ll break it down:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#what">What are marketing channels?</a></li>
<li><a href="#which">Which marketing channels are best for your business?</a></li>
<li><a href="#free">Free marketing channels</a></li>
<li><a href="#paid">Paid marketing channels</a></li>
<li><a href="#bonus">Bonus marketing channels</a></li>
<li><a href="#how">How to get started with these marketing channels</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Use this post to make picking your marketing channels easier than choosing toppings for a sundae.</p>
<div id="what"></div>
<h2><strong>What are marketing channels?</strong></h2>
<p>Marketing channels are the various places you promote your business and/or communicate with your target audience—both online and offline.</p>
<p>For example, a potential customer could see a print ad and navigate online to learn more. From there, they might search for your business on Google, see a video about your brand on YouTube, or find your business on social media.</p>
<p>That’s all part of a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-multichannel-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multichannel marketing</a> strategy that ensures you catch every potential customer within your sales funnel.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/marketing-channel-mix-wordstream-scaled.webp" alt="marketing channel mix" width="2560" height="1979" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85428" /></p>
<h3><strong>Types of marketing channels</strong></h3>
<p>Typically, there are two types of marketing channels most businesses use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional marketing channels:</strong> any channel that&#8217;s done offline, like TV, radio, and print.</li>
<li><strong>Non-traditional marketing channels:</strong> any digital channel that&#8217;s done online, like search ads, email marketing, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, these labels can be a bit outdated. They don&#8217;t accurately reflect the ever-changing marketing space as many channels could now fit into either of these categories. How you choose to organize your different types of marketing channels will depend on what makes the most sense for your business. That said, knowing the difference between these two types of marketing channels can help you ensure you&#8217;re <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/02/promote-your-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promoting your business</a> both online and offline.</p>
<div id="which"></div>
<h2><strong>What is the best marketing channel for your business?</strong></h2>
<p>Like with anything in marketing, there is no right or wrong answer when it comes to which channels you choose for your business. The best marketing channels for your business might be different from the channels your competitor is using. Ideally, you&#8217;ll use as many marketing channels as possible to maximize your chances of interacting with potential buyers throughout their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/19/customer-journey-map-templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer journey</a>. Be ready to test various marketing channels and benchmark your progress to find out what mix of channels is right for you.</p>
<div id="free"></div>
<h2><b>The top free marketing channels: </b></h2>
<p>As you plan out your campaigns, these are the marketing channels that should make up the foundation of your strategy since they require little to no <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing budget</a>:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Local SEO</strong></h3>
<p>This past year, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/google-my-business-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">46%</a> of Google searches had local intent. Plus, searches for “near me” or “close by” have grown by over <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/consumer-trends/near-me-searches-search-open-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">900%</a> since 2018. This means that in 2023 and beyond, local SEO will continue to be a game-changer for small businesses.</p>

<p><strong>Quick tips for local SEO:</strong></p>
<ul>

<h3><strong>2. Local listings and online reputation management</strong></h3>
<p>Today, <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/online-review-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">93%</a> of people read online reviews before making a purchasing decision. What’s even better is that people are now willing to pay <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/online-review-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">22%</a> more for a product or service if the company has a good <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-reputation-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online reputation</a>.</p>
<p>Achieving that stellar online reputation in 2023 all comes down to managing your local listings. Your local listings not only show up on the specific listings’ sites—like Yelp, Google Maps, and CitySearch—but they can also help you to show up in search engines.</p>
<p>Plus, listings like the Google Business Profile allow customers to find vital information about your business. For example, your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-write-a-business-description/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business description</a>, contact hours, or address can all be found in one spot.</p>
<p>What’s even better is that <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/best-free-business-listing-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local listings</a> are a completely <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-get-free-advertising-on-google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free way to promote your brand</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Tips to elevate your local listings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-check your information.</strong> You’ll want your business’s profiles to be as accurate as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Respond to reviews.</strong> <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/reputation-management/how-respond-your-customers-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Responding to your customers online</a> will foster a sense of brand credibility within your local listings.</li>
<li><strong>Have fun with it.</strong> Once your profiles are in a good spot, you can get creative with <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/google-my-business-posts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Business Profile posts</a> or <a href="https://blog.yelp.com/businesses/things-to-know-about-advertising-on-yelp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yelp search ads</a>.</li>

<h3><strong>3. Organic social media marketing</strong></h3>
<p>This year, <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/local-social-media-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media marketing</a> is a must-have marketing channel. That’s because there are now <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/social-media-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3.7 billion</a> active monthly social media users worldwide, and the average US adult currently spends over two hours per day on social media.</p>
<p>Some examples of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popular social media platforms</a> you can promote your brand on are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/benefits-of-facebook-advertising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a></li>
<li><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-promote-your-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a></li>
<li><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/linkedin-profile-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a></li>
<li><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/pinterest-marketing-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pinterest</a></li>
<li><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/snapchat-business-account/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snapchat</a></li>
<li><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/tiktok-marketing-for-small-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/12/14/why-use-twitter-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Within the social media channel, you have two options: organic, or unpaid, social media marketing and social media advertising.</p>
<p>Your organic social media marketing strategy relies on engaging your audience and building a community. Plus, with those numbers and options to choose from, you’re sure to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/ways-to-appeal-to-your-target-audience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">catch your ideal audience</a> on social media this year. To do so, establish social media marketing goals.</p>
<p>Preplan what you’ll post (plus where you’ll post it) and how you’ll track success. Using a social media scheduling tool or leveraging a marketing partner can help you with this.</p>
<p><strong>Tips for your organic social posts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use engaging media</strong>. <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/video-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumers prefer digesting videos</a> and images over just plain text.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage your followers for content.</strong> To drive engagement, call out your followers by running contests to have their posts featured on your page.</li>
<li><strong>Try hashtags. </strong><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-use-hashtags-with-hashtag-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hashtags</a> help your organic posts get found and add creative flair.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>4. Word-of-mouth marketing</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/26/word-of-mouth-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Word-of-mouth marketing</a> can be just as effective as other free marketing channels, like online reviews and local listings, since <a href="https://www.inc.com/craig-bloem/84-percent-of-people-trust-online-reviews-as-much-.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">84%</a> of people weigh online reviews the same as they would a word-of-mouth recommendation from friends or family. This means that word-of-mouth marketing is a highly trusted channel for customers to learn more about your business.</p>
<p><strong>Word-of-mouth marketing tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Run a referral program. </strong>A<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/14/referral-program-ideas" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> referral program</a> motivates your loyal customers to spread the word about your business.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritize customer service.</strong> Ensure that every customer has a smooth, seamless experience with your business. When you offer a good quality customer service experience, your customers will be <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/75-customer-service-facts-quotes-statistics/#:~:text=A%20good%20customer%20service%20experience,likely%20to%20recommend%20that%20company." target="_blank" rel="noopener">38%</a> more likely to recommend your business to others. Additionally, <a href="https://www.superoffice.com/blog/customer-experience-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">72%</a> of customers will share a positive experience with six or more people. Focusing on your customer service will maximize your chances of gaining more word-of-mouth marketing.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>5. Networking and partnerships</strong></h3>
<p>The connections you build throughout your career can turn into mutually beneficial partnerships. When you network with other small businesses and local organizations, you&#8217;re opening up opportunities for people to learn more about you and your business. This could lead to partnerships with other business owners or organizations where you could cross-promote one another&#8217;s offerings. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/25/networking-strategies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Networking</a> also allows you to share marketing ideas and source inspiration for new campaigns based on what your connections are doing.</p>
<p><strong>Networking tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep an open mind.</strong> If a business unrelated to your industry is interested in connecting with you, don&#8217;t immediately turn down the opportunity to network. Instead, see how your offerings could complement one another. You might uncover more opportunities to reach one another&#8217;s customer base.</li>
<li><strong>Practice active outreach.</strong> Try to keep a running list of potential businesses or contacts you&#8217;d like to connect with. That way, you can draft tailored <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/26/networking-email-subject-lines-templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">networking emails</a>, call scripts, or direct messages to increase your chances of building a meaningful relationship with them.</li>

<h3><strong>6. Event marketing</strong></h3>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re running your own events, or joining in on community and industry events, event marketing provides countless ways to grow your business with any budget. Both in-person and virtual events can help you <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/lead-generation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get more leads</a>. In fact, <a href="https://blog.gitnux.com/event-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">79%</a> of U.S. businesses use event marketing as a lead-generation tactic.</p>
<p><strong>Event marketing tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Promote your events on social media.</strong> Social media is a great place to raise awareness and attendance for any events you host or participate in. Some platforms, like Facebook, even give you the option to create an event page or event countdown that you can invite users to opt into. Start your social media promotions ahead of the event to create buzz, then take lots of photos and videos during the event to share out after.</li>
<li><strong>Try participating in varying capacities.</strong> Different approaches to event marketing will bring you different results. For example, you could try sponsoring or volunteering at a community event, and measure that against hosting your own event.</li>
<li><strong>Track everything you can.</strong> Hosting or participating in events can be a whirlwind, so tracking can easily get pushed to the back burner. However, it&#8217;s crucial to have a way to measure the success of your event. Be sure you&#8217;re able to track how many people registered or attended your event, and how many may have interacted with your business. Look out for any increases in <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-leads/">marketing leads</a> during or after the event, too.</li>
</ul>
<div id="paid"></div>
<h2><strong>The top paid marketing channels</strong></h2>
<p>Although the following marketing channels will require you to spend a bit of your budget, the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-roi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing ROI</a> can be well worth it for your business!</p>
<h3><strong>7. Social media advertising</strong></h3>
<p>The beauty of social media is that you can market your business for free or decide to put a bit of budget towards <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/benefits-of-facebook-advertising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paid social ads.</a></p>
<p>Paid social ads help you to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-instagram-feed-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">show up in your follower’s feeds</a> more efficiently, and even reach folks who may not be following you yet.</p>
<p>You don’t need a monster budget to get started with social advertising. For example, you can start by putting a few dollars behind an organic post you already created—which will “boost” or “promote” it.</p>
<p><strong>Tips for your paid social content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Have a clear and unique call to action. </strong>With so many social ads getting thrown at your viewers, being clear on what you want them to do when they see your ad will help you stand out.</li>
<li><strong>Be sparing with your text. </strong>You’re putting money towards a post that’s working with limited space in social feeds. Don’t let your text get cut off by keeping your points clear and concise.</li>
<li><strong>Refresh ads often. </strong>Social media is now a quite saturated space, give your audience something fresh to look out for every once in a while by swapping out your images and ad copy.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>8. Search advertising</strong></h3>
<p>Today, <a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/ppc-stats/#gref" target="_blank" rel="noopener">97%</a> of consumers search online for local businesses, and <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/ppc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a local PPC strategy</a> is a great way to guarantee your business will show high in search results when they do.</p>
<p>PPC, or pay per click, ads (also known as search engine marketing, SEM, paid search, and more) show up above organic results on the search engine results page for searches related to your business—making local PPC the perfect marketing channel to complement your local SEO efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Quick PPC tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Find a reporting method that works for you. </strong>With so many <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/ppc-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PPC metrics</a> that can clue you on performance, finding a tool to understand your account’s data is crucial. There are plenty of free, online options like Google Analytics or Google Data Studio.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage automation when you can</strong>. Automation has been on the rise in PPC platforms, you can use this to create smart ads or smart campaigns that do a lot of the build-out and optimization work for you.</li>
<li><strong>Be patient! </strong>The hardest part of running ads is being patient. All ads go through a “learning period” as platforms test them out to different queries. This can last up to two weeks, or even a whole month, at minimum. However, if you treat PPC as a time investment, you’ll be sure to see stellar results by the end of 2023.</li>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An example of search ads on the search results page</em></p>
<h3><strong>9. Display ads</strong></h3>
<p>Along with paid search, one of the other main forms of PPC ads is <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-display-advertising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">display ads</a>. Display ads are images or videos that show to your audience passively as they browse websites. Display’s outlook for 2023 and beyond looks very promising, as it has grown to take up over <a href="https://smallbiztrends.com/2021/02/advertising-statistics.html#:~:text=Display%20Advertising%20Statistics,-Display%20advertising%20is&amp;text=According%20to%20Zenith%20forecast%3A,global%20ad%20spend%20by%202021." target="_blank" rel="noopener">21%</a> of global advertising in 2022.</p>
<p>To start, you can place an image ad on a relevant website that your audience may frequent, or have your video ad play alongside <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/video/what-is-youtube-advertising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content on YouTube</a>. This helps you tap into your audience even when they might not necessarily be searching for you.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/search-ads-vs-display-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running display and search ads together works like a charm</a>. Your display ads can spark awareness—triggering your audience to look for your search ads on the SERP later. You can even measure the effectiveness of display and search together through a metric called <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/14/view-through-conversions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view-through conversions.</a> (Find out more <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing metrics</a> you need to know and track here!)</p>
<p><strong>Tips for display ad:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get creative with your targeting.</strong> Display ads have a plethora of audience targeting options, like <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-remarketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remarketing</a> to your website viewers or showing to folks of certain interests or lifestyles. You can have fun by imagining what your ideal customer’s daily life is like and choosing your targeting based on that.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage unique placements. </strong>With display, you can show across apps, selected websites, and more. Be sure to choose a variety of placements across devices to maximize your results.</li>
<li><strong>Start small, then go big! </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/17/lower-cost-per-click" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Display historically has a cheaper cost-per-click</a> than other channels. This gives you the chance to start off with a small budget while you test what works, then build up from there.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>10. OTT ads</strong></h3>
<p>This hot marketing channel is sure to be a hit in 2023 since OTT (over-the-top) streaming has increased by <a href="https://pages.conviva.com/WP_2021_Q1_State_of_Streaming_Success-Page.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">115%</a> in 2021 compared to previous years. In contrast to display and search ads, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/09/what-ott-advertising" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OTT ads</a> use different pathways to show paid video ads.</p>
<p>With OTT your video ads could appear on apps like Hulu, Google Play, and more.</p>
<p>OTT ads instill <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/search-marketing-display-video/7-ways-drive-leads-and-awareness-your-local-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand awareness</a> and spark searches for your business later which can result in conversions. Plus, OTT helps you reach beyond the SERP or social media to find people you may have otherwise missed.</p>
<p><strong>OTT tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Know your audience.</strong> Identify the personas you’re trying to target with your video ads and be sure to focus your ads on what would appeal to them.</li>
<li><strong>Market with emotion.</strong> Think about what <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/target-audience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your target audience</a> might react to best—whether that be a funny skit, a heartfelt moment, or a suspenseful action scene.</li>
<li><strong>Run tests.</strong> Frequently testing your video ads to see what your viewers are the most receptive to is your best bet for finding your OTT “secret sauce.&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>11. Affiliate marketing</strong></h3>
<p>With <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/16/affiliate-marketing-small-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">affiliate marketing</a>, you&#8217;re letting someone else do the hard work of selling your product or offering. Essentially, you offer a financial incentive for a third-party seller to promote your business for you. For example, if a customer purchases your product or service through an affiliate link, that affiliate would earn a commission. This can be an especially powerful marketing channel for businesses that don&#8217;t yet have a lot of reach or brand awareness. Instead, you&#8217;re leveraging the credibility and resources your affiliate has to help grow your business.</p>
<p><strong>Affiliate marketing tips: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Run a SWOT analysis.</strong> A SWOT analysis requires you to evaluate your business&#8217;s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. With this exercise, you can find out where your business may be lacking, and find an affiliate that fills that gap.</li>
<li><strong>Create a checklist to quickly vet potential affiliates.</strong> A strong affiliate has a clear online presence that matches or complements your brand. For example, you may want to consider the following factors when choosing an affiliate:
<ul>
<li>Do they already have a platform, such as a blog or a website, with<span> </span><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/15/quality-content-defined">quality content</a>?</li>
<li>Are they authentic when<span> </span><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/02/client-communication">communicating</a><span> </span>with audience members online?</li>
<li>Is their<span> </span><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/17/increase-online-presence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online presence</a><span> </span>professional, and does it align with your brand position?</li>
<li>Do they have a large or<span> </span><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/30/social-media-engagement">engaged social media following</a>?</li>
<li>Is the affiliate ranking high for keywords connected to your products or services?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong style="color: #333333; font-size: 22px;">12. Influencer marketing</strong></p>
<p>Although <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/digital-marketing/influencer-marketing-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">influencer marketing</a> has been around for a couple of years now, it won’t be going away any time soon. In fact, <a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/social-media-marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">49%</a> of consumers depend on influencer recommendations from social media.</p>
<p>When you leverage influencer marketing, you’re tapping into someone’s larger following by having them recommend you on their social pages or blog sites.</p>
<p>Most businesses tend to shy away from influencer marketing because they picture a celebrity with millions of followers charging them hundreds of thousands of dollars per post. On the contrary, using micro-influencers that have a lower price per post and a niche following can bring just as effective, if not better, results.</p>
<p><strong>Influencer marketing tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scout out an array of potential micro-influencers. </strong>You may need to reach out to a few accounts before you score a solid partnership. To start, find micro-influencers that fall in line with your industry and have like-minded customers within your target audience following them.</li>
<li><strong>Draft your pitches ahead of time.</strong> To save time, draft up a few different pitches for when you direct message or email micro-influencers. If one pitch doesn’t work, you’ll have another on hand to try instead.</li>
<li><strong>Brainstorm content ideas.</strong> Your micro-influencers will be relieved to know you already have a caption, image, or video script in mind. That way, you can control the quality of their shoutout while also saving them time.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>15. Audio and podcast marketing</strong></h3>
<p>Nearly <a href="https://www.business2community.com/digital-marketing/numbers-and-facts-you-need-to-know-about-audio-content-in-2021-02398919" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60%</a> of people agree audio is more engaging than other forms of content. Don’t just get eyes on your content, get ears on them too. The emergence of audio across marketing channels in recent years has brought to light the endless audio capabilities businesses now have.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-channels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55%</a> of the U.S. population aged 12 and above listen to podcasts. There is a podcast for just about every <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/niche-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">niche market</a> out there, so see if you can place an ad for your business on a popular, fitting podcast. Or, start your own podcast to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/brand-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build your brand’s community</a>!</p>
<p>Another way audio has crept into the marketing world is through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/19/social-media-for-small-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media</a>. Many platforms now offer ways to foster communities through virtual chat rooms with designated speakers and listeners. For example, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/twitter-updates-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter introduced Twitter Spaces</a> as well as voice tweets. With Twitter Spaces, folks can listen and chat with others about hot topics. Voice tweets are audio clips followers can playback.</p>

<li><strong>Write scripts.</strong> There’s nothing wrong with preplanning what you will say in your audio content. Writing a script or even loose notes ahead of time can save you from slip-ups if your audio content is being recorded live.</li>
<li><strong>Promote your audio clips on other marketing channels.</strong> What’s audio content without listeners? Be sure to draw attention to your audio marketing so people know to keep an ear out for it.</li>
<li><strong>Practice makes perfect.</strong> If your audio efforts don’t take off right away, don’t give up! Keep practicing and putting out audio content, as it will take time to build up a loyal listener base.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>16. Artificial Intelligence</strong></h3>
<p>The forecasted AI growth rate between 2020 and 2027 is <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-stats/#:~:text=The%20wearable%20AI%20market%20size,reach%20%2483.25%20billion%20by%202027." target="_blank" rel="noopener">33.2%.</a> Talk about a trendy marketing channel!</p>
<p>A plethora of <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/ai-in-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI marketing capabilities</a> has become accessible to all businesses just this past year. AI (artificial intelligence) in marketing uses machine learning based on large sets of data to do tasks for us like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content creation and curation</li>
<li>Product or search recommendations</li>
<li>Ad targeting</li>
<li>Website chatbots</li>
<li>Marketing automation</li>
<li>And much more!</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/28/ai-for-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trying AI marketing</a> could <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-make-your-business-stand-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help your business stand out</a> by conveniently connecting with your customers from the comfort of their own homes (or wherever they may be in the world).</p>
<p><strong>AI marketing tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Try rolling out VR experiences.</strong> For example, you can use AI to create <a href="https://www.adroll.com/blog/augmented-and-virtual-reality-in-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VR (virtual reality)</a> ads that might let them try on clothing items, view a venue, or take a test drive completely virtually.</li>
<li><strong>Use AI as a time-saving tool.</strong> Using AI for tactics like data collection and analysis will take tasks off your plate.</li>
<li><strong>Proceed with caution.</strong> AI is constantly changing. To avoid any glitches, don’t implement any strategies you haven’t yet tested or gotten comfortable with first.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>17. Marketing with website chat</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.inc.com/nicolas-cole/the-power-of-live-chat-5-surprising-statistics-that-show-how-consumers-want-thei.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">92%</a> of customers feel satisfied with their experience after using <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/live-chat-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live chat</a>, so don’t miss out on this easy website win this year! <a href="https://localiq.com/products/chat/?&amp;itm_source=localiq&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adding live chat</a> can work as a bonus marketing channel because it can make suggestions to customers. For example, your chatbot could promote a new product or offer users an exclusive deal.</p>
<p><strong>Live chat tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Provide options. </strong>Be sure your prompts not only include marketing mentions but also have plenty of options for the various needs your web visitors may have.</li>
<li><strong>Personalize your bot. </strong>Adding a bit of personality to your live chat experience will make your customers’ chat more enjoyable.</li>
<li><strong>Run quality checks early on. </strong>Be sure to run tests and check that all of your chat’s responses make sense before a customer gets caught up in a nonsensical chat.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://chatlio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<h3><strong>18. Print advertising</strong></h3>
<p>Although print advertising is a bit more of an &#8220;old-school&#8221; marketing channel, it&#8217;s still a lucrative strategy for many businesses. Print advertising includes tactics like direct mail, advertisements in publications such as newspapers or magazines, flyers, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Print advertising tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solidify your creative strategy.</strong> Print advertising is all about the visuals you create to pop on your viewer&#8217;s page. Plus, your print ad may end up in various different placements, so you&#8217;ll need imagery that can flex to many different sizes.</li>
<li><strong>Source print advertising inspiration from your competitors.</strong> Print advertising may feel a bit different from the digital marketing channels you may be used to doing. To get a feel for what&#8217;s going on in your print advertising market, check out some <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/best-print-ad-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">print ad examples</a> to see what strategies might be most effective for your business.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>19. TV and radio</strong></h3>
<p>We can&#8217;t do a marketing channels roundup without a nod to traditional marketing channels like TV and radio. While digital marketing channels should primarily be your focus, TV and radio can help supplement any other online and offline promotions you may be running.</p>
<p>Tips for TV, radio, and similar traditional marketing channels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use your OTT ads as material for TV ads.</strong> Since TV commercials and OTT ads are so similar, you can knock out two marketing channels at once if you use the same video ads across both platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Remember the rule of seven.</strong> A common mistake with traditional marketing channels is worrying that you&#8217;ll overtire your audience. It&#8217;s been proven that people need to see or hear something at least <a href="https://factorialhr.com/blog/the-rule-of-7/#:~:text=marketing%20principle%20applies-,What%20is%20the%20rule%20of%207%3F,studios%20first%20coined%20the%20approach." target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven times</a> in order to recall it later. Try running your traditional marketing channels for a longer period of time than you might with other channels so you can ensure you&#8217;re promoting your business as much as possible.</li>
</ul>
<div id="how"></div>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Marketing your business can sometimes feel like this. </em></p>
<p>However, it doesn’t always have to feel like you’re performing tricks to market your business successfully across the board. Today, I’m going to show you how you can market your business for maximized success without jumping through hoops. The secret is cross-channel marketing. Now, just hearing that word may raise some questions—which I’ll provide the answers to, like:</p>
<p>Let’s jump right in!</p>

</ul>
<p><a id="cross-channel-definition"></a></p>
<h2>What is cross-channel marketing?</h2>
<p>In order to understand cross-channel marketing, you first have to be familiar with<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/26/marketing-channels" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> marketing channels</a>—which are all the various places you could promote your business both online and offline. You may be using more channels than you think, as any time you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">communicate with your target audience</a> is an opportunity to market your brand. This means that anything like radio advertising placements, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/04/how-to-build-a-chatbot-your-brand">live chat on your website</a>, your social media platforms, online search ads, and more could all be considered marketing channels.</p>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-cross-channel-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cross-channel marketing</a> means you’re leveraging multiple placements, platforms, or other forms of communication to promote your brand <strong><em>holistically across your sales funnel</em></strong>. It focuses on the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/19/customer-journey-map-templates">customer journey</a>—meaning you’re customizing your offers on each channel to their stage in the funnel. It takes your marketing a step further where you’re not only using multiple marketing channels, but also making sure each of them align to create a seamless, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/01/06/cater-to-your-customers">customer-centric marketing experience.</a><br />
<a id="difference"></a></p>
<h2>What’s the difference between cross-channel and multi-channel marketing?</h2>
<p>Cross-channel marketing often gets confused with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/10/15/multi-channel-marketing">multi-channel marketing</a>, so here’s a quick breakdown:</p>
<p>With <strong>multi-channel marketing</strong>, you use multiple channels to reach your customer but the channels don’t share information with one another. You may still be <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/brand-consistency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maintaining brand consistency</a> across channels, but your offers may not always align with where the customer is at in their journey.</p>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><p><strong>Example </strong></p>
<p>Let’s say you’re an IT provider. A person searches on Google for cloud migration and sees a search ad for your services. They click it and go to your site but exit. Later, they go on Facebook where they see an ad for your services, but they don’t click it. The following week, they go on LinkedIn where they see an ad to download your enterprise benchmarks report.</p></div></div>
<p>With<strong> cross-channel marketing</strong>, the multiple channels do share information with one another, so the offer a person sees on any given channel is determined by their previous engagement with your business (on any other channel).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>So, let’s redo the IT provider example in a cross-channel setting. A person searches on Google for <em>cloud migration</em> and sees a search ad for your services. They click it and go to your site but exit. Later, when they go on Facebook, they see a lead ad for a guide on <em>cloud migration</em>, which they download. In the lead form, they indicate their company size . The following week, when they’re on LinkedIn, they see an ad for a webinar on 10 IT mistakes small businesses make. They register and when they attend, they sign up for a consult.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div></div>
<p>See the difference? In the cross-channel strategy, you have curated material that <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/types-of-customer-needs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meets your customers’ needs </a>across their journey. This means that, while a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-multichannel-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-channel marketing strategy </a>is important, you’ll ideally want some of those channels to be involved in a cross-channel system.</p>

<a id="right-for-your-business"></a></p>
<h2>Is cross-channel marketing right for you?</h2>
<p>Just as marketing on one channel is better than on no channels, and multi-channel marketing is better than single-channel, cross-channel marketing is ultimately better than multi-channel. It’s right for you if…</p>
<p><strong>You want to maximize your results. </strong>Since cross-channel marketing involves customizing your offers to a person&#8217;s stage in the funnel, their chances of conversion at each of those points is much higher. Plus, this personalized approach helps to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/brand-personality-messaging">make your brand more memorable</a> and increases your chances of<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/18/how-to-follow-up-with-sales-leads"> turning prospects into customers.</a></p>
<p><strong>You’re tight on time. </strong>You read that right! Many people think cross-channel marketing takes a ton of time. But when you unify your efforts across platforms, you can streamline processes like asset creation and reporting.</p>
<p><strong>You’re tight on budget. </strong>Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. If you’re tight on budget you’ll want plenty of opportunities to squeeze the most out of it across platforms, rather than spending it all on one with no results.</p>
<p><strong>You have a busy audience. </strong>Most people are bouncing around many places across the web, with cross-channel marketing you’re catching your audience at every step of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/03/03/sales-funnel">sales funnel.</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cross-channel-marketing-sales-funnel-then-and-now.jpg" alt="cross-channel marketing - example of sales funnel differences then and now" width="720" height="520" class="aligncenter wp-image-62125 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cross-channel-marketing-sales-funnel-then-and-now.jpg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cross-channel-marketing-sales-funnel-then-and-now-480x347.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Cross-channel marketing helps you meet the needs of the ever-changing sales funnel. </em></p>
<p><a id="benefits"></a></p>
<h2>Benefits of cross-channel marketing</h2>
<p>While we touched on some of the pros to cross-channel marketing above, you may also want to consider these statistics when deciding if this strategy is right for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>The average consumer needs to interact with a brand at least <a href="https://www.b2bmarketing.net/en/resources/blog/marketing-rule-7-and-why-its-still-relevant-b2b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven times</a> before they become a customer. Cross-channel marketing helps you to make each of those encounters super-relevant, potentially even reducing the number of encounters needed..</li>
<li><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-cross-channel-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">87%</a> of consumers want brands to provide more consistent experiences. With multi-channel marketing, your content is siloed for each platform. Whereas with cross-channel marketing, you’ll be able to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/01/brand-strategy"> provide a seamless brand experience</a> throughout the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-the-buyers-journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buyer’s journey</a>.</li>
<li>Brands using three or more marketing channels see a<a href="https://www.adroll.com/blog/4-cross-channel-marketing-stats-and-what-they-mean-for-brands#:~:text=Companies%20with%20strong%20cross%2Dchannel,rely%20on%20only%20one%20channel." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 287%</a> higher conversion rate.</li>
<li>Businesses that engage with people across multiple channels see nearly <a href="https://www.adroll.com/blog/4-cross-channel-marketing-stats-and-what-they-mean-for-brands#:~:text=Companies%20with%20strong%20cross%2Dchannel,rely%20on%20only%20one%20channel." target="_blank" rel="noopener">90%</a> of their customers returning for more later. This means that cross-channel marketing can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/18/loyalty-marketing">increase your brand loyalty</a> over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly, cross-channel marketing is a non-negotiable when it comes to reaching your marketing goals.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cross-channel-marketing-stats.jpg" alt="cross-channel marketing - stat callouts" width="720" height="520" class="aligncenter wp-image-62127 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cross-channel-marketing-stats.jpg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cross-channel-marketing-stats-480x347.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /><br />
<a id="number-of-channels"></a></p>
<h2>How many channels should your cross-channel marketing include?</h2>
<p>A question I often get asked is, “How many channels are<em> enough </em>channels?” This question is completely valid, as most brands are looking to squeeze the most out of limited resources, though you probably can guess what I’m about to say: there is no right or wrong answer.</p>
<p>Giving a set blanket number of channels for all business types wouldn’t make sense, as each organization has a unique set of goals and challenges. What it really comes down to is how able you are to connect those channels with one another and integrate them into your marketing system.</p>
<p>Even still, you might have multi-channel efforts happening alongside your cross-channel efforts—as it&#8217;s not be possible to connect every single channel and effort. So if you&#8217;re not sure how many <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/29/ad-channels">ad channels</a> to use, here are some things to consider:</p>
<h3>Budget</h3>
<p>Your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/10/26/marketing-budget">marketing budget</a> will determine how much or how little you may be able to put towards each of your desired channels.</p>
<p>This is not to say that those with monster marketing budgets should be blasting themselves across as many channels as possible, or that<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/09/free-and-low-budget-marketing-ideas"> lower budget marketing</a> equates to fewer channels. Think more about how you’ll allocate budget towards each channel depending on your needs.</p>
<p>If you need help calculating this, we have plenty of resources on it like this<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> post on creating your marketing budget</a>. However, a good rule of thumb is that<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/19/digital-marketing-statistics"> 5-10%</a> of your revenue should go towards your marketing budget. For larger businesses, that number could climb to 14% or higher.</p>
<h3>Audience</h3>
<p>Picture your ideal customer when you’re picking your channels. How many channels do <em>they</em> use? What does their day-to-day lifestyle look like? Where do they live, and how old are they?</p>
<p>Asking yourself exploratory questions like this about your audience can help you determine how many channels you need in order to effectively reach them at each step of the way.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cross-channel-marketing-audience-analysis-chart.jpg" alt="cross-channel marketing - chart of audience considerations for a cross-channel marketing strategy" width="720" height="520" class="aligncenter wp-image-62128 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cross-channel-marketing-audience-analysis-chart.jpg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cross-channel-marketing-audience-analysis-chart-480x347.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>Your business’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/15/marketing-objectives">marketing objectives </a>will also impact how many channels you choose. For example, if you’re looking to<a href="https://localiq.com/localiq-grader?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> increase your online presence</a>, you may need to add social media as an additional channel for your strategy—even if you’ve never tried it before.</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>Time will also be a factor because, at the end of the day, one individual or team can only do so much. However, you may have other tools at hand that can make cross-channel management easier.</p>
<p>See if you might have a way to summarize your reporting across channels, or if there are any platforms you can use to send out multiple marketing assets at once. These<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/30/productivity-tools"> time-saving tools </a>can help you to do more with less.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cross-channel-marketing-client-center-dashboard.png" alt="cross-channel marketing - example of a cross-channel reporting dashboard" width="800" height="474" class="aligncenter wp-image-62129 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cross-channel-marketing-client-center-dashboard.png 800w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cross-channel-marketing-client-center-dashboard-480x284.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>CRMs like LOCALiQ’s </em><a href="https://localiq.com/reporting-analytics/client-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Client Center</em></a><em> allow you to streamline reporting on many platforms with one dashboard. </em></p>
<p>As you can imagine, answers to the above are going to look different for everyone. If you’re still stuck and need a number of channels to start with, here’s what I’ll say: pick your top three. This will allow you to still be using multiple channels to see what works, as opposed to only using one or two, and you can always add on from there.<br />

<h2>How to create a cross-channel marketing strategy</h2>
<p>You might be wondering: is cross-channel marketing easy to achieve? Short answer: yes. You<em> can</em> do it all! Here are our ten tips to finding cross-channel marketing success for your business:</p>
<h3>1. Map out your customer journey</h3>
<p>Before you dive into cross-channel marketing, it’s important to get a bird’s eye view of your sales funnel. Understanding your consumers’ behavior at each step of the buyer’s journey will help you to identify which offers best align with each stage.</p>
<p>Look at historical data and information your business may have on how past customers may have converted. You could also leverage your audience analysis to put yourself in your customers’ shoes and brainstorm the steps they may take to ultimately commit to your business.</p>
<p>Not only will this help you tailor your cross-channel marketing to specific scenarios throughout the customer journey, but it will also help you to narrow down which channels are best (more on this next).</p>
<h3>2. Have an offer funnel</h3>
<p>The key to cross-channel marketing is aligning your offers with each stage of the funnel. Someone at the top of your funnel is more likely to be open to a guide on how to do something than a demo on how to use your product. Or even within the guide category, they may be more receptive to a high-level overview on something than a more technical one on ways to do it.</p>
<p>So be sure to map out different offers and topics to the stages of your customer journey. This will look different for every business, but here&#8217;s a loose example:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cross-channel-marketing-offer-funnel.png" alt="corss-channel marketing offer funnel" width="421" height="467" class="aligncenter wp-image-62187" /></p>
<h3>3. Choose your channels</h3>
<p>Using our guidelines above may have helped you narrow down the <em>number</em> of channels you’ll be looking to use, so now it’s a matter of <em>which</em> channels. Here at WordStream, we believe in working smarter, not harder. Your best bet would be to pick channels that will work better together to maximize your results.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/22/combine-ppc-with-social-media">search marketing and social media marketing</a> complement one another. When someone sees your posts pop up on social, that may trigger them to search for you later to learn more.</p>
<p>Think back to your ideal <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/23/buyer-personas">buyer persona</a> to understand which channels they may be hitting the most frequently, and that should help you uncover which ones are best for your business.</p>
<p>To help get you started, here are some possible channels to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://localiq.com/website-grader/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Website</a></li>
<li>SEO</li>
<li>PPC</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">Social media marketing</a></li>
<li>Social media advertising</li>
<li>Display advertising</li>
<li>Remarketing</li>
<li>Print ads</li>
<li>Email marketing</li>
<li>Mailers</li>
<li>Geofencing</li>
<li>Live chat</li>
<li>Messaging apps</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/09/what-ott-advertising">OTT advertising</a></li>
<li>Video marketing</li>
<li>Content marketing</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cross-channel-marketing-channels-list.jpg" alt="cross-channel marketing - chart of channels to consider for a cross-channel marketing strategy" width="720" height="480" class="aligncenter wp-image-62135 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cross-channel-marketing-channels-list.jpg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cross-channel-marketing-channels-list-480x320.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>4. Take inventory of your costs</h3>
<p>Be ready to be flexible with your budget as you implement cross-channel marketing. The performance of your channels might ebb and flow, so you may need to reallocate your budgets accordingly.</p>
<p>To help you get a sense of how much to spend on each channel, use<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/18/search-advertising-benchmarks"> industry benchmarks</a> to estimate costs. Check in on these reports frequently to troubleshoot your spend or to see how your business stacks up throughout your marketing journey.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe height="644" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="Search Advertising Benchmarks" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-yhYoP" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/yhYoP/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Using industry benchmarks</em><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/online-advertising-benchmarks"><em> like these </em></a><em>can help you keep your cross-channel budget in check.</em></p>
<h3>5. Have a set of overarching goals</h3>
<p>While each channel may achieve different things, having a couple of “big picture” goals can help you to unify your efforts. It can be easy to get bogged down in the deep performance details of each channel. Overarching goals help to hold yourself accountable for keeping your channels on track for success.</p>
<h3>6. Use a CRM</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/09/crm-for-small-business">customer relationship management</a> (CRM) tool can work wonders for your cross-channel marketing. As your prospects’ behavior evolves, a CRM will allow you to track those changes and recognize broader trends in the customer journey. It will also make it easy for you to segment your campaign audiences so you can customize your offers.</p>
<p>CRMs can also make major cross-channel initiatives, like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/17/retargeting-campaign-tips">retargeting</a>, a breeze.</p>
<h3>7. Use retargeting</h3>
<p>Speaking of which, retargeting is a must-have for any cross-channel marketing strategy. There are a number of<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/17/remarketing-audiences"> retargeting audiences</a> you can try out. For example, you might run a retargeting Facebook ad for a product that someone added to their cart but did not purchase. Or you might run a specific promotion for your most loyal customers.</p>
<h3>8. Button up your tracking</h3>
<p>Be sure you implement tracking parameters across every channel you leverage in your cross-channel marketing strategy. Not only will this allow you to see how each channel, offer, and placement is working, but it will also allow you to set rules in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/05/b2b-marketing-automation-tactics">marketing automation</a>. For example, if a person downloads guide X, show them thank you page A with offer B.</p>
<p>The naming convention you use for tracking is completely up to you—what’s most important is you have an easy and reliable way to consistently know how your performance is pacing across channels.</p>
<p>And on a related note, make sure you resolve all your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/24/google-ads-conversion-tracking">conversion tracking hangups</a> for search engine marketing as this can make or break your campaigns.</p>
<h3>9. Use multi-touch attribution</h3>
<p>Attribution modeling determines how the different channels involved in a customer’s journey will be credited.</p>
<p>For cross-channel marketing, it’s best to go with one that falls under the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/15/multi-touch-attribution">multi-touch attribution </a>umbrella. Since you’ll be encouraging customers to take specific actions across channels, you’ll want to see the impact your campaigns have on the entire customer journey. Multi-touch attribution modeling helps you to do so by using data across channels to weight certain actions more than others.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cross-channel-marketing-multi-touch-attribution-chart.jpg" alt="cross-channel marketing - example of multi-touch attribution models" width="720" height="520" class="aligncenter wp-image-62136 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cross-channel-marketing-multi-touch-attribution-chart.jpg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cross-channel-marketing-multi-touch-attribution-chart-480x347.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>10. Keep your reporting all in one place</h3>
<p>To make cross-channel marketing more manageable and effective, unify your reporting efforts. Use free tools like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/05/15/google-analytics-tips">Google Analytics</a> to understand how your platforms are performing in one space. Not only does this save you time, but it also helps you to understand how all your channels are performing both against and in concert one another.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cross-channel-marketing-google-analytics-channel-map-example.jpg" alt="cross-channel marketing - example of google analytics channel mapping" width="720" height="303" class="aligncenter wp-image-62137 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cross-channel-marketing-google-analytics-channel-map-example.jpg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cross-channel-marketing-google-analytics-channel-map-example-480x202.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here is one example of how Google Analytics displays success by channel in multiple different ways. </em></p>
<h3>11. Try nurture email campaigns</h3>
<p>While it’s great you have cross-channel materials at the ready to move customers along in their journey, some people may need a bit more of a nudge than others.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/30/lead-nurturing-campaign-emails">Targeted email marketing</a> is a great go-to for this situation since you can segment out your lists and offers accordingly. You could even<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/01/automated-email-marketing"> automate your emails</a> to send once someone completes a specific step in your funnel.</p>
<p>This is an easy default strategy to boost your cross-channel marketing and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/07/customer-engagement-strategy">keep customers engaged</a>.</p>
<h3>12. Be patient</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/24/cross-channel-marketing-mistakes">hardest part of cross-channel marketing</a> is patience! Some channels may bring you results more quickly than others. This is precisely why choosing a variety of channels is so important.</p>
<p>One channel, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/21/how-to-run-google-ads">PPC advertising</a>, may help you reach your business’s short-term goals while others, like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/12/27/eleven-seo-tips-for-local-search-optimization">local SEO</a>, will bring you results in the long term. Treating your cross-channel marketing like a living, breathing project that’s ongoing will help you to set realistic expectations and make the most of your results along the way.</p>
<h2>Cross-channel marketing is easier than you think</h2>
<p>Many don’t consider successful cross-channel marketing feasible for their business. However, this complete cross-channel marketing guide proves that it can be a viable strategy for anyone. With a bit of self-evaluation, patience, and the help of online tools or platforms, your cross-channel marketing strategy can help you to gain and retain customers for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/12/growth-marketing">sustainable business growth. </a></p>

<h2>The best paid advertising strategies for 2022</h2>
<p>It should be no surprise here that each of these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/10/paid-media-strategy">paid media strategies</a> is focused on privacy. But don&#8217;t forget about the tried-and-true best practices here, like having a<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/the-last-guide-to-google-ads-account-structure-youll-ever-need"> strong account structure</a> and using a<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/24/cross-channel-marketing-mistakes"> cross-channel strategy</a> (not just multi-channel).<br />
<a id="leadads"></a></p>
<h3>1. Use Facebook lead ads to collect zero-party data</h3>
<p>Third-party cookies, which are in their final days, allow ad platforms to string lots of different data together into insights—both on your audience or to provide custom audiences to target—with respect to their hobbies, occupation, income, marital status, inner thoughts and more. Just kidding on that last one (but am I?).</p>
<p>And if you’re thinking <i>hey, that sounds a lot like Facebook ad targeting options</i>, you’re right.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/lead-qualification-google-lead-ad-custom-questions.png" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49760" width="400" height="455" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/lead-qualification-google-lead-ad-custom-questions.png 400w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/lead-qualification-google-lead-ad-custom-questions-264x300.png 264w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>This is information people give out in their public profiles and activity. And as such, Facebook lead ads—where the form can auto-populate based on the user’s profile, and where a user might feel more inclined to give out that information—are suddenly more appealing now.</p>
<p>When given directly by the user, it’s called zero-party data—the purest and most pristine data in all the land.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-third-party-vs-zero-party-data.png" alt="third-party vs zero-party data meme" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55695" width="720" height="266" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-third-party-vs-zero-party-data.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-third-party-vs-zero-party-data-480x177.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>You won’t know how much you don’t know about your audience until third-party cookies are gone, and by then it will be too late.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So start <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/12/first-party-data">collecting first [and zero]-party data</a> now. To use Facebook lead ads in this manner in 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a look at these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/24/facebook-lead-ad-examples">Facebook lead ad examples</a> to get familiar with them.</li>
<li>Create custom questions to better qualify your leads. You have short answer, multiple choice, conditional, store locators, and appointment scheduling options.</li>
<li>Follow our tips on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/24/facebook-lead-ads">how to create Facebook lead ads that convert.</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-advertising?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FBGrader_FBGrader"><em>You can also use our Free Facebook Ads Performance Grader to find and fix missed opportunities.</em></a><br />
<a id="fbsources"></a></p>
<h3>2. Create custom Facebook Page audiences</h3>
<p>Here’s another underdog strategy.</p>
<p>When creating a custom audience in Facebook Ads, you can target users based on their interaction with your sources (like your website, customer list, app activity, offline activity) after clicking an ad, or with Facebook sources (your videos, lead forms, Facebook Page, and more).</p>
<p>Historically, “Your Sources” has been the popular pick, but with the Facebook pixel losing power and website data losing accuracy, “Facebook Sources” are coming in for the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/13/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-world">privacy-friendly Facebook ad targeting</a> win.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-tables-haev-turned-meme.jpeg" alt="how the tables have turned meme" class="aligncenter wp-image-55553" width="366" height="211" /></p>
<p>Remember, iOS users can prevent Facebook from tracking them outside of the app, so the data you see in Ads Manager is incomplete. And incomplete data can actually be worse than no data at all if it leads you in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Incomplete data can be worse than no data at all if it leads you in the wrong direction.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your best bet with Facebook advertising this year is to switch over to Facebook&#8217;s sources.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-facebook-sources.png" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50565" width="600" height="426" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-facebook-sources.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-facebook-sources-480x341.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You can even retarget users who have filled out your lead form. But the Facebook Page activity option in particular is key. Here, you can treat Page visitors just as you would treat your website visitors, serving them particular ads based on whether they:</p>
<ul>
<li>Liked, followed, or engaged with your Page</li>

<h3>3. Prep for expanded text ads takeoff</h3>
<p>The ETD for ETAs is June 30, 2022 <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2708.png" alt="✈" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>After this day, you will not be able to edit or create new expanded text ads (ETAS), and responsive search ads (RSAs) will be the only standard search ad you can create. We <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/02/google-sunsetting-expanded-text-ads">cover the story here</a>.</p>
<p>What this does <strong>not</strong> mean is that you should stop creating ETAs now and wait until June to run responsive search ads (RSAs).</p>
<p>What this <strong>does</strong> mean is that you should do these things now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Test and create ETAs that you want to continue running after June 30 (they’ll still run, you will just only be able to pause or run them).</li>
<li>Make use of the granular reporting with ETAs while you can.</li>
<li>Start running RSAs now so you can set new benchmarks.</li>
<li>Learn how to pin strategically</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Run Performance Max campaigns</h3>
<p>Performance Max campaigns jumped out of beta and into the hands of all advertisers at the end of 2021. These campaign types offer the automation benefits of Smart campaigns, the dynamic nature of responsive ads, and the multi-placement targeting of social ads—all in one.</p>
<p>The reason why they will be important to familiarize with in 2023 is that <strong>Smart Shopping and Local campaigns will be folded into Performance Max this year</strong> (not to mention the direction we’re inevitably headed with automation in Google Ads).</p>
<p>With Performance Max, you provide one set of assets (images, videos, logos, headlines, etc.) and Google will mix and match those assets to show ads across all of its channels, including Search (which includes Shopping and Local), Display, Discover, Maps, Gmail, and YouTube.</p>

<h3>5. Improve conversion tracking with Google Ads enhanced conversions</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/08/google-floc">Google is working on FLoC</a>, but in the meantime, Google Ads has provided us with enhanced conversions. This feature provides the third-party cookie benefit of cross-device <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/24/google-ads-conversion-tracking">conversion tracking</a>, without the third-party cookies. How so? Your first-party data about your website visitors (such as their email addresses and phone number) will get sent to Google (in hashed form). Google will then look for Google accounts that match that information and gather <em>its</em> first-party [which is cross-device] data on those users and transmit it back to you in hashed, aggregated, and anonymous form. Now you have insights on your ad clickers&#8217; behavior (their logged in Google account behavior, at least) before and after your Google ads.</p>

<h2>The best SEO strategies for 2023</h2>
<p>Just some general housekeeping: Creating useful, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/12/google-e-a-t">E-A-T</a>, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/29/fresh-content-google-ranking-factor">fresh</a> content that answers your audience&#8217;s questions is and always will be the best SEO strategy. Period.</p>
<p><a id="mum"></a></p>
<h3>6. MUMify your content</h3>
<p>In May of 2021, <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/introducing-mum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google introduced us to MUM</a>—Multitask Unified Model. The goal of this search technology is to reduce the number of queries a person has to perform. So <strong>instead of performing multiple searches</strong>, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>“How to prepare to hike mount fuji,” and then</li>
<li>“Mount adams vs mount fuji hiking,” and then</li>
<li>&#8220;Weather in mt fuji in the fall&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&#8230;a person can ask Google a question in the same way they&#8217;d ask a human. </strong></p>
<p>“I’ve hiked Mt. Adams and now want to hike Mt. Fuji next fall, what should I do differently to prepare?”</p>
<p>Google will then build a result that answers all of that, which could be comprised of different sources and media formats. On top of that, MUM knows 75 different languages, so if the best answer to that question is in Russian, Google can now connect that information to the searcher.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-google-mum-search-results.png" alt="best marketing strategies for 2022 - google mum search result mockup" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55629" width="720" height="381" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-google-mum-search-results.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-google-mum-search-results-480x254.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Pretty crazy, right?</p>
<p><strong>And totally not something that will happen in 2023.</strong></p>
<p>So why is it in this post? Because for MUM means following the same SEO best practices we&#8217;ve harped on for years. So basically, this is just a cool new way to tell you to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Write long-form content that targets long-tail question keywords.</strong> No, do not target complex questions like the one above. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/09/18/best-keyword-research-tools">These keyword research tools</a> will help you.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-long-form-content.png" alt="long form content meme" class="aligncenter wp-image-55782" width="725" height="356" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-long-form-content.png 1695w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-long-form-content-300x147.png 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-long-form-content-1024x503.png 1024w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-long-form-content-768x377.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /></li>
<li><strong>Organize your content. </strong>Organize your H2s and H3s accordingly so Google can surface results (more on this shortly).</li>
<li><strong>Diversify your content.</strong> MUM can source answers from text, pictures, videos, and more, so create different media for evergreen topics that can start building traffic and authority now.</li>
<li><strong>Use structured data.</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/15/what-is-schema-markup">Schema markup</a> helps Google to clearly understand the information and information types you are providing.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Optimize for</strong></strong> [ <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f62c.png" alt="😬" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> cringe <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f62c.png" alt="😬" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> cringe <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f62c.png" alt="😬" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> cringe]<strong><strong> voice search. </strong></strong>I know I know. It’s been in every marketing trends list for the past three years. But it’s true. No one is going to type that long question above into a search bar. They’re going to speak it. So you’ve got to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/14/google-voice-search">optimize for voice search.</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a id="clipmarkup"></a></p>
<h3>7. Video schema</h3>
<p>Speakin&#8217; o&#8217; schema&#8230;Google dropped two new video schema markup types in 2021: Click markup and Seek markup—the former of which allows you to create and communicate your own timestamps in your videos to Google Search results.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve probably seen Clip markup in action if you&#8217;ve Googled a &#8220;how to&#8221; query and got a crazy specific video result like below:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-video-seo-clip-markup.png" alt="best marketing strategies of 2022 - video clip markup in the SERP" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55679" width="720" height="298" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-video-seo-clip-markup.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-video-seo-clip-markup-480x199.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>We know that YouTube is one of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">most popular social media platforms</a>. We know that video is the way to go. And we know that schema is MUM-friendly. So video schema should be in your 2023 SEO strategy. No ifs, ands, or buts.

<a id="passageranking"></a></p>
<h3>8. Optimize for passage ranking (sort of)</h3>
<p>This comes from Brian Deans&#8217; <a href="https://backlinko.com/seo-this-year">Guide to SEO in 2023</a> and fair warning: It&#8217;s yet another cool new 2023 way of telling you to do something we&#8217;ve been telling you to do for years.</p>
<p>With the passage ranking update, Google can now consider not just the relevancy of a page—but also a section of content within a page—to a given query. So <strong>all of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/09/google-ranking-factors">regular Google ranking factors</a> still apply</strong>, but your pages now have even more opportunities to show up on the good old [and by old I mean at the leading edge of search technology] <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/19/get-on-first-page-google">first page of Google.</a></p>
<p>The best way to optimize for passage ranking? Use your H2s and H3s to organize your post into crystal clear sections. Each of your H2s should cover a specific subtopic (which should happen naturally if your H2s are different long-tail variations on the target keyword).</p>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-passage-ranking-optimization-H2-h3-headers-seo.png" alt="best marketing strategies 2022 - h2 and h3s for passage ranking seo optimization" class="aligncenter wp-image-55696" width="385" height="628" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Illustration inspired by Brian&#8217;s.</em></p>
<p>For example, in my post on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/19/get-on-first-page-google">How to Get on the First Page of Google</a>, I have several separate sections, indicated by H2s (not all shown in the illustration above).</p>
<ol>
<li>Why is the first page of Google important</li>
<li>Benefits of getting on the first page of Google</li>
<li>How to use your website to get on the first page of Google</li>
<li>How to use your business listings to get on the first page of Google</li>
<li>How to get on the first page of Google [recap]</li>
</ol>
<p>So instead of just having just one H2 with 10 H3s, I have five H2s with 10 H3s. Not only does this give me several opportunities to put the keyword in an H2, but it also 1) makes the content more digestible and 2) creates those discreet sections Brian recommends.</p>
<p>If you know <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/30/seo-basics">SEO basics,</a> you should already be doing this. But you might want to do an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/20/seo-audit">seo audit</a> to find opportunities to do this elsewhere.</p>

<h3>9. Technical SEO [the easy kind]</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/01/17/seo-content-beginners-guide">The content side of SEO</a> is supreme, but with the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/19/core-web-vitals-google-page-experience-update">page experience update</a> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/15/mobile-first-indexing">mobile-first indexing</a> of 2021 <em>and</em> the tools we have available today, there&#8217;s plenty you can do on your own in terms of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/28/technical-seo">technical SEO</a>. If you&#8217;re unfamiliar, a new set of ranking factors called Core Web Vitals came out last year with the page experience update.</p>
<p><strong>Core Web Vitals in plain English:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LCP (Largest contentful paint) = How long it takes the largest content asset on a page to load.</li>
<li>FID (First input delay) = How long it takes for your site to register a user&#8217;s first tap or click on your page.</li>
<li>CLS (Cumulative layout shift) = How stable the page is (i.e. are there any unexpected movements on the page like elements shifting around when you pinch/zoom/scroll, disruptive popups, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/16/how-to-use-google-search-console">use Google Search Console</a> to check your Core Web Vitals. Many of the recommendations for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/02/improve-core-web-vitals">improving your Core Web Vitals</a> will require a developer, but..</p>
<p><strong>Here are some technical SEO optimizations for 2023 that you can do on your own:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Compress images using a free compressor tool (Tinypng.com is my absolute favorite).</li>
<li>Resize your images so they are not wider than the maximum column width of your site.</li>
<li>Implement comment moderation for your blog to prevent spammy links.</li>

<h3>10. Social local SEO</h3>
<p>The thing about the vast audiences on social media is that they&#8217;re not just audiences. They&#8217;re also posting their own content, forever increasing the size of the whirlpool your content can get lost in. Organic reach just keeps getting further and further, well, out of reach.</p>
<p>Apart from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/02/reasons-to-advertise-on-social-media">social media advertising</a>, a local approach is one of the best ways to stand out on social to who those who matter most to your business—whether on Facebook, LinkedIn, Snapchat, and more.</p>
<p>We actually have a whole course dedicated to <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/local-social-media-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local social media marketing</a> but here are some starter tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Treat your profiles like listings (Facebook especially—it&#8217;s one of the top online business directories).</li>
<li>Add your business to Facebook Places so you (and others) can tag your location in posts.</li>
<li>Use location-based hashtags on Instagram and Twitter.</li>
<li>Share local news articles on Facebook.</li>
<li>Share industry insights from influencers in your geographic community on LinkedIn.</li>
</ul>

<h3>11. Shoppable live streams</h3>
<p>Now this is one of the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/2022-digital-marketing-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2023 digital marketing trends</a> that might feel too far off to you, but it&#8217;s not. Not only is live streamed content growing, but it generates <a href="https://bloggingwizard.com/live-streaming-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">27%</a> more minutes of watch time per viewing than on-demand video. On top of that, Instagram—which already revolutionized the online shopping experience with shoppable posts, Stories, and Reels—launched shoppable Lives in September, making this marketing strategy easier than ever.</p>
<p>To create an Instagram Live Shopping session, here&#8217;s what to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up a Facebook or Instagram shop and enable Instagram checkout.</li>
<li>Make sure products are in your catalog three days before you go live.</li>
<li>Tap on &#8220;Your Story,&#8221; select &#8220;Live,&#8221; and then find the shopping bag icon.</li>
<li>Add products from your catalog.</li>
<li>When you&#8217;re ready, go live and then use that same icon to pin items to your video.</li>
<li>Save your live video—users can still shop from the saved version<br />

<h3>12. No, not TikTok</h3>
<p>So here&#8217;s the thing about TikTok. As a social media platform, it&#8217;s big. Very big. As a social media marketing platform, <strong>it&#8217;s not all that great.</strong></p>
<p>YET.</p>
<p>But the Tok is not going to conform to<a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/local-social-media-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> social media marketing.</a> <strong>Social media marketing will conform to the Tok.</strong> I mean, Instagram told us over the summer that It is now looking to shift focus to <em>&#8220;full screen, immersive, entertaining, mobile-first video&#8221;</em> content. In other words, TikTokitize itself.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you need to start marketing or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/22/tiktok-ads">advertising on TikTok</a> (although if your audience includes entertainment-seeking teens with a good sense of rhythm, then yes, you do). What it does mean is you need to have a <strong>TikTok-inspired content strategy</strong>. And what does that mean?<br />
I&#8217;ll give you one hint:</p>
<ul></ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/most-popular-social-media-platforms-tiktok-entertainment.png" alt="best marketing strategies for 2022 - tiktok used for entertainment" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55632" width="600" height="468" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/most-popular-social-media-platforms-tiktok-entertainment.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/most-popular-social-media-platforms-tiktok-entertainment-480x374.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Entertainment. </em></p>
<p>Short, entertaining content. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Short clips.</strong> Think Instagram Reels (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/22/instagram-reels-ideas-for-businesses">18 Reels ideas here</a>) and YouTube Shorts (learn about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/29/promote-your-business-on-youtube">YouTube shorts here</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Humor.</strong> Be funny. Share your bloopers or angle your posts around a fun theme. (<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/social-media-holidays/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tons of creative social media holidays here.</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Quality. </strong>You can still be entertaining while being practical, educational, and on-brand.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>You don&#8217;t need to market on TikTok (unless your audience fits the bill), but you do need to have a TikTok-inspired content strategy.</p></blockquote>

<h2>The best email marketing strategies for 2023</h2>
<p>While SEO and PPC hit some turbulent patches last year, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/01/email-marketing-tips">email marketing</a> was just cruising along, living its best life. That is, until Q4 when Apple dropped the MPP bomb on us&#8230;<br />
<a id="openrates"></a></p>
<h3>13. Close the door on open rates</h3>
<p>For the uninitiated, MPP stands for Mail Privacy Protection, which rolled out with the Apple iOS 15 update. With this feature iOS users can block your ability to gather accurate open data (i.e., if, when, where, or how many times they opened your marketing emails). In short, Apple will open a user&#8217;s email, regardless—in a proxy server—so that any tracking pixels in the email download there, and not the user&#8217;s device. Then, if a user decides to open the email, they will be opening the cached version.</p>
<p>Email tracking software can&#8217;t distinguish between proxied and non-proxied opens. The result? Inflated open rates and missing or incorrect open data (like location, time of open, number of times opened, and more). <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/12/27/email-marketing-ios15">We share iOS 15-friendly email marketing strategies here</a>, but the key takeaways are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A/B test elements in the <strong>body</strong> of your emails, <strong>not subject lines.</strong></li>
<li>If you do test <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/31/email-subject-lines">subject lines</a>, declare winners based on something like click-through rate or purchases (not open rate).</li>
<li>Nix any email flows or dynamic content campaigns that are based on open-related data and rebuild them based on other <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/28/trigger-emails">triggers</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-no-more-email-countdown-timers.png" alt="best marketing strategies for 2022 - no more countdown timers in emails" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55636" width="500" height="585" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-no-more-email-countdown-timers.png 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-no-more-email-countdown-timers-480x562.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Proxied opens due to Mail Privacy Protection will tell you that your user opened your email even if they didn&#8217;t. Not good.</p></blockquote>
<p><a id="preferencecenters"></a></p>
<h3>14. Email preference centers</h3>
<p>Now we know that open data isn&#8217;t everything, but it still can tell us a lot about our audience—where they&#8217;re located, what types of content and topics they like, when they&#8217;re most likely to read your email, how frequently they want to receive emails from you, and more.</p>
<p>But there is a workaround. Instead of gleaning these insights, you can ask your audience themselves. When they sign up for your emails, create a preference center so you can get it directly from the [audience member]&#8217;s mouth.</p>
<p>You can even use them as a part of your unsubscribe flow.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-unsubscribe-center.png" alt="best marketing strategies for 2022 - email preference centers" class="aligncenter wp-image-55638" width="568" height="391" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-unsubscribe-center.png 568w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-unsubscribe-center-480x330.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 568px, 100vw" /><br />
<a id="plaintextemails"></a></p>
<h3>15. Plain text emails</h3>
<p>So plain text isn&#8217;t a retro trend (like the early aughts in our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/04/landing-page-trends">2023 landing page trends</a>). You should still send out branded, HTML emails but you should also send out a plain text version along with it. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>Plain text-dependent devices are ever on the rise, like smartwatches, voice assistants, and screen readers.</li>
<li>Spam filters really want to see that plain text.</li>
<li>Some people do, in fact, prefer them. They&#8217;re simpler, they load faster, and you can see all of the links it contains right there in front of you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most email automation platforms will give you the option to generate a plain text version of your email, but you&#8217;ll still need to optimize it. Here are some tips and an image example, courtesy of <a href="https://www.litmus.com/blog/best-practices-for-plain-text-emails-a-look-at-why-theyre-important/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Litmus:</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Use all caps or symbols to separate sections.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t add linebreaks to keep the text narrow. The text should resize to fit the screen of any device.</li>
<li>Do add linebreaks to separate sections with whitespace.</li>
<li>Use hyphens to create bullets.</li>
<li>Keep links to a minimum.</li>
</ul>

<a id="content"></a></p>
<h2>The best content marketing strategies for 2023</h2>
<p>The TLDR for this section? Pretend you&#8217;re a hipster content restaurant. Make lots of content. Content that is delicious-looking (attractive), easy to digest (skimmable), free of fillers (fluff and words you can&#8217;t pronounce) satisfies your readers (quality and interesting information), and suitable for different preferences and requirements (accessible). Here are three ways to make that happen.<br />
<a id="multimedia"></a></p>
<h3>16. Meaningful. Multimedia. Meta. ← (not the metaverse)</h3>
<p>We know that it’s important to break up the text in your blog posts with images, but there’s a right and a wrong way to do it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Your images should be such that if they&#8217;re the only thing the reader looks at in the post, they can still get value from it.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaningful images: </strong>Nix the empty stock images and graphics in your blog posts. Your images should be such that your reader can get value if images are the only thing they look at. Illustrate the concept, visualize the data, provide a real-life example, or (my favorite) make a meme analogy (<a href="https://promo.com/tools/meme-maker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">super cool tool to create memes here</a>).<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-meaningful-images.png" alt="best marketing strategies for 2022 - example of meaningful visual" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55681" width="600" height="422" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-meaningful-images.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-meaningful-images-480x338.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An image depicting the surrounding text on this page, of an image depicting the surrounding text of a page. </em><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f92f.png" alt="🤯" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A multimedia approach:</strong> Don’t just use images. Add videos (maybe the short clips you created from strategy #12?), podcasts, and more to your posts (more on this in a moment). Not only do people have different preferences on different channels, but MUM is going to allow Google to surface information across multiple media formats. So you can add value now while also building SEO equity for the future.</li>
<li><strong>Meta:</strong> Sit back down, metaverse, with your augmented reality and virtual nonsense. <strong>We’re referring to just plain old SEO metadata here.</strong> Use your meta tags and schema markup to clearly spell out for Google what you’re saying and in what form. This will improve your SEO and make your content MUM-friendly.</li>
</ul>
<p><a id="accessibility"></a></p>
<h3>17. Accessible &amp; inclusive content</h3>
<p>The other reason to use metadata? Accessibility. Title tags, H1s, H2s, and image alt text are all used by screen readers so that those with visual impairments won&#8217;t just hear what&#8217;s on a page, but understand it.</p>
<p>Some accessibility tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>For visual impairment: Use meta tags (as just mentioned), proper color contrast, and font size for those with visual impairments.</li>
<li>For cognitive or reading impairments: Use images to convey information</li>
<li>For hearing impairments: Include the transcripts or key takeaways of a podcast or video.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-accessible-website-example.png" alt="best marketing strategiges 2022 - accessible website example" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55740" width="720" height="420" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-accessible-website-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-accessible-website-example-480x280.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And accessibility is just one way of making your content more inclusive. You&#8217;ll also want to represent all races and abilities in not just your visuals, but in the examples and hypotheticals in your blog posts too.<br />
<a id="canva"></a></p>
<h3>18. Use Canva</h3>
<p>Not only will multi-media content help you to store up MUM-friendly content, but it will also keep you competitive. It&#8217;s getting easier and easier to create great content these days, and the more your audience sees it elsewhere, the more they will expect it from you. Which brings me to the next strategy.</p>
<p>For starters, neither WordStream nor I am affiliated with Canva in any way. And I have yet to find a free tool as great as Canva (but if you know of one, let me know in the comments). Hence the super-specific strategy.</p>
<p>Canva is perfect for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marketers who have no design experience.</li>
<li>Small businesses that don&#8217;t have a designer.</li>
<li>Big businesses who wish they could clone their designer (like us).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can make everything with Canva, from email signatures and branded graphics to Facebook ads and Stories templates. And most importantly, you can <strong>mark up images with arrows, labels, and boxes so you can create those meaningful visuals I talked about above</strong>.</p>

<ul></ul>
<blockquote><p>Good visual content is an expectation now. So it&#8217;s no longer great visuals that will make you stand out, but mediocre ones, and not in the way you want.</p></blockquote>
<p><a id="conversationalcopy"></a></p>
<h3>19. Conversational copywriting</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s your final <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/franchise-marketing">marketing strategy</a> summed up in one image:<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-conversational-copywriting.png" alt="best marketing strategies for 2022 - conversational copywriting example" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55685" width="720" height="406" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-conversational-copywriting.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-conversational-copywriting-480x271.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-conversational-copywriting-example-full-size.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Click to enlarge</em></a></p>
<p>And here it is, typed out for SEO purposes and accessibility.</p>
<p><strong>Not conversational</strong></p>
<p>One thing to avoid in 2023 is writing too formally. This means using proper grammar always. It also means not varying sentence length. It also means being repetitive, using complex or boring words, or being too serious. However, it is not hard to learn how to write conversationally. This entails going against traditional grammar, but it will help you to attract customers. Here are some ways to write conversational copy.</p>
<p><strong>Conversational</strong></p>
<p>What&#8217;s the best way to turn off your readers in 2023?</p>
<p>By using corporate blady bla or writing like a robot. Clinging tightly to proper grammar (you&#8217;re gonna have to unlearn some things), using words that are either too fancy or too boring, and taking yourself too seriously. But it’s easy to get the hang of. Here are some handy tips that&#8217;ll get your readers smiling and subscribing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use contractions</li>
<li>Ask questions</li>
<li>Vary sentence length</li>
<li>Make up words</li>
<li>Use interesting (not fancy) words</li>
<li>Put side comments in parentheses</li>
<li>Write incomplete sentences</li>
<li>Start sentences with &#8220;and&#8221; and &#8220;but&#8221;</li>
<li>Be friendly with alliteration, rhyming, puns, and more.</li>
<li>Use emojis</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p>The phrase “cross-channel advertising” can sound intimidating to some folks, but the concept is actually quite simple. While multi-channel marketing uses multiple channels (paid search, organic search, and social media, for example) to reach your audience, cross-channel uses those multiple channels to provide more of a connected experience for your audience. So even as they cross back and forth between channels, they&#8217;re still on one cohesive customer journey.</p>

<p>Cross-channel marketing comes with many benefits, like increased engagement, better insights, and a stronger brand—but that&#8217;s if you do it <em>right</em>. So for today’s post, I’m going to cover seven common cross-channel marketing mistakes to avoid, so you can get the most out of your strategy. They include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Delivering inconsistent messages</li>
<li>Promoting the same offers on every channel</li>
<li>Having the same KPIs for every channel</li>
<li>Being rigid with budget</li>
<li>Creating inconsistent retargeting audiences</li>
<li>Not using a single source of truth for reporting</li>
<li>Ignoring non-converting channels</li>

<p>Advertising across multiple platforms is just one form of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/22/cross-channel-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cross-channel marketing.</a> Let&#8217;s go over the most common mistakes I see with folks advertising across Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, and more—and what to do instead.</p>
<h3>1. Delivering inconsistent messages</h3>
<p>This will be the most basic suggestion I make in this post, but you might be surprised at the number of companies who make this mistake.</p>
<p>No matter if someone is searching for you on Google or Bing, seeing you as they scroll through their Facebook or Instagram feeds, or while they’re catching up on industry news on LinkedIn and Twitter, it&#8217;s imperative that you keep your messaging consistent.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>Let me be clear: You SHOULD tweak your <a href="/blog/ws/2016/03/14/ppc-ad-copywriting">ad copy</a> according to each platform, the audience you&#8217;re targeting on each platform, and where they&#8217;re at in their mental range.</p>
<p>But you should NOT have a <a href="/blog/ws/2016/12/19/adwords-headline-formulas">Google headline</a> that says all products are 15% off first purchase while Facebook says it’s 10% off. Or a <a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/05/linkedin-advertising">LinkedIn ad</a> that says you’re rated #1 on G2 Crowd but a Twitter ad that says you&#8217;re #2.  (Again, you might be surprised at the number of folks who do this.)</p>
<p>Bottom line: Don’t confuse your customers.</p>
<h3>2. Running the same offers on every channel</h3>
<p>You know from experience that you’re in a different mindset on Instagram than you are on LinkedIn or when you’re searching on Google. Your audience is no different. So if a particular offer is performing well on Google but not on Facebook, it might not be a problem with your<a href="/blog/ws/2018/08/28/facebook-ad-headlines"> Facebook ad copy</a> or <a href="/blog/ws/2021/06/24/design-facebook-ads-free">creative</a>, but with the offer itself.</p>
<p>Take this LinkedIn ad Litmus is running, for example. They&#8217;re offering their State of Email Service Providers report.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="15113c01-ab87-401b-bc66-6198e17d64bc" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cross-channel-marketing-tip-channel-mindset.png" width="500" height="550" alt="cross-channel marketing tips - linkedin ad by litmus" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Would this offer make sense on Instagram? Not likely. But an <a href="/blog/ws/2021/05/25/email-copywriting-tips">email copywriting </a>cheat sheet might. So find out which offers your audience is interested in on each channel to get the best performance out of each.</p>
<p>If you can get<a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/01/bottom-funnel-conversions"> bottom-funnel conversions </a>like sales or demo requests from Google, but not from Facebook, then accept that. What other conversion actions could you gain benefit from for Facebook? Maybe a lead gen form or a phone call. Maybe you simply want to do audience building and brand awareness.</p>
<p>Be in tune with the actions your <em>audience</em> wants to take on each channel—not what actions <em>you</em> want them to take—and tailor your campaigns accordingly.</p>
<h3>3. Having the same KPIs for each channel</h3>
<p>With a cross-channel advertising strategy, each channel needs to have its own goals and KPIs. <a href="/blog/ws/2019/11/12/facebook-ad-benchmarks">CTR on Facebook</a> will not be the same as LinkedIn. And neither of those will be close to Twitter.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="690537cc-7693-41ee-a234-8c72b2b15f95" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cross-channel-marketing-channel-goals.png" width="720" height="252" alt="cross-channel marketing goals chart" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>The same can be said for your <a href="/blog/ws/2019/08/19/conversion-rate-benchmarks">cost-per-conversion</a> goals. If you know <a href="/blog/ws/2021/07/26/generate-leads-facebook-ads-ios14">leads on Facebook</a> are of lower quality than LinkedIn, you might have a lower acceptable CPA on Facebook. And on the flip side, you might say that LinkedIn leads are so good you’re willing to pay twice the account average for them. The same can be true for ROAS and lifetime value.</p>
<p>Make sure you understand not only the immediate performance goals for each channel, but also the total value (if possible) that each channel generates and set KPIs accordingly.</p>
<h3>4. Being rigid with budget</h3>
<p>So many times clients will come to me and say something like this.</p>
<p>“Our budget is $50,000 this month. We want to spend $20k on Facebook, $25k on Search, $5k on LinkedIn.”</p>
<p>Great. Wonderful. I’m happy you’re prepared for this meeting.</p>
<p>But I always push back on this. It’s nice to be organized, but in any given month, one channel can drastically under or over perform its historical average. If you’re not adjusting and taking advantage of these trends, you’re severely missing out.</p>
<p>It’s fine to say you have a $50k budget and that you want to run ads on Search, Facebook, and LinkedIn and maybe even give ranges of what you think you should start with. But as the month goes on, it’s in your best interest to pay attention to how each channel is doing compared to its average, as well as how efficient they are adding value compared to each other.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="f95989a7-8f9b-4305-8434-4814756088c8" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cross-channel-marketing-budget-ROAS-chart.png" width="720" height="151" alt="example cross-channel PPC budget chart with ROAS" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>If you need to shift $10k to LinkedIn, do it. If you need to pause something entirely, do it. Start with a plan, then be flexible to maximize performance in the time range you’re given.</p>
<h3>5. Creating inconsistent retargeting audiences</h3>
<p>On nearly every online marketing channel you can target users on, you can create<a href="/blog/ws/2018/09/04/facebook-retargeting"> retargeting audiences</a>. These will differ from platform to platform, but you can mostly cover the same ground.</p>
<p>If you’re using retargeting audiences to target previous website visitors who haven’t purchased on one platform, you should be doing that across all of them (as long as performance permits).</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="bd33796c-bea9-486e-b0a0-1a13d18887e4" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cross-channel-PPC-channels-audiences.png" width="512" height="344" alt="list of PPC channels with audience targeting" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Even more importantly, if you’re excluding users from a campaign on one platform, you should be doing it across all of them. This goes to the ad messaging section. If users are getting messages on some platforms but not others because they’re excluded, they might get confused. And also, you’re spending money on users who shouldn’t be in those audiences.</p>
<h3>6. Not using Google Analytics for tracking</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges I hear when people <a href="/blog/ws/2019/08/28/cross-channel-lead-generation">start cross-channel marketing</a> is “but we don’t know what is driving sales.”</p>
<p>First of all, this is a false narrative. Unless you really only have one channel of business, you’ll never truly KNOW what’s <a href="/blog/ws/2017/04/05/how-to-increase-urgency">driving your sales</a>. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: If there was an <a href="/blog/ws/2018/05/08/attribution-models">attribution</a> platform that was 100% accurate, that founder would be a household name because they’d be rich.</p>
<p>But just because something isn’t perfect doesn’t mean that it’s not imperative to success.</p>
<p>Every platform has its own pixel or tracking functionality, which is great. The not-so-great part is that each platform will nearly always claim more credit than it’s due. This isn’t (only) because they’re trying to show their value, but partially due to a lack of tech to cross-check other platforms.</p>
<p>And to be clear, no platform will ever do this as it’s not in their best interest.</p>
<p>For this reason, it’s very important to have a third-party source of truth for your cross-channel marketing. The most common and likely easiest option is Google Analytics. Although it’s made by Google, it doesn’t put its ad platform on a higher pedestal than any other when it comes to tracking in the analytics tool.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="a9d8923c-b580-488f-9ede-89d1b324ab1f" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cross-channel-ppc-marketing-google-analytics.png" width="720" height="325" alt="google analytics view for multiple ppc channels" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Every goal set up in Google Analytics will be attributed based on a last non-direct click model. Meaning that whatever channel contributed the click before the conversion (assuming there is one other than a direct website visit) will get the credit for the conversion.</p>
<p>When getting your cross-channel strategies in place, don’t skip over the tracking setup portion. Be sure <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUiaNSPcaVc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all of your channels are tracked consistently</a> in your single source of truth to allow you to make informed decisions about <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/24/google-ads-optimization">optimizations</a>.</p>
<h3>7. Ignoring non-converters</h3>
<p>Although we’d always like all our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/29/ad-channels">advertising channels</a> to drive direct conversions, that’s just simply not a reality. In most cases, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/10/15/multi-channel-marketing">multiple channels</a> are involved in a user&#8217;s path to conversion (which is the whole point of <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-cross-channel-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cross-channel marketing</a>), so it&#8217;s important to identify the role each channel is playing and at which stage. The Assisted Conversions report can show you how many conversions each channel or campaign contributed to, even if they weren’t the last non-direct touch.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="1bb98656-0252-43cf-9f71-8f9ff6f55ea5" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">

</article>
</div>
<p>A further breakdown can be found in the Multi-Channel Funnel, Top Conversion Path Reports where you get to see source/medium, campaign, or some other user flow from their first touchpoint through to conversion.</p>
<h2>Avoid these cross-channel marketing mistakes</h2>
<ol>
<li>Use consistent and accurate messaging</li>
<li>Cater your ads to what your audience is looking to achieve on each channel</li>
<li>Set separate goals and KPIs for each channel</li>
<li>Be flexible with budget allocation.</li>
<li>Keep your retargeting audiences consistent.</li>
<li>Use a single source of truth for tracking.</li>
<li>Pay attention to channel paths.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, all of these mistakes are avoidable. Cross-channel marketing brings home great returns, as long as you put time and thought into your strategy.</p>

<div>
<p>As someone who has always been on the agency side of things, I am used to the pushback against Display advertising in Google. The number one reason I hear why clients do not want to use them is that they typically do not perform as well as Search. Of course they do not. The user intent between the networks is completely different.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="c24d9415-7be1-41fa-ae14-d48226f8d7a1" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>But just because users are not as likely to convert, it does not mean Display ads are not valuable. There are several ways you can check and see if Display Ads are impacting overall performance on Google, and we’ll be covering four of those methods in this post. The methods involve:</p>
<ol>
<li>Display-specific Google Analytics audiences</li>
<li>Observation audiences</li>
<li>Google Trends</li>
<li>View-through conversions</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s begin.</p>
<h2>1. Create display-specific Google Analytics audiences</h2>
<p>When you are in Google Analytics, click on the Admin button in the lower right-hand corner of your window. The middle column will be your Property column in Universal Analytics. Click on Audience Definitions towards the bottom of the middle column.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e12a9968-1ba1-420a-bedd-83cc12aff260" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-display-ads-impact-search-google-analytics-audiences-1.png" alt="How display advertising can impact search network performance google analytics audiences" width="800" height="463" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>In Audience Definitions, we can create audiences from so many <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/09/20/ppc-metrics-ultimate-guide">metrics available within Google Analytics</a>.</p>
<p>Before you can create an audience in Google Analytics, however, you must have Edit permissions to the property. Click on the red “New Audience” button, and soon you will find yourself in the Audience Builder. With the Audience Builder, and how you have your Display campaigns set up in Google Ads, there could be a variety of ways to build audiences from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/18/google-display-network-tips">Display Network</a> traffic.</p>
<p>I always have “Display” in my Display campaign names so I can create a Traffic Source audience to include any visits from users who came to my site via a campaign with “Display” in the name.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="363d9ddf-4d87-4a49-bc4d-3215388e0d43" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>If you manually tag your Display URLs with a specific source and medium, you can create an audience that way. If you use specific landing pages for your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/30/best-display-ad-examples">Display campaigns</a>, you can create an audience in Google Analytics from just those landing page visits. There are a variety of ways you can do this. I just wanted to make it clear we can build audiences from our Display traffic in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>Now before you save the audience, you will want to make sure you are adding the audience to both Google Ads and Google Analytics. And this is a trick I learned a long time ago from <a href="https://twitter.com/Hoffman8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy Bishop</a>. I wanted to make sure she got credit for teaching me this.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="855c09b8-c905-48a6-b54e-4163aba80030" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>The reason we want to make sure our audience is added to Google Analytics is because we can review the performance of this audience within the Google Analytics Audience report. In Google Analytics, go to the left-hand column and click “Audiences.” Then click on the subcategory which is a second “Audiences.”</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="8c93a980-26ba-4ae4-bc8e-7c760e142a44" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this report, you will be able to see if anyone within your audiences has <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/08/13/adwords-conversion-tracking-guide">converted</a> within your selected date range. So when we create an audience from Display campaigns, we can then go back and see if anyone who came to the website eventually converted.</p>
<p>The numbers I see from &#8220;audiences&#8221; in Google Analytics and &#8220;direct conversions&#8221; in Google Ads from <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/30/best-display-ad-examples">Display campaigns</a> are typically different. The difference I usually experience is that the numbers in Google Analytics are higher because Display is more of a first interaction approach unless you are doing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/12/04/adwords-remarketing-best-practices-guide">remarketing</a>.</p>
<p>This has helped me showcase to clients when users were not converting from my Display campaigns, that those users were eventually coming back to the site via many of our other channels and converting. This helped prove the impact of using Display to build the initial <a href="/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">brand or product awareness</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note: You can create this type of audience in Google Analytics 4 as well, but I wanted to stick with the more familiar Universal Analytics way of doing it for this post. </em></p>
<h2>2. Apply those audiences in observation mode</h2>
<p>After you have your audiences created in Google Analytics (if you created them using the Google Ads audience manager, that is completely fine too), I highly recommend adding each of these audiences as an Observation audience to all of your Search Network campaigns.</p>
<p>Observation audiences are bid-only audiences in Google Ads. We are not specifically <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/10/google-display-network-targeting">targeting users</a> within our Display audiences we just created. We just want to <em>observe</em> how users within this Display audience come back and interact with our Google Ads campaigns.</p>
<p>When you are in Audience Manager in Google Ads, you can select your Display audiences you just created. Once you click on the checkbox next to your audience, a blue bar will pop up on the screen. You can then choose to add that audience to as many ad groups or campaigns as you would like. Of course, I am going to recommend adding them to all of your campaigns because who doesn&#8217;t want more information?</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0f9915e6-e019-4125-afb4-93b00dd93eb0" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Now what we are doing is essentially creating Observation <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/03/12/remarketing-lists-for-search-ads">RLSA</a> campaigns. While we are not targeting users in these audiences, the RLSA audience rules still apply to the Search campaigns. This means your audience needs to have at least 1,000 cookies within that audience before we can start seeing the data show up in the Google Ads Audience report. But if you do have enough data, you can start seeing how your Display audiences are performing compared to the account averages or other audiences in the account.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="2c8691d2-b4a6-41ed-8af0-2d4d2b10776c" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>The biggest grain of salt when reviewing RLSA audiences as a success metric is that we are only seeing if users within your Display audience come back and interact with your other <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/06/06/best-ads">Google Ads campaigns</a>. And those campaigns have to be enabled for us to gather the Observation information.</p>
<p>This tactic is helpful from the impact on your paid search campaigns, but it will not help prove the impact on other search sources. Maybe users went back to your site through organic search. Maybe they came back to your site via a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/14/microsoft-ads-if-functions">Microsoft Ads search campaign</a>. We do not get the full picture using Observation audiences, but it can give you additional information on what users are searching for after interacting with your Display ads.</p>
<h2>3. Monitor Google trends to see if volume changes</h2>
<p>Depending on the goals of the Display campaign, I like to monitor how search trends change after we launch the campaign. If we are launching an overall <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/06/brand-advertising-for-conversions">brand campaign</a>, I am going to monitor the most important brand keywords to see if we see more searches across Google. If we are bidding on brand terms in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/03/differences-between-google-ads-and-microsoft-ads">Google or Microsoft</a>, we will also monitor if impressions increased for those keywords.</p>

<p>If our Display campaign is focused on specific <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">products or services</a>, we will pull specific branded product keywords and see if we see any growth. In the case of brand new products with zero awareness, we will see if any searches start showing up. Now it is always important to keep in mind any other channels you may be using to build the awareness. If you are running Display with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/30/social-media-advertising-tips">social campaigns</a>, YouTube ads, direct mail, etc., it is pretty hard to prove that the impact on Search was from just Display. But if you are only running Display to build awareness, I would look for changes in the interest over time to see if search volumes changed in your favor.</p>
<h2>4. Monitor your view-through conversions</h2>
<p>Now this tactic is not Search-specific, but it is one I monitor when I run any type of Display campaign. When you are reviewing your Display campaigns, you have the ability to adjust your columns in Google Ads. One column I always have selected for my Display campaigns is the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/view-through-conversion">View-through conversions column</a>. You can find this option when in the Conversions section when modifying your column views.</p>

<p>View-through conversions do not include any conversions from users who have interacted with your other ads. In other words, View-through conversions are not included in the regular Conversions column totals. These conversions occur when someone sees, but does not interact with your ad. And seeing the ad means at least 50% of the ad was visible on the user’s screen.</p>
<p>So this action is very applicable to Display campaigns which can have a lower CTR compared to other paid media channels. People might see your Display ads, but they are not ready to click on it because they were on a particular website or app for different reasons.</p>

<p>We use view-through metrics to evaluate the impression-based impact on our Display campaigns. Then we like to go back to our assisted conversion metrics in Google Ads and see how these users are coming back and converting. In many cases, users are coming back via search (both paid and organic) to make the conversion. That is how we can really see the value of just having Display ads visible to a user.</p>
<h2>See how your Display ads affect Search with these tips</h2>
<p>Can Display campaigns in Google Ads convert? Yes. Absolutely. But even if your Display campaigns are not converting, you have to review the complete impact your Display efforts are having before turning them off. Take the ideas I laid out in this post and apply them to your account.</p>
<p>Are users going back to Google and searching for your brand after seeing or clicking on your Display ad? There are several ways we can review this. Display is great for building the awareness to drive more Search traffic, and hopefully you can now see how that is possible.</p>
