										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here’s a little secret about TikTok fame and fortune: pumping out hilariously addictive video clips is only half the battle. To get your content in front of a big audience, grow your follower count, and mayhaps even go viral (<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f632.png" alt="😲" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />), you need to understand TikTok SEO.</p>
<p>“Wait, like the search engine optimization I use to get my website on the front page of a Google search?” you ask.</p>
<p>Yep, that SEO. Well, there are a few key differences, which we’ll explain in this guide.</p>
<p>There’s much to cover, so let’s dig in and start boosting those TikTok stats!</p>

<h2>What is TikTok SEO?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/category/tiktok">TikTok</a> SEO is the practice of optimizing your content, account, and posts so they become more visible and discoverable on TikTok. In theory, it’s similar to any other form of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">optimization</a> when the goal is to help your content surface more often when people search for relevant search terms.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-trailer-results.webp" alt="TikTok SEO - TikTok search results" width="356" height="578" class="aligncenter wp-image-84607 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-trailer-results.webp 356w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-trailer-results-185x300.webp 185w" sizes="(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you sell travel trailers, you want your content to end up in TikTok’s search results for that term.</em></p>
<p>In practice, TikTok SEO <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-competitors">differs from SEO on Google</a> because content discovery on TikTok differs from content <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/outdated-seo-tactics">discovery on Google</a>. In fact, it’s way more interesting!</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/first-page-of-google?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_10WaysFirstPageGoogle_Download">10 Tangible &amp; Free Ways to Get on the First Page of Google</a></p>
<div id="how-does-content-discovery-happen-on-tiktok"></div>
<h2>How does content discovery happen on TikTok?</h2>
<p>To understand how TikTok SEO works (and how to make it work for you!), you need to understand the three ways people discover new content on the platform.</p>
<h3>The FYP page</h3>
<p>The<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/07/how-to-get-on-tiktok-fyp"> For You Page</a> is the secret sauce of new content discovery on TikTok. When anyone opens the app, they see a full-screen video they haven’t seen before. The content updates for every new session and is unique to every user.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-captions.webp" alt="TikTok SEO - TikTok FYP" width="366" height="579" class="aligncenter wp-image-84608 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-captions.webp 366w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-captions-190x300.webp 190w" sizes="(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The FYP is where people can randomly discover your brand on TikTok.</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/tiktok-algorithm">TikTok algorithm</a> decides which videos to show on each FYP. Since TikTok wants to keep you on the app longer, the algorithm will show content it thinks you’ll like based on your prior behavior.</p>
<p>This is the main difference between TikTok SEO and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/local-seo-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google SEO</a>. TikTok promotes passive discovery, prioritizing each user’s behavior to guide it. Google focuses on active discovery since you have to tell it what you want before it shows you anything. That makes your current behavior (the words you type into the search bar) paramount on Google.</p>
<p>Okay, there is some<a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/12412910?hl=en#:~:text=Personalization%20is%20only%20used%20in,personalized%20while%20others%20aren%27t." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> personalization in Google results</a>, but it’s not nearly as big a factor there as it is in the FYP.</p>
<h3>TikTok search</h3>
<p>Here’s where TikTok SEO and Google SEO start to overlap (and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-competitors">even compete</a>). At the top of the TikTok screen, there’s a search bar where you can type in a query, just like you would with a traditional search engine. There’s even an auto-suggest function that’ll fill in popular keywords once you start typing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-search-suggestions-makeup.webp" alt="TikTok SEO - TikTok search bar" width="543" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-84609 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-search-suggestions-makeup.webp 543w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-search-suggestions-makeup-480x530.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 543px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>TikTok has a search function that works much like Google’s</em></p>
<p>For the search function, the TikTok algorithm works a lot like Google’s. It looks for content that matches the keyword you’ve typed in. Only on TikTok, there are a few different ways you can use keywords to your advantage. We’ll get to those in a bit.</p>
<p>Once you’ve entered your query, you get a page like this, with a scrollable list of videos to choose from.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-tutorial.webp" alt="TikTok SEO - TikTok search results for makup tutorial." width="349" height="584" class="aligncenter wp-image-84610 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-tutorial.webp 349w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-tutorial-179x300.webp 179w" sizes="(max-width: 349px) 100vw, 349px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you use keywords effectively, people will find your videos when they search for relevant terms.</em></p>
<p>Notice something else along the top of the page? You can search for content in several ways, like by hashtag, location, and even sound. That’ll be important when we get into how to use TikTok SEO to rank your content.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Use the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">Free Keyword Tool</a> to find popular keywords you can use to rank on Google and TikTok</p>
<h3>Google Search</h3>
<p>Here’s where the two SEO worlds really collide. TikTok content is <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/tiktok-is-fast-becoming-a-key-search-and-discovery-platform-for-younger-aud/629718/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showing up in some Google search results</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-google-serp.webp" alt="TikTok SEO - TikTok videos showing in Google results." width="883" height="482" class="aligncenter wp-image-84611 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-google-serp.webp 883w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-google-serp-480x262.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 883px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Look at that! TikTok videos competing with Google’s own YouTube content in search results.</em></p>
<p>What does that mean? Your TikTok SEO strategy must align with your search engine SEO strategy to maximize your content&#8217;s visibility.</p>
<div id="why-does-tiktok-seo-matter"></div>
<h2>Why does TikTok SEO matter?</h2>
<p>TikTok has over <a href="https://backlinko.com/tiktok-users" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 billion</a>(!) monthly active users. Even better, younger shoppers (the ones with rapidly increasing buying power) are <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/gen-z-prefers-tiktok-google-searches" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turning to TikTok over Google</a> to find new brands and products. A successful TikTok SEO strategy will get you in front of this huge and energetic group of buyers.</p>
<h3>TikTok is transforming into a search engine</h3>
<p>TikTok is still a discovery platform that helps users stumble on creators they’ve never heard of. But as we mentioned, it’s also growing into a search platform where people go to find their next pair of comfy boots or even business insurance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-insurance.webp" alt="TikTok SEO - TikTok search results for insurance." width="318" height="567" class="aligncenter wp-image-84612 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-insurance.webp 318w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-insurance-168x300.webp 168w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>TikTok is evolving into a search platform where people learn about a wide range of products and services.</em></p>
<p>Once you’ve optimized your TikTok content, those people will learn that you’re the solution to what they’re searching for.</p>
<h3>You can diversify your non-paid traffic</h3>
<p>Google traffic has been a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2024-google-algorithm-updates">bit wonky lately</a>, to say the least. And with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-overviews">AI Overviews</a> now answering users’ questions, we may see even fewer clicks from that search engine.</p>
<p>TikTok’s growing user base and its search engine features make it a viable way to generate unpaid traffic to fill some of the Google gap.</p>
<h3>TikTok SEO has a lower barrier to entry than Google SEO</h3>
<p>It’s really hard for a new brand to show up on Google results pages for highly searched terms. That’s because Google gives more weight to websites with a high domain authority (something the recent <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-algorithm-documents-leak">Google algorithm document leak</a> seemed to confirm).</p>
<p>On TikTok, however, past performance doesn’t heavily influence content ranking. So, a brand can appear on TikTok FYPs and search results shortly after posting its first videos. If, of course, the brand uses a smart TikTok SEO strategy.</p>
<div id="what-are-the-tiktok-seo-ranking-factors"></div>
<h2>What are the TikTok SEO ranking factors?</h2>
<p>TikTok’s algorithm analyzes thousands of ranking signals to decide which posts to place on your FYP and search results. We don’t know them all, but the good folks at TikTok did <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publish a document</a> that lists some of the most important ones.</p>
<h3>User interactions</h3>
<p>TikTok personalizes your results based on how you’ve interacted with content previously. This helps ensure you see the most helpful videos (and keeps you on the platform longer).</p>
<p>Here are a few actions that influence TikTok’s decision:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watching full videos</li>
<li>Following or hiding accounts</li>
<li>Liking or sharing videos</li>
<li>Commenting</li>
<li>Reporting a video as inappropriate</li>
<li>Adding videos to favorites</li>
</ul>
<p>It all starts when you first open the app and tell TikTok what interests you.</p>
<p>Additionally, if other people who share your interests interact with a video, it’ll be more likely to appear in your feed.</p>
<h3>Video information</h3>
<p>These TikTok ranking factors are really important because they’re the ones you can most directly affect. They include things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hashtags</li>
<li>Sounds</li>
<li>Captions</li>
</ul>
<p>When these things in your posts match a search query (and a user’s activities), your content will appear on their screens.</p>
<h3>Device and settings</h3>
<p>How your device and TikTok account are set up will influence the content you see on the platform.</p>
<p>A few examples of device and settings ranking factors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Language settings</li>
<li>Country settings</li>
<li>Device type</li>
</ul>
<p>These make sense since content in an unfamiliar language isn’t going to keep you watching.</p>
<h3>TikTok algorithm weighting factor</h3>
<p>Like most algorithms, TikTok weights some ranking factors more heavily. The idea is to focus more on factors that more directly predict which content will keep users watching.</p>
<p>The takeaway is that your efforts should be on the factors that make your content easier for an algorithm to understand (like adding the right <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/07/tiktok-hashtags">hashtags</a>) and those that keep viewers clicking and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/17/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok">liking your posts</a>.</p>

<h2>5 ways to improve your TikTok SEO</h2>
<p>Now that you know how TikTok SEO works, let’s get more of your content in front of more people with these TikTok SEO tips.</p>
<h3>1. Find and use keywords</h3>
<p>One of a search engine&#8217;s most basic jobs is matching content to search queries. On TikTok, that means when someone types “beach hats” into the search bar, TikTok will first look for videos associated with that keyword.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-hats.webp" alt="TikTok SEO - TikTok search results for beach hats." width="345" height="583" class="aligncenter wp-image-84613 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-hats.webp 345w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-hats-178x300.webp 178w" sizes="(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>To appear in these search results, you’ll need to find the right keywords and use them correctly.</em></p>
<p>There are two easy ways to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide"> research keywords</a> on TikTok. First, type a word relevant to your brand in the search bar and see what TikTok auto-fills.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-search-suggestions-keywords.webp" alt="TikTok SEO - TikTok search bar autofill." width="544" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-84614 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-search-suggestions-keywords.webp 544w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-search-suggestions-keywords-480x529.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 544px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>TikTok’s autofill in the search bar makes keyword research easy.</em></p>
<p>Second, TikTok’s<a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/keyword-insights/pad/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Keyword Insights</a> tool will show you a list of related keywords.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-keyword-insights.webp" alt="TikTok SEO - Keyword Insights page" width="777" height="590" class="aligncenter wp-image-84615 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-keyword-insights.webp 777w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-keyword-insights-480x364.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 777px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>TikTok has a tool to help you find keywords.</em></p>
<p>With a list of keywords in hand, it&#8217;s time to place them strategically. There are several places to do that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Captions:</strong> Use keywords organically and naturally (meaning, don’t cram them in if they don’t make sense) in the captions you write.</li>
<li><strong>Text in video:</strong> You can and should include text for people to read in your videos, and there&#8217;s <a href="https://www.servemethesky.com/blog/tiktok-experiments-seo-trick">some evidence</a> that the algorithm understands keywords in your video text.</li>
<li><strong>Speech in video:</strong> Say your keywords while filming your videos (but again, make sure it’s organic and not forced).</li>
<li><strong>Hashtags:</strong> We’ll show you how to find great hashtags in the next section.</li>
<li><strong>Bio: </strong>Add your most important keywords to your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/tiktok-bio-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok bio</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Thumbnail text:</strong> TikTok understands the text in your thumbnails, so make sure they include your focus keyword.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Go big on hashtags</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/07/tiktok-hashtags">Hashtags</a> group content by topic on TikTok so users can find what’s trending quickly. They’re also another directional sign that helps TikTok’s algorithm match content to each user and search query.</p>
<p>Just like keywords, your two jobs here are to find the best hashtags and use them in a way that helps users and algorithms find your content.</p>
<p>Like keywords, one easy way to find hashtags is to type a root word into the search bar. Only this time, complete the search, then tap “Hashtags” at the top.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-hashtag-suggestion.webp" alt="TikTok SEO - Hashtag suggestions in TikTok search." width="326" height="576" class="aligncenter wp-image-84616 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-hashtag-suggestion.webp 326w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-hashtag-suggestion-170x300.webp 170w" sizes="(max-width: 326px) 100vw, 326px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>TikTok graciously gives you a list of related hashtags.</em></p>
<p>You can also do a little <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/competitors-ads">competitive research</a> and see which hashtags others in your space use.</p>
<p>And finally, once again, TikTok has a tool to help you find <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/inspiration/popular/hashtag/pad/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hashtags in its Creative Center</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-hashtag-finder.webp" alt="TikTok SEO - Hashtag finder in TikTok Creative Center." width="867" height="418" class="aligncenter wp-image-84617 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-hashtag-finder.webp 867w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-hashtag-finder-480x231.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 867px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Just like keywords, you can find active hashtags in TikTok’s tools.</em></p>
<p>To use your trove of hashtags, just add them to your captions. Here are a few tips to nail that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a mix of broad (#FYP; #trending), relevant (#travelwithdogs, #bestpizza), trending (#stpatricksday, #Olympics), and branded (#nike, #youringoodhands) hashtags.</li>
<li>Use three to six hashtags on most posts.</li>
<li>Stick to hashtags that are relevant to your business.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-hashtags.webp" alt="TikTok SEO - TikTok with lots of hashtags." width="351" height="585" class="aligncenter wp-image-84618 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-hashtags.webp 351w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-hashtags-180x300.webp 180w" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Use a good mix of different types of hashtags.</em></p>
<p>Remember to include a #[topic]tok hashtag if there’s a relevant one (like #farmtok, #booktok, or #movietok).</p>
<h3>3. Use trending sounds</h3>
<p>Believe it or not, the sounds you hear while watching TikTok act like hashtags and keywords. When you listen to a few videos with the same catchy beat or funny voiceover, TikTok tends to serve more that use the same sounds.</p>
<p>Plus, you can search for content by their common sounds, just like with hashtags.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-sounds-list.webp" alt="TikTok SEO - TikTok search for sounds." width="364" height="577" class="aligncenter wp-image-84620 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-sounds-list.webp 364w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-sounds-list-189x300.webp 189w" sizes="(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>You can attract a lot of video views with the right sound.</em></p>
<p>We’ll go back to TikTok’s Creative Center to see which sounds are trending.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-songs.webp" alt="TikTok SEO - Song finder in TikTok Creative Center." width="844" height="392" class="aligncenter wp-image-84619 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-songs.webp 844w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-songs-480x223.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 844px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Look at other accounts in your industry to see which songs best fit the content. To catch their wave, try a few sounds that aren’t yet trending but show early signs of doing so.</p>
<h3>4. Post at the right frequency and time</h3>
<p>When and how often you post aren’t direct ranking factors. But both can help your TikTok SEO tangentially.</p>
<p>When you post more often, you simply have more chances to go viral. The<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/20/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok#:~:text=According%20to%20TikTok%2C%20you%20should,need%20Avatar%2Dlevel%20production%20quality."> exact posting frequency is up for debate</a>. TikTok says to post multiple times per day, while other studies say a couple of times per week is enough.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-time-to-post.webp" alt="" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-84621 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-time-to-post.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-time-to-post-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The real answer is to post as often as you can while still sharing valuable content people want to watch. Remember that video completion <em>is</em> a direct ranking factor, so posting more stuff people won’t watch all the way through will hurt more than help.</p>
<p>TikTok also doesn’t directly care<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/09/best-time-to-post-on-tiktok"> when you post your content</a>. But if you get it in front of your audience when they’re most likely looking at the app, it’ll give your videos a little engagement boost, which may make them more likely to land on the FYP of new potential followers.</p>
<p>Luckily, your TikTok analytics tells you when your followers are flipping through the app.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-analytics-1.webp" alt="TikTok SEO - Screenshot of TikTok analytics dashboard." width="359" height="581" class="aligncenter wp-image-84622 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-analytics-1.webp 359w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-analytics-1-185x300.webp 185w" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Your TikTok analytics dashboard tells you when followers are active. </em></p>
<h3>5. Drive engagement</h3>
<p>Likes, comments, and shares are the real deal ranking factors. You can’t make people take these actions (thankfully), but you can sure encourage them to do so. Here are a few ways to get more<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/17/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok#:~:text=By%20posting%20videos%20that%20are,Hashtags"> engagement on your TikTok posts</a> for SEO success.</p>
<p>It starts with a great hook to halt those scrolling thumbs. Use a thumbnail and some text that incites curiosity.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-hook.webp" alt="TikTok SEO - TikTok screenshot with &quot;wait for it&quot; in text." width="344" height="576" class="aligncenter wp-image-84623 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-hook.webp 344w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-hook-179x300.webp 179w" sizes="(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px" /></p>
<p>Speaking of text, make sure your videos have captions. Many TikTok users binge with the sound off. Captions make sure they can still get what you’re putting out.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-captions-two.webp" alt="TikTok SEO - TikTok with captions." width="366" height="575" class="aligncenter wp-image-84624 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-captions-two.webp 366w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TikTok-SEO-Wordstream-captions-two-191x300.webp 191w" sizes="(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px" /></p>
<p>Then, use some simple tactics like asking people to comment on a statement you make, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/14/tiktok-trend-discovery">jumping on new trends</a>, and adding effects to make your posts more interesting.</p>

<h2>TikTok SEO is your key to virality</h2>
<p>TikTok started as a trendy place to share dance moves and silly challenges. It’s grown way up and now competes with Google as a place where people search <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/tiktok-video-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">videos for inspiration</a>, information, and new brands.</p>
<p>Like Google, you need to optimize your TikTok content and account to reach more people. The good news is that TikTok SEO doesn’t have to be complicated. Remember to use your keywords effectively and create content people want to engage with. The rest will come with consistency.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's a quick rundown of TikTok's two ad bidding strategy options and how to choose the right one.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/tiktok-ads-bidding">TikTok Ads Bidding Strategies (Which Is Best for You?)</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bidding strategies are essential for digital advertising campaigns to ensure you reach your goals. This is undoubtedly true of TikTok, where people increasingly learn about new products and brands.</p>
<p>TikTok only offers two bidding strategy options at the moment: Cost Cap and Maximum Delivery. Although they seem similar on the surface, each provides a unique way to get the biggest bang for your advertising buck.</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll discuss the two bidding strategies available on TikTok and help you determine which is the best option for you.</p>
<h2>The two TikTok ads bidding strategies</h2>
<p>In TikTok ads, your bidding strategy tells the platform how to place bids for your account in the ads auction. (If you’re new to TikTok ads, read this<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/22/tiktok-ads"> TikTok ads primer</a> on how they work). The goal is to pick the bidding strategy that matches your goal and budget.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Get the free <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteAllStarPlaybook.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_AllStarPlaybook_Download">All-Star Advertising Playbook</a> to learn how to maximize all of your online marketing strategies.</p>
<h3>Strategy #1: Cost Cap</h3>
<p>Cost Cap bidding is a performance-based approach to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/tiktok-algorithm">optimization</a>. With Cost Cap bidding, the goal is to control the average cost per result you receive in the auction.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/23/tiktok-marketing">The TikTok platform</a> tries to hit an average cost per result based on your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/15/marketing-objectives">campaign goals</a> to make it work. That means that for each conversion, the cost per result might be higher or lower than your target, but the plan is to average out to your goal over time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tiktok-ads-bidding-wordstream-cost-cap-1.webp" alt="tiktok ads bidding - line graph showing bid cap results." width="865" height="450" class="aligncenter wp-image-83454 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tiktok-ads-bidding-wordstream-cost-cap-1.webp 865w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tiktok-ads-bidding-wordstream-cost-cap-1-480x250.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 865px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Cost Cap bidding is an option for App Install, Conversions, and Lead Generation campaign objectives.</p>
<p>TikTok says this strategy is best for goal-based campaigns and advertisers trying to keep costs around those goals consistent, regardless of market conditions. That’s because the platform will bid more or less depending on the likelihood of a conversion and won’t work to spend the budget every single day. If performance isn’t strong, it will underspend the daily budget for that day, and try again tomorrow when performance may be better.</p>
<p>Now, when it comes to actually setting up your Cost Cap, TikTok suggests setting the highest amount you’re willing to pay for the conversion. Or for a return on ad spend (ROAS) target, the lowest ROAS you’re willing to accept. Both of these give TikTok the most leniency when bidding for you in the auction, as they’re the least restrictive ends of the spectrum.</p>
<p>It also suggests that your budget should be 50 times your Cost Cap bid. While that might be feasible for some folks and is likely where the platform performs best, it may or may not be reasonable for most advertisers. In that case, try to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/10/26/marketing-budget">set your daily budget</a> at least five times your Cost Cap bid, but higher is better.</p>
<p>If you can’t hit the five-times mark, it&#8217;s not a dealbreaker. I’ve seen campaigns perform well with a Cost Cap at the same level as the daily budget, but it’s rare. If you’re in that scenario, you might want to examine your account&#8217;s structure and see if you can condense <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">audiences</a> and budgets to better align with TikTok’s suggested budget/Cost Cap split.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f44b.png" alt="👋" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Digital marketing is an always-on strategy.

<h3>Strategy #2: Maximum Delivery</h3>
<p>Maximum Delivery, unlike Cost Cap, is a spend-based strategy rather than performance-based. You’re not able to enter a bid amount. Instead, you provide your budget and TikTok will work to drive as many of your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/23/tiktok-ads-targeting"> target actions</a> as possible while spending your entire budget.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tiktok-ads-bidding-wordstream-maximum-delivery-1.webp" alt="tiktok ads bidding - line graph showing Maximum Delivery results." width="867" height="437" class="aligncenter wp-image-83455 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tiktok-ads-bidding-wordstream-maximum-delivery-1.webp 867w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tiktok-ads-bidding-wordstream-maximum-delivery-1-480x242.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 867px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>That means the platform will not pull back on days when your performance is less efficient than others. Your costs could vary quite a bit, but your overall spending will stay level. The only wrinkle is that Maximum Delivery is only available for daily budgets and isn’t an option if you’re using a lifetime budget.</p>
<p>You can use this bidding strategy with every campaign objective in the TikTok platform. Just leave the Cost Cap, Bid Cap, Target CPA field in the Bidding &amp; Optimization section empty, and you’ll default to Maximum Delivery for that ad set.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tiktok-ads-bidding-wordstream-bid-control.webp" alt="tiktok ads bidding - screenshot from TikTok ads manager." width="846" height="369" class="aligncenter wp-image-83456 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tiktok-ads-bidding-wordstream-bid-control.webp 846w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tiktok-ads-bidding-wordstream-bid-control-480x209.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 846px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Like Cost Cap, TikTok recommends setting your budget to achieve 50 conversions per day. Again, this is likely not attainable for many people, so do your best with it.</p>
<p>If you’re seeing good results with Maximum Delivery and want to scale, make sure you do so in a strategic manner. While other platforms like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/11/28/facebook-ads-benchmarks">Meta ads</a> suggest no more than a 20% budget change on any given day, TikTok says it can handle up to a 50% bid change without seeing performance disruptions. It then suggests you wait until you receive another 50 conversions and at least one day before changing the budget again.</p>
<p>I’d stick to the 20% rule that Meta suggests here as well (and see how your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/07/facebook-vs-tiktok-ads">Facebook and TikTok ads</a> work together). 50% is a pretty huge increase, and depending on how competitive your industry is, you may see pretty fluctuant CPAs with a larger change.</p>
<h2>Make the best of your TikTok ads bidding strategies</h2>
<p>I’m a fan of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/tiktok-seo">TikTok</a> only having two bidding strategies on the platform. It simplifies things and makes it much easier for advertisers to digest and understand.</p>
<p>Are you working on ROAS or CPA targets? Cost Cap is your best option. Are you seeing good results and want to get the most scale from your campaigns? Let’s hit Maximum Delivery and see how high we can go. Hopefully, this demystifies the TikTok Ads bidding strategies enough for you to feel confident in your campaign settings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you post videos and want more people to spend more time watching them, then you and TikTok have a common goal. That’s why I cringe a bit when I see people talking about hacking the TikTok algorithm for more likes and views.</p>
<p>You don’t need to trick it; you just need to know how the TikTok algorithm works. Once you understand its basic principles, you’ll know what and when to post for your best shot at TikTok virality.</p>
<p>But what about the <a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2024/04/30/whats-behind-potential-ban-tiktok#:~:text=On%20April%2024%2C%20President%20Joe,American%20firm%20within%20nine%20months." target="_blank" rel="noopener">potential US TikTok ban</a>? TikTok has <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1299807/number-of-monthly-unique-tiktok-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">148 million</a> active users in the US. To paraphrase Samual L. Jackson’s character Nick Fury in Marvel’s Avengers, “Until such time as <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">the world</span> TikTok ends, we will act as though it intends to spin on.”</p>
<p>Let’s get into the weeds of TikTok’s algorithm, see how it suggests videos to individual users, and find ways to get your content on more viewers’ screens.</p>

<div id="what-is-the-TikTok-algorithm"></div>
<h2>What is the TikTok algorithm?</h2>
<p>The TikTok algorithm is a recommendation engine that decides which videos to suggest to each individual user.</p>
<p>On TikTok, recommended videos appear on your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/07/how-to-get-on-tiktok-fyp">For You Page</a> (FYP) when you first open the app.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-fyp.webp" alt="Tiktok algorithm - screenshot of the TikTok FYP" width="299" height="560" class="aligncenter wp-image-82661 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-fyp.webp 299w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-fyp-160x300.webp 160w" sizes="(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px" /></p>
<p>Everyone’s For You feed is unique and will change over time. TikTok pays attention to the videos you watch, where you post comments, and the accounts you follow. Each interaction is another signal the algorithm uses to refine your FYP—showing videos you’ll probably like while keeping videos you won’t off your feed.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong> Want to grow all of your marketing channels?</strong> Download <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteBestOnlineMarketingTips.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_130marketingtips_Download">The Best Online Marketing Tips for Generating More Traffic, Leads, &amp; Sales</a> to get over 100 actionable growth marketing tactics.</p>

<h2>How does the TikTok Algorithm work in 2025?</h2>
<p>If you’ve ever sent your friend a cake recipe link because you remembered they love to bake, you get the gist of how the TikTok algorithm works.</p>
<p>Of course, TikTok’s proprietary algorithm is infinitely more complex than yours (no insult intended). It analyzes thousands of signals to determine which videos belong on your FYP. Let’s look at a few of the most influential ranking factors.</p>
<h3>Factors TikTok uses to rank content</h3>
<p>We’ll probably never know what every <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/tiktok-ads-bidding">TikTok</a> ranking factor is, but thanks to <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this post from TikTok</a> itself, we do have an idea of a few ranking categories.</p>
<h4>User interactions</h4>
<p>Your behavior in the TikTok app is the most influential signal for the algorithm. Whenever you like a video or follow a particular account, TikTok uses that to understand your preferences further.</p>
<p>These are some of the user interaction signals TikTok will track:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watching full videos</li>
<li>Following or hiding accounts</li>
<li>Liking or sharing videos</li>
<li>Commenting</li>
<li>Reporting a video as inappropriate</li>
<li>Adding videos to favorites</li>
</ul>
<p>TikTok also uses what you say you are and aren’t interested in when you first join the app to guide its suggestions.</p>
<p>Other users’ interactions on a video can also determine whether you get it on your feed. If many people who share your interests watch and like a post, there’s a bigger chance you’ll see it, too.</p>
<h4>Video information</h4>
<p>On the flip side of the equation, TikTok reviews certain characteristics of the videos you’ve interacted with to see how they match your preferences. That’s important for creators to know since these are the things we have the most control over.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the video and post characteristics the algorithm looks for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hashtags</li>
<li>Sounds</li>
<li>Captions</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll go into how to optimize your videos for <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/tiktok-marketing-for-small-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok marketing</a> using these characteristics in a bit.</p>
<h4>Device and settings</h4>
<p>Device and settings are also user-specific actions the algorithm uses to recommend content. If you’re registered as a US user, you’ll see a lot more content made in the USA. But unlike user interactions, these are one-time signals that don’t typically change over time.</p>
<p>A few device and setting signals that may nudge the TikTok algorithm include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Language setting</li>
<li>Country setting</li>
<li>Device type</li>
</ul>
<h4>TikTok factor weighting</h4>
<p>TikTok’s algorithm weights ranking factors based on how directly they indicate viewer preferences. Direct user actions, like watching a full video, carry much more influence than geographic location.</p>
<p>This means that while it’s good to be aware of all the ranking factors, your focus should be on posting content that your audience will want to watch and share.</p>
<h3>Factors that don’t help (and could hurt) your content ranking</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its post</a>, TikTok says it won’t give creators a boost based on past performance. Someone with a high follower count and previously viral videos won’t get preferential rankings over a smaller account with more relevant content.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are some types of content that TikTok will de-rank (show less or not at all) in your FYP. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Videos you’ve already seen</li>
<li>Content that’s considered spam</li>
<li>Duplicated content (like a second post of the same video)</li>
<li>Videos with restricted content (like graphic medical procedures)</li>
</ul>
<p>To be clear, some of this content will still be available if you search for it. It just won’t pop on your FYP.</p>
<div id="how-do-you-reset-the-tiktok-algorithm"></div>
<h2>How to reset the TikTok algorithm</h2>
<p>TikTok’s algorithm finds the type of content you’ll love based mainly on what you’ve enjoyed in the past. Sometimes, the recommendations don’t keep up with your changing preferences, and your feed gets stale.</p>
<p>TikTok has built a way for you to scrub its algorithm so it starts from scratch. Then, your interactions moving forward will influence the content you get on your personal FYP.</p>
<p>Here are the steps to <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-a-way-to-refresh-your-for-you-feed-on-tiktok-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refresh your FYP</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the TikTok app and tap “Profile”</li>
<li>Go to the menu at the top and choose “Settings and privacy”</li>
<li>Tap “Content preferences”</li>
<li>Tap “Refresh your For You feed”</li>
<li>Tap “Continue” and “Continue” again</li>
</ol>

<p>You can’t go back once you finish the process. But only your FYP will be affected. Your “Following” feed and profile won’t change.</p>

<h2>9 ways to use the TikTok algorithm to your advantage</h2>
<p>Knowing how the TikTok algorithm works is half the battle. The other half is publishing <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/engaging-posts-on-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engaging content</a> that makes it easy for TikTok to find, categorize, and suggest your posts.</p>
<h3>1. Hook viewers quickly</h3>
<p>You have a fleeting second or two to grab a viewer’s attention and convince them to watch your video. Keep their thumbs from scrolling by adding an attention-grabbing hook that’s relevant to your audience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-hook.webp" alt="Tiktok algorithm - Tiktok with a hook in the video cover." width="383" height="582" class="aligncenter wp-image-82663 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-hook.webp 383w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-hook-197x300.webp 197w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /></p>
<p>A great hook should give the viewer just enough information to make them want more. Try these tactics for your video hooks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a bold claim</li>
<li>Ask a question</li>
<li>Share a surprising fact</li>
<li>Hint at a secret</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure each hook is relevant to your audience, and use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">emotional words</a> to catch their attention.</p>
<h3>2. Create niche content</h3>
<p>It’s hard to gain footing with very popular topics on TikTok since many creators are already fighting for precious FYP placement. However, you can use the algorithm to your benefit by finding <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/28/niche-marketing">niche</a> topics to post about.</p>
<p>For example, cooking is a super popular topic on TikTok. There are plenty of accounts dedicated to whipping up the best dishes. But Bobby Hicks of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@retrorecipeskitchen?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@theretrorecipekitchen</a> uses his account to trial dishes from days of old. Many of the recipes he tests look tasty, while others look like…a veggie gelatin stack?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-niche.webp" alt="Tiktok algorithm - Screenshot of a TikTok recipe video." width="414" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-82664 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-niche.webp 414w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-niche-207x300.webp 207w" sizes="(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px" /></p>
<p>It may seem a little odd, but by focusing on one corner of a popular topic, Hicks has grown his account to over 150k followers.</p>
<p>Review the topics you’d like to use, and if they seem a little crowded, find a subtopic your audience would appreciate. That’ll leave you with fewer competitors in the race for the FYP. It’ll also make your content more relevant to a specific audience, which the algorithm loves.</p>
<h3>3. Use TikTok SEO</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">Search engine optimization</a> isn’t just for Google. Pretty much any time there’s a search function, you can optimize your content for it, and TikTok is no exception. Plus, even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/12/google-exec-suggests-instagram-and-tiktok-are-eating-into-googles-core-products-search-and-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google admits</a> that TikTok is becoming a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-competitors">popular search engine</a> in its own right.</p>
<p>In addition to the other tips in this guide, you’ll want to use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/articles/keyword-research-for-social-media-guide">keyword research</a> to boost your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/tiktok-seo">TikTok SEO</a>. Like on search engines, people use specific words and phrases in the search bar to find content on the app. Your job is to figure out what those words are.</p>
<p>Keyword research is easy on TikTok. Make a list of things your audience might search for that are relevant to your business. If you’re an esthetician, “skin care” might be one of them. Then, enter those words into the TikTok search bar and see what it auto-fills.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-keywords.webp" alt="Tiktok algorithm - TikTok search bar with autofill." width="579" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-82665 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-keywords.webp 579w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-keywords-480x497.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 579px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You’ll see options like “skin care for men” and “skin care routine.” Once you’ve gathered a list of keywords, plan out your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-calendar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content calendar</a> to cover each term. Don’t forget to add keywords to your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/tiktok-bio-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok bio</a>, too.</p>
<h3>4. Tailor content to the platform</h3>
<p>It’s smart to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/03/repurposing-content#:~:text=Repurposing%20content%20(aka%20finding%20new,Some%20choose%20podcasts%20over%20ebooks.">repurpose content</a> for multiple platforms. But when it’s time to post it on TikTok, make sure it fits the app’s best practices.</p>
<p>First, produce and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-edit-tiktok-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">edit</a> full-screen, vertical videos with a 9:16 ratio. That will fill the entire mobile screen while matching how most people view TikTok content.</p>
<p>Second, keep most of your videos short. While there’s no ideal duration for every video, in 2021, TikTok suggested that the optimal length should be <a href="https://twitter.com/stokel/status/1459171303227904000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">24 to 31 seconds</a>. The platform has <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-wants-longer-videos-like-not/?utm_brand=wired-uk&amp;utm_campaign=onsite-share&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_social-type=earned&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushed for longer content</a>, but many viewers find videos longer than one minute to be stressful, so it&#8217;s safer to keep them under 60 seconds.</p>
<p>Finally, for the best chance of your TikTok videos going viral, keep them positive in tone. <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/hooks-of-viral-tiktoks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semrush evaluated</a> a large collection of viral TikTok videos and found that those with a positive, funny, or happy vibe did best.</p>
<p>Follow these best practices to get more early engagement, which the algorithm will use as a signal that your video belongs on more FYPs.</p>
<h3>5. Post at the right time and frequency</h3>
<p>The TikTok algorithm doesn’t really care what time or how often you post—at least not directly. But it does look at how much engagement an individual video gets. Knowing when and how frequently to post can give your videos a little engagement boost.</p>
<h4>The right time</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/09/best-time-to-post-on-tiktok">best time to post on TikTok</a> depends on when most of your audience will be on the app. The goal is to publish content a little before the peak potential viewing time to get them indexed and ready for your followers.</p>
<p>You can find that information in your TikTok analytics.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-when-to-post.webp" alt="Tiktok algorithm - Graph shown when an audience is on TikTok." width="821" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-82666 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-when-to-post.webp 821w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-when-to-post-480x351.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 821px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>The right frequency</h4>
<p>Consistency is essential for success on any <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">social media platform</a>. You don’t want followers to forget about you, and you want more chances to reach new viewers. But how do you quantify “consistency?”</p>
<p>Just like timing, learning <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/20/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok">how often you should post on TikTok</a> will take some trial and error. TikTok says you should post up to four times per day (of course they do). More realistically, most brands post content to TikTok around two to four times per week (depending on which study you follow).</p>
<p>Here are a few tips to find your perfect TikTok schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consider your creative capacity:</strong> Posting more often is great, but not at the expense of quality.</li>
<li><strong>Review other creators:</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/competitors-ads">Spy on your competition</a> to see how often successful accounts in your niche post content.</li>
<li><strong>Watch your analytics:</strong> Vary your posting frequency over several weeks and see how it affects your views and engagement.</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Incorporate hashtags</h3>
<p>Using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/07/tiktok-hashtags">hashtags on TikTok</a> can help you succeed in two ways. First, hashtags help the TikTok algorithm understand your content so it can better match it to user preferences.</p>
<p>Second, TikTok users use hashtags to search for content, so when your video is tagged, it may show up in their search. As we know, when more people see your content, the algorithm will show it to more people with similar interests.</p>
<p>You can find which hashtags are trending in TikTok’s <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/login?redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2Fcreator-center&amp;enter_method=redirect&amp;enter_from=creator-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creative Center</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-hashtags.webp" alt="TikTok algorithm - TikTok's Creative Center." width="881" height="478" class="aligncenter wp-image-82667 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-hashtags.webp 881w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-hashtags-480x260.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 881px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here are a few tips for using hashtags on TikTok:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don’t use too many:</strong> One to four hashtags will usually do the trick without making your post look spammy.</li>
<li><strong>Use different types:</strong> Combine branded, topical, popular, and niche hashtags for the best mix of reach and relevance.</li>
<li><strong>Include seasonal and holiday hashtags:</strong> Adding <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/holiday-hashtags-instagram-post-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seasonal hashtags</a> like #hellospring and #Holloweenscares lets you ride the wave of attention during peak times of the year.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Add popular audio clips</h3>
<p>Audio clips work similarly to hashtags on TikTok. If an audio clip gets popular, and you like videos that use that clip, there’s a greater chance you’ll get more videos with that audio in your FYP.</p>
<p>Head back to the Creative Center to find trending songs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-audio.webp" alt="TikTok algorithem - TikTok's Creative Center." width="870" height="470" class="aligncenter wp-image-82668 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-audio.webp 870w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-audio-480x259.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 870px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Look in the Popular tab to see which tunes are already getting a lot of play. Then, check out the Breakout tab to catch the next audio wave early.</p>
<h3>8. Add captions</h3>
<p>Many people don&#8217;t watch videos with the sound on. Adding captions to your posts lets those people follow along. But captions don’t just help you appeal to a broader audience. TikTok’s algorithm can learn more about your videos from the text of its caption.</p>
<p>TikTok makes it easy to add captions. Tap the Captions icon, and the app will automatically generate them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-.webp" alt="TikTok algorithem - TikTok's caption manager." width="318" height="568" class="aligncenter wp-image-82669 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-.webp 318w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream--168x300.webp 168w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" /></p>
<p>Make sure you use the keywords you dug up in your video script. The algorithm will read those in the captions and know who should see your videos.</p>
<h3>9. Jump on trends</h3>
<p>One of the best ways to leverage the algorithm to get views is by following <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/14/tiktok-trend-discovery">TikTok trends</a>. A trend is a theme, idea, or trait of a video that already has mass appeal. That might be a common song or a dance.</p>
<p>Trends can also be challenges, like this one where one person holds another so they look like they’re in the iconic scene from the movie Titanic.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-trends.webp" alt="TikTok algorithem - Screenshot of a TikTok video showing the Titanic trend." width="356" height="578" class="aligncenter wp-image-82670 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-trends.webp 356w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiktok-algorithm-wordstream-trends-185x300.webp 185w" sizes="(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px" /></p>
<p>When viewers get hooked on a trend, TikTok sends them more videos to view. If you&#8217;ve jumped on the trend, the algorithm will put your video in that mix.</p>
<h2>Work with the TikTok algorithm to go viral</h2>
<p>The trick to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">social media marketing</a> is remembering that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-algorithm">social platform algorithms</a> want you to succeed. If people love the content you post, they’ll spend more time on the app—which is a win-win for everyone.</p>
<p>The key is learning how the TikTok algorithm (and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-algorithm">Instagram algorithm</a>, for that matter) works to make it your partner in success. Instead of fighting against the algorithm, find ways to leverage it, and you’ll leap-frog ahead of all the accounts trying to trick or hack it. And of course, consider using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/tiktok-ads-bidding">TikTok ads</a> to bypass the algorithm altogether.</p>
<p>Here’s a recap of nine ways you can use TikTok’s algorithm to your advantage:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hook viewers quickly</li>
<li>Create niche content</li>
<li>Use TikTok SEO</li>
<li>Tailor content to the platform</li>
<li>Post at the right time and frequency</li>
<li>Incorporate hashtags</li>
<li>Add popular audio clips</li>
<li>Add captions</li>
<li>Jump on trends</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Love it or hate it, social media is all about what’s “in” and popular. So, it’s no wonder that as TikTok has grown so have TikTok trends.</p>
<p>TikTok trends are traits within TikTok videos that make them appeal to a large audience. TikTok trends often start from videos that have gone viral by trying out a creative format or an ear-catching audio clip.</p>

<h2>TikTok trend examples</h2>
<p>Let’s first review a few quick TikTok trend examples. That way, you know what to look out for when doing your own TikTok trend discovery. However, just keep in mind that TikTok trends usually get played out over a few months. While these TikTok trend examples can be helpful reference points, they probably aren’t trending anymore.</p>
<h3>Bird’s eye view trend</h3>
<p>The first TikTok trend example you may recognize is the “bird’s eye” view trend that rose in popularity towards the end of 2023. Three main characteristics turned this style of TikTok into a trend:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The camera angle. </strong>The premise of this TikTok trend is to tape your phone to your ceiling for an equally unique and challenging camera angle.</li>
<li><strong>The song. </strong>This TikTok trend example uses a clip from a TikTok song, called <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Surround-Sound-7050547465157642241"><em>Surround Sound</em></a> by rapper JID, which was popular at the time of the TikTok trend.</li>
<li><strong>The edits. </strong>To go along with the beat of the song, the point of the trend is to cut between looking serious and having fun.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tiktok-trend-discovery-bird-eye.jpg" alt="tiktok trend discovery - tiktok trend example" width="291" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-78551 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tiktok-trend-discovery-bird-eye.jpg 291w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tiktok-trend-discovery-bird-eye-146x300.jpg 146w" sizes="(max-width: 291px) 100vw, 291px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@retirementhouse/video/7295458479798766894?embed_source=121355058%2C121351166%2C71788788%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%3Bnull%3Bembed_blank&amp;refer=embed&amp;referer_url=later.com%2Fblog%2Ftiktok-trends%2F&amp;referer_video_id=7295458479798766894" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Watch an example TikTok</em></a><em> that follows this trend here. </em></p>
<h3>Bad idea trend</h3>
<p>The “bad idea” trend became popular during the summer of 2023. It’s an example of a TikTok trend that uses two of the same themes throughout:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The song.</strong> The point of this TikTok trend is to use a popular clip from the song <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/bad-idea-right-7265652790483437569"><em>bad idea right?</em></a> By Olivia Rodrigo.</li>
<li><strong>The plot. </strong>All videos that follow this TikTok trend show the creator doing something that requires a big or meaningful decision. This is supposed to match Rodrigo’s contemplation in her song as the lyrics go “Seeing you tonight, it’s a bad idea right?”</li>

<h3>I got married in Italy trend</h3>
<p>This last TikTok trend example has a pretty clever concept and it’s too funny not to include. It plays off an audio clip of one of Kim Kardashian’s <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfessionCam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confessional cam</a> bits from her family’s Hulu show The Kardashians. “I got married in Italy” TikToks are meant to joke about others copying you, as Kim called out her sister for copying her wedding in the clip.</p>

<h3>4. Find popular songs</h3>
<p>The final part of the Trends section of TikTok Creative Center is the <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/inspiration/popular/music/pc/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Songs tab</a>. Here, you can discover trending TikTok audio clips and songs to use in your videos. It’s broken out into two sections.</p>
<p>The popular section can help you find the most frequently used songs within your selected timeframe, and you can filter out for those approved for business use. The breakout section includes both songs and user-generated audio clips that are rising in popularity—which can help you get ahead of TikTok trends.</p>

<h3>5. Use the TikTok Commercial Music Library</h3>
<p>In addition to the Trends section within Creative Center, you can use the TikTok Commercial Music Library (found in the Creative Tools section) for trend discovery. The <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/music/pc/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commercial Music Library</a> holds all pre-cleared music for both organic TikTok content and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/tiktok-ads-bidding">TikTok Ads</a>.

<h3>6. Read up on TikTok trend perspectives</h3>
<p>To make TikTok trend discovery even easier, the TikTok Creative Center also includes a Trends section which includes <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/trends/hub/pc/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trend Perspectives</a>. The purpose of Trends Perspectives is to educate TikTok marketers and advertisers on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/23/tiktok-ads-targeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok audience behaviors</a>. With this resource, you can predict how TikTok trends in your industry may grow and evolve.</p>

<h3>7. Research successful TikTok creative strategies</h3>

This is where you can find <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/23/tiktok-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok marketing</a> case studies, creative tips, and quick TikTok tutorials.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tiktok-trend-discovery-creative-strategies.jpg" alt="tiktok trend discovery - example of tiktok creative strategies" width="900" height="576" class="aligncenter wp-image-78542 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tiktok-trend-discovery-creative-strategies.jpg 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tiktok-trend-discovery-creative-strategies-480x307.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>8. Use the TikTok Ads library and Top Ads Dashboard</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/14/tiktok-ads-library" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok Ads library</a> can be a secret weapon for businesses looking to do TikTok trend discovery since it allows you to research <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/tiktok-ads-bidding">TikTok ads</a> from competitors. If you’re familiar with the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/06/facebook-ad-library" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook ads library</a>, know that the TikTok ads library functions in the same way where it’s meant to provide transparency for users and help businesses source video inspiration.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-countries.jpg" alt="tiktok ads library - available country data example" width="777" height="427" class="aligncenter wp-image-75944 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-countries.jpg 777w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-countries-480x264.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 777px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Currently, the TikTok Ads library only pulls data from ads running in Europe. That said, if you’re based outside of Europe, you can still use it to get a general understanding of how different types of TikTok Ads are trending for similar businesses in your industry.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can head to the <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/inspiration/topads/pc/en?period=30&amp;region=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Top Ads Dashboard</a> within the Inspiration section of the TikTok Creative Center to see the highest-performing ads within your chosen criteria for any region.</p>

<h3>9. Find hot keywords with Keyword Insights</h3>
<p>Also within the Inspiration section of Creative Center is the <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/keyword-insights/pc/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keyword Insights</a> tool. With this resource, you can explore trending <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/tiktok-seo">keywords</a> to ensure your TikTok video scripts and captions are hitting all the right buzzwords for your business to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/target-market-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connect with your target market</a>.</p>

<h2>6 more ways to do TikTok trend discovery (beyond the TikTok Creative Center)</h2>
<p>While the TikTok app and TikTok Creative Center will likely be your primary sources for TikTok trend discovery, you’ll want a well-rounded look at what’s hot in your industry. Try to keep an open mind and consider other ways TikTok trends rise in popularity using these ideas below.</p>
<h3>1. Look at YouTube Shorts</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-make-youtube-shorts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube Shorts</a> are short-form videos on YouTube that are comparable to TikTok videos in length, styling, and format. Because of this, brands typically have some crossover between their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/11/08/tiktok-vs-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok and YouTube</a> Shorts content. So, if you scroll through <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/youtube-shorts-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popular YouTube Shorts</a>, you’ll also likely be able to discover new TikTok trends.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tiktok-trend-discovery-youtube-shorts.jpg" alt="tiktok trend discovery - youtube shorts home page example" width="601" height="522" class="aligncenter wp-image-78532 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tiktok-trend-discovery-youtube-shorts.jpg 601w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tiktok-trend-discovery-youtube-shorts-480x417.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 601px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>2. See what’s trending on Instagram Reels</h3>
<p>Like YouTube Shorts, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-instagram-reels-for-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram Reels</a> are another opportunity to find trending short-form videos similar to TikToks. You’ll likely find many of the same concepts trending on both <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/16/tiktok-vs-instagram-reels-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram Reels and TikTok</a>. In fact, it’s not uncommon for viral TikToks to be reposted to Reels!</p>

<h3>3. Refer to your historical performance</h3>
<p>The best way to discover which TikTok trends may or may not work for your business is through trial and error. As you get started on TikTok, find a few TikTok trends to start testing out. As you continue to market and advertise on TikTok over time, benchmark your progress.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/The-2023-State-of-Social-Media.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">96%</a> of business leaders agree that companies that want to be successful must continue to invest in social media. So the question here isn’t really <em>if</em> you should have a strong social game but <em>which</em> platforms give you the most bang for your buck?</p>
<p>And that’s where the whole TikTok vs. YouTube debate stems from—both platforms can help businesses connect with audiences, drive purchases, and build a sense of community through video.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-vs-youtube.webp" alt="tiktok vs youtube logos" width="936" height="553" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77151" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-vs-youtube.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-vs-youtube-480x284.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But what’s unique about both platforms is they’re also used as search engines by users. In fact, <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo/meet-search-engines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube is the second-largest search engine</a>. And for Gen Z, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/16/technology/gen-z-tiktok-search-engine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok is Google</a>.</p>
<p>Whether you create tailored content for these platforms to grow organically, partner with influencers, or run ads to drive sales, both YouTube and TikTok have a lot to offer.</p>

<h2>TikTok vs. YouTube: Background</h2>
<p>YouTube and TikTok are titans in the realm of video-sharing platforms.</p>
<p>Originating in 2005, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/03/how-to-advertise-on-youtube">YouTube</a>, now under Google&#8217;s umbrella since its 2006 acquisition, has firmly established itself as a platform for diverse content, from vlogs to tutorials, and allows users to upload, comment on, and share videos.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB0TlsnkY6E&amp;ab_channel=ThinkMedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>On the flip side, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/20/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok">TikTok</a>, a relatively newer sensation, has taken the world by storm with its short, engaging clips and virality potential.

<p>Both platforms offer unique advantages for businesses, but the choice between them hinges on your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a> and content strategy.</p>

<div id="pros-of-youtube"></div>
<h2>Pros of YouTube</h2>
<p>YouTube stands as a digital titan in the realm of video content, paving ways for content businesses to diversify, engage, and monetize their work. But in this grand platform arena, how does YouTube compare with the rising star, TikTok?</p>
<h3>A wide range of content types</h3>
<p>Both YouTube and TikTok offer an expansive array of content types, catering to different audience preferences.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://databox.com/popular-youtube-video-types" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey from Databox</a> shows the 15 most popular video types include education videos, explainer videos, product demos, and product reviews.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-channel-content-types.webp" alt="types of content shared on youtube" width="936" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77138" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-channel-content-types.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-channel-content-types-480x241.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://databox.com/popular-youtube-video-types" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>On TikTok, dance videos and quick tutorials reign supreme, capturing the essence of fleeting moments and trends. Meanwhile, YouTube offers a broader spectrum, from casual vlogs to professional business workshops.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/youtube-seo">breadth of content on YouTube</a> is staggering—whether it&#8217;s an intricate cooking tutorial, a comedic skit, or an in-depth tech review, the platform has it all. This diversity speaks to the versatility it provides to businesses, ensuring that there&#8217;s something for every viewer.</p>
<h3>Long-form content possibilities</h3>
<p>YouTube has long been the sanctuary for brands looking to dive deep. Its platform effortlessly accommodates 30-minute intense workouts, 2-hour in-depth podcasts, and everything in between.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpV63fceRgY&amp;ab_channel=YouTubeAdvertisers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cassey Ho</a>, through her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIJwWYOfsCfz6PjxbONYXSg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blogilates</a> channel, exemplifies this perfectly. For Cassey, her videos provide not just a 20- to 30-minute exercise session but also a chance to forge deeper connections.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-blogilates-channel.webp" alt="youtube pros - blogilates channel youtube thumbnail example" width="936" height="550" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77139" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-blogilates-channel.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-blogilates-channel-480x282.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIJwWYOfsCfz6PjxbONYXSg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>But recognizing the emerging trend of bite-sized content, YouTube also introduced <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-make-youtube-shorts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube Shorts</a>, a feature allowing users to craft 15-60 second videos like TikTok.</p>
<h3>Established and popular platform</h3>
<p>As veterans in the digital space, both YouTube and TikTok have cemented their places as popular platforms. YouTube boasts over <a href="https://www.demandsage.com/youtube-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2.7 billion</a> active monthly users, an impressive figure that underscores its dominance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-monthly-active-users.webp" alt="monthly active users on youtube" width="936" height="516" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77140" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-monthly-active-users.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-monthly-active-users-480x265.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.demandsage.com/youtube-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>TikTok, though newer, has quickly amassed more than <a href="https://www.demandsage.com/tiktok-user-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.1 billion</a> monthly active users, driven by its captivating, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/28/user-generated-content">user-generated content</a>. Features like an easy user interface, a wide variety of content, and personalized recommendations have contributed to the monumental success of both platforms.</p>
<h3>Target audience options</h3>
<p>Understanding and catering to the right audience is crucial for content success. YouTube, with its vast expanse, appeals to a broad audience, from curious kids and trend-following teens to information-seeking adults and seniors.</p>
<p>The introduction of YouTube Shorts further solidifies its appeal to the younger crowd. In contrast, TikTok predominantly resonates with the younger generation, offering businesses a concentrated demographic to target.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1287137/youtube-global-users-age-gender-distribution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Statista</a>, the 18-24 (15%) and 25-34 (20.7%) age ranges account for most of YouTube’s demographic.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-user-demographics.webp" alt="youtube user demographics" width="889" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77141" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-user-demographics.webp 889w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-user-demographics-480x323.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 889px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1287137/youtube-global-users-age-gender-distribution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<h3>High user engagement rates</h3>
<p>Engagement is the currency of the digital realm.</p>
<p>Both TikTok and YouTube have cultivated ecosystems where user engagement rates soar. Engaging content not only retains viewers but positively influences algorithm rankings and content recommendations. (Check out these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/10/youtube-seo-tips">Simple YouTube SEO Tips to Rank Your Videos Higher in Search</a>)</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/tiktok-algorithm">TikTok&#8217;s algorithm</a> thrives on virality, ensuring users are constantly engaged with trending videos, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/15/youtube-algorithm">YouTube&#8217;s algorithm</a> focuses on user behavior, pushing content that aligns with individual preferences.</p>
<h3>Ability to monetize content</h3>
<p>YouTube offers a well-defined path to monetization, with options ranging from ad revenue to affiliate marketing and brand promotions. And a <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-154/marketing-strategies/video/youtube-challenges-tv-advertising-roi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study from Google</a> showed that YouTube beat TV in ad ROI in 77% of studies.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-pros-higher-roi-than-tv.webp" alt="youtube benefits - higher roi than tv" width="936" height="490" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77142" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-pros-higher-roi-than-tv.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-pros-higher-roi-than-tv-480x251.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>TikTok, while not offering direct monetization options akin to YouTube&#8217;s AdSense, still presents opportunities. Popular brands on TikTok can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/22/tiktok-ads">drive sales through ads</a>, brand partnerships, and influencer marketing endeavors.</p>
<div id="pros-of-tiktok"></div>
<h2>Pros of TikTok</h2>
<p>TikTok predominantly captivates the younger demographic with its snappy content and virality-driven features. From offering a buffet of bite-sized videos to being the epicenter of trending challenges, TikTok has reshaped how content is created and consumed.</p>
<p>Here’s a dive into what makes TikTok a standout platform.</p>
<h3>Bite-sized content possibilities</h3>
<p>TikTok and YouTube both offer avenues for bite-sized content, with TikTok specifically sculpted around short-form videos. This bite-sized format is what helped <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en/inspiration/prism-plus-sg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PRISM+</a>, a Singaporean electronics brand, leverage TikTok to engage Gen Z tech enthusiasts. Their TikTok strategy resulted in over 16.5K followers and a 58.6% sales boost during their 12.12 Sale in 2022.</p>

<p>Their TikTok Shop venture and interactive live streams also contributed to significant growth and a plan to expand to markets like Malaysia.</p>
<h3>Ideal platform for viral trends</h3>
<p>TikTok stands as a colossal hub for viral trends and challenges. Its algorithm, coupled with fierce user engagement, fosters an environment where content can achieve virality overnight.</p>
<p>From trending dances to quirky challenges, TikTok has become synonymous with internet trends that have transcended to other platforms like YouTube and Instagram.</p>

<h3>TikTok shopping options</h3>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://shop.tiktok.com/business/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>The platform offers frictionless checkout, scalable support tools, and partnership opportunities, leading to tangible sales results as evidenced by case studies of multiple sellers experiencing significant growth. Importantly, according to TikTok, <a href="https://shop.tiktok.com/business/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70%</a> of TikTok users discover new brands on the platform, and 3 in 4 users are inclined to make a purchase.</p>
<h3>Highly engaged user base</h3>
<p>Both TikTok and YouTube boast a deeply engaged user base, each with unique demographic leanings.</p>
<p>But while YouTube recently introduced &#8220;YouTube Shorts&#8221; to cater to short-form content preference, it cannot compete with TikTok. Compared to YouTube Shorts, which has an average engagement rate of about 3.80%, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/16/tiktok-vs-instagram-reels-ads">Reels</a>, with an average engagement of <a href="https://www.socialinsider.io/blog/tiktok-vs-reels-vs-shorts/#1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4.36%</a>, TikTok boasts a notably higher engagement level.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-vs-reels.webp" alt="tiktok vs instagram reels engagement rate" width="484" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77146" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-vs-reels.webp 484w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-vs-reels-480x594.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 484px, 100vw" /></p>

<h2>How to choose between TikTok vs. YouTube</h2>
<p>YouTube, with its vast expanse of diverse audiences, offers brands unparalleled reach. Meanwhile, TikTok&#8217;s virality potential can catapult a brand into overnight fame. Advertising on these platforms is not just an option; it&#8217;s a strategic imperative.</p>
<p>The best option isn’t TikTok vs. YouTube but rather TikTok and YouTube. You can create content on YouTube that can be repurposed for both TikTok and YouTube Shorts. And you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/tiktok-ads-bidding">run ads</a> on both platforms to reach the widest audience for your business.</p>
<p>It’s a win-win!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Look at all that love for pumpkin spice.</em></p>
<p>Just think of all the brand awareness and engagement you’ll get if you post a dozen times a day!</p>
<p>Not so fast. There is a diminishing return if you bombard the platform with content—especially if you’re pushing out subpar posts for the sake of more views.</p>
<p>The truth is, how often you should post on TikTok depends on a bunch of factors, and it’s unique to everyone. Your goals, capacity, audience, and industry all come into play.</p>
<p>But TikTok posting frequency does matter—the platform loves to serve up fresh, creative content. In this guide, we’ll show you how to figure out the right TikTok schedule for your goals and give you seven tips to keep up the cadence without losing content quality.</p>

<h2>How often TikTok says you should post</h2>
<p>Let’s start with what the platform itself tells us about posting frequency. According to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/tiktok-seo">TikTok</a>, you should post between <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/tiktok-creative-ultimate-guide?redirected=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one to four</a> times per day.</p>
<p>If that feels like a lot, it is. Especially when you consider that posting <a href="https://later.com/blog/how-often-post-to-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three to five times</a> per week on Instagram Reels is the norm.</p>
<p>It’ll help to remember that your videos don’t need Avatar-level production quality. Even TikTok says that authenticity is more important than big-budget production.</p>
<p>A simple background and your phone’s camera are enough if you have good information to share.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-simple.jpg" alt="How often to post on TikTok - TikTok from a psychologist." width="432" height="576" class="aligncenter wp-image-76132 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-simple.jpg 432w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-simple-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px" /></p>
<p>Plus, as you’ll learn next, most brands aren’t posting to TikTok nearly that often.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />TikTok is great, but it’s not the only way to drum up more sales.

<div id="data"></div>
<h2>How often the data says you should post on TikTok</h2>
<p>The more you post, the more content the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/tiktok-algorithm">TikTok algorithm</a> has to keep people on its platform. So of course, it says to post multiple times each day. But how often do brands post in the real world?</p>
<p>SocialInsider <a href="https://www.socialinsider.io/blog/tiktok-vs-reels-vs-shorts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conducted a study</a> comparing TikTok to Instagram Reels and YouTube shorts. Three interesting points emerge from the report:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brands post on TikTok about 16 times per month on average.</li>
<li>That’s just over one post every two days, a far cry from TikTok’s suggestion.</li>
<li>It’s still double the pace they post on other short-form video platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>In another <a href="https://www.rivaliq.com/blog/tiktok-benchmark-report/#title-videos-per-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review by RivalIQ</a>, the average brand was only pushing content to TikTok 1.75 times a week. Even the most active brands posted just five times every week, according to that data.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-often-to-post-tiktok-graph-1.jpg" alt="How often to post on TikTok - graph showing how often to post on TikTok" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76104 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-often-to-post-tiktok-graph-1.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-often-to-post-tiktok-graph-1-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The takeaway is that you probably don’t need to hit TikTok’s posting quota. But you should consider a higher posting frequency than you use on other short-form video platforms.</p>
<div id="ideal"></div>
<h2>How to find your ideal TikTok posting frequency</h2>
<p>We’ve seen that the recommendations and data for how often you should post on TikTok are all over the place. Instead of relying on outside sources to set your schedule, let’s look at a few ways you can determine the absolute best posting frequency for your unique situation.</p>
<h3>Be real about your creative capacity</h3>
<p>The key to growth on TikTok is landing on the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/07/how-to-get-on-tiktok-fyp">For You Page</a> (FYP) of as many viewers as possible. That’s how new content, and companies, get discovered.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-fyp.jpg" alt="How often to post on TikTok - the FYP on TikTok" width="313" height="567" class="aligncenter wp-image-76105 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-fyp.jpg 313w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-fyp-166x300.jpg 166w" sizes="(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px" /></p>
<p>To get there, you have to share content people want to watch. If that means slowing down a little and posting less frequently, that’s okay. If you push a bunch of posts up that people scroll past, you’ll just have more videos no one sees—and a bunch of wasted effort for your troubles.</p>
<h3>Consider your type of content</h3>
<p>The type of content you post is an important consideration of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/23/tiktok-marketing">TikTok marketing strategy</a>. Does your audience crave 30-second comedy clips? Or do they want longer Q&amp;As with your team of experts.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-investors.jpg" alt="How often to post on TikTok - Interview TikTok" width="772" height="599" class="aligncenter wp-image-76106 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-investors.jpg 772w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-investors-480x372.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 772px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Those longer videos take more to produce so you’ll be able to post less often. Plus, your viewers might get fatigued with too many deep dives in a week—which could push them to scroll past your multiple posts.</p>
<h3>Review your industry’s competitiveness</h3>
<p>Some categories like beauty and interior design are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">more popular on TikTok</a>. That means two things where posting frequency is concerned:</p>
<ol>
<li>There’s an appetite for more content</li>
<li>There’s more competition</li>
</ol>
<p>So if you’re in a busy space on TikTok, you’ll need to nudge your posting schedule up.</p>
<p>Not sure where your industry lands? Look at popular accounts in your field to get the idea. If they’re <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-get-tiktok-followers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting followers</a> with a couple of posts each week, that’s a good target to start with. If they’ve got two new videos up every day, well, read our tips below to up your posting game.</p>
<h3>Test and track your analytics</h3>
<p>Still not sure how many times you should post on TikTok every week? Just ask your audience. They’ll tell you by way of the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/tiktok-content-strategy/understanding-your-analytics/">analytics in your TikTok account</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-analytics.jpg" alt="How often to post on TikTok - screenshot of TikTok analytics" width="323" height="574" class="aligncenter wp-image-76133 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-analytics.jpg 323w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-analytics-169x300.jpg 169w" sizes="(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px" /></p>
<p>Try a different cadence each week and watch what happens to total and per-video view count. Also look at your profile views and new follower counts. Those will tell you if people are hungry for more or tired of your posts.</p>
<div id="tips"></div>
<h2>7 tips to keep up with your TikTok posts</h2>
<p>The two things that slow most TikTok creators down are coming up with new ideas and having enough time to shoot and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-edit-tiktok-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">edit each TikTok video</a>. These tips will help you create a pipeline of creative greatness with less time and effort.</p>
<h3>1. Use Duet and Stitch</h3>
<p>One of the worst-kept secrets of successful TikTok creators is that you don’t have to come up with every novel idea on your own. In fact, TikTok encourages collaboration with two features called Duet and Stitch.</p>
<p>A Duet lets you add your video to an existing TikTok, showing each side-by-side.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image13.png" alt="How often to post on TikTok - screenshot of a TikTok stitch" width="348" height="595" class="aligncenter wp-image-76108 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image13.png 348w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image13-175x300.png 175w" sizes="(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px" /></p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/11/how-to-stitch-on-tiktok">Stitch</a> is similar, but instead of playing next to an existing TikTok, your video plays after it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image11.png" alt="How often to post on TikTok - screenshot of a TikTok Stitch" width="368" height="599" class="aligncenter wp-image-76109 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image11.png 368w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image11-184x300.png 184w" sizes="(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px" /></p>
<p>In both cases, you build on an existing, successful video which is way easier than thinking up brand-new concepts.</p>
<p>Here’s an example from PUMA. The brand showed a barista’s hack for brewing coffee and PUMA’s hilarious result while trying to copy it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-Puma.jpg" alt="How often to post on TikTok - TikTok from Puma." width="927" height="530" class="aligncenter wp-image-76110 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-Puma.jpg 927w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-Puma-480x274.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 927px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>2. Work with other brands and creators</h3>
<p>You don’t have to do all the heavy lifting of social media marketing yourself. Find a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/23/how-to-become-a-social-media-influencer">popular creator</a> and let them introduce your brand and products to their audience.</p>
<p>Minute Maid racked up nearly 20,000 likes on this collab with Spencerx.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-influencer-1.jpg" alt="How often to post on TikTok - TikTok from Minute Maid" width="379" height="596" class="aligncenter wp-image-76111 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-influencer-1.jpg 379w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-influencer-1-191x300.jpg 191w" sizes="(max-width: 379px) 100vw, 379px" /></p>
<p>Don’t worry about finding the biggest TikTok stars. Look for micro-influencers that have an engaged following that would likely love what you do.</p>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f44b.png" alt="👋" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Emotional content is more influential and engaging. Put all the feels in your videos by using these <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite120WordsforMarketingWithEmotion.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_120WordsPhrases_Download">135 words and phrases for marketing with emotion</a>.</div></div>
<h3>3. Repurpose content from other platforms</h3>
<p>If you’re already publishing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/22/instagram-reels-ideas-for-businesses">Instagram Reels</a> or long-form video content to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/15/youtube-algorithm">YouTube</a>, then you have some assets that’ll speed up TikTok posting.</p>
<p>Take a Reel, tweak it a bit, and repost it on TikTok. Or break apart your 30-minute YouTube tutorial and either post the bits on TikTok or make a trailer that leads people to the full video.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image12.png" alt="How often to post on TikTok - screenshot of a video preview on TikTok" width="324" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76112 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image12.png 324w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image12-162x300.png 162w" sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px" /></p>
<h3>4. Use TikTok ads</h3>
<p>Paying for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/11/advertising-on-tiktok">TikTok ads</a> won’t necessarily help you post faster. But it could change how often you should post on TikTok in the first place.</p>
<p>Why? Because with a paid post and the right bid strategy, you can place your content in front of a very <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/23/tiktok-ads-targeting">targeted audience</a>. So you could get away with posting less because each ad will be seen by the very people who want to engage with your brand and buy what you sell.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-Hollister-1.jpg" alt="How often to post on TikTok - screenshot of an ad from Hollister" width="398" height="599" class="aligncenter wp-image-76113 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-Hollister-1.jpg 398w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-Hollister-1-199x300.jpg 199w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px" /></p>
<p>And if you need inspiration for your ads, just creep <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/14/tiktok-ads-library">TikTok’s public ad library</a>. You’ll see how other brands tackle TikTok.</p>
<h3>5. Jump on the trend train</h3>
<p>Since its earliest days, TikTok has been all about the trends. Viral dances and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/07/tiktok-hashtags">hashtag challenges</a> still rule on the platform. That means there’s a nearly limitless bounty of creative ideas you are allowed—even encouraged—to copy.</p>
<p>To tap into the next big trend, use <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/inspiration/popular/pc/en?from=001119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok’s trend tracker</a> and see what’s taking over.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-trends.jpg" alt="How often to post on TikTok - screenshot of TikTok's trending chart" width="918" height="492" class="aligncenter wp-image-76114 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-trends.jpg 918w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok-trends-480x257.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 918px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You’ll find trending hashtags, songs, and popular videos to fuel your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/24/editorial-calendar">content calendar</a>.</p>
<h3>6. Start big and taper</h3>
<p>If you’ve just <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-create-a-tiktok-account/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">created your TikTok account</a>, make a splash by posting as much content as possible early on. That’ll do three things to catapult your success:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give you more chances to land on the FYP</li>
<li>Give the TikTok algorithm plenty of content to index</li>
<li>Give you more data to learn from quickly</li>
</ul>
<p>Try to create enough content to post at least once per day for the first two or three weeks that you’re on the platform. Then you can taper off to see if your videos are still <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/17/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok#:~:text=In%20this%20article%2C%20I%E2%80%99ll%20explore%2010%20tips%20for,trends%20and%20leaving%20your%20viewers%20with%20a%20cliffhanger.">getting likes</a> and your follower count keeps growing.</p>
<h3>7. Batch and schedule content</h3>
<p>Assuming your entire job isn’t creating videos for TikTok, you probably have to jump in and out of the app to edit and post your content. Switching contexts from other tasks to TikTok like that can slow you down.</p>
<p>An alternative is to create posts in batches, then schedule them throughout the week or month. That would gain you some efficiency in your workflow.</p>
<p>Luckily, TikTok has a content scheduler in the desktop version of the app.</p>

<h2>Find your flow on TikTok</h2>
<p>Should you post on TikTok every day? As long as you’re posting <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/engaging-posts-on-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great content</a>, it probably won’t hurt. But if that cadence burns you out, then take it easy on yourself and spread out your posts. It’s always better to create and share fewer good posts then more meh ones.</p>
<p>While you’re figuring out how often you should post on TikTok for your goals, remember these tips to make it easier:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use Stitch and Duet</li>
<li>Work with other brands and creators</li>

<li>Start big and taper</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As online ad platforms evolve more privacy-friendly approaches to audience targeting, ad transparency naturally has grown into a need, not a want, for both consumers and advertisers.</p>
<p>Published ads on platforms like Google Ads, Facebook, and TikTok are public knowledge and should be treated as such. Consumers have a right to know about the ad being put in front of them, and advertisers should also be able to accurately evaluate their ad competition. That’s why we’re seeing the emergence of tools like the Facebook Ads library or Google’s Ad Transparency Center, and now, the TikTok Ads library.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library.jpg" alt="tiktok ads library home screen example" width="618" height="442" class="aligncenter wp-image-75945 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library.jpg 618w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-480x343.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 618px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The TikTok Ads library is a directory of all ads that have been shown on TikTok. Both users and advertisers alike can use it as a tool to learn about what ads are being published by different businesses, what targeting tactics were applied, and more&#8230;</p>
<p>That “more” part will be precisely what we’ll discuss today as we walk through all the important TikTok Ads library details you need to know.</p>
<p>Let’s get started!</p>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>

<ul>
<li><a href="#what">What is the TikTok Ads library?</a></li>

<div id="what"></div>
<h2>What is the TikTok Ads library?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://library.tiktok.com/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok Ads library</a> is a one-stop-shop for anyone around the world looking to gather information about an ad that’s running on TikTok. You don’t have to be a TikTok user or advertiser to access the TikTok Ads library. Currently, the TikTok Ads library only pulls data from ads running in Europe.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-countries.jpg" alt="tiktok ads library - available country data example" width="777" height="427" class="aligncenter wp-image-75944 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-countries.jpg 777w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-countries-480x264.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 777px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Now, that doesn’t mean the TikTok Ads library can’t be useful for your business if you’re located outside of Europe. You can still use this tool to get a general idea of how TikTok Ads in your industry are being approached by businesses like yours (more on this later).</p>
<p>However, if you’re looking for insight on TikTok ads from businesses located outside the countries outlined in the TikTok Ads library, you can head to the TikTok Creative Center. The “Top Ads Dashboard” within the <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/inspiration/topads/pc/en?period=30" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok Creative Center’s “Inspiration” tab</a> allows you to search top-performing ads on TikTok from all countries the app is available in. Yet, keep in mind that this will only show you a view of top performers and isn’t necessarily an online directory of all ads running (regardless of performance) like the TikTok Ads library.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-creative-center.jpg" alt="tiktok ads creative center screenshot" width="794" height="403" class="aligncenter wp-image-75946 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-creative-center.jpg 794w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-creative-center-480x244.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 794px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you’re familiar with the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/06/facebook-ad-library" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook ads library</a>, it can be helpful to know that the TikTok Ads library functions in the same way where it’s meant to provide transparency for users and help businesses source inspiration for ads.</p>
<p>That said, the TikTok Ads library is arguably better than the Facebook Ads library since it provides sorting features to help you find the best (or worst) ads based on multiple filter parameters. Additionally, the TikTok Ads library detail pages are a bit more in-depth than the Facebook Ads library ad detail pages since they incorporate data on the ad’s targeting and reach.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-targeting-summary.jpg" alt="tiktok ads library - targeting summary example" width="765" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-75957 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-targeting-summary.jpg 765w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-targeting-summary-480x376.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 765px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>More TikTok Ads library features and terms to know</h3>
<p>The standard TikTok Ads library for European data branches out into a few more tabs if you’re looking for general information on the patterns of TikTok advertising or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/tiktok-algorithm">organic TikTok content</a>. For example, the “All ads report” shows you the total number of ads posted by country and by day, which can be interesting when <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/seasonal-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning your seasonal marketing</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-ad-report.jpg" alt="tiktok ads library - all ads report example" width="744" height="567" class="aligncenter wp-image-75948 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-ad-report.jpg 744w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-ad-report-480x366.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 744px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For instance, you’ll find below that more ads were posted during this past year’s holiday season than during the summer season. This could mean that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/29/holiday-marketing-trends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holiday marketing</a> on TikTok is fiercely competitive, so you should <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/23/tiktok-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plan your TikTok ad content</a> accordingly. (Pro tip: find the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/09/best-time-to-post-on-tiktok" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best times to post on TikTok</a> year-round here!)</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-ads-by-day.jpg" alt="tiktok ads library - tiktok ads by day chart" width="808" height="446" class="aligncenter wp-image-75947 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-ads-by-day.jpg 808w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-ads-by-day-480x265.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 808px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For insight on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/07/how-to-get-on-tiktok-fyp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-paid, organic TikToks</a> you can head over to the “Other commercial content” tab. This still focuses on content designated as “commercial” in nature by creators. So, it weeds any TikToks from users that are solely for entertainment purposes and focuses on TikToks meant to <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite30BestWaysToPromote.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Marketing_The30BestWaysToPromoteYourBusiness_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promote a product or service</a>—whether it be from a business’s direct account or an influencer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-commercial-content-library-1.jpg" alt="tiktok ads library - tiktok commercial content library home screen" width="738" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-75960 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-commercial-content-library-1.jpg 738w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-commercial-content-library-1-480x390.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 738px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The TikTok Creative Center also offers these types of resources for businesses around the world. For example, the TikTok Creative Center is where you can find TikTok’s other popular library: the <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/music/pc/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commercial Music Library</a>. You could use the TikTok Commercial Music Library in unison with the TikTok Ads library to find inspiration for video formats in combination with different audio clips.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-commercial-music-library.jpg" alt="tiktok ads library - commercial music library screenshot" width="827" height="480" class="aligncenter wp-image-75954 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-commercial-music-library.jpg 827w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-commercial-music-library-480x279.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 827px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Lastly, whether you’re checking out TikToks within the TikTok Ads library or the Creative Center, there are few core terms you’ll want to be familiar with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First shown:</strong> First shown date is the day that the ad received its first impression, regardless of when it was published.</li>
<li><strong>Last shown: </strong>Last shown date is the day when the ad received its last impression, regardless of when it was taken down.</li>
<li><strong>Unique users seen:</strong> The estimated number of unique TikTok users who have seen the ad at least once.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ready to put your foundational knowledge of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/11/advertising-on-tiktok" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok Ads</a> library to work? Let’s learn the steps to actually <em>use</em> the TikTok Ads library&#8230;</p>
<div id="how"></div>
<h2>How to use the TikTok Ads library</h2>
<p>Here’s how you can access and use the TikTok Ads library:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Navigate</strong> to <a href="https://library.tiktok.com/ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://library.tiktok.com/ads/</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Follow the prompts to filter</strong> out for a specific type of TikTok Ad. This is where you can choose to see ads from specific countries, or find ads that fit different formats, publishing dates, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">keywords</a>, or even a specific brand name.</li>
<li>Once your filters are set, <strong>click the red search box</strong> on the far right.</li>
<li><strong>Sort your results</strong> using the drop-down menu on the right. This is where you can sort to quickly find the most or least popular ads, as well as the newest and oldest.</li>
<li>If you spot an ad in your results that you want to learn more about, you can <strong>click the play button </strong>to watch the TikTok ad. Alternatively, you can click anywhere on that ad’s tile to be taken to a separate detail page to find information on the ad’s target audience size, location, gender, and more.</li>
<li>Congratulations, you’re now able to use the TikTok Ads library to help your business gain a competitive edge!</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-detail-page-ad-summary.jpg" alt="tiktok ads library - ad detail page example" width="769" height="578" class="aligncenter wp-image-75953 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-detail-page-ad-summary.jpg 769w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-detail-page-ad-summary-480x361.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 769px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>What to do when no ads show in your TikTok Ads library search results</h3>
<p>Did you follow the steps above to use the TikTok Ads library, but nothing came up? That’s okay! TikTok outlines this as a possibility on the TikTok Ads library home screen:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-no-results.jpg" alt="tiktok ads library - zero search results troubleshooting screen from tiktok" width="852" height="437" class="aligncenter wp-image-75952 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-no-results.jpg 852w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-no-results-480x246.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 852px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Basically, you might not always find what you’re looking for on the TikTok Ads library because of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re looking for a specific advertiser that isn’t currently running ads or doesn’t run ads within your set country.</li>
<li>No ads match your filter criteria.</li>
<li>You’re looking for a political or election ad, which is not currently supported by the TikTok Ads library.</li>
<li>The ads you’re looking for are too fresh. There’s a slight delay in the TikTok Ads library data where it can occasionally take up to 24 hours to process updates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Luckily, there’s no usage limits on the TikTok Ads library. Once you troubleshoot your initial search, you can run it again to bring up results. Now, it’s time to use those results to your advantage!</p>

<h2>11 ways to create better content using the TikTok Ads library</h2>
<p>You have all the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/tiktok-ad-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok ad examples</a> you need at your fingertips thanks to the TikTok Ads library, here’s how you can take advantage of this unique resource for your business:</p>
<h3>1. Filter to see top performers</h3>
<p>Finding a high-performing TikTok ad from the TikTok Ads library filters alone can feel like you’re searching for a needle in a haystack. It’s a good idea to layer one of the sorting options from the drop-down menu on the right. For example, if you sort by “Unique users seen: high to low” you can find the ads that had the most reach out of all the ones that populated in your search.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-sort-filter.jpg" alt="tiktok ads library - example of sorting for best performing ads" width="614" height="608" class="aligncenter wp-image-75951 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-sort-filter.jpg 614w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-sort-filter-480x475.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 614px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>2. Learn which content ideas you<em> don’t </em>like</h3>
<p>As you poke around in the TikTok Ads library, don’t only admire ads you’d like to replicate. Instead, try taking a different approach to see the types of TikTok ads you don’t like.</p>
<p>Of course, you can get an understanding of this by using the sorting filter to see an older ad or one with a lower number of unique users seen.</p>
<p>However, you can also learn which TikTok ad styles may be better performers but don’t align with your brand or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/09/company-core-values" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company core values</a>. That way, you can start to understand which types of TikTok Ads to avoid over others when creating and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-edit-tiktok-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">editing your own TikTok videos</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-sort-features.jpg" alt="tiktok ads library - sorting example" width="645" height="502" class="aligncenter wp-image-75950 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-sort-features.jpg 645w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-sort-features-480x374.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 645px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>3. Peek at your competitors&#8217; TikTok ads</h3>
<p>One of the best parts of the TikTok Ads library? You can search for a specific advertiser&#8217;s name! If you want to go after a competitor and you know their name on TikTok, you can plug it into the “Advertiser name or keyword” field when setting your search parameters. That way, you can see the ads they’ve posted and compare them against your own strategy.</p>
<p>Another approach would be to search by a core keyword term for your business to evaluate any new competitors on TikTok or to simply see the number and quality of TikTok Ads for that particular product or service offering.</p>

<h3>4. Check out stats and set goals</h3>
<p>Another super stellar feature that the TikTok Ads library provides is basic performance stats for each ad. This can give you a real view of how ads like yours should be performing. Try searching for ads within your industry and take note of the number of unique users seen compared to the target audience size on the detail page.</p>
<p>To track your own TikTok Ads performance, you’ll need <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/15/google-ads-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">baseline performance benchmarks</a> to measure your progress against. That way, you can set trackable goals based on the average ad performance within your industry. Using this feature within the TikTok Ads library can help you do just that!</p>

<h3>5. Find popular hashtags</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-use-hashtags-with-hashtag-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hashtags</a> can be added to your TikTok ads to help interested users find your content. When you’re short of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/07/tiktok-hashtags" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok hashtag ideas</a>, the TikTok Ads library can help. When you watch each ad shown in a TikTok Ads library search, you’re able to get an understanding of which captions or core hashtag terms that business might be using. This can help you find new or trending hashtags to use based on other top-performing ads, or it could even inspire you to create your own spin on a popular hashtag.</p>
<h3>6. Get fresh audio ideas</h3>
<p>Since you can playback TikTok ads right from within the TikTok Ads library search results, you can see which audio clips have brought other advertisers positive (or negative) results. This can help you pre-plan which audio you want to use in your next TikTok Ad clips. Additionally, if there’s a trending audio clip that you want to use but can’t think of a video script to go along with it, the TikTok Ads library can help with that, too.</p>
<h3>7. See which trends are coming and going</h3>
<p>There’s nothing more “cringe” (as TikTokers would say) than creating a video based on a popular trend only to find that trend to be considered “old news” by the time it reaches your audience. TikTok trends are always rapidly changing, so you can use the TikTok Ads library to stay up to date on the latest and greatest of TikTok. Use the sort filter to compare and contrast new and old TikTok Ads. This can help you predict what types of TikTok ads will be more or less popular in the future.</p>

<h3>8. Find the right influencer for your business</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/26/influencer-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Influencer marketing</a> is a great way to position your brand on TikTok—especially if you’re struggling to establish a presence on the platform by yourself. However, sourcing influencers willing to partner with you can often be a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small business challenge</a>.</p>
<p>Luckily, many TikTok ads already feature influencers that specialize in creating branded content for businesses. In the TikTok Ads library, if you see a business similar to yours that is leveraging an influencer, that influencer (or other influencers in their circle) could be a potential target for you to partner with!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-tiktok-influencer-ad.jpg" alt="tiktok ads library - tiktok influencer ad example" width="264" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-75959 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-tiktok-influencer-ad.jpg 264w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-tiktok-influencer-ad-132x300.jpg 132w" sizes="(max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An example TikTok Ad created by an influencer rather than the business itself. </em></p>
<h3>9. Source businesses for future partnerships</h3>
<p>Along with influencers to partner with, you can also find businesses to collaborate with through the TikTok Ads library. Try <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteBigEasyKeyword.html?cid=Web_Any_Homepage_PPC_BigEasyKeyword_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">searching for keywords</a> that are complementary to your business and see which businesses are running high-performing ads for that topic.</p>
<p>You could reach out to the business directly or try to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/11/how-to-stitch-on-tiktok" target="_blank" rel="noopener">duet their video</a> to connect with them. From there, you could shout one another out on TikTok or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/01/how-to-go-live-on-tiktok" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go live on TikTok</a> together!</p>
<h3>10. Client prospecting</h3>
<p>Calling all <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/15/ppc-agency-pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PPC agencies</a>! The TikTok Ads library isn’t just for assessing your competition or potential promotional partners. Since you can search for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/tiktok-ads-bidding">TikTok Ads</a> that fit within a certain industry, use this as an opportunity to identify poor-performing ads in your target client’s verticals. This could be a great way to open the door for prospecting since you could use their TikTok Ad to start a conversation about how your agency could help them improve.</p>
<h3>11. Learn new targeting tactics</h3>
<p>Unlike the Facebook Ads library, the TikTok Ads library ad detail pages provide you with information on any given advertiser’s targeting tactics. However, keep in mind that TikTok explains that there may be other targeting parameters involved that aren’t shown on the detail page.</p>
<p>That said, you can get an idea of how other businesses are approaching their TikTok Ad targeting—which can be helpful when you need new ways to show to an ideal audience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-targeting-details.jpg" alt="tiktok ads library - tiktok ad targeting details" width="681" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-75958 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-targeting-details.jpg 681w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiktok-ads-library-targeting-details-480x423.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 681px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>Get ahead with the TikTok Ads library</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With its colossal reach, engaging ad formats, and suite of marketing tools, TikTok is an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/11/advertising-on-tiktok">essential platform</a> for any marketer looking to drive rapid results.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-stats.jpg" alt="tiktok marketing stats" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75576" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-stats.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-stats-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-happens-in-an-internet-minute/#:~:text=TikTok%20statistics&amp;text=In%202022%2C%20TikTok's%20user%20base,post%20across%20social%20media%20sites." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stats source</a></em></p>
<p>But while it’s relatively easy to start using TikTok, mastering the platform is a whole different story.</p>
<p>If you want to maximize your conversions and reduce acquisition costs, then you’ll need to be smart with your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/tiktok-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok marketing strategies</a>. That means refining your audience targeting, leveraging as much data as possible, and crafting TikTok ads that will drive consistent action.</p>
<p>But don’t worry&#8211;you’re in the right place.</p>
<p>We’ve pulled together nine proven TikTok marketing strategies that will help you to reach high-value audiences at scale, dramatically improve cost efficiency, and skyrocket your conversions.</p>
<h2>9 best TikTok marketing strategies</h2>
<p>Use these strategies for improved TikTok marketing and better results.</p>
<h3>1. Include a compelling call to action (CTA)</h3>
<p>This may sound obvious, but the impact of a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/05/best-call-to-action-phrases">strong CTA</a> should never be underestimated.</p>
<p>Your CTA ultimately nudges prospects to the next stage in the customer journey. For instance, let’s say that you’ve captured the interest of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a> with a high-quality video ad&#8211;you’ve showcased your products, highlighted their key benefits, and demonstrated your value as a brand. What comes next?</p>
<p>If your CTA is weak or unclear, customers may scroll through to the next video without a second thought. But if you’ve included a clear and compelling CTA, you’ll be in a great position to increase clicks&#8211;and more importantly, conversions.</p>
<p>Ideally, you should incorporate a CTA into both your TikTok video assets and ad text, as this will increase your chances of driving action. In fact, TikTok platform data shows that CTAs in text format can deliver a staggering <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/creative-that-drives-conversions?redirected=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">152%</a> lift in conversions for marketers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-cta.jpg" alt="tiktok marketing - example of post with in-text cta" width="627" height="593" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75577" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-cta.jpg 627w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-cta-480x454.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 627px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You should also ensure that your CTA slots neatly into the customer experience, creating a seamless user journey.</p>
<p>For example, if you’ll be driving customers directly to a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">landing page</a> where they’ll be prompted to book a call, then “Contact Us” makes a lot more sense than “Shop Now” as a CTA button. The more logical and convenient the customer journey is, the more likely you are to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/31/increase-conversions">increase conversions</a>.</p>
<h3>2. Start with broad targeting and refine</h3>
<p>TikTok offers a wide range of granular, data-driven <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/23/tiktok-ads-targeting">targeting options</a>, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you should always focus on smaller audience segments.</p>
<p>Starting with broad audience targeting is a fantastic way to gather performance insights that can fuel your campaigns and supercharge conversion rates.</p>
<p>But how can broader targeting enable you to reach and convert high-value customers?</p>
<p>It’s all about the <a href="https://searchengineland.com/how-tiktok-algorithm-works-390229" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok algorithm</a>.</p>
<p>Whenever you launch a new TikTok campaign, the algorithm will enter a “<a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/learning-phase?lang=en">Learning Phase</a>.” During this time, the algorithm will expose a range of different audiences to your ads, gathering data on which users are most likely to click and convert. While your CPA may fluctuate in these first few days, it will quickly stabilize once the Learning Phase progresses.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-learning-phase-chart.jpg" alt="tiktok marketing - chart that shows conversions relative to learning phase" width="835" height="398" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75563" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-learning-phase-chart.jpg 835w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-learning-phase-chart-480x229.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 835px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>By starting your campaign with a wider audience, you essentially provide the algorithm with the scale it needs to test, optimize, and evolve.</p>
<p>The more users that can be reached throughout the Learning Phase, the faster the algorithm can identify audiences that are converting from your ads, which is crucial for cost efficiency.</p>
<p>While there’s nothing wrong with focusing on smaller audience segments once you’ve <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gathered sufficient data</a>, it’s a good idea to cast a wider net initially. Not only will this help the algorithm to collect performance insights, but it will also help you to dramatically increase conversions in the long run.</p>
<h3>3. Use full-screen vertical videos</h3>
<p>Here’s a simple <a href="https://upbeatagency.com/tiktok-marketing-strategy/">TikTok strategy</a> that can make a big difference to your conversion rates.</p>
<p>Whenever you’re creating new <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/tiktok-ad-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok ads</a>, make sure that you’re producing full-screen vertical videos that are tailored to the platform.</p>
<p>The vast majority of TikTok users consume content in portrait mode, so if you want to drive engagement and boost conversions, you’ll need to reflect this in your creative assets. By shooting and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-edit-tiktok-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">editing TikTok videos</a> in a 9:16 aspect ratio, you can maximize the creative space you have available and increase the impact of your visual assets.</p>
<p>Not only will full-screen vertical videos appear more native to the TikTok platform, but they’ll also feel more natural for your target audience to engage with. TikTok users tend to respond to content that feels authentic, and your video production is a major factor here.</p>
<p>TikTok data even suggests that videos shot in a 9:16 aspect ratio see a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/creative-that-drives-conversions?redirected=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">91%</a> lift in conversions, so if you want to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/31/buying-motives">generate more sales</a>, think carefully about your creative approach.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-creative.jpg" alt="tiktok marketing - example of tiktok creative" width="853" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75564" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-creative.jpg 853w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-creative-480x338.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 853px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-GB/inspiration/mancave-tiktok-success-story" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Source</i></a></p>
<h3>4. Unlock the full potential of A/B testing</h3>
<p>A/B testing (also known as split testing) is a surefire way to improve your TikTok marketing performance and increase your conversion rates.</p>
<p>With a consistent, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/20/ppc-campaign-testing-tips">data-driven testing strategy</a>, you can begin to identify the best-performing elements of your current TikTok marketing campaigns while also removing inefficient tactics. But that’s not all&#8211;with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/11/copywriting-ab-tests">A/B testing</a>, you’ll also be able to discover brand new audiences and strategies that help you to drive <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/03/improve-conversion-rates">high-value conversions</a>.</p>
<p>There are many different variables that you can split test on TikTok, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ad formats</li>
<li>Audience targeting</li>
<li>CTAs</li>
<li>Creative assets</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/21/emotional-ad-copy-examples">Ad copy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/tiktok-ads-bidding">Bidding tactics</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The TikTok marketing landscape is constantly shifting. Audience behaviors change, different content trends emerge, and new tools are released. A/B testing enables you to stay ahead of the curve and constantly evolve your strategy to maximize conversions.</p>
<p>Plus, setting up A/B tests on TikTok is a breeze. You can create split tests directly through the TikTok Ads Manager&#8211;just follow <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/create-split-test?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this guide</a> for more information.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-split-test.jpg" alt="tiktok marketing - split test set up in tiktok ads manager" width="857" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75580" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-split-test.jpg 857w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-split-test-480x336.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 857px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>5. Run short and snappy creative assets</h3>
<p>TikTok users tend to engage with video content that’s short and sweet, so if you want to generate more conversions, you’ll need to adapt your creative assets accordingly.</p>
<p>While it may be tempting to cram your TikTok ads with product details and selling points, shorter assets will perform infinitely better than long-winded videos. TikTok data shows that video ads between 21-34 seconds in length achieve a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/creative-that-drives-conversions?redirected=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">280%</a> lift in conversions compared to longer videos, so always keep this in mind when you’re producing content.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-shorter-video-content.jpg" alt="tiktok marketing - post shorter content - example from running coach" width="360" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75578" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-shorter-video-content.jpg 360w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-shorter-video-content-180x300.jpg 180w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></p>
<p>But how can you ensure that you’re creating punchy video assets while still delivering compelling messages? Here are some best practices to keep you on the right track:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Drill down to your most persuasive product benefits. </strong>Think about a central <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/20/product-positioning">product message</a> that will resonate with your target audience and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-pain-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resolve their problems</a>. Remember, it’s all about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/06/how-to-market-a-product">showcasing relevant benefits</a> rather than basic features.</li>
<li><strong>Refine your video assets and product messages. </strong>Don’t rush the creative process and overload your videos with weak content. Trim the fat, edit your content meticulously, and don’t hesitate to enlist the help of professional creatives/<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/19/copywriting-skills">copywriters</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on a high-impact CTA. </strong>Your CTA is the finishing touch on your video ads and will ultimately encourage your target audience to take action. Highlight your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">key product benefits</a>, prove how they’re relevant to your customers, and drive conversions with a strong CTA.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2"></ol>
<ol start="3"></ol>
<p>Reducing the length of your videos and refining your product messaging can be difficult, but short and snappy assets will help you to drive significantly more conversions on TikTok.</p>
<h3>6. Leverage Custom Audiences on TikTok</h3>
<p>Standard TikTok audiences can deliver great results for your business.</p>
<p>But if you really want to skyrocket performance and scale up your conversions, Custom Audiences are the way to go.</p>
<p>TikTok Custom Audiences are segments built using your own data, enabling you to target hot prospects that are already familiar with your brand, website, or products and used for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/16/tiktok-vs-instagram-reels-ads">TikTok advertising</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-custom-audiences.jpg" alt="tiktok marketing - set up custom audience" width="936" height="551" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75579" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-custom-audiences.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-custom-audiences-480x283.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/custom-audiences?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>Since Custom Audiences have already expressed interest in your product offering, they’re significantly more likely to click and convert. This is great news for your conversion rate, allowing you to launch highly effective retargeting strategies that increase sales and reduce acquisition costs.</p>
<p>These are the different Custom Audiences available on TikTok:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer File.</strong> Upload your own customer files to target existing customers through TikTok.</li>
<li><strong>Engagement.</strong> Retarget users who have previously engaged with your ad campaigns.</li>
<li><strong>App Activity.</strong> Retarget users who have completed specific actions on your app.</li>
<li><strong>Website Traffic.</strong> Retarget users who have visited (or completed a specific action on) your website.</li>
<li><strong>Lead Generation.</strong> Retarget users who have engaged with your Lead Generation ads/completed a lead form.</li>
<li><strong>Business Account Audience.</strong> Retarget users who have engaged with your TikTok account/organic content.</li>
</ul>
<p>Custom Audiences can be incredibly powerful for TikTok marketers as they allow you to target high-value prospects at scale. Since you already know these users are familiar with your brand, you can lead with more sales-driven messaging to generate conversions.</p>
<p>If you’re seeing strong performance with Custom Audiences, you can also leverage <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/lookalike-audience?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lookalike Audiences</a> to increase reach while maintaining a focus on quality targeting.</p>
<p>Lookalikes are essentially users who share common traits with your existing customers, meaning they’re highly likely to engage with your TikTok ads and purchase your products.</p>
<h3>7. Produce high-resolution video ads</h3>
<p>There are plenty of data-driven tactics that can help you to drive more conversions on TikTok, from retargeting Custom Audiences to running A/B tests.</p>
<p>However, sometimes it’s the simple things that can make a big difference to your conversion rate&#8211; for instance, the quality of your <a href="https://localiq.com/products/video-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video ads</a>.</p>
<p>TikTok is a highly competitive marketing platform, and if you want to capture the attention of your target audience, then you’ll need to ensure you’re making a strong impression. Users are constantly scrolling through fresh content from publishers, advertisers, and regular accounts&#8211;if you’re running low-quality assets, you may find yourself being overlooked.</p>
<p>To help you maximize audience engagement and stand out in a cluttered feed, be sure to produce high-resolution TikTok video ads that feel polished.</p>
<p>Not only will high-resolution video ads look more appealing to potential customers, but they’ll also have a direct impact on your conversion rates. TikTok data shows that videos shot at 720p resolution (or higher) see a staggering <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/creative-that-drives-conversions?redirected=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">312%</a> lift in conversions compared to lower-resolution assets.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/creative-that-drives-conversions?redirected=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Source</i></a></p>
<h3>8. Set up a frictionless customer journey</h3>
<p>It’s not just your activity within the TikTok app that will affect your conversion rates. You’ll also need to optimize the wider customer experience to maximize results.</p>
<p>Think carefully about how consumers will engage with your TikTok ads, interact with your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/18/website-maintenance">website</a>, and explore your products.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/the-buyers-journey.jpg" alt="buyers journey from awareness to retention" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75582" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/the-buyers-journey.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/the-buyers-journey-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>A disjointed <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/19/customer-journey-map-templates">customer journey</a> is a surefire way to deter potential customers from making a purchase. For example, if you’re sending users to a landing page that doesn’t align with your ad messaging, they’re likely to feel confused and frustrated.</p>
<p>If prospects click a “Learn More’” CTA, they’ll want to discover more information about your products. If they click “Buy Now,” they’ll probably want to reach the checkout as quickly as possible. Make sure that you’re building a seamless user journey that feels convenient and intuitive, with fast-loading pages and a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/15/website-accessibility">clear website structure</a> that’s easy to navigate.</p>
<p>By removing as many barriers as possible across the customer journey, you can increase conversions and drastically improve the efficiency of your TikTok campaigns.</p>
<h3>9. Remain diligent with campaign optimizations</h3>
<p>Finally, make sure that you’re constantly looking out for opportunities to <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/optimize-tiktok-ads/466735/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optimize your TikTok ads</a>, remove inefficient strategies, and experiment with new tactics.</p>
<p>Consistent optimizations are key for improving performance over time, so getting comfortable with the TikTok Ads Manager is hugely important. If you’re not able to identify the ad types or audiences that are driving the most conversions, it’s going to be very difficult to refine your strategy and improve ROI.</p>
<p>Stay focused on your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">core metrics</a> (e.g., conversions, CPA) and utilize custom report templates to make the optimization process simpler.</p>
<p>It’s also vital to give the TikTok algorithm time to test, learn, and optimize whenever you launch a new campaign. Although it can be tempting to interfere when performance is fluctuating, implementing optimizations is much easier when the algorithm has gathered conversion data and identified profitable audiences.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are several reports that collectively reviewed thousands of posts to determine the best average time to post on TikTok. Those stats are interesting, but they’re not meant to be the foundation of your long-term TikTok strategy.</p>
<p>Why? Because your business isn’t average.</p>
<p>You have unique customers and followers with their own online habits—stay-at-home parents don’t peruse social media at the same time as most restaurant workers. So what really matters is posting your wonderfully creative content to TikTok when <em>your</em> audience will see it (and love it, like it, and share it!).</p>
<p>And that’s just what we’ll help you do here. By the end of this guide, you’ll be able to make a data-backed determination of the best TikTok posting schedule tailored for your business. Even better, you’ll have a strategy to improve engagement with your posts over time.</p>

<div id="matter"></div>
<h2>Does it really matter what time you post on TikTok?</h2>
<p>You bet it does. But only if you’re posting quality content that’s relevant to your audience.</p>
<p>It goes like this. Every time someone opens TikTok, the first thing they see is a curated collection of content from new (to them) creators called the For You Page (FYP). <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/07/how-to-get-on-tiktok-fyp">Land a spot on the coveted “For You Page”</a> and your organic reach goes through the roof!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TikTok-times-TikTok-for-you-1.jpg" alt="Best times to post on TikTok - Screenshow of a TikTok post from the For You Page" width="305" height="594" class="aligncenter wp-image-72521 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TikTok-times-TikTok-for-you-1.jpg 305w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TikTok-times-TikTok-for-you-1-154x300.jpg 154w" sizes="(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px" /></p>
<p>The TikTok algorithm uses two signals to decide what to place on the FYP. The post has to share some characteristics (music, topic, etc.) with content the user previously engaged with. And it needs enough engagement to prove that people will like it.</p>
<p>The second one is where timing comes in. If you post fresh content when your current users are most likely plugged in, it’ll get more early engagement. Then that post has a better shot at being discovered on FYPs.</p>
<p>So don’t skimp on what you post. But make sure to share it at the right time.</p>
<h2>What’s the best time to post on TikTok?</h2>
<p>The best time to post on TikTok depends on when your unique audience is thumbing through videos. You’ll learn when that is after posting some content (we’ll show you how in a bit).</p>
<p>But where do you start if you don’t have data yet? Let’s use a few recent studies to help us pick times to post your first TikToks.</p>
<p>Each study came up with a slightly different answer. So we’ll triangulate based on all three to get the best options.</p>
<p>Here are the absolute best times to post on TikTok according to each study:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/best-time-to-post-on-tiktok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hootsuite</a>: 7 p.m. on Thursday</li>
<li><a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/best-times-to-post-on-tiktok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sprout Social</a>: 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Tuesday</li>
<li><a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/best-times-to-post-on-tiktok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Influencer Hub</a>: 9 a.m. on Tuesday, 12 a.m. on Thursday, and 5 a.m. on Friday</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s a pretty big spread. But if you look at where things do intersect, we can draw a few conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weekdays beat weekends by a long shot</li>
<li>Before work and at the end of the traditional workday are safe bets</li>
<li>Tuesday and Thursday are the best overall days to post</li>
</ul>
<p>The results don&#8217;t mean you should only post on Tuesdays and Thursdays. TikTok recommends releasing new content up to four times each day, so plan to spread them around a little. Especially as you learn when your audience is most active.</p>
<h3>Best time to post on TikTok by day</h3>
<p>The Influencer Marketing Hub study is based on 100,000 posts—more than the others. So we’re using it to inform our daily TikTok schedule. Note that these times are all Eastern Standard Time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/how-to-get-on-tiktok-fyp-best-time-to-post-tiktok.png" alt="best time to post on tiktok" width="720" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-65211" /></p>
<h4>Best time to post on TikTok on Monday</h4>
<p>6 a.m., 10 a.m., and 10 p.m. are the best times to post on Monday. Seems like people want to wind up their week and wind down their Monday on TikTok.</p>
<h4>Best time to post on TikTok on Tuesday</h4>
<p>2 a.m., 4 a.m., and 9 a.m. are the top times to post on Tuesday. There’s also particularly high engagement at 9 a.m., so schedule some content then.</p>
<h4>Best time to post on TikTok on Wednesday</h4>
<p>7 a.m., 8 a.m., and 11 p.m. are the best target times for posting on Wednesday. Similar to Monday, people want to start and end their day watching short-form videos.</p>
<h4>Best time to post on TikTok on Thursday</h4>
<p>9 a.m., 12 p.m., and 7 p.m. are your best bets for posting on Thursday. Engagement is high at noon, so it’s a good time to catch people dreaming about the weekend.</p>
<h4>Best time to post on TikTok on Friday</h4>
<p>5 a.m., 1 p.m., and 4 p.m. rank highest for posting on Friday. That makes sense since people are often doing fun stuff instead of watching TikTok on Friday night.</p>
<h4>Best time to post on TikTok on Saturday</h4>
<p>11 a.m., 7 p.m., and 8 p.m. is when you’ll want to target your first few Saturday posts. Interesting that fewer people are watching early on Saturday. They&#8217;re either up and going or recovering from Friday night.</p>
<h4>Best time to post on TikTok on Sunday</h4>
<p>7 a.m., 8 a.m., and 4 p.m. are the best options for posting on Sunday. That afternoon slot is a good time to help people chase away the Sunday scaries.</p>
<p>Here’s a handy chart to keep it all straight.</p>

<h2>When’s the worst time to post on TikTok?</h2>
<p>Knowing when not to post is as important as knowing when to post. According to Influencer Marketing Hub’s data, the worst times to post on TikTok are:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 p.m., 6 p.m., and 9 p.m. on any day of the week</li>
<li>10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Sunday through Wednesday</li>
<li>12 a.m. to 4 a.m. on Friday through Monday</li>
<li>Any time after 9 a.m. on Tuesday</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that this data is based on worldwide usage. Your results are going to change depending on your audience’s time zone. In fact, there are several factors to consider as you dial in your own TikTok schedule.</p>
<div id="business"></div>
<h2>How to find the best time to post on TikTok for your business</h2>
<p>The averages above will give you a target to use as you start out on TikTok. But the real magic happens as you gather data from your posts. That’s when you learn all about your audience&#8217;s habits so you can catch them as they scroll.</p>
<h3>Know your audience</h3>
<p>This is a must in any <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">social media marketing strategy</a>. It’s also really helpful to picture when your potential customers are likely to view your posts.</p>
<p>Start by creating <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/23/buyer-personas">personas</a> and then imagining their typical day. When are their busy times, downtimes, bored times, stressed times, and social times?</p>
<p>For example, if your target audience is kids, right after school might be prime time for TikTok. But if working professionals are who you want to engage, lunchtime or late at night is probably better.</p>
<p>Knowing this will help you get a ballpark range as to when they’re most likely to be on TikTok, as well as what some of the themes in your content should be.</p>
<h3>Access analytics from a Pro account</h3>
<p>A TikTok Pro account is free and easy to set up. Go to your profile, tap the <strong>hamburger icon</strong> in the top right, and select<strong> Privacy and settings</strong>. Tap <strong>Switch to Pro Account</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TikTok-times-setup-pro-account.png" alt="Best time to post on TikTok - screenshots showing how to create a pro account on TikTok" width="720" height="475" class="aligncenter wp-image-72523 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TikTok-times-setup-pro-account.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TikTok-times-setup-pro-account-480x317.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Once you’re set up, you can access analytics by tapping on that same <strong>hamburger icon</strong>, then <strong>Privacy and settings</strong>, then <strong>Analytics</strong>. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview:</strong> video views, profile views, and follower count over the past seven or 28 days.</li>
<li><strong>Content:</strong> views from each video in the past seven days, which ones have been on the FYP, and individual insights for each video (more on that soon).</li>
<li><strong>Followers:</strong> top territories, gender, total count, and the holy grail&#8211;peak engagement time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Learn what time zone your audience is in</h3>
<p>If you run a business based in New York but most of your customers are located on the West Coast, you’ll miss the mark posting for the Eastern time zone. While setting your TikTok schedule, make sure you consider where your audience lives.</p>
<p>The answers will come from your own experience. If you’re a local service business or you ship the majority of your product to a particular area, you know which time zone to target.</p>
<p>Using this intel, adjust your posting times to the right time zone.</p>
<h3>See when your audience is most engaged</h3>
<p>TikTok analytics also make it easy to tell when your current followers are most active.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TikTok-times-analtycs-user-active-times.png" alt="Best time to post on TikTok - analytics screenshot highlighting when users are active" width="500" height="867" class="aligncenter wp-image-72525 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TikTok-times-analtycs-user-active-times.png 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TikTok-times-analtycs-user-active-times-480x832.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/tiktok-content-strategy/understanding-your-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>A word of caution. Just like the research we reviewed before, this data is more of a starting point than a conclusion. Just because your followers are most active at 6 p.m. doesn’t mean you should always post at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>In his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOYXvMGi5_M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube video on TikTok analytics</a>, Owen Video shares his strategy. If 6 p.m. is peak attention time, he’ll post on TikTok around 1 p.m. That gives his video time to collect engagement and then peak at the perfect point.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TikTok-times-analtyics-prepost.png" alt="Best time to post on TikTok - Analytics graph showing how a post at 1pm is seen at 6 pm" width="480" height="343" class="aligncenter wp-image-72526 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TikTok-times-analtyics-prepost.png 480w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TikTok-times-analtyics-prepost-300x214.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></p>
<p>This is where a little trial, review, and improve comes in.</p>
<h3>Track your best posts</h3>
<p>They always say, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” <em>They</em> were probably talking about using your most successful TikTok posts as a guide to when you should post future content.</p>
<p>But you don’t want to have to check dozens of posts individually.</p>
<p>Luckily, there’s a nifty way to do this en masse using the <strong>desktop version of TikTok</strong>. Just hover over your profile picture in the top right and click “view analytics.” Then download it all to a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>When you export the data, you’ll get one view to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Day and time posted</li>
<li>Likes</li>
<li>Comments</li>
<li>Shares</li>
<li>Average watch time</li>
<li>Views</li>
<li>Traffic source (FYP or followers)</li>
<li>Territories reached</li>
</ul>
<p>Look for patterns in your posts that match up to when they were posted. Bonus: you’ll see which types of content are best, too.</p>
<h3>Look at your other social media platform analytics</h3>
<p>If you’re just starting out with TikTok, you might not have enough data to work with yet. In the meantime, check out the analytics of your other social media channels to see when they’re most active.</p>
<p>We’ve seen that Instagram and TikTok users are on at different times, so you won’t be able to mimic the schedule for each. Instead, learn about your audience (who they are, where they’re from, etc.) on those other channels. And use that info to make a more educated guess about your ideal times to post on TikTok.</p>
<p>You can also use a social <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/17/best-free-social-media-management-tools">media management tool</a>. Some include recommended times to post based on past engagement and views.</p>

<h3>Review your competitors</h3>
<p>No two accounts are the same, but you’ll get a general idea of when to post by looking at accounts that are popular with your target audience. Especially if they’ve been around a while.</p>
<p>It’s easy to see when each video was posted and how popular it is.</p>

<p>Some audiences will behave much differently in summer than in winter—like parents with school-aged children. At the same time, online habits on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/28/memorial-day-messages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Memorial</a> or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/12/labor-day-messages-greetings">Labor Day</a> may look more like a weekend than most Mondays.</p>
<p>Keep these temporary changes of behavior in mind when planning the timing and content of your posts. And pay attention to how they affect your results so you’re even better prepared the next time they roll around.</p>

<h2>8 other ways to get more engagement on TikTok</h2>
<p>Successful TikTok marketing is all about the right content at the right time. We’ve covered the right time, now let’s talk about the right content.</p>
<h3>1. Go for creative relatability</h3>
<p>People are complicated. We love a surprise but at the same time like familiarity too (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/23/influence-buyers-marketing-psychology">more marketing psychology here</a>). And TikTok seems to be the place where the two come together.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.agilitypr.com/pr-news/public-relations/preparing-for-tiktok-in-2022-3-tips-for-maximizing-the-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with Agility PR</a>, creator Grace Hayes talks about the “’shareable sweetspot,’ combining relatability with something that’s never been done before. The Internet loves the unexpected.”</p>
<h3>2. Use the headline approach</h3>
<p>What makes a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/07/17/headline-writing">great headline </a>that draws you in before you skip past it? It strikes a chord by providing just enough information to capture you but not enough—leaving you to want more and click to get it. Headlines that hook tend to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bold claims</li>
<li>Questions</li>
<li>Surprising facts</li>
<li>Emotional</li>
</ul>
<p>And since this is video, throw some music, movement, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">emotion</a> in there, and you’ve got your viewers hooked.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@moneycoachvince/video/7055268544241650990?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id6992965571860104710" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>Here are some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/01/headline-examples">headline examples and templates</a> to inspire your TikTok videos:</p>

<li>This is why I don’t _______.</li>
<li>Everything you know about _____ is wrong.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3"></ol>
<h3>3. Don’t just dance</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/hooks-of-viral-tiktoks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study by Semrush</a> found that while popular dance videos receive more plays than other genres, they also receive fewer shares and comments. In fact, &#8220;more than 1 in 3 viral TikTok videos focused on a person speaking within the first three seconds.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TikTok-times-TikTok-SEMrush-viral-stats.jpg" alt="Best time to post in TikTok - Graph showing the most popular TikTok formats" width="723" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-72529 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TikTok-times-TikTok-SEMrush-viral-stats.jpg 723w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TikTok-times-TikTok-SEMrush-viral-stats-480x398.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 723px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>4. Shorter is still often better</h3>
<p>TikTok continues to increase the allowable length of videos on its platform (it’s now up to 10 minutes). While you can and should experiment with longer-format content, the conventional wisdom—as <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-wants-longer-videos-like-not/#:~:text=By%20November%202021%2C%20the%20optimal%20recommended%20video%20length,had%20doubled%20to%20between%2021%20and%2034%20seconds." target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested by TikTok in 2021</a>—is that videos between 21 and 34 seconds are best.</p>
<p>TikTok Live, of course, is an exception. You can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/01/how-to-go-live-on-tiktok">learn how to go live on TikTok here</a>.</p>
<h3>5. Stay positive</h3>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s important to lead with emotion. But on TikTok, that emotion should be happy, positive, or funny. That same study by Semrush found that 58% of viral videos skewed towards humor and happiness.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TikTok-times-graph-genres.png" alt="Best time to post in TikTok - Graph showing the most popular TikTok grenres" width="720" height="574" class="aligncenter wp-image-72530 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TikTok-times-graph-genres.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TikTok-times-graph-genres-480x383.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>6. Get into a rhythm (pun not intended)</h3>
<p>The more videos you post, the more likely you are to show up on someone’s FYP right? Yes and no. TikTok recommends posting 1-4 times per day. But don’t just post just to post. Find a format, theme, or genre that people like and that you can create variations on. Then only post when you have crowd-pleasing content. You can get even <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/tiktok-marketing-for-small-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more TikTok marketing tips here.</a></p>
<h3>7. Hop on trends/challenges</h3>
<p>Going against the grain isn’t the name of the game on TikTok. Use viral sounds, participate in challenges, do the duets, embrace it all. TikTok songs are like Instagram hashtags. They are portals to endless threads of videos that just may lead a viewer to yours. And use hashtags too.</p>
<h3>8. Don’t try too hard</h3>
<p>At the end of the day, TikTok is a place for happiness, humor, and relatability. Forcing any one of these things has the opposite effect. Don’t stress, be yourself, and actually have fun. This will reflect in your content and resonate with viewers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TikTok-times-TikTok-tries-too-hard-1.jpg" alt="Best times to post on TikTok - screenshot of a TikTok joking about people who try too hard" width="392" height="594" class="aligncenter wp-image-72531 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TikTok-times-TikTok-tries-too-hard-1.jpg 392w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TikTok-times-TikTok-tries-too-hard-1-198x300.jpg 198w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px" /></p>

<h3>How often should you post on TikTok?</h3>
<p>TikTok recommends that you post between 1 &#8211; 4 times per day. Just like posting times, post frequency will be individual to your business and audience. Test out more and fewer posts to find the sweet spot. But prioritize quality over quantity—posting more bad content will hurt your business faster.</p>
<h3>How do you get popular on TikTok?</h3>
<p>Picking the right times to post is one step.

<h2>When’s the best time to post on TikTok? [Recap]</h2>
<p>TikTok has a large audience and high organic reach. To engage as many people on the platform as possible, you’ll need to post the right content, at the right frequency, at the right time.</p>
<p>Finding the right time for your business to post on TikTok will take some testing. But before you have data, you can aim for the best average time, which is Tuesdays and Thursdays, before and after the traditional workday.</p>

<h2>6 proven techniques for ultra-effective TikTok ads targeting</h2>
<p>Use these data-backed tactics for your TikTok ad targeting.</p>
<h3>1. Leverage your existing customer data</h3>
<p>Before you start planning your next TikTok campaign, think carefully about the data you currently have on your audience.</p>
<p>If you’re running an ecommerce business, you may already be sitting on a goldmine of audience insights and data signals.</p>
<p>For example, you might be able to delve into your internal data to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">understand the demographic profiles of your existing customers</a>. If you can identify the age, gender, and locations of your most valuable shoppers, then you already have plenty of fuel to power your TikTok ads targeting.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/munro-buyer-persona-example.jpg" alt="example of a visual buyer persona from munro" width="751" height="597" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71248" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/munro-buyer-persona-example.jpg 751w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/munro-buyer-persona-example-480x382.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 751px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/23/buyer-personas">Buyer personas</a> can also help inform your TikTok ads targeting.</em></p>
<p>You may even spot patterns around products that are appealing to specific types of shoppers, which can also help to shape your creative messaging.</p>
<p>Now, this isn’t to say that your future customers will necessarily be identical to your current audience.</p>
<p>You might discover entirely new audience segments on TikTok that are generating huge amounts of revenue, which is the beauty of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">social media marketing</a>. Plus, experimenting with different targeting tactics is a surefire way to improve results over time.</p>
<p>However, if you can hit the ground running by utilizing your existing <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer data</a> to inform your TikTok audiences, you’ll be in a good position to drive strong performance.</p>

<h3>2. Utilize interest and behavior targeting</h3>
<p>TikTok attracts <a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/charts/global-tiktok-user-stats/#:~:text=TikTok%20will%20have%20834.3%20million,phenomenon%20has%20been%20incredibly%20quick." target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 830 million</a> monthly active users, which is a jaw-dropping <a href="https://upbeatagency.com/tiktok-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statistic</a>.</p>
<p>On the one hand, this is great news for marketers. You can reach a colossal audience of potential customers, and there’s plenty of opportunity for you to scale up your campaigns.</p>
<p>However, this also means that you need to tighten up your TikTok ads targeting as much as possible to avoid high volumes of wasted impressions.</p>
<p>Leveraging interest and behavior targeting is a great way to ensure that you’re reaching relevant and receptive TikTok audiences.</p>
<p><a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/interest-targeting?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Interest targeting</a> allows advertisers to target users based on their long-term interests and passions. You can target audiences based on broad interest categories (e.g. gaming, food, finance) but the TikTok algorithm will also suggest associated interests to broaden reach.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/behavior-targeting?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">behavior targeting</a>, you can reach users based on recent actions, such as commenting on a specific profile or sharing a particular type of video content.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiktok-ads-targeting-behavior-targeting.jpg" alt="tiktok ads targeting - interesting and behavior targeting in tiktok" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72185" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiktok-ads-targeting-behavior-targeting.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiktok-ads-targeting-behavior-targeting-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/interest-targeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>Combining these two strategies will enable you to target relevant (and valuable) audiences.</p>
<p>For instance, if you’re a brand selling gym attire, then you could target interest categories such as ‘Apparel &amp; Accessories’ and ‘Sports &amp; Outdoors’ to find users that are likely to be interested in your products. You might also target users that have liked videos from well-known gym brands, as there’s a good chance that they’ll be open to your messaging.</p>
<p>Although these are relatively broad targeting tactics, the TikTok algorithm will be able to identify the best-performing segments within these groups, meaning you can effectively optimize your ads over time to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/03/improve-conversion-rates">maximize conversions</a>.</p>
<p>Think about it this way&#8211;interest and behavior targeting allow you to cast a wide net and reach users that are more likely to be interested in your brand.</p>
<p>Once you’ve gathered some performance data based on these larger audiences, you can refine your targeting, allow the TikTok algorithm to work its magic, and increase your ROI.</p>
<h3>3. Harness the power of Custom Audiences</h3>
<p>Custom Audiences are one of the most powerful tools available to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/11/advertising-on-tiktok">advertisers on TikTok</a>.</p>
<p>In basic terms, <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/custom-audiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Custom Audiences</a> allow you to target users that have already interacted with your brand in some way. These audiences are aware of your business, so you can focus on more action-led messaging to drive performance.</p>
<p>That means you can instantly engage hot prospects that are infinitely more likely to purchase your products, which is a game-changer for cost efficiency.</p>
<p>There are several different types of Custom Audiences available on TikTok, and selecting the right strategy is key to success. Marketers can choose to build the following segments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer File:</strong> Upload your customer data to match and target TikTok accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Engagement:</strong> Retarget users that have previously engaged with your video ads.</li>
<li><strong>App Activity</strong>: Retarget users that have completed a specific action within your app.</li>
<li><strong>Lead Generation:</strong> Retarget users that have engaged with your <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/lead-generation-objective?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lead Generation ads</a> on TikTok.</li>
<li><strong>Website Traffic:</strong> Retarget users that have visited (or taken a specific action on) your website.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiktok-ads-targeting-custom-website-audience.jpg" alt="tiktok ads targeting - custom audiences for website traffic custom audience in tiktok ads" width="936" height="512" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72181" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiktok-ads-targeting-custom-website-audience.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiktok-ads-targeting-custom-website-audience-480x263.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/custom-audiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>All of these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/01/15/retargeting-ads">retargeting strategies</a> can be extremely effective at generating clicks and conversions since you’re reaching users that have already engaged with your business.</p>
<p>When it comes to targeting high-value prospects on TikTok, it doesn’t get much better than Custom Audiences.</p>
<p>You can also utilize different Custom Audiences depending on your main objective, but always make sure that you’re taking full advantage of these data-driven targeting segments.</p>
<h3>4. Capitalize on Lookalike segments</h3>
<p>Custom Audiences can deliver outstanding results for TikTok advertisers&#8211;but what if we told you that you could make them even more effective?</p>
<p><a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/lookalike-audience?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lookalike Audiences</a> allow you to effectively extend the reach of your Custom Audiences by identifying and targeting similar users.</p>
<p>The TikTok algorithm will analyze a few common attributes across your Custom Audiences (e.g. operating device, demographics, interests) and locate user groups with the same profiles.</p>
<p>If you’ve already discovered profitable TikTok audiences, why not make the most of them?</p>
<p>By building Lookalike segments, you can rapidly increase reach while still maintaining a clear focus on quality.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiktok-ads-targeting-lookalike-audience.jpg" alt="tiktok ads targeting - lookalike audiences" width="936" height="541" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72182" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiktok-ads-targeting-lookalike-audience.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiktok-ads-targeting-lookalike-audience-480x277.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This is a fantastic way to leverage data about your high-value prospects and expand the scale of your TikTok campaigns.</p>
<p>You can use TikTok Lookalike Audiences in a few different ways to drive performance:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the beginning of a new campaign, launching Lookalikes helps the TikTok algorithm collect audience insights and optimize ads faster.</li>
<li>If you feel like you’re peaking in terms of conversion volumes, you can utilize Lookalike Audiences to expand reach and generate incremental sales.</li>
<li>Finally, if campaign performance is beginning to slow down, you can use Lookalikes to stretch out ad delivery and deliver additional impressions.</li>
</ul>
<p>A combination of data-driven Custom Audiences and tactical Lookalike Audiences is guaranteed to identify cost-effective prospects on TikTok.</p>
<h3>5. Analyze performance data and then optimize</h3>
<p>Implementing the above targeting strategies will help you to reach and convert valuable TikTok audiences&#8211;but if you want to maximize performance, you’ll need to stay close to your reporting data.</p>
<p>By constantly analyzing your campaign data and implementing optimizations, you’ll be able to focus on your most profitable audiences and significantly improve ROI.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on the delivery of different audience segments to understand your best-performing tactics. Trust what the data is telling you and be decisive with your optimizations.</p>

<p>Don’t hesitate to adjust your TikTok ad budgets. Bolster profitable audiences with incremental spend and pause underperforming segments.</p>
<p>Your ideal TikTok audiences are out there&#8211;you just need to work diligently and optimize your campaigns until you find them.</p>
<p>To further enhance your TikTok targeting, you should also put <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/tiktok-pixel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok pixel</a> data to good use whenever possible. The pixel will provide you with incredibly useful insights about audience performance, helping you to establish the users that are completing purchases, generating revenue, and driving the best ROI.</p>
<p>Try to avoid making assumptions about your preferred audiences based on clicks alone.</p>
<p>If you dig deeper into your pixel data and calculate the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/16/return-on-ad-spend-roas">return on ad spend (ROAS)</a> you’re seeing from different targeting segments, you’ll discover the best-performing audiences in no time.</p>
<h3>6. Use A/B testing to fuel superior targeting</h3>
<p>One of the fastest ways to enhance your TikTok audience targeting is to utilize <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/02/26/ab-testing-best-practices">A/B testing</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/split-testing?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Split Testing tool</a> (available in the <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok Ads Manager</a>) allows marketers to quickly set up A/B tests and monitor the results in real time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiktok-ads-targeting-split-testing.jpg" alt="tiktok ads targeting - split testing tool in tiktok" width="896" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72184" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiktok-ads-targeting-split-testing.jpg 896w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiktok-ads-targeting-split-testing-480x321.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 896px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>By A/B testing different audience segments, you can rapidly compare performance and establish your best-performing strategies. The TikTok platform will ensure that your test audiences run with sufficient (and fair) budgets, and a ‘winning’ ad group will only be confirmed if the results are statistically significant.</p>
<p>If you’re keen to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/20/ppc-campaign-testing-tips">experiment with a new audience targeting strategy</a>, A/B testing is a brilliant way to gather results quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>However, there are a few best practices to keep in mind when you’re planning to launch A/B tests on TikTok.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t launch too many tests at the same time, or you may find yourself drowning in data and struggling to make the right adjustments.</li>
<li>Stay diligent with campaign analysis. A/B tests are only effective if you track performance and optimize accordingly, so keep an eye on your reports.</li>
<li>Give the TikTok algorithm space to work. Be patient with your tests, and don’t interfere with your audiences until you’ve gathered reliable data.</li>
<li>Ensure that all of your test audiences have a healthy budget. You’ll only be able to gather targeting insights if you have enough campaign data to review!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can stick to a consistent TikTok A/B testing strategy, you’ll find it much easier to refine your audience targeting and scale up your conversions.
