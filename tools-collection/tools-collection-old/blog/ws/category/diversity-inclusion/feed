<h3>Native American Heritage Month</h3>
<p>If you’re hoping to incorporate Native American Heritage Month into your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/31/diversity-equity-inclusion-resources">diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts</a> this season, you’ll be in good company as The Library of Congress, National Archives and Records Administration, National Endowment for the Humanities, National Gallery of Art, National Park Service, Smithsonian Insituation, and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum all regularly pay homage to this November monthly observance.</p>
<p>Native American Heritage Month is observed annually every November, and it celebrates the contributions the first Americans made towards the growth of the United States. It also honors and reflects on the struggles indigenous American people have endured.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/native-american-heritage-month-tweet.png" alt="native american heritage month tweet" width="500" height="445" class="size-full wp-image-67283 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/native-american-heritage-month-tweet.png 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/native-american-heritage-month-tweet-480x427.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>National Day of Mourning</h3>
<p>A historically accurate description of Thanksgiving would include the reality of its damaging impact on Native American people, which is why we have the National Day of Mourning every year on Thanksgiving—to remind us of the pain Native American people have gone through, and still may be feeling today.</p>
<p>Here are some ideas for ways your business can pay its respects to Native American Heritage Month as well as the National Day of Mourning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amplify the voices of Native Americans by handing off your Instagram account to a Native American in your community for a day-long “takeover.” They can then go live on your stories or share posts about what Native American Heritage month means to them.</li>
<li>Loop Native American Heritage month and the National Day of Mourning into your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/01/thanksgiving-greetings-messages">Thanksgiving messaging </a>by sharing more concious content around the holiday’s impact on Native American people.</li>
<li>Check out the <a href="https://www.sba.gov/about-sba/organization/observances/native-american-heritage-month" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free Native American Heritage Month resources</a> on the U.S. Small Business Administration website. There you can find statistics to share, lists of Native American-Owned businesses to partner with, and more.</li>
<li>Spread awareness using a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags">social media hashtag.</a> The official hashtag for Native American Heritage Month is #NAHM.</li>
</ul>

<h3>National Adoption Month</h3>
<p>There is always a lot of messaging around family during the holiday season, which makes it particularly important to stay mindful of those with non-traditional families. National Adoption Month, celebrated every November to bring awareness to children in foster care, provides an opportunity for this. Here are some ways to incorporate it into your holiday marketing campaigns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid using traditional parent roles in your <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/01/holiday-copywriting&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1668613567031213&amp;usg=AOvVaw3IJCsR77F13PRFHEmw7EnT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holiday copywriting</a>, like “mom” and “dad” which may make your audience members who don’t have that type of parental figure feel excluded.</li>
<li>Adjust your content to be more sensitive to those with different family structures. For example, instead of promoting an event as a “family fun day,” try “friends and family fun day” or “festival fun day.”</li>
<li>Highlight a superstar adoption story in your business’s community. If you have an employee, friend, or community member who was part of an adoption process, ask to share their story to showcase how they inspire your business during this month and beyond.</li>
<li>Raise awareness about adoption within minority groups. For example, did you know that adoptions done by LGBTQ+ couples only became legal in all 50 states just a few years ago in<a href="https://nationaltoday.com/national-adoption-month/#:~:text=History%20of%20National%20Adoption%20Month&amp;text=The%20state%20of%20Massachusetts%20was,in%20the%20foster%20care%20system." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 2017</a>?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Day of the Dead (November 1-2)</h3>
<p>Day of the Dead, also known as Dia de los Muertos, is a Mexican holiday that honors the soulds of the deceased. It’s a two-day celebration that starts every year on November 1 and carries into November 2. This colorful and fun holiday is believed to open the passageway between the real world and the spirit world in traditional Mexican culture, so many people of Mexican descent feel they can connect with their loved ones who have passed during this time.</p>
<p>Nearly <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/RHI725221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20%</a> of the U.S. population is of Mexican heritage, so you’ll likely have audience members who celebrate Day of the Dead. Make your Mexican audience members feel included in your holiday marketing with these ideas and examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share fun facts or hold a virtual trivia event centered around Day of the Dead to spread the word about the holiday’s traditions.</li>
<li>Decorate your store or office with traditional Day of the Dead skulls, flowers, and more. Be sure to snap a picture of your temporarily updated decor so you can share it on your company website or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">social media platforms. </a></li>
<li>Honor those who have passed. Have you or an employee ever lost a friend or loved one you’d like to commemorate? Day of the Dead is the perfect opportunity to do so! You could share their story on social media to give your audience a more personalized perspective of your business.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Forget-Me-Not Day (November 10)</h3>
<p>Having been around <a href="https://nationaltoday.com/forget-not-day/#:~:text=U.S.,in%20the%20line%20of%20battle." target="_blank" rel="noopener">since World War I</a>, Forget-Me-Not Day happens annually on November 10 — right before <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/veterans-day-greetings">Veteran’s Day</a> on November 11. Forget-Me-Not Day is meant to honor and remember wounded soldiers who have become disabled due to their time fighting for our freedom.</p>
<p>The number of veterans who carry the weight of service-related physical and mental hardships is very high. In fact, counting only wars from 2001 and beyond still amounts to about <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2020/06/who-are-the-nations-veterans.html#:~:text=More%20than%20a%20third%20(1.5,to%20survive%20once%2Dfatal%20injuries." target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.5 million</a> veterans in America with a service-connected disability. While wounded veterans should be remembered every day, here’s how your marketing can honor them on Forget-Me-Not Day:</p>
<ul>
<li>Donate your time, resources, or (if your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing budget </a>allows) money to a local Veteran’s organization or shelter.</li>
<li>Be mindful of your veteran (and civilian) customers who have a disability by focusing on your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/15/website-accessibility">website accessibility</a>. Take time to ensure your site is easy to navigate regardless of what assistance someone might need. If you’re not sure where to start, check out this <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/website-accessibility-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complete website accessibility checklist.</a></li>

<h3>Women Entrepreneurs Day (November 19)</h3>
<p>Only <a href="https://writersblocklive.com/blog/women-entrepreneurs-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four out of every ten </a>entrepreneurs in the U.S. are women. Women Entrepreneurs Day, occurring annually on November 19, aims to change that.</p>
<p>This inclusive holiday is much needed, as America is still far behind other countries in terms of women entrepreneurs. In comparison, women represent 50% of entrepreneurs in Latin America and the Caribbean. Here’s how your business can make an impact with this holiday:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share surprising statistics about women entrepreneurs through an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/01/email-marketing-tips">email marketing</a> campaign or social media post. These are sure to engage your audience while spreading awareness. You can find plenty of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/27/diversity-inclusion-marketing-statistics">diversity, equity, and inclusion in marketing statistics here</a>.</li>
<li>Partner with a woman-owned business. You could cross-promote one another in-store or online, and offer samples or discounts on each other’s offerings.</li>
<li>Support the <a href="https://www.womenseday.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Women’s Entrepreneurship Day Organization.</a> Also known as WEDO, this organization acts as a hub for Women Entrepreneurs Day. On its site you’ll find many ways to elevate your marketing for the day, including events you can attend, ways to donate, custom hashtags, surprising statistics, inspiring stories, and more!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Transgender Day of Rememberance (November 20)</h3>
<p>Transgender Day of Rememberance occurs annually on November 20 to honor and remember transgender people who lost their lives due to anti-transgender violence. It started in <a href="https://www.glaad.org/tdor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1998 </a>in memory of Rita Hester, a transgender woman who was stabbed in Allston, Massachusetts that same year.</p>
<p>This inclusive holiday is important to acknowledge because, sadly, these acts of violence are still occuring as 2020 was the most violent year <a href="https://www.hrc.org/resources/fatal-violence-against-the-transgender-and-gender-non-conforming-community-in-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on record</a> for transgender people. Your business can become a transgender ally on Transgender Rememberance Day and beyond with these ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Donate or volunteer to a local LGBTQ+ organization.</li>
<li>Spread awareness and acceptance by openly sharing your allyship on your website, social media, local listings, and more.</li>
<li>If you have an employee, family member, friend, or community member who is openly transgender you could ask their permission to highlight their story in an email send or social post.</li>
<li>Amplify transgender voices by resharing public speeches, posts, and more from transgender people. You could even handing off your “mic” by allowing a transgender person in your business’s community to do a social media takeover.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Inclusive December holiday marketing ideas and examples</h2>
<p>Here are some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/05/december-marketing-ideas">December marketing ideas</a> that will help you to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/28/diversity-in-marketing">embrace diversity and inclusion</a>:</p>
<h3>Rosa Parks Day (December 1)</h3>
<p><a href="https://nationaldaycalendar.com/rosa-parks-day-december-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rosa Parks Day</a> is celebrated twice annually, once on December 1 and once on February 4. This inclusive holiday is to, of course, honor civil rights hero and leader Rosa Parks.</p>
<p>The Rosa Parks story is one no American citizen can forget, as she bravely did not give up her seat to a white passenger after a long day of work on December 1, 1955. This action jumpstarted the Montgomery Bus Boycott organized by E.D. Nixon, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and other civil rights leaders at the time. Here’s how your business can observe Rosa Parks Day:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage your audience to educate themselves on Rosa Parks and the Civil Rights movement by sharing with them your favorite books around the era. For example, Rosa Parks herself wrote a couple of books, including <em>Rosa Parks: My Story </em>and<em> Quiet Strength: The Faith, The Hope, and the Heart of a Woman Who Changed a Nation.</em></li>
<li>Partner with a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/28/black-business-month">black-owned business</a> in your community and run a joint campaign themed around civil rights and standing up (or sitting down) for what you believe in.</li>
<li>Run a Rosa Parks-themed giveaway. There is a <a href="https://www.troy.edu/student-life-resources/arts-culture/rosa-parks-museum/visit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rosa Parks museum</a> at Troy University in Alabama. You could entice your audience to enter to win free tickets to the museum or do a full-on sweepstake by offering a complete trip to tour the museum.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Human Rights Day (December 10)</h3>
<p>Inclusivity means making sure <em>all </em>types of people feel like they belong, regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, abilities, etc. That’s why Human Rights Day (occurring on December 10 each year) is the perfect holiday to incorporate into your inclusive marketing this season.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/human-rights-day">Human Rights Day</a> was created by the UN in 1948 to proclaim the rights everyone is entitled to as a human being “regardless race, color, religion, sex, language, political or other opinions, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.” Show your audience you support the rights of all people with these Human Rights Day marketing ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attend a human rights event and share a recap of your experience with your audience to inspire them to do the same. There are plenty of political summits, cultural conferences, and more held on Human Rights Day, so simply being present at an event in your community can spread awareness and inspiration.</li>
<li>Create a shareable, public playlist of your favorite songs about human rights. There are plenty of inspiring songs your audience will want to listen to, so you could simply build a quick list on a platforms like Pandora, Spotify, Soundcloud, and more. Be sure to include your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/23/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name">business name</a> in your playlist’s title so that your audience will think of your brand as they listen.

<h3>Kwanzaa (December 26 &#8211; January 1)</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Kwanzaa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kwanzaa</a> is a seven-day African American holiday that occurs annually from December 26 to January 1. Each day of the celebration is dedicated to the following seven cultural principles: unity, self-determination, collective responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith. Work the values of Kwanzaa into your inclusive holiday marketing plan with these ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on one of the seven Kwanzaa principles and share with your audience how your business strives to embody it. For example, you could incorporate unity or collective responsibility into your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/video-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video marketing strategy</a> by giving your audience a behind-the-scenes look at the teamwork of your employees.</li>
<li>As you decorate your store or office for Christmas and Hanukkah, be sure to include Kwanzaa as well. For example, each day of Kwanzaa requires one of seven candles to be lit — which are in an arrangement called a Kinara. You could add a Kinara to your decor, or include other Kwanzaa decorations like traditional African crops such as ears of dried corn and more.</li>
<li>Try out any of these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/12/03/christmas-instagram-captions/#kwanzaa">Kwanzaa Instagram captions</a>.</li>
<li>Add a twist to one of your products or offerings and refresh it for the Kwanzaa season by changing its name or colors.</li>

<h2>Inclusive January holiday marketing ideas and examples</h2>
<p>Some of the “bigger” holidays may be over by the time January comes around, but there are still plenty of diverse holidays you can leverage in your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-create-an-inclusive-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inclusive marketing strategy</a> this month:</p>
<h3>National Braille Literacy Month</h3>
<p>January is Braille Literacy Month because Louie Braille, the creator of the braille system, was born in January. This monthly observance is meant to bring awareness to those who are visually impaired. Here’s how your business can take part in National Braille Literacy Month:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/24/website-audit-checklist">Audit your website </a>for visual accessibility features and optimize where you can to cater to your visually impaired audience members.</li>
<li>Share fun facts about the braille system to entertain your audience while spreading awareness of the need for braille literacy. For example, did you know that Braille is primarily created by just<a href="https://www.ocls.info/ocls-blog/six-facts-about-braille-braille-literacy-month%C2%A0#:~:text=January%20is%20Braille%20Literacy%20Month,creator%20of%20the%20braille%20system."> six dots</a>? And, there are separate codes used for music, math, walkways, and more!</li>

<h3>Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day (January 15)</h3>
<p><a href="https://thekingcenter.org/about-tkc/martin-luther-king-jr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day</a> occurs on the third Monday of every January to commemorate his birthday on January 15. It’s no secret that Dr. King played one of the most impactful roles in American history as he helped lead the civil rights movement. In fact, this holiday is also often called Civil Rights Day, since Dr. King had such an influence on the civil rights movements during the 1950’s, 1960’s, and beyond. Dr. King’s legacy still resonates today as we continue to strive for equality across the nation. Celebrate Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. with these ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share an inspiring story or quote from Dr. King’s life to celebrate his work with your audience.</li>
<li>Lead by example by embodying Dr. King’s principle of peaceful protest. Is there a cause in your community or industry that you feel passionate about? Hold a peaceful in-person or virtual event to discuss the topic with your brand&#8217;s community members.</li>
</ul>

<h3>National Religious Freedom Day (January 16)</h3>
<p><a href="https://nationaldaycalendar.com/national-religious-freedom-day-january-16/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Religious Freedom Day</a> is celebrated each year on January 16 because the Statute for Religious Freedom was signed on January 16, 1786. This statute created the base for the core principles our country still stands by to this day, and guaranteed freedom to practice any desired religion is one of the privelages Americans rely on. Show how your business cares this holiday season by implementing these Religious Freedom Day marketing ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re using stock photos on your website, social media, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/05/types-of-google-ads">Google Ads campaigns</a>, and other marketing materials, try to ensure you’re using diverse visuals to embrace religious freedom. For example, you might try to include images of women wearing hijabs, or men wearing kippahs or yarmulkes. We share more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/05/accessibility-inclusivity-advertising">tips on inclusivity in advertising here</a>.</li>
<li>Join a National Religious Freedom Day online discussion to share the religion you practice and encourage your audience to do the same. If you don’t currently practice any religion, that’s okay too! Acknowledging the norm that everyone’s religious journey (or lack thereof) is different will be the point of this inclusive marketing idea. Plus, you’ll be building your brand community as you foster an open discussion with your audience.</li>
<li>Educate your audience on their religious freedom rights by sharing out resources on laws and regulations relating to religious freedom.</li>

<h3>International Day of Acceptance (January 20)</h3>
<p>International Day of Acceptance is fairly new as it was established back in<a href="https://nationaltoday.com/international-day-of-acceptance/#:~:text=International%20Day%20of%20Acceptance%20is,the%20disability%20of%20the%20person." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 2010. </a>It was created to foster social acceptance for those with disabilities.

Here are some inclusive holiday marketing ideas you can leverage on this day and beyond to make your audience feel more accepted:</p>

<h3>Chinese New Year</h3>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American filmmaker Ava Duvanay once said, “When we’re talking about diversity, it’s not a box to check. It is a reality that should be deeply felt and held and valued by all of us.”</p>
<p>I agree wholeheartedly with this statement, but at the same time, I also realize that from a business and marketing standpoint, there is a need to put some structure, and maybe even checklists, into place in order to build a true culture, brand voice, and community around these concepts of diversity equity, and inclusion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/diversity-vs-equity-vs-inclusion.png" alt="diversity vs equity vs inclusion" width="720" height="296" class="size-full wp-image-61460 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/diversity-vs-equity-vs-inclusion.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/diversity-vs-equity-vs-inclusion-480x197.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And each year, these efforts have become more and more important, not just for society but for any given business&#8217;s health. That&#8217;s why we have plenty of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/31/diversity-equity-inclusion-resources">resources on improving diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) for your business</a>, and why we&#8217;re adding another one: this list of DEI stats and findings from studies—plus key takeaways—to help you</p>
<ul>
<li>Broaden your perspectives.</li>
<li>Inform your strategy around diversity and marketing.</li>
<li>Build stronger connections with all groups within your target audience.</li>

<h2>Statistics about the growing power of the minority consumer population</h2>
<p>These statistics are helpful in getting a feel for the growing power of minority groups among consumers, including Hispanic, Black, and Asian American groups.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the past decade, the white population declined for the first time in history (2.6%), while people who identify as Black, multiracial, Hispanic, and Asian drove population growth (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/us/us-census-population-growth-diversity.html">NY Times</a>).</li>
<li>The Census Bureau projects that in the next 25 years, non-Hispanic whites will account for less than half of the U.S. population (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2021/07/23/prominent-agencies-and-marketers-are-ramping-up-their-ad-commitment-to-minority-owned-media/?sh=2e005aeb348c">Forbes</a>).</li>
<li>The buying power of minority groups in the U.S. is exploding. It was $4.2 trillion in 2020 and is projected to reach $7 trillion by 2025 (<a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/chart/252370/us-buying-power-by-raceethnicity-2000-2023-billions">Insider Intelligence</a>).</li>
<li>The median age among multicultural consumers is younger than non-Hispanic whites: For Hispanics it is 30, for Blacks 35, for Asian-American 38 and for non-Hispanic whites it is 44 (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2021/07/23/prominent-agencies-and-marketers-are-ramping-up-their-ad-commitment-to-minority-owned-media/?sh=2e005aeb348c">Forbes</a>).</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Marketers report that their company is more likely to provide visual (66%) and hearing (56%) accessibility features than cognitive ones.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are several key <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/08/august-marketing-ideas">monthly awareness themes in August</a>, from eye health to family fun, but there is one that you won’t want to miss: Black Business Month. Started in 2004 by historian John William Templeton and engineer Frederick E. Jordan Sr., this month is dedicated to shining a light on all the amazing work Black-owned businesses do.</p>

<p>In honor of Black Business Month, we thought we&#8217;d highlight some Black-owned businesses that are succeeding in their niche and making a difference in the community. Black-owned businesses account for <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/august-social-media-holidays/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10%</a> of all U.S. companies and 30% of all minority-owned businesses. This equates to over 2 million Black businesses! We wish we could list them all, but here are a few that are truly leading the way. Let&#8217;s take a look.</p>
<p>P.S: You can find plenty of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/27/diversity-inclusion-marketing-statistics">diversity, equity, and inclusion in marketing statistics here</a>.</p>

<h3>1. Black Girl Sunscreen</h3>
<p>With August also being Summer Sun Awareness Month, we thought it’d only be fitting to start our list with the brand <a href="https://www.blackgirlsunscreen.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Girl Sunscreen.</a> Sunscreen has been notorious for leaving white residue and streaks on the skin. That is, of course, until Shontay Lunday founded Black Girl Sunscreen in 2016. Black Girl Sunscreen is a clear-drying SPF lotion that is made to protect melanin-rich skin. In its first six years, Black Girl Sunscreen has already seen exponential growth and it&#8217;s now sold at both Target and Ulta Beauty stores.</p>

<h3>2. Frugal Bookstore</h3>
<p>Not only is <a href="https://frugalbookstore.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frugal Bookstore </a>the only Black-owned bookstore in Boston, Massachusetts, but it also offers Boston’s largest inventory of books from Black authors. The Frugal Bookstore is proudly family owned and operated with a community-focused approach to bookselling.

Co-founders Teo Hunter and Beny Ashburn craft each beer to be themed around Black history and culture. Plus, they started the<a href="https://www.8trillpils.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 8 Trill Pils </a>fund with their partners, <a href="https://www.brewdog.com/usa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrewDog</a>, to give $100,000 back to Black-owned breweries.</p>

Chief Consulting Officer Shaun Glaze is a self-confessed data nerd at heart, so they combined that with their passion for social justice to help businesses reach target audiences in a meaningful way. For example, Shaun and the Inclusive Data team help to answer questions like &#8220;What can you tell me about People of Color (POC) who live in this area?&#8221; or &#8220;Is there any data that can help me end disparities for these communities?&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your website gets judged by a lot of criteria—this is inevitable. Website visitors will consider whether or not they like the brand colors, the appearance, the copy. Potential customers will weigh how authoritative your business, your product, or your team appears to be. But one big criteria that is way too often overlooked by businesses? A website’s accessibility. In fact, there&#8217;s an average of<a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 51</a> accessibility errors on the homepages of the top one million websites.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/homepage-website-accessibility-stats.png" alt="" width="720" height="465" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61856" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/homepage-website-accessibility-stats.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/homepage-website-accessibility-stats-480x310.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Website accessibility is essential for any business to reach its entire target audience. That’s why today, we’re going through everything you need to do to get started. Here, we’ll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>What website accessibility is and why it&#8217;s essential</li>
<li>Eight website accessibility best practices you need to know</li>
<li>Three website accessibility tools to help you get compliant</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s get to it.</p>
<h2>What is website accessibility?</h2>
<p>Website accessibility is the practice of building and maintaining your site in a way that people of all abilities can access and understand the information. That means making sure that the information on your website can be accessed and understood by anyone blocking videos, using a screen reader, or looking at your website.</p>
<p>According to the latest <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/intro#understanding-the-four-principles-of-accessibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Website Accessibility Content Guidelines</a>, website content is accessible if it’s perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/website-accessibility-pour.png" alt="website accessibility - pour acronym" width="650" height="390" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61848" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/website-accessibility-pour.png 650w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/website-accessibility-pour-480x288.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://noblestudios.com/digital-marketing-services/web-development-design/ada-compliance-meaning-and-web-accessibility-standards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>Here’s what this means:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perceivable: </strong>Information must be conveyed to users in a way that they can perceive (it can&#8217;t be invisible to all of their senses).</li>
<li><strong>Operable: </strong>The UI and navigation of a website must work in the ways that users operate.</li>
<li><strong>Understandable: </strong>The UI and operation of the website need to be understandable for the user.</li>
<li><strong>Robust: </strong>All website content needs to be robust enough to be accurately interpreted by users, whether or not they’re using assistive technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Website accessibility includes your site, as well as any tools, dashboards, databases, or other technologies that live on your site. These should all be developed with the same goal of conveying information to people of all abilities. For this post, we’ll focus on your web pages, including your homepage, your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/about-us-page-examples-and-tips/">about us page</a>, your blog posts, your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/08/landing-page-examples">landing pages</a>, and more. It’s important you get these right—and let’s get into why.</p>
<h2>Why is website accessibility essential?</h2>
<p>Website accessibility is essential for all businesses so that everyone using the internet can access and understand the information on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/14/website-examples">your website</a>. Because if your website isn’t accessible, you risk missing potential customers, alienating your audience, or even facing legal action. Websites for government offices or for private companies with 15 or more employees must be ADA compliant. And there is a precedent of <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/website-accessibility-law/285199/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuits for inaccessible online content</a>.</p>
<p>While compliance is one big reason to keep accessibility top of mind when you’re creating a website or embarking on a redesign, it’s far from the only one. According to the <a href="https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Health Organization</a>, more than one billion people worldwide live with some kind of disability.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/website-accessibility-stat.png" alt="website accessibility : stat showing that 15% of the world has a disability" width="600" height="263" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61839" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/website-accessibility-stat.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/website-accessibility-stat-480x210.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You might think that if your website is simple, this won’t impact you. But even the most <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/12/31/basic-website">basic websites</a> aren’t accessible for completely preventable reasons. In fact, <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5.3%</a> of all home page elements have a detected accessibility error. That’s page elements—not just pages. It’s clear that website accessibility needs to be a priority.</p>
<p>You want to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/31/diversity-equity-inclusion-resources">make sure your content is as inclusive</a> as possible, and that takes time, effort, and attention. This isn’t daunting, but it is important, so you’ll need a plan. And now let’s talk through the website accessibility best practices you need to know to get started.</p>
<h2>Website accessibility standards you need to know</h2>
<p>Maintaining an accessible website requires attention to all the elements of your website design, including media content, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/information-architecture">site architecture</a>, font, and more. This can be overwhelming, but it’s essential, so start with the most important best practices. Here are the key website accessibility standards that everyone working on their website—business owners and marketers alike—need to know.</p>
<h3>1. Choose the right CMS</h3>
<p>This is the first website accessibility best practice because it’s the most fundamental. You need a content management system (CMS) that supports all of your users and helps you create processes for website development and maintenance that are both effective and easy to manage. This is especially true if you’re a small business strapped for time without a web team.</p>
<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress</a> has great features for website accessibility, and it’s easy to use once you get the hang of it. <a href="https://drupal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drupal</a> is another ideal option, but this might require web dev help. Website builders like <a href="https://www.wix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wix</a> and <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Squarespace</a> may be limited in support for keeping your website accessible—be sure to double-check before committing, or work with a web design agency to make a website that follows all the up-to-date guidelines.</p>
<h3>2. Use alt text everywhere</h3>
<p>Alt text is essential for website accessibility. The text, which you’ll typically be prompted to add to all images within your CMS, is contained in an HTML element, and this is what screen readers will use to translate your image for someone who isn’t able to see the graphic on your website.</p>
<p>Take this example from Kristen McCormick’s post about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">words for emotional copywriting</a>:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/website-accessibility-image.png" alt="website accessibility - example of image in blog post with alt text" width="366" height="376" class="aligncenter wp-image-61840" /></p>
<p>The image is a wheel that expands on feelings and emotion to help give you more options for your marketing copywriting. That’s exactly what the alt text says, so that anyone reading the post with a screen reader knows what’s visible on the screen.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/website-accessibility-alt-text.png" alt="website accessibility - example of alt text in source code" width="720" height="306" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61841" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/website-accessibility-alt-text.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/website-accessibility-alt-text-480x204.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>It should be noted that alt text is also an essential part of our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/06/on-page-seo">on-page SEO checklist</a>, since this is how Google &#8220;sees&#8221; the images on your page.</p>
<h3>3. Avoid conveying information with color or imagery alone</h3>
<p>In order to keep your website content accessible to users with different abilities, including users with assistive technologies, you need to avoid any places on your website where you’re conveying information through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/12/color-psychology-marketing">color</a> or imagery alone. This isn’t going to be understandable for all of your users.</p>
<p>Take <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/22/lead-capture-form">lead capture forms</a>, for example. You can’t alert a user of an incorrect entry with only a red box. People with colorblindness won’t be able to detect a difference, and they won’t get the information. Add a text explanation in addition to this color-based cue.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/website-accessibility-form-errors.png" alt="website accessibility - example of properly indicating errors on forms" width="720" height="320" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61842" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/website-accessibility-form-errors.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/website-accessibility-form-errors-480x213.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>4. Arrange your headings in order</h3>
<p>Headings are important for arranging information in your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/05/blog-post-templates"> blog posts</a>, since they communicate the importance of the section to the overall post as well as shifts to new sections. These signals help convey the logical structure of the post, which is why you might address headings in your brand’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/10/content-style-guide">style guide</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/on-page-seo-html-heading-dropdown-wordpress.png" alt="on-page seo - html headings in wordpress" width="720" height="360" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59379" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/on-page-seo-html-heading-dropdown-wordpress.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/on-page-seo-html-heading-dropdown-wordpress-480x240.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But headings aren’t just a text size or shape, they’re an HTML element. That means they can communicate the structure of the post and the importance of the sections to anyone using a screen reader, as well. This makes keeping them in order even more important. So remember to always go in order, never skipping to an H4 after an H2, and using headings of the same type to note comparable sections of your content.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/on-page-seo-checklist-html-headings-illustration-wordstream.png" alt="on-page seo checklist - html headings" width="352" height="497" class="aligncenter wp-image-59363" /></p>

<h3>5. Use easy-to-read fonts</h3>
<p>Another related tip: Choose a font that’s easy to read. From an accessibility standpoint, this point speaks for itself. But there&#8217;s also a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/23/influence-buyers-marketing-psychology">marketing psychology</a> aspect to it. According to the cognitive fluency effect, the harder it is to read something, the less trustworthy it is perceived to be. Furthermore, if that text is describing instructions, the harder that task is perceived to be.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/psychology-copywriting-cognitive-fluency-taxes.png" alt="" width="409" height="295" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50647" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/psychology-copywriting-cognitive-fluency-taxes.png 409w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/psychology-copywriting-cognitive-fluency-taxes-300x216.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px" /></p>
<h3>6. Keep all navigation keyboard-friendly</h3>
<p>Your website navigation should be accessible to anyone—you want your visitors to be able to engage with your content, to check out your product pages, to sign up for your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/25/email-newsletter-ideas">newsletters</a>, and more. In order to keep your website inclusive, you need to make sure that a user can navigate using a keyboard.</p>
<p>Keyboard users commonly use the Tab key to move throughout a website. Moving throughout your site successfully with this key requires testing and some code setup. <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/">Website Accessibility in Mind </a>has a great guide to get started checking your site. Plus, we’ll share some more tools to check your general accessibility in the next section.</p>

<h3>7. Ensure colors contrast</h3>
<p>Remember that your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-website-design-tips/">website design</a> should be accessible, too. One all too common problem is with color contrast. <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/">86.4%</a> of home pages have low contrast text, which falls below the WCAG 2 AA thresholds—making this the most common website accessibility failure.</p>
<p>The colors on your website, especially the colors of the text and its background, need to contrast sufficiently so that anyone can easily read, whether they have a visual impairment or not.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/website-accessibility-low-contrast-text.png" alt="website accessibility - example of low contrast" width="600" height="395" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61843" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/website-accessibility-low-contrast-text.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/website-accessibility-low-contrast-text-480x316.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://developers.google.com/codelabs/devtools-cvd#2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<h3>8. Make information easy to understand in multiple formats</h3>
<p>This is the foundation of website accessibility: <strong>You need to create content on your website with the knowledge that not everyone will be viewing and scrolling to access and understand the information. </strong>If you keep this top of mind, you’ll remember to add alt text and keyboard navigation, and you’ll know that you need to convey information in text, graphics, code, and more instead of relying on a single source, like a video or gif.</p>

<h2>Website accessibility tools</h2>
<p>The website accessibility standards here are a great foundation—but that doesn’t really help unless you apply it to your site. Here are a few simple, easy-to-use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/31/website-graders">website graders</a> that can identify the elements or items that need fixing in order to make your site inclusive for all of your potential customers.</p>
<h3>1. Sort Site</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.powermapper.com/products/sortsite/checks/accessibility-checks/?_ga=2.112216707.660454475.1654444835-1290511369.1654444835">Sort Site</a> is a quick, free tool that scans your entire website to let you know of any errors, and it provides some context. For each error category, you get a benchmark so you know how your website stacks up against averages.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/website-accessibility-tools-sortsite.png" alt="website accessibility tools - screenshot of sortsite" width="720" height="307" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61844" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/website-accessibility-tools-sortsite.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/website-accessibility-tools-sortsite-480x205.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>2. Accessibility Checker</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.accessibilitychecker.org/">Accessibility Checker </a>is sleek and clean, and the results are clearly conveyed in the report. It provides a score, a list of issues, and what needs to happen to correct it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/website-accessibility-tools-accessibility-checker.png" alt="website accessibility - accessibility checker screenshot" width="720" height="497" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61845" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/website-accessibility-tools-accessibility-checker.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/website-accessibility-tools-accessibility-checker-480x331.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An example report from a website that needs some work.</em></p>
<h3>3. Website Accessibility Checker Chrome Extension</h3>
<p>I love a Chrome extension. <a href="https://accessibleweb.com/web-accessibility-checker-browser-extension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CSS Peeper</a> helps me assess or check on-brand colors and font whenever I need, and I find it saves me so much time otherwise spent guessing or referring to a brand guide. This Website Accessibility Checker offers a way to quickly scan whatever page you’re on and get results right away—an excellent tool for anyone committed to keeping their website up to date.</p>
<p>On another note, since many accessibility optimizations overlap with SEO optimization, you can use our <a href="https://localiq.com/website-grader/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free Website Grader</a> to check for missing alt text, heading tags, and other elements.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You already know that diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) has come into the spotlight over the past two years, but the Google Trends chart below shows just how drastic this shift is.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/diversity-equity-inclusion-search-trends.png" alt="diversity equity inclusion search trends" width="720" height="494" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61488" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/diversity-equity-inclusion-search-trends.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/diversity-equity-inclusion-search-trends-480x329.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>From the beginning of 2020 to today, the popularity of this search term has increased 700%. And there&#8217;s no doubt that a good portion of those searches is coming from businesses trying to figure out how to do their part.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re one of those businesses, read on to get 11 resources to help you in your DEI efforts. But first, a quick overview on what these terms mean.</p>
<h2>What is diversity, equity &amp; inclusion?</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://dei.extension.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eXtension Organizing Committee on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion</a>, diversity is the presence of differences, equity is fair treatment to those different groups, and inclusion is making sure each of those groups actually feels welcome.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/diversity-vs-equity-vs-inclusion.png" alt="diversity vs equity vs inclusion" width="720" height="296" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61460" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/diversity-vs-equity-vs-inclusion.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/diversity-vs-equity-vs-inclusion-480x197.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>So in the popular party analogy, diversity is having guests of different races, genders, religions, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/pride-month-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sexual orientations</a>, ethnicities, nationalities, socioeconomic statuses, languages, (dis)abilities, ages, and political perspectives. Equity is making sure everyone who wants to attend the party can do so—such as by adding a wheelchair ramp. And inclusion is commonly referred to as being asked to dance, but some better definitions have emerged such as choosing the music and being part of the party-planning committee.</p>

<h2>Bookmark these diversity, equity &amp; inclusion resources</h2>
<p>While the explosion of DEI awareness is positive, it&#8217;s unfortunate that it has taken society so long—and events as tragic as those that occurred in 2020—for this to happen. Furthermore, greater awareness does not mean greater action. We&#8217;re still very much in a phase where we&#8217;re more aware of how much action needs to be taken. But you can do your part by using these resources to promote and practice diversity, equity, and inclusion in your business and marketing strategies:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just last week, we celebrated the 52nd anniversary of Earth Day, which helped give rise to the environmental movement more than half a century ago.</p>
<p>Now, of course, it’s far more common to see brands prioritize the environment than it was in 1970.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-infographic.jpg" alt="green marketing infographic" width="447" height="650" class="aligncenter wp-image-60678" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://blog.gwi.com/chart-of-the-week/lifting-the-lid-on-sustainable-packaging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<p>And this, of course, spurred the rise of green marketing. What exactly does that mean? Read on to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>What green (or sustainable) marketing is and why it&#8217;s important</li>
<li>Five of the most eco-friendly brands to give you inspiration</li>
<li>Eight ways to implement your own green marketing</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is green marketing?</h2>
<p>Sustainability marketing, or green marketing, is a practice that emphasizes the environmental benefits of a product or service, which also reflects a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/09/company-core-values">brand’s values.</a></p>
<p>“Overall, the objective is to advocate toward an end mission,” said digital marketing specialist <a href="https://matttutt.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Tutt</a>, who focuses on ethical, green, and sustainable businesses. “For example, it might be to reduce the use of fossil fuels or to pivot toward greener sources of energy.”</p>
<p>That means sustainability marketing is a big shift from traditional marketing, which focuses on revenue and profits.</p>
<p>But the definition of sustainability is shifting. <a href="https://shelhorowitz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shel Horowitz</a>, a green business profitability expert, noted that ultimately, brands should strive to move beyond sustainability to “regenerativity,” which he defined as taking steps to actively make the world better, such as “developing and marketing products and services that [target] hunger, poverty, racism, other kinds of othering, catastrophic climate change and even peace.”</p>
<p>In fact, one study shows that <a href="https://co-nxt.com/blog/new-consumer-research-food-and-sustainability-post-pandemic-shifts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly half</a> of consumers now consider the definition of sustainability to include social and economic factors.</p>

<h2>Why is green marketing important?</h2>
<p>Aside from the environmental benefits, sustainability marketing is important because it helps brands connect to increasingly environmentally and socially conscious consumers, said Roger Huang, head of growth operations at talent development platform <a href="http://springboard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Springboard</a>.</p>
<p>“Sustainability is a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/13/digital-marketing-trends-2022">vast 2022 macro trend</a> and marketing plays an important role,” added Matt Lally, founder of the consultancy <a href="https://mattyads.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MattyAds</a>. “Sustainability is high on the customer&#8217;s internal value system, which they embrace with higher brand loyalty and less price sensitivity.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/eco-friendly-brands-survey-on-consumers-sustainability.png" alt="chart showing importance of eco-friendliness to consumers" width="720" height="484" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60667" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/eco-friendly-brands-survey-on-consumers-sustainability.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/eco-friendly-brands-survey-on-consumers-sustainability-480x323.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/03/generation-z-sustainability-lifestyle-buying-decisions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just an opinion. Studies like the one above show that consumers in every generation consider sustainability a more important factor than the brand name of a product when making a purchase. Furthermore, Facebook found that posts containing sustainability-related hashtags received <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/insights/sustainability-trends-shape-consumers-decisions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4.2x</a> more interactions per post than other posts made by CPG brands, and 10.8x more engagement for posts with eco-friendly-related <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags">hashtags</a>.<a href="https://co-nxt.com/blog/new-consumer-research-food-and-sustainability-post-pandemic-shifts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em></em></a></p>
<h2>5 of the most eco-friendly brands to inspire you</h2>
<p>While there are many brand examples by now, a few stand out in their<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/22/cause-based-marketing"> cause-based marketing</a>:</p>
<h3>The Body Shop</h3>
<p>Scott McKinney, head of marketing at financial literacy site <a href="https://www.debtbombshell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Debt Bombshell</a>, pointed to cosmetics retailer The Body Shop, which <a href="https://www.thebodyshop.com/en-au/about-us/activism/faat/a/a00018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been advocating for the end of animal testing since 1989</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sustainability-marketing-body-shop-animal-testing.png" alt="sustainable brands - the body shop against animal testing" width="600" height="663" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60658" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sustainability-marketing-body-shop-animal-testing.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sustainability-marketing-body-shop-animal-testing-480x530.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Zaeem Chaudhary, architectural draftsman at engineering firm <a href="https://acdesignsolutions.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AC Design Solutions</a>, agreed, noting <a href="https://www.thebodyshop.com/en-us/about-us/activism/isolated-not-alone/a/a00020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">domestic violence</a> and <a href="https://www.thebodyshop.com/en-gb/about-us/activism/a/a00015" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HIV/AIDS</a> are two of many other causes the retailer has supported over the years.</p>
<h3>Ikea</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, furniture retailer Ikea <a href="https://about.ikea.com/en/sustainability/becoming-climate-positive/what-is-climate-positive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has committed to becoming climate positive by 2030</a>. That means Ikea will not just reach net-zero carbon emissions, but it will actually be removing additional carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</p>
<p><a href="https://about.ikea.com/en/sustainability/becoming-climate-positive/what-is-climate-positive" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sustainability-marketing-ikea-climate-positive.png" alt="sustainability marketing - ikea" width="600" height="588" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60659" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sustainability-marketing-ikea-climate-positive.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sustainability-marketing-ikea-climate-positive-480x470.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<p>“They have launched a ‘sustainable living at home’ products range after investing heavily in wind turbines and solar panels throughout the world,” Tutt said. “By combining these two things, they can help to position themselves as having green energy and sustainability at the heart of their products.”</p>
<h3>Lego</h3>
<p>Likewise, toymaker Lego <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/sustainability/environment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wants to make all core products from sustainable materials by 2030</a>—and to make all packaging from renewable or recycled materials by 2025.</p>
<p>“This form of marketing gives the company a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/07/unique-selling-proposition">unique selling proposition</a> and customers are willing to walk with the company and hold it accountable until it achieves its sustainability goals,” said Doug Pierce, chief marketing adviser at analytics platform <a href="https://www.sigmacomputing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sigma Computing</a>. “Moreover, customers are willing to pay more for Lego products and will continue to remain loyal to the company because of this commitment to sustainability.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sustainability-marketing-lego.png" alt="sustainability marketing - legos sustainable materials page" width="720" height="362" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60660" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sustainability-marketing-lego.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sustainability-marketing-lego-480x241.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The brand also has a Replay program, which <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/sustainability/environment/replay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allows customers to donate used bricks</a> to children in need. This, noted Stephen Light, CMO of retailer <a href="https://www.nolahmattress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nolah Mattress</a>, has the added bonus of helping to reduce waste in landfills.</p>
<p>“When you consider their product is traditionally made of plastic, it’s incredibly smart to invest so much energy into the implementation of sustainable practices—they don’t ignore the potentially negative impact their product has had, they use it to define their fight to achieve better for the planet at large,” he added. “They provide goals and regular updates regarding sustainable materials and packaging, offering a level of transparency that’s crucial to strong sustainability marketing.”</p>
<h3>Patagonia</h3>
<p>Noting “it feels like sustainability is at the heart of everything they do,” Tutt pointed to outdoor apparel brand Patagonia as another example.</p>
<p>“They are working hard toward building a community of people who love and care deeply for the outdoors and not simply existing to sell garments,” he said. “Their social feeds are full of exciting, stunning wildlife and landscapes, images and videos of people out hiking and exploring—really putting the environment at the heart of what they do.”</p>
<p>One memorable example is the brand&#8217;s <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/stories/dont-buy-this-jacket-black-friday-and-the-new-york-times/story-18615.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Don’t Buy This Jacket campaign</a>, which brought attention to consumerism on Black Friday 2011.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.patagonia.com/stories/dont-buy-this-jacket-black-friday-and-the-new-york-times/story-18615.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/eco-friendly-brands-patagonia-dont-buy-this-jacket.jpeg" alt="eco-friendly sustainable brands - patagonia's don't buy this jacket campaign" width="652" height="1250" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60661" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/eco-friendly-brands-patagonia-dont-buy-this-jacket.jpeg 652w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/eco-friendly-brands-patagonia-dont-buy-this-jacket-480x920.jpeg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 652px, 100vw" /></a><a href="https://bettermarketing.pub/dont-buy-this-jacket-patagonia-s-daring-campaign-2b37e145046b" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>“Patagonia&#8217;s ethos is to build a product that will last, thus rejecting the fast fashion trends that plague our landfills,” Lally added.</p>
<h3>Starbucks</h3>
<p>Finally, coffee chain Starbucks recently announced its <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/business-food/starbucks-cup-sustainability/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plans</a> to encourage more customers to drink from reusable mugs by 2025.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/business-food/starbucks-cup-sustainability/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/most-sustainable-eco-friendly-brands-starbucks-cups.png" alt="most sustainable brands - starbucks announcement to eliminate single-use cups" width="720" height="216" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60662" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/most-sustainable-eco-friendly-brands-starbucks-cups.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/most-sustainable-eco-friendly-brands-starbucks-cups-480x144.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></a>That follows a long history of sustainable efforts.</p>
<p>“Since the early 2000s, the company has been promoting green and humane sourcing for their products,” said Christiaan Huynen, founder of design firm <a href="https://designbro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DesignBro</a>. “Moreover, the company also donates millions of dollars to other environmental programs and renewable energy developments. Starbucks also prioritizes sustainable practices in an attempt to decrease power and water waste.”</p>

<h2>How you can implement green marketing</h2>
<p>Feeling inspired? Here are six <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/earth-day-slogans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ways to integrate green marketing</a> into your own <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/18/best-marketing-strategies">marketing strategy</a>:</p>
<h3>Find the right sustainable initiative</h3>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to commit to something lofty like any of the big corporations above. “This may be as simple as giving one percent of your profits to charity or as complex as devoting your business model to a specific cause,” said Joe Davies, founder of digital marketing firm <a href="https://fatjoe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fatjoe</a>.</p>
<p>By looking for features that can be marketed as sustainable, brands can leverage the feel-good benefit of the product or service while also providing value, he added.</p>
<h3>Keep your efforts genuine</h3>
<p>Horowitz noted that these efforts have to be genuine or you run the risk of greenwashing. Greenwashing refers to using vague and misleading tactics to appear sustainable without actually being sustainable—all in the name of benefiting the business and not the environment.<a href="http://weforum.org/agenda/2022/03/generation-z-sustainability-lifestyle-buying-decisions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-definition-greenwashing.jpg" alt="green marketing - definition of greenwashing" width="372" height="609" class="aligncenter wp-image-60668" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blondegonerogue.com/blogs/fashion-sustainability/what-is-greenwashing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<h3>Adjust your messaging for the different levels of green</h3>
<p>“That&#8217;s only step one,” he said. “Step two is reaching out to not just the Deep Green [consumers] but also the Lazy Greens and even the Non-Greens—all of whom require different marketing hooks.”</p>
<h3>Implement eco-conscious design</h3>
<p>First, consider product design—such as how to make your products recyclable or reusable if they aren’t already. Starbucks cups are a good example but there are countless others, like Coolpaste below.</p>
<p>Davies recommends making products with less packaging while Jeff Mains, CEO of the consultancy <a href="http://championleadership.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Champion Leadership Group</a>, suggests seeking out environmentally conscious suppliers, manufacturers and partners.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-eco-product-design.jpeg" alt="examples of green marketing - eco-conscious design toothpaste" width="720" height="245" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60669" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-eco-product-design.jpeg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-eco-product-design-480x163.jpeg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/02/28/the-top-10-sustainable-product-designs-that-help-you-maintain-an-eco-friendly-and-green-lifestyle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<h3>Source sustainable materials</h3>
<p>Then, think about whether you can incorporate more sustainable materials, like bamboo, cork or hemp.</p>
<p>This, said David Wurst, CEO of digital marketing agency <a href="https://www.webcitz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Webcitz</a>, is one of the most prominent approaches to sustainable marketing.</p>
<p>“Shampoos with fewer hazardous components that dissolve more quickly in water, as well as reusable straws and water bottles, are among these items,” he added. “Companies can gain traction in the green market by providing consumers with alternative items that help them feel better about their influence on the environment.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-ethique.png" alt="green marketing example - ethique" width="720" height="183" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60672" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-ethique.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-ethique-480x122.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://ethique.com/products/heali-kiwi-shampoo-for-dandruff-or-scalp-problems?nosto=frontpage-nosto-1-fallback-nosto-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethique</a> is another example of a super-sustainable brand.</em></p>
<p>Another way to ensure your items are sourced sustainably is to ensure your suppliers are ethical and provide a living wage to their employees, said David Bitton, CMO of property management firm <a href="https://www.doorloop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DoorLoop</a>.</p>
<p>“Additionally, ensure that the materials used to make your products have a low environmental impact, do not contain any harmful substances and are biodegradable,” he added.<em></em></p>
<h3>Use plastic-free products and packaging</h3>
<p>Another way to do this is by going plastic-free.</p>
<p>“Today, billions of pounds of [plastic] can be found in the swirling convergences that make up over 40% of the world&#8217;s ocean surfaces,” Wurst said. “Thousands of seabirds, sea turtles, seals, and other marine creatures are killed each year after consuming or becoming entangled in plastic.”</p>
<p>If, for example, your packaging is single-use plastic, consider more environmentally friendly alternatives.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-zero-waste-packaging.png" alt="green marketing - plastic free packaging" width="720" height="339" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60673" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-zero-waste-packaging.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-zero-waste-packaging-480x226.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Brands like <a href="https://earthhero.com/product-category/shop-by-values/zero-waste-packaging/page/15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Earth Hero</a> allow you to shop by specific value, like plastic-free packaging. </em></p>
<p>“We make an effort on sustainable packaging, reducing our use of plastics and other non-compostable packaging materials by replacing them with wood, wool and straw,” said Kathryn McDavid, CEO of ecommerce company <a href="https://editorspick.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Editor&#8217;s Pick</a>.</p>
<h3>Reduce your emissions</h3>
<p>Fulfillment is another business sector that can benefit from sustainable practices.</p>
<p>“Long-distance shipping can have a significant carbon footprint,” said Jason Ball, director of B2B agency <a href="https://consideredcontent.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Considered Content</a>. “Trucks and planes, among other modes of transportation, are among the major emitters of greenhouse gases.”</p>
<p>Instead, he said companies can ship in bulk to lessen their carbon impact or they can offer a green shipping option at checkout.</p>
<p>In addition, businesses can offset carbon emissions from the supply chain, Davies noted.</p>
<h3>Focus on renewable energy</h3>
<p>Beyond the products themselves, businesses can also implement eco-friendly energy practices, such as using solar, wind, hydropower or geothermal electricity.</p>
<p>“Access to renewable energy sources has improved in recent years and the market for harvesting renewable energy is likely to grow in the next decades as more countries invest in it,” said Jamie Opalchuk, CEO of hosting platform <a href="https://www.hostpapa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HostPapa</a>.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-most-eco-friendly-brands.png" alt="most eco friendly brands that use renewable energy" width="720" height="509" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60674" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-most-eco-friendly-brands.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-most-eco-friendly-brands-480x339.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranked-the-50-companies-that-use-the-highest-percentage-of-green-energy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></p>
<p>Dan Close, CEO of house-buying firm <a href="https://buyhousesinkentucky.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We Buy Houses in Kentucky</a>, agreed, noting renewable energy can reduce production costs while also helping the environment.</p>
<h3>Assume social responsibility</h3>
<p>Finally, corporate social responsibility (CSR) allows brands to better communicate how they’re affecting positive change to conscious consumers. That’s according to Chris Gadek, vice president of growth at outdoor advertising firm <a href="https://www.adquick.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdQuick</a>, who noted customers are often willing to pay more when a brand’s identity aligns with their beliefs.</p>
<p>“For this reason, businesses must embrace CSR in their brand ethos to have a competitive advantage,” he said. “However, promoting your business&#8217;s CSR initiatives without tooting your own horn can be tricky. But, through a well-crafted social media campaign, you can invite customers on your brand&#8217;s journey to effect positive change in the world.”</p>
<p>You can even go as far as getting a third-party certification, such as becoming a B Corp.</p>
<p>“Certified B Corp status is a recognizable certification that verifies your brand&#8217;s sustainability efforts and having a third party make the sustainability claims is more legitimate to consumers than the brand making the claims themselves because there&#8217;s less bias,” said Calloway Cook, president of supplement maker <a href="https://illuminatelabs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Illuminate Labs</a>.</p>
<h2>Get your green marketing strategy in gear</h2>
<p>To recap, here are eight ways to implement green marketing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick the right initiative</li>
<li>Keep your efforts genuine</li>
<li>Adjust your messaging to the different levels of &#8220;green&#8221; in your audience</li>
<li>Implement eco-conscious design</li>
<li>Use plastic-free products and packaging</li>
<li>Reduce your emissions</li>
<li>Use renewable energy</li>
<li>Assume social responsibility</li>
</ol>
<p>The sooner you start, the sooner you can feel good about saving the planet. Start simple and let the story unfold from there!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although minorities make up 30% of the U.S population, only <a href="https://www.sbc.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/minorityentrepreneurs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18%</a> of U.S. businesses are minority-owned. Clearly, even though diversity has become a topic of focus over the last two years, it is still harder for minority-owned businesses to get started, obtain loans, and stay afloat.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/minority-business-loan-rejection-rates.png" alt="loan rejection rates for minority businesses" width="720" height="544" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60134" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/minority-business-loan-rejection-rates.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/minority-business-loan-rejection-rates-480x363.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Minority-owned business face <a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/blog/news/covid-funding-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">higher loan rejection rates.</a> </em></p>
<p>But there is growing support out there. So in this post, I&#8217;m going to share eight tips and resources to help minority businesses succeed.</p>
<h2>Tips for minority-owned businesses</h2>
<p>Read on for a mix of info and inspo! If you&#8217;re not a minority business owner, share this post with someone who is!</p>
<h3>1. Get certified as a minority-owned business (MBE)</h3>
<p>Obtaining an official certification as a minority business enterprise (MBE) gives you access to lots of different advantageous resources: client databases, increased business partnership opportunities, training and management workshops, networking events, and lots more.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/co/run/business-financing/certification-guide-for-minority-owned-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Chamber of Commerce</a>, there are a few ways to get certified:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NMSDC certification:</strong> National Minority Supplier Development Council, Click here for the <a href="https://nmsdc.org/mbes/mbe-certification/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certification process</a>. After verifying your eligibility, all you’ll need to do is gather up the necessary documents, complete the online application, pay the fee, and wait for the final approval.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/mbe-certificate-example.jpeg" alt="minority owned business certificate" width="720" height="490" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60119" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/mbe-certificate-example.jpeg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/mbe-certificate-example-480x327.jpeg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Federal certification:</strong> SBA’s <a href="https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-assistance-programs/8a-business-development-program#section-header-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8(a) Business Development Program</a> is for socially and economically disadvantaged people who either have or want to start their own business.

Here are the <a href="https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-assistance-programs/8a-business-development-program#section-header-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eligibility requirements and application process steps</a>.</li>
<li><strong>State/city certification:</strong> Some regions and cities grant their own assistance for minority-owned businesses. To check out opportunities in your area, do a quick Google search to explore all the opportunities in your area.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Apply for minority business grants and loans</h3>
<p>Starting and growing a business is certainly a pocket-bender, but there are small and minority-owned business grants and loans to help.</p>
<p>Each grant or loan will have its own eligibility requirements based on employee count, gross annual revenue, and more. You can use <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business-loans/small-business-grants-for-minorities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes&#8217; full list of small business grants for minorities here</a>. If you qualify, go ahead and start the application process. After all, even the smallest amount helps!</p>

<h3>3. Embrace your minority experience</h3>
<p>This one may sound a little cliché (it totally is), but it’s important. No matter your race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation, embrace your identity and incorporate it into the pride and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/23/how-brand-your-business">branding foundation</a> of your business.</p>
<p>Rihanna is just one example of a minority business owner who is constantly uplaying her authentic Caribbean roots and staying true to her message of diversity and inclusion. But you don&#8217;t have to be a celebrity to embrace the minority experience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/minority-owned-buisness-instagram.png" alt="tips for minority-owned businesses - instagram post embracing minority experience" width="720" height="417" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60120" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/minority-owned-buisness-instagram.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/minority-owned-buisness-instagram-480x278.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>4. Expand into other languages</h3>
<p>There’s no doubt that most people in the U.S. speak English fluently, but as the world becomes more globalized, you’ll be surprised by how helpful linguistic diversity can be.</p>
<p>For example, if you are a LatinX-owned business, go ahead and invest in English and Spanish translation services for your website and social accounts. Not only can you expand your audience, but you’re supporting the minority community by making it easier for them to discover, learn about, and access your brand.</p>
<p>Make sure that they can connect with every piece of marketing you put out there. After all, the goal is <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/05/accessibility-inclusivity-advertising">inclusivity</a>, not exclusivity.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/languages-spoken-in-us.jpeg" alt="minority languages spoken in the US" width="720" height="360" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60129" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/languages-spoken-in-us.jpeg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/languages-spoken-in-us-480x240.jpeg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>5. Follow minority influencers on social media</h3>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re looking for inspiring quotes or practical tips, there are plenty of minority entrepreneur influencers out there that can give you your daily dose.</p>
<p>Whether it’s lifestyle influencer Nabela Noor all the way to “The Glow Up” founders Shannae Ingleton-Smith and Tania Cascilla, there are so many minority success stories that you can learn from.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what industry you are trying to dominate. It doesn’t matter what specific goals you want to achieve. Sometimes, learning from others can be the best way to cut through the red tape of business and get right to the success you’re looking for.</p>
<p>Manifest victory by having it show up on your social feed every single day!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/minority-entrepreneur-influencer-bio.png" alt="instagram bio of a minority entrepreneur influencer" width="720" height="330" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60126" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/minority-entrepreneur-influencer-bio.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/minority-entrepreneur-influencer-bio-480x220.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/susanne.mariga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Susanne Mariga</a> is just one of the many minority entrepreneur influencers out there.</em></p>
<h3>6. Diversify your team</h3>
<p>The minorities that make up an MBE doesn&#8217;t need to all have the same background. In fact, it&#8217;s best to surround yourself with hard-working, dedicated, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/28/diversity-in-marketing">diverse</a> employees that come from all different kinds of ideologies, goals, and values on diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p>This is a great way to strengthen the minority community as a whole, not to mention strengthen your brand integrity.</p>
<h3>7. Use minority-owned labels and badges</h3>
<p>Platforms like Google Shopping, Instagram, and Facebook offer ways for minority-owned businesses to declare themselves as such. This makes it easier for socially aware shoppers to find and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/12/black-owned-business-support">support minority and Black-owned businesses</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/black-owned-badge-instagram.png" alt="black-owned badge on instagram" width="500" height="570" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60130" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/black-owned-badge-instagram.png 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/black-owned-badge-instagram-480x547.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>

<p>The majority of people in the United States feel underrepresented in media and marketing campaigns, and there is more interest in what brands are doing to address this issue given the social changes that are sweeping the nation. Because of this, diversity marketing is becoming a cornerstone through recognizing and actively including the many different groups of people that come into contact with ad campaigns.</p>

<p>Although the words ‘inclusion’ and ‘diversity’ create the image of an umbrella covering a wide audience, efforts to diversify marketing strategies must be fine-tuned to target very specific audiences and meet them in the places where they will come into contact with your brand. There are many ways to help your brand begin to effectively embrace the diversity that has gone unnoticed and underappreciated. In this post, we’ll cover three of them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Diversify your team</li>
<li>Perform market research</li>
<li>Let your customers’ voices be heard</li>
</ol>
<h2>3 ways to incorporate diversity into your marketing strategies</h2>
<p>It has become increasingly important that a company is <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/09/20/ethical-marketing">socially aware</a> and willing to include minorities and other groups of people that have, in the past, not typically been included in advertising. This is especially true as online <a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/19/social-media-for-small-business">marketing through social media</a> continues to become more streamlined in targeting specific (and potentially sensitive) demographics such as weight and marital status.</p>
<p>Creating visibility and representation not only has a major impact on how potential clients see a company when choosing where to invest their money, but it also is the key to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/19/conversion-rate-benchmarks">higher conversion rates</a>.</p>
<p>Here are three ways to create visibility and representation within your brand.</p>
<h3>1. Start by diversifying your team</h3>
<p>Before we get into how to diversify your team, let&#8217;s start out with some stats behind it.</p>
<p><strong>White males dominate the workforce</strong></p>
<p>Business in the United States is largely dominated by Caucasian males, which bars many women and people of color from making a comparable income.</p>

<p><strong>Female-owned businesses are taking longer to recover from the pandemic</strong></p>
<p>This has become even worse since the pandemic hit. According to Freshbooks’ most recent Women in the Independent Workforce survey, industries with predominantly female-owned businesses have been among the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/02/new-data-google-ads-benchmarks-during-covid-19">hardest hit by COVID-19</a>, to the point that businesses owned by women are <a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/press/data-research/women-owned-businesses-in-the-u-s-facing-slower-recovery"><strong>taking three times as long</strong></a>, on average, to financially recover when compared to businesses owned by men.</p>

<div class="column">
<p>The best way to ensure that your audiences see themselves reflected in your brand is by hiring a team that represents your audience. In order to relate to and understand what consumers are looking for, you have to have a team that can take their own life experience and craft messaging and imagery that is meaningful to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/25/hyperlocal-marketing">hyper-specific demographics</a>. Your audience will naturally gravitate towards people who believe, think and look like them, thereby naturally diversifying your brand’s following.</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>A diverse team attracts a diverse following, and a diverse following can give you even more insights and ideas to strengthen your initiatives.</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Diversity is a win-win</strong></p>
<p>Having a diverse marketing team can help your brand gain valuable insight into the needs of those who you are trying to reach which would otherwise be non-existent. In addition, by having a more dynamic group of people working together, creativity and expansion can unfold in a manner that is not available when you have a team that conforms to similar backgrounds and experiences.</p>

<p>This also allows brands to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/28/resilient-digital-agencies-2020">build resilience and adaptability</a> in a global market that sometimes changes in the blink of an eye. The more perspectives you include in your marketing strategy, the more visibility you can achieve.</p>
<p>As you can see, diversifying your team is not only favored by customers but also strengthens various aspects of your business.</p>

<p>The pandemic has challenged the norm when it comes to not only how and where we do business, but it’s also given us a more global perspective and shown us how important it is to work together towards creating new solutions. There is really no business as usual for any marketing strategy.</p>
<p>Avoid ignoring new information in favor of conventional methods of marketing. This is your time to stand out. Many missteps can be averted simply by taking an honest <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-marketing-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">look at the right data</a> and asking questions about the types of people you intend to reach. You may need to adjust your<a href="/blog/ws/2015/09/23/buyer-personas"> customer personas</a> in some cases.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Do not ignore new information in favor of conventional methods of marketing—now is your time to stand out.</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Approach your audience directly</strong></p>
<p>Not only should you be asking questions about your<a href="/blog/ws/2014/09/18/beginners-guide-to-target-markets"> target audience</a>, but you should also be asking them questions directly. Without conducting <a href="/blog/ws/2014/11/10/best-online-survey-tools">surveys</a>, focus groups, and field trials that include individuals from your diverse target market, <a href="/blog/ws/2021/03/31/brand-personality-messaging">brand messaging </a>will fall short and may even be harmful. Brands have to go directly to the source of hyper-specific demographics in order to glean meaningful information from the data being collected.</p>
<h3><span lang="EN">3. Focus on your audience’s perception of your brand</span></h3>
<p>A brand could choose all the right <a href="/blog/ws/2015/02/26/influencer-marketing">influencers</a> and imagery and still lose credibility with audiences by choosing inauthentic and exclusive messaging. The art of incorporating <a href="/blog/ws/2020/11/5/accessibility-inclusivity-advertising">inclusivity</a> into your brand requires confronting your own traditional messaging by actively creating a foothold for minority groups.</p>
<p>Instead of adapting current brand messaging, marketing agencies should choose <a href="https://www.twine.net/blog/freelance-portfolios-effective-graphic-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organic messaging and imagery</a> that is created to be welcoming, target-specific, and attractive.</p>

<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://blog.bonus.ly/diversity-inclusion-statistics">Image source</a></em></p>
<p>Consumers are no longer fooled by claims to be transparent or diverse. Major industries such as tech, healthcare, and fintech still <a href="https://tokenist.com/fintech-is-sorely-behind-in-female-participation-but-for-how-long/">struggle with creating inclusive atmospheres</a> in their workplaces and this shows through <a href="/blog/ws/2017/10/24/subliminal-advertising">subliminally</a> in their marketing assets. A brand must also be perceived as inclusive by its audience.</p>
<p>To be perceived as authentic, you must actually be authentic, and the truth is agencies may have to do some soul searching and redefine what diversity means from a very basic standpoint.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Claiming to be diverse and inclusive does not mean your brand will be perceived as such by your audience.</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Practices to become more authentic and inclusive start with the hiring process, flow into the work environment and business policies, are squeezed out through branding, and perceived by audiences through marketing and ad campaigns.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, let the voices of your potential and existing customers be heard. Let their language be infused into yours, so you can truly represent them and <a href="/blog/ws/2021/03/22/stand-out-from-competitors-on-google">stand apart from your competitors</a>. Making space for diversity means not just listening, but also building an awareness based on their feedback that can help your brand produce messaging that is relatable and authentic.</p>
<h2>Diversity in marketing is more important than ever</h2>
<p>The problems with gender and racial income disparity have only been magnified by the economic and social impact of the pandemic. Potential customers are becoming increasingly aware of the social challenges that people of all sorts of backgrounds, philosophies, and ethnicities are facing.</p>

<p>It is valuable to people that they not only recognize themselves represented in advertising, but also that they see a variety of people groups reflected as well. Embracing the diversity of consumers will impact marketing from now on, and staying on the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/30/social-media-advertising-tips">cutting edge of advertising</a> with this in mind will allow audiences to see how brands are leading the way toward awareness and inclusivity.</p>

<p>Rapid cultural shifts and the propagation of media technologies have rendered many tried-and-true marketing strategies obsolete. These shifts are constant and picking up speed drastically. The global village (or the interconnection of the globe through telecommunications) has made us all much more aware of people and cultures distant from our own, and have also shone a spotlight on the elements of our own society that have been virtually invisible for much of history.</p>

<p>These advancements have made marketing inseparable from technology, which is itself closely knit with modern culture. Facebook has, over the years, made its algorithm more culture-based by prioritizing content and ads that create positive interaction, discussion, direct sharing, and so on. Therefore, selling ideas has become more important in marketing than selling an actual product, which has given the advertising industry more power to influence culture and create cultural change.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll discuss how your business can honor and implement cultural shifts in your marketing through social responsibility, social listening, segmentation, and more.</p>
<h2>1. Advocate for inclusivity, accessibility, and social responsibility</h2>
<p>Making the distant and the sidelined more visible and integrated is a particular culture shift that has made <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/5/accessibility-inclusivity-advertising">implementing accessibility and inclusivity</a> into advertising incredibly important. Not only does aligning with<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/22/cause-based-marketing"> this cause</a> it increase your reach by giving you visibility among people living with various disabilities—and help your brand stand out among traditionally underrepresented groups—it’s also a significant part of the modern culture that values acceptance. Additionally, it is often simply considered the right thing to do.</p>

<p>As more millennials enter the business world and stock markets, socially responsible investing has been rapidly rising in the US since the mid-nineties with <a href="https://tokenist.com/investing/what-is-socially-responsible-investing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one out of every four dollars invested</a>— approximately $12 trillion—has been allocated to sustainable strategies. This number continues to gain traction as socially responsible investors gain more power and authority to demand more transparency, and more socially responsible choices being made within companies when it comes to making marketing and advertising decisions.</p>

<h3>2. Practice social listening to understand your audiences</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">A major shift that we have all been subjected to this year was brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Its impact has been immediate and damaging, and believing that it will not have a lasting impact <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/voices/covid-19-will-leave-lasting-economic-scars-around-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would be foolish</a>.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Apart from the huge move online, it has also fundamentally changed the way we communicate as collective teams, which has had a major impact on developing post-pandemic marketing strategies to adjust and navigate our businesses through a post-COVID world. This new reality will require a <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/18/post-covid-19-customers">full understanding of your post-COVID target audience</a>.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">One of the silver linings of the pandemic is that because of the massive move online, the opportunities for turning a <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/07/agency-profitability-metrics">higher profit</a> with your site are higher than it ever has been before. A whopping <a href="https://zyro.com/blog/profitable-website-ideas/">65% of internet users</a> have been fully reliant on online purchases this year, and that number is only expected to grow next year. Data collected through social media and customer surveys are extensive and reliable methods of gaining a better understanding of these customers. </span></p>
<p>But on the other hand, raw data can only tell you so much. This is where <a href="/blog/ws/2021/03/25/social-listening-boolean-search">social listening</a> can play a crucial role. Simply put, <a href="/blog/ws/2018/07/20/social-listening">social listening</a> represents monitoring what people are saying about your brand online. It helps you gauge the customers’ sentiment towards it, identify and prevent a crisis before it fully forms, and jump on opportunities as soon as they arise.</p>
<p>Netflix UK used social listening to figure out how the <a href="https://resources.audiense.com/blog/understanding-cultural-shifts-by-enriching-social-listening-with-audience-intelligence-netflix-uk-case" target="_blank" rel="noopener">segmentation of their customer base has changed</a> in 2020—which is something that has immense ramifications on existing marketing strategies. Social media marketing is now considered best used to engage audiences and nurture their trust and connection while the actual sales are best achieved through other means. This however presents the problem of your marketing teams acting too swiftly and overzealously.</p>

</div>
<p><span lang="EN">While a quick reaction to a rising trend or problem is usually beneficial, it can also compromise the brand image. Social listening should not be utilized without thought and plan. This goes hand-in-hand with the fact that culture can’t be thought of only as German, Canadian, Ethiopian, and Chinese. Cultures can differ wildly within the same region between professions, confessions, and hobbies—all of them merit consideration when coming up with a culturally conscious marketing strategy.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Remember, a culture that deeply connects to your brand image reflects your own corporate culture. Getting cross-cultural management right from the start can <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/04/build-a-culture-that-aligns-with-peoples-values">translate to sales and overall success</a> later down the line. This doesn’t mean that it should never be altered based on information collected, however, it should always be a carefully considered move and not a knee-jerk reaction.</span></p>

<h3>2. Personalize content through customer segmentation</h3>
<p>We have already established that social media campaigns should mostly be directed at <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/tips-to-help-your-business-build-a-sense-of-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">community-building </a>rather than actual sales. On the other hand, <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/21/promotional-email-examples">email advertising</a> presents itself as an excellent channel for just that while offering a similar community vibe.</p>
<p>Email marketing can net immense returns for a relatively small investment especially when paired with the ability to personalize the message using information gained through social listening. However, this can easily turn from simple to tricky, depending on the size of your organization.</p>
<p>It is reasonable to assume that for most businesses this is another area in which <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/01/automated-email-marketing">automation</a> is necessary. This might appear daunting as the idea of automation seems to defeat the idea of personalized marketing, but it’s possible that the two strategies can marry together to create seamless, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing">personal email marketing experiences</a> for customers.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="2b7378e8-ca48-47e9-80fd-d2f24e95ea95" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/adjust20to20social20change20in20markteing20personalized20automated20newsletters-1.png" alt="adjust to social change in markteing personalized automated newsletters" width="800" height="370" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>An automated, yet personalized email from the Nir &amp; Far email newsletter.</em></p>
<p>Another thing to touch upon is the importance of audience <a href="/blog/ws/2016/05/13/targeted-email-marketing-strategies">segmentation</a>. In the simplest terms, there is very little point in sending a snowmobile ad to someone living in the tropics—<a href="/blog/ws/2017/08/28/behavioral-segmentation">segmenting</a> your customers between those that could be interested in this product, and those that almost certainly aren’t is key to retaining subscribers and targeting the right audience.</p>
<p><span lang="EN"><a href="/blog/ws/2017/06/29/email-marketing-statistics">Email marketing</a> services can be an excellent tool for direct marketing of this type, offering a wide range of free and paid features including customer segmentation so different emails can be sent based on specific factors like culture. However, email segmentation can come with a hefty investment, with Mailchimp in particular <a href="https://hostingdata.co.uk/best-email-marketing-service/#footable_2762:~:text=This%20starts%20at%20%C2%A3250%2Fmonth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">charging $250 per month</a> for this feature to be unlocked and other services charging similar prices. </span></p>
<p>The combination of <a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/19/social-media-for-small-business">social media marketing</a> and<a href="/blog/ws/2019/01/03/email-marketing-best-practices"> email marketin</a>g is a form of <a href="/blog/ws/2013/10/15/multi-channel-marketing">cross-channel marketing</a>, which enables you to <a href="https://www.jotform.com/blog/implementing-cross-channel-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connect with audiences across multiple channels</a> and deliver relevant and personalized content. This marketing strategy, when used with social listening data, can create staggering results such as customer retention, increased sales, and brand loyalty.</p>
<h2>Stay on top of cultural trends so you can market appropriately</h2>
<p>At its core, social listening is about staying ahead of the curve and improving customer relations. Both of these things, while providing a great deal of value, require data-juggling that can prove difficult. While smaller operations could handle this with relative ease, things can get out of hand quickly.</p>
<p>Customer relationship management (CRM) software can be a solution for businesses <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/09/crm-for-small-business">with multiple tools</a> to support them in handling and managing interactions with different audiences. Social listening isn’t just about collecting information, it is about organizing it in such a way that helps you better understand, react, and plan for your future marketing campaigns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Customers are demanding more from brands in 2020 and beyond, looking for the companies they buy from to be engaged in their communities and active in the national dialogue. In 2019, <a href="https://markstein.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CSR-Survey-deck-for-website-20190930.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marstein</a> reported that 70 percent of consumers want to know what brands are doing to address social and environmental issues.</p>

<p>In 2020, as social justice came to a head, while mitigating a <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/02/facebook-ads-boycott">challenging political climate</a> and <a href="/blog/ws/2020/03/18/covid-19-google-ads-data">global pandemic</a>, consumers demanded that companies speak out. Brands like the NBA and MLB responded by supporting the Black Lives Matter movement and <a href="https://builtin.com/diversity-inclusion/companies-that-support-black-lives-matter-social-justice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">companies like Grubhub</a> took a leading role in the conversations that were happening online.</p>
<p>However, engaging in social change isn’t something that’s limited to major corporations and global brands. You don’t need a major platform to speak out when you see injustice or to stand up for what is right. See how these four companies took a stand, shifted their business processes, and lived their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/09/20/ethical-marketing">company values</a> to help make a change.</p>
<h2><strong>Mindfulness: WholeCo Media now proactively builds more diverse partnerships </strong></h2>
<p>Many small business owners have used this year to consider who they work with and where they’re unintentionally exclusionary. Carly Jo Bell, a <a href="/blog/ws/2015/12/23/humanize-brand">brand</a> coach at <a href="https://www.wholecomedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WholeCo Media</a>, realized that she needed to actively expand her <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/26/networking-email-subject-lines-templates">network</a> and partnerships to welcome people from diverse backgrounds, rather than passively expecting people to find her.</p>
<p>“I used to think that because I wasn&#8217;t intentionally collaborating with only white women, I wasn&#8217;t doing anything ‘wrong.’ But I now realize that to be true to my values is to intentionally collaborate with Black, Indigenous, and people of color—and this shift is not only a more accurate depiction of my true values, it also makes it easier to connect with customers who share similar values,” says Bell.</p>

<p>Bell is actively working to check her white privilege at the door and understand her role in building others up. Bell reminds us that we need to be intentional about <a href="/blog/ws/2020/11/12/black-owned-business-support">creating diverse conversations and relationships</a>—and you don’t need to work for a well-known brand to do that.</p>
<h2><strong>Education: USA Busines Insurance trains clients on regulations and bias</strong></h2>
<p>Social change isn’t just found on the B2C front. Many companies are working to help their clients become smarter and fairer with regard to social issues. For example, many insurance companies are seeing an increase in Employment Practices Liability Insurance (EPLI), says Sam Meenasin, vice president of Sales and Marketing Operations at <a href="http://www.businessinsuranceusa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USA Business Insurance</a>.</p>

<p>Meenasin isn’t just doling out insurance, though. He explains how they’re leveraging this opportunity: &#8220;We don&#8217;t just provide the coverage but we also mail all customers fact sheets with their policy renewal that outlines the rights of the people in their workplace. We feel this is just one small way we can help both employers and employees create a fair, just and kind workspace.”</p>
<p>In many cases, employers aren’t aware that their unconscious bias is at the root of the problem. <a href="/growth-academy">Education</a> is the first step toward creating an equitable workplace.</p>
<h2><strong>Representation: Celebriducks creates more inclusive products</strong></h2>
<p>If you don’t think your company can embrace social change and make a statement with its products or services, think again. <a href="https://celebriducks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CelebriDucks</a>, a company that manufacturers collectible celebrity rubber ducks, as a role model.

<p>“A few years ago one of our clients had us create the first transgender rubber duck of Amanda Lepore….She loved it!” Wolfe says.</p>
<p>Representation is important, whether you’re watching the first woman take the field during a <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/vanderbilt-kicker-sarah-fuller-makes-history-as-first-woman-to-play-in-a-power-five-college-football-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">college football game</a> or giving your child a bath.

<h2><strong>Invention: Ethicool Books creates products that fill a societal need</strong></h2>
<p>While existing brands are making great strides to build up their communities, some entrepreneurs are building new companies that solve the problems 2020 has brought to the forefront. This was the case for Teigan Margetts, co-founder of <a href="https://ethicoolbooks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethicool Books</a>, a company that develops children’s books that tackle big issues.</p>
<p>Not only will these books create a generation of kids who care, but the company itself gives back when it can. “For us, being more inclusive means giving back to those who may not be able to afford our books in the first place,” Margetts says.</p>

<p>She continues, “This year, we&#8217;ve donated more than 1,000 books to charities that support refugee families, as well as those who support people of different faiths to take action on climate change.”</p>
<p>The books themselves are manufactured with a minimal carbon footprint and are printed on recycled paper with soy-based ink to continue making an impact on the world, long after the books are finished being read.</p>
<h2><strong>Every company can take steps toward social justice</strong></h2>
<p>If Americans are going to take steps to create a fair and just country for all, regardless of race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation, every person and business needs to work to overcome their own biases and exclusionary behaviors. These companies, and many others, have proven that small businesses and entrepreneurs can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/13/wordstream-qorporate-membership">contribute in a meaningful way</a>—and more importantly, that we all have a duty to contribute to driving social change.</p>
