<h2>What is a marketing proposal?</h2>
<p>A marketing proposal is a written document that an agency/marketer provides to a client to communicate the details of a given project or service. Those details include everything the client and stakeholder need to decide whether to sign the contract.</p>
<p>Like any <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/11/business-proposals">good business proposal</a>, the marketing proposal comes after a discovery session where the agency/marketer collects all of the information they need to formulate the strategy, timeline, and pricing.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Want to know how your agency stacks up to the competition?

<h2>Why you need a marketing proposal</h2>
<p>So we just covered the basic definition and purpose of a marketing proposal, but there’s more to it than just information. It’s part art, part science. The science part is the logistics, quantifiable goals, metrics, timelines, and deliverables. The art part is how you present it, and how you use it to bring about the intangibles in your clients, like excitement about success, confidence in your services, and relief that their problem will be solved.</p>
<p>A marketing proposal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides all of the information needed for a prospective client to confidently say yes.</li>
<li>Shows how you can organize and convey information in a compelling way.</li>
<li>Gives you a chance to <a href="https://www.proposify.com/proposal-templates/marketing-proposal-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stand out from competitors</a> and also show that you’ve listened closely and thought through the details.</li>
<li>Highlights your qualifications and past successes.</li>
<li>Helps you to map out the project and stay accountable.</li>
<li>Protects you from scope creep and unpaid invoices.</li>
</ul>

<div id="what-to-include-in-marketing-proposal"></div>
<h2>What to include in a marketing proposal</h2>
<p>What you include in your marketing proposal will depend on your services, your client, and your industry, but here is a list that you can pick and choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cover page:</strong> Your first impression! Make it bold, attractive, and catered to your client’s brand feel.</li>
<li><strong>Executive summary:</strong> Summarizes the overarching problem, goal, and solution; the big picture concept that will get stakeholders to want to listen in on the rest of the presentation.</li>
<li><strong>Table of contents:</strong> A small but necessary detail to help your client navigate through the content on their own.</li>
<li><strong>Goals:</strong> What the client is striving to achieve. These should include both the project goals as well as how those goals fit into greater organizational and <a href="https://www.proposify.com/proposal-templates/marketing-proposal-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing goals</a>. Ideally, these goals are measurable.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges:</strong> What’s getting in the way of achieving those goals. Your client will know most of their challenges but you may also be able to identify additional ones during the discovery session.</li>
<li><strong>Solutions:</strong> The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/03/best-marketing-strategies">marketing strategies</a> you will implement to solve for the challenges and goals.</li>
<li><strong>Scope of work:</strong> The tactics of the strategies, as well as timeframes and other operational details.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> The deliverables of each phase or strategy, how they tie back to the core goals, and any additional benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing: </strong>The cost to the client fully broken out.  May have a few options to choose from. Provides clear return on investment</li>
<li><strong>Working with us:</strong> A look into the team members, your culture, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/09/company-core-values">values</a>. Keep it focused on what value this delivers to the client.</li>
<li><strong>Why us?</strong> Any <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/19/customer-testimonial-examples">testimonials</a>, awards, success metrics, special skills, or social proof that make you especially fit for the job.</li>
<li><strong>Contract:</strong> The terms and conditions and any other legalese you need to include. Try to keep this as easy to read as possible.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips for creating a winning marketing proposal</h2>
<p>It’s not just the information that goes into your proposal—but also how you gather, present, and deliver that information—that matters. Here are some tips on creating marketing proposals that win over clients.</p>
<h3>Do your prep work</h3>
<p>The proposal should come after a thorough discovery session where you get all of the information you need. Take detailed notes so your proposal doesn’t just satisfy their needs, but reflects that you listen carefully and care about and will cater to their individual preferences.</p>
<p>Information to gather in the discovery session:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goals and challenges (short and long-term)</li>
<li>The problem and the source of the problem</li>
<li>Past/existing strategies/successes/failures (including other agencies)</li>
<li>Existing metrics/What will success look like</li>
<li>Priorities</li>
<li>Emotions involved (frustrations, desires, pain points)</li>
<li>The personalities and work styles of the client’s team members</li>
<li>Their timeline, budget, stakeholders</li>
<li>Their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a>, brand messaging, and customer journey</li>
</ul>
<h3>Do additional research</h3>
<p>Your client knows their business best, but you should still do additional research both before and after the discovery session. Gather as much as you can about the client before the session so you can demonstrate your diligence, alleviate them from having to educate you, and free up more time for the more nuanced details.</p>
<p>Do research after the session, on the market, competition, and anything pertinent to the session. This will allow you to add stats and examples to your proposal that can strengthen your case and further <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-demonstrate-value-to-your-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demonstrate your value</a>.</p>
<h3>Make it easy to read and visual</h3>
<p>This is the same tip I give for <a href="https://www.usehatchapp.com/blog/hvac-service-contract-templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">service businesses in their service contracts</a>. Don’t write in complex or formal language to try and impress your client! Keep it <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/05/conversational-tone">conversational </a>and easy to read. Use terms they use, and constantly refer back to the problems and goals they are focused on. Also, visualize wherever you can, such as with timelines:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/marketing-proposal-timeline.webp" alt="how to write a marketing proposal - example of timelines in marketing proposal" width="936" height="545" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-78447" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/marketing-proposal-timeline.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/marketing-proposal-timeline-480x279.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Keep it client-focused</h3>
<p>While a marketing proposal is an opportunity to show your value and set yourself apart from competitors, it needs to stay focused on the client, not you. Any time you highlight something great about your business, be sure to connect it back to what value that provides for the clent.</p>
<h3>Walk through it with them</h3>
<p>Don’t just email the proposal over to your client. Set a time to meet and walk through it together. This will ensure the proposal communicates the information and messaging that you intended and ensures the client sees the details in your work. You can then send the proposal after the meeting and give them time to digest it, think it over, and come up with any other questions before signing.</p>

You can also make changes to the master template and customze the design to your branding. In addition, you can use Jotform itself to share the proposal via email and collect e-signatures from any device. It doesn’t include examples and it’s pretty basic, so this is best for marketers who know what makes an effective proposal and just need a tool to make it look great and/or offer esigning.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/marketing-proposal-template-jotform.webp" alt="marketing proposal template from jotform" width="431" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-78444" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/marketing-proposal-template-jotform.webp 431w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/marketing-proposal-template-jotform-216x300.webp 216w" sizes="(max-width: 431px) 100vw, 431px" /></p>

Like the above two templates, it’s best for marketers who can write effective proposal copy and just need a way to design it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/marketing-proposal-template-proposify.webp" alt="marketing proposal template from proposify" width="429" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-78446" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/marketing-proposal-template-proposify.webp 429w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/marketing-proposal-template-proposify-215x300.webp 215w" sizes="(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px" /></p>

<h2>Start winning more clients with these marketing proposal templates</h2>
<p>As I said, a marketing proposal is a piece of marketing collateral in and of itself. And it’s part art, part science. With the right balance of information and metrics with design and delivery, a good proposal can win over the client and set the stage for a successful project.</p>

<p>But what should a creative brief include and how do you create one that clearly communicates your desired output? We’re sharing all that and more in this article!</p>

<h2>What is a creative brief?</h2>
<p>A creative brief is a concise document that outlines the key elements and objectives of a marketing project or campaign. It serves as a centralized location to communicate all the necessary details in 1-2 pages.</p>
<p>Typically, a creative brief takes the form of a document, whether it&#8217;s a Google doc or a .pdf file. However, it can also be a sheet or a table within a project management tool.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that your brief isn’t a place for draft copy or sketching out ad graphics. It shouldn’t be a collaborative, working document because its purpose is to record the crucial details that everyone involved in a project has agreed to.</p>

<div id="when-to-use-a-creative-brief"></div>
<h2>When do you need a creative brief?</h2>
<p>You need a creative brief for any marketing project that requires developing creative elements and coordination between multiple stakeholders. If you’re a marketing team of one whose boss doesn’t want to oversee social content? You don’t need a creative brief for the holiday content you’re putting together yourself. But if you’re a marketing team of one who is working with an agency to create and manage a holiday social campaign? You’re going to want a creative brief.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-example-seo-article.webp" alt="creative brief example for seo article" width="936" height="549" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77179" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-example-seo-article.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-example-seo-article-480x282.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This </em><a href="https://milanote.com/templates/creative-briefs/seo-brief" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>creative brief example</em></a><em> is for an SEO blog post. </em></p>
<p>Here are a few common types of marketing creative that might require a creative brief:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Graphic design:</strong> Logos, brochures, business cards, brand materials.</li>
<li><strong>Ad campaigns:</strong> Concepts, copy, graphics, media.</li>
<li><strong>Website and UX design:</strong> Full site overhaul, individual pages, event product interfaces.</li>
<li><strong>Content creation:</strong> Blogs, articles, social media posts, and social series.</li>
<li><strong>Videography: </strong>Video content, animations, motion graphics, event videography.</li>
<li><strong>Photography: </strong>Headshots, brand images, product photos, event photography.</li>
<li><strong>Product packaging:</strong> Labels, boxes, containers, shipping materials.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a good overview, but it’s not an exhaustive list. If you need to align multiple people on a project, a creative brief is going to be a good idea—and here’s why.</p>
<div id="why-use-a-creative-brief"></div>
<h2>Why use a creative brief?</h2>
<p>You should use a creative brief to align all stakeholders on a marketing project or campaign. A brief that includes all essential elements—background essentials, creative direction, and follow-through plans—will help avoid re-doing designs or scrapping a blog post. That means saving time and money spent on any given initiative.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise then that Monday.com found that <a href="https://monday.com/blog/marketing/creative-brief-template/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">93%</a> of marketers use a creative brief of some form to capture and communicate information for their projects.</p>
<p>Even though the overwhelming majority of marketers surveyed used creative briefs, most weren’t satisfied. In fact, 67% reported that they found their briefs completely or partially ineffective.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-stat.webp" alt="why use a creative brief stat" width="500" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77180" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-stat.webp 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-stat-480x574.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you’re going to spend time drawing up a document like this for your projects, then it should be effective. Here’s how to write up a successful creative brief—one that leads to better outcomes for your projects and less stress getting there.</p>
<div id="how-to-write-a-creative-brief"></div>
<h2>How to write a creative brief</h2>
<p>Here’s a step-by-step guide to writing your creative brief.</p>
<h3>1. Write a project overview</h3>
<p>The first thing you need in a creative brief is an overview of the project to identify what you’re looking for, for what purpose, and how that will be completed and finalized.</p>
<p>Outlining these will avoid scope creep, which is the gradual expansion of a project&#8217;s original deliverables or requirements. If you’ve ever freelanced, you’re probably all too familiar. This happens when a client adds additional tasks, requests additional features, or increases expectations after the project’s already started. Often, all this ends up as uncompensated work.</p>
<p>This isn’t only bad for contractors, though. When you increase the scope of the project, it often takes more time to complete and needs more communication to review and approve.</p>
<p>Having a quick, clear overview of the project will help avoid scope creep and time delays so that you can keep on track and meet your goals.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/26a1.png" alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website</a></p>
<h3>2. Define the project objectives</h3>
<p>You need objectives for all your marketing activities, and that includes creative campaigns.</p>
<p>Take this example creative brief for PayPal below.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-examples-paypal.webp" alt="creative brief example from paypal" width="473" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77182" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-examples-paypal.webp 473w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-examples-paypal-237x300.webp 237w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/aaga8/paypal-creative-brief" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>The objective is stated nicely: The point of the campaign is to clear up misunderstandings about what PayPal does and make its offering super clear.</p>
<p>Now, in a perfect world, the specific misconceptions would be written out here. But this is still a good example of an objective for a campaign. What are you trying to do with the creative? Make sure this is what’s communicated to everyone involved in the project.</p>
<h3>3. Share your brand’s key messaging and facts</h3>
<p>You’ll also need to include your main message or messages that you’re trying to communicate with this marketing collateral.</p>
<p>Say you’re working with a freelancer who is writing copy for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/07/google-ads-location-assets-enhancements">Google Ads</a> about your latest product offering. What’s the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">value proposition</a> of your product? What’s the tagline? What’s the positioning statement? Share your messaging essentials in your creative brief.</p>
<p>While this is especially important for any creative using copy, it’s still useful guidance for visuals. It never hurts to know how best to communicate with your audience—which brings us to the next element of a successful creative brief.</p>
<p>You’ll also need to include some facts that can be used to guide your project. These could be stats, information about your brand, or insight into your audience.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/270f.png" alt="✏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Ready to make your marketing messaging more compelling?

<h3>4. Describe your target audience</h3>
<p>Understanding your brand’s target audience is the key to developing compelling creative assets.</p>
<p>So include relevant details about your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a>. This will include basic demographic information, like age ranges, gender identities, or occupations. But it should also include more insight into your audience’s connection to your company. Why do they connect with your branding?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/identifying-your-target-audience.webp" alt="questions to ask to find your target audience" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77202" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/identifying-your-target-audience.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/identifying-your-target-audience-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If your creative partner knows the pain points that your customers experience and what motivates them to buy your solution or service, they can use this to make the designs, content, or media more personal. And <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing">personalized marketing </a>is effective.</p>
<h3>5. Summarize your brand guidelines</h3>
<p>When you’re working with someone outside of your organization—or even simply outside of the marketing team—you should include guidelines for your brand.</p>
<p>The other relevant brand information for this will depend on the project. For graphics, for example, this will include your colors, themes, logos, and any design rules. For content, this will include your brand voice and tone standards or your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/10/content-style-guide">content style guide</a>.</p>
<p>Masooma Memon, a freelance content marketer who writes the great <a href="https://masooma.substack.com/p/letter-51-5-must-use-docs-for-working" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Content Workshop </a>newsletter, recommends keeping this background short and sweet. Instead of sharing a big document, link to a quick one-pager with big dos and don’ts. No one is going to be able to internalize a thick document for a single freelance project, but they are likely to go through a one-pager to make sure everything’s in order.</p>
<h3>6. Point out your competitors</h3>
<p>In your creative brief, you’ll want to include key competitors. You don’t need to include in-depth <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/21/competitive-analysis-templates">competitive analysis</a> in your project document. But you do want to include relevant competitor information.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you manage marketing for a doggy daycare and there’s only one other option in town. If you’re looking for new brand visuals, you want to make sure that your colors, style, and overall creative feel are super distinguishable from your major local competitor.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-competitor-example.webp" alt="creative brief - example of logos from two businesses that look similar" width="766" height="559" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77183" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-competitor-example.webp 766w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-competitor-example-480x350.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 766px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you ended up with logos this close to your competition because you didn’t include it in the creative brief, you’d be in trouble. </em></p>
<h3>7. Include any references for inspiration</h3>
<p>Let’s start with a caveat: Your creative brief should include more information about your business and your products than your competitors. But if you’ve got examples of amazing creative from other companies that you’re looking to for inspiration, include that.</p>
<p>The best examples to use will be from businesses that aren’t your competitors. You never want to copy, but</p>
<p>Take this creative from dog food company <a href="https://www.petfoodprocessing.net/articles/16103-stella-and-chewys-launches-first-ever-national-ad-campaign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stella &amp; Chewy</a>’s campaign below. This photo could be a great reference visual for photos highlighting dog leashes, pet-friendly hotels, or even hiking shoes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-example-inspiration.webp" alt="how to write a creative brief - inspiration photo example" width="869" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77184" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-example-inspiration.webp 869w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-example-inspiration-480x331.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 869px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3><span>8. Spell out the timeline and deliverables</span></h3>
<p>Your creative brief is different from your contract, which you should have as an agreement with any agency or freelancer you’re working with. It’s your contract that will cover payment terms and timelines, as well as other aspects of the agreement such as rights, non-disclosure agreements, and more.</p>
<p>But your creative brief should include an overview of the specific deliverables you’re looking for and the exact deliverables you’re expecting to receive.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re looking for a new logo, you need to specify what file types you’ll need—like .svgs, .pngs, and more—as well as any versions—like black and white, color, reversed, favicon. Those additional logos may not require additional designs, but they do require additional work. Your designer needs to be aware.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-logo-file-formats.webp" alt="logo file formats for creative brief" width="936" height="373" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77185" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-logo-file-formats.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-logo-file-formats-480x191.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://looka.com/blog/logo-file-formats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>It’s also worth confirming the delivery method. Videographers, for instance, might require you to provide a hard drive for physical delivery or specify ahead of time if you need a digital file transfer. If you have a bigger project, those files will be huge. Plus, you’ll need to agree on how many rounds of edits will be included and the turnaround time for these.</p>
<p>So stick a list reviewing the agreed-upon deadlines, the deliverables, and the method of delivery in your creative brief to cover your bases.</p>
<h3>9. State your distribution plan</h3>
<p>Context matters, and it should have a quick spot in your creative brief. Whether you’ve got someone <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post">writing a blog post</a> or putting together graphics for a campaign, it’s good for the creator to have an idea of where their project fits in your marketing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/social-media-sites-popular.webp" alt="popular social media sites" width="678" height="750" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76936" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/social-media-sites-popular.webp 678w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/social-media-sites-popular-480x531.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 678px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Social media assets are great examples for considering this. You can use graphics and copy across platforms, but you’ll want to tailor it slightly for the different personalities of each platform. On Facebook groups and family updates are the big draw. Images are secondary on Twitter. Photos are most polished on Instagram. LinkedIn loves a long-winded post.</p>
<p>Knowing the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">social media platform</a> you’re planning to use for distribution won’t necessarily change the scope of your project. But it will make sure your designer is aware of the types of content you’re competing with for user attention. That’s helpful information.</p>

<h2>Creative brief examples</h2>
<p>Need some inspiration before you write your own creative brief? Here are a few to help guide you!</p>
<h3>Colgate creative brief</h3>
<p>This creative brief from Colgate is simple, yet effective.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-examples-colgate.webp" alt="creative brief examples - colgate creative brief" width="477" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77186" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-examples-colgate.webp 477w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-examples-colgate-239x300.webp 239w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" /></p>
<p>They clearly lay out the information needed to get started on their project. And they keep it simple, yet on brand, with some Colgate-red icons.</p>
<h3>Nike creative brief</h3>
<p>Nike has excellent branding, so it stands to reason that their creative brief would be excellent as well.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-examples-nike.webp" alt="creative brief example from nike" width="436" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77187" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-examples-nike.webp 436w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-examples-nike-219x300.webp 219w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px" /></p>
<p>They clearly lay out their facts, objective, problem, the big picture, and their target audience to help guide their project.</p>
<h3>LocaliQ creative brief</h3>
<p>Here’s an example of a creative brief the LocaliQ team uses for internal projects.</p>

<p>It includes all the necessary information needed to create final deliverables that can include presentations, guides, ads, and more.</p>
<div id="creative-brief-template"></div>
<h2>Creative brief template</h2>
<p>Here’s a simple creative brief template to help you get started. Make a copy and get to work!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-template.webp" alt="creative brief template from wordstream by localiq" width="494" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77189" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-template.webp 494w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-template-480x582.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 494px, 100vw" /></p>

<h2>Make your creative briefs count</h2>
<p>This might seem like a lot of information, but remember that each of these steps shouldn’t take more than a paragraph. Your creative briefs should be compact—short and sweet documents that contain everything you need to know about a marketing project in process in just a few pages.</p>
<p>Here’s how to write a creative brief in 9 simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a project overview</li>
<li>Define the project objectives</li>
<li>Share your brand’s key message and facts</li>
<li>Describe your target market</li>
<li>Summarize your brand guidelines</li>
<li>Point out your competitors</li>
<li>Include any references for inspiration</li>
<li>Spell out the timeline and deliverables</li>
<li>State your distribution plan</li>
</ol>
<p>Follow these steps for less back-and-forth with your team and fewer creative revisions—and more time to focus on how to put your amazing creative to use.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The common saying “first impressions are everything” holds true when potential customers are evaluating your business.

<h3>Why is brand messaging important?</h3>
<p>Brand messaging plays a role in just about every aspect of your business! So, it’s a necessary element of any marketing plan. However, a strong brand messaging framework can also positively impact your business’s bottom line. Consider these statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/branding-stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">81%</a> of consumers need to trust a brand before they consider buying from it.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/branding-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">88%</a> of consumers say authenticity is an important deciding factor in which brands they like and support.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/branding-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">77%</a> of people buy from brands that share the same values as them.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ads-brand-suitability-controls">Brand consistency</a> can increase small business revenue by <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/branding-stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10-20%</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/branding-stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15%</a> of companies don’t have brand messaging guidelines.</li>
<li><a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/branding-stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nearly half</a> of all businesses publish off-brand content a few times a year—if not more.</li>
<li><a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/branding-stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">13%</a> of businesses don’t enforce their brand messaging guidelines.</li>
</ul>
<p>This data proves that brand messaging can be a powerful tool when trying to convince your potential customers to do business with you. On top of that, having a strong brand messaging framework can put you ahead of many other competitors that are lacking in the brand department (and improve your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/brand-perception">brand&#8217;s perception</a>).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brand-messaging-statistics-graphic.jpg" alt="brand messaging - chart of brand messaging statistics" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76876 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brand-messaging-statistics-graphic.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brand-messaging-statistics-graphic-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="how-to-create-a-brand-messaging-framework"></div>
<h2>How to create a brand messaging framework</h2>
<p>Before you go live with iron-clad brand messaging, you’ll need to set up a brand messaging framework. Here are the seven steps to create a brand messaging framework that works best for your business.</p>
<h3>1. Start with your brand’s mission statement</h3>
<p>The tricky part of creating a brand messaging framework is you may find yourself in a “what came first? The chicken or the egg?” situation. Your<em> brand messaging</em> should be crafted around your business’s mission statement&#8230;but you need a strong <em>brand messaging framework </em>to create the best mission statement possible.</p>
<p>That said, your mission statement can help structure your brand messaging framework around your business’s core objectives. So, using this post on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/02/how-to-write-a-business-mission-statement">how to write a mission statement</a>, try circling in on your business’s mission statement as the first step to a good brand messaging framework. Then, once your framework is set and you start implementing your brand messaging, you can always go back to tweak and perfect your mission statement accordingly.</p>
<h3>2. Set goals</h3>
<p>Your goals are going to indicate what you want your brand messaging to ultimately achieve. Be sure to take inventory of your business’s short and long-term goals in marketing so you can assess what your brand messaging framework should be working towards.</p>
<p>For example, if one of your goals is to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/lead-generation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get more leads</a>, you likely will be looking to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drive more traffic to your website</a> so that potential customers can fill out a contact form or call your business. With that in mind, you could create a brand message that entices customers with an “all online” process.</p>
<p>For reference, here are some of the top goals that drive most business’s brand messaging:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brand-messaging-goals-chart.jpg" alt="brand messaging - goals for brand content chart " width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76877 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brand-messaging-goals-chart.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brand-messaging-goals-chart-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>3. Research your target market</h3>
<p>Brand messaging isn’t only about what you say, but also <em>how</em> you say it, and more importantly, to <em>whom </em>you say it. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">Knowing your target audience</a> is key to crafting the perfect brand messaging that resonates with them, relates to them, and ultimately convinces them to do business with you. This might feel silly at first but take a moment to picture your ideal customer. Think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>What they might look like</li>
<li>Their lifestyle</li>
<li>Their job</li>
<li>Their income</li>
<li>The family and friends they might have</li>
<li>The devices or platforms they might use and when they’d be on them</li>
<li>Where they live</li>
<li>What they do for fun</li>
<li>The types of content or brands they enjoy</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/target-market-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">target market</a> traits like these can help you pinpoint how to correctly craft and deliver your brand messaging.</p>
<p>For example, if your home services business is targeting middle-aged homeowners, you might focus on a  family-friendly brand message since your potential customers likely prioritize family time. Next, you could decide to include <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/09/what-ott-advertising" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OTT advertising</a> (like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/06/hulu-advertising">Hulu Ads</a>) as a key marketing channel in your brand messaging framework, since your audience is likely streaming home renovation shows.</p>
<h3>4. Analyze your competitors’ brand messaging</h3>
<p>I’m not suggesting this brand messaging framework step so that you can duplicate or tease your competitors’ messaging in your own content. In fact, <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/branding-stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two-thirds</a> of consumers think it’s annoying when brands make fun of their competitors. So, you don’t want to do competitor analysis just to create a defensive brand messaging framework.</p>
<p>Instead, use the brand messaging of your competitors to get a feel for what you may or may not prefer in your own content. Seeing how your competitors present themselves can help you understand what the standards might be in your industry and how you can set yourself apart.</p>
<p>Try these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/21/competitive-analysis-templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">competitive analysis templates</a> to guide your research.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/competitive-analysis-basic-marketing-template.webp" alt="basic competitive analysis template example screenshot from wordstream" width="936" height="506" class="aligncenter wp-image-76073 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/competitive-analysis-basic-marketing-template.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/competitive-analysis-basic-marketing-template-480x259.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>5. Set your unique brand voice and tone guidelines</h3>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, your brand messaging framework is, essentially, a set of guidelines to help shape your marketing communications. With that is going to come some rule setting. You’ll want a set of standards in place to make it easy for your team to follow your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-branding-basics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>This includes any notes or examples of your ideal tone and voice depending on what works best with your audience. You may also want to refer to your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-brand-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand kit</a> for any grammar, font, or creative preferences that could impact how your brand messaging comes across.</p>
<h3>6. Identify core terms, keywords, and CTAs</h3>
<p>To easily maintain your brand messaging throughout your marketing journey, try sticking to a short list of buzzwords, keywords, or calls to action that your team can keep coming back to. This helps to ensure your brand messaging stays consistent over time since you’ll continuously use the same core terms that reinforce your business’s purpose. Plus, ideally, your brand messaging is also aligned with your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/05/seo-strategy">SEO strategy</a>, so that your brand messaging across your online assets can help you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google">rank for top keywords</a>.</p>

<h3><span>7. Try following the 3 C’s</span></h3>
<p>You may have already heard of the <a href="https://www.cxnetwork.com/cx-experience/articles/the-3-cs-of-brand-messaging-consistency-clarity#:~:text=and%20expert%20webinars-,What%20is%20the%203%20Cs%20model%20of%20brand%20messaging%3F,%3A%20consistency%2C%20clarity%20and%20character." target="_blank" rel="noopener">3 c’s for brand messaging</a>, but let’s take a deeper dive into what these “c’s” actually mean when constructing your brand messaging framework. The 3 cs for brand messaging stand for consistency, clarity, and character. Here’s a breakdown of each:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consistency: </strong>Your brand messaging should align with your business’s style and reinforce your unique personality. You never want your audience to see your brand messaging out of context and not recognize what business it’s associated with. Be sure you keep to the same types of brand messages over time, so your audience becomes familiar with your business.</li>
<li><strong>Clarity: </strong>Your brand messaging should be crystal clear and to the point. More importantly, your brand messaging should always be concise. With smaller screens and shorter attention spans, you need to get your point across quickly and efficiently.</li>
<li><strong>Character: </strong>Don’t be afraid to get creative with your brand messaging to help your business stand out!</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brand-messaging-3-c.jpg" alt="brand messaging - graphic of the 3 c's of brand messaging" width="936" height="429" class="aligncenter wp-image-76899 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brand-messaging-3-c.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brand-messaging-3-c-480x220.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="how-to-use-your-brand-messaging"></div>
<h2>When and how to use your brand messaging framework</h2>
<p>Once you’ve followed the steps above to complete your own brand messaging framework, it’s time to put it into practice! Here’s how:</p>
<h3>When<em> not </em>to use your brand messaging framework</h3>
<p>Since your brand messaging will inevitably be involved in most of your marketing efforts, it’s easier to name off when you<em> shouldn’t</em> take brand messaging into consideration. Let’s talk through a couple of examples. You don’t necessarily need to refer to your brand messaging framework when you’re&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Working with an influencer</strong>. Okay, I know <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/digital-marketing/influencer-marketing-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">influencer marketing</a> is a brand-heavy initiative. However, keep in mind that most influencers already have their own content style. Plus, today’s audiences can see right through inauthentic or forced content. So, while you want any influencer-sponsored content to align with your brand, try not to push the influencer to abide by your brand messaging framework. Instead, find influencers with a content style that already fits well within your industry, and trust them to create a post that will speak best to <em>their </em>audience (which is ultimately who you’re trying to reach in this case).</li>
<li><strong>Partnering with another business</strong>. Similar to my point about working with influencers above, you may need to find a compromise when combining marketing initiatives with another small business. Look for harmony between both of your brands so that audiences are inspired to work with both of you, rather than confused about who’s who.</li>
<li><strong>Writing sensitive ad copy</strong>. Whether you’re in a highly regulated or restricted industry (such as healthcare or finance), or if you’re simply stating what your offer details, you may need to be more conservative with the language you use to avoid any legal issues. Catchy brand messaging is great, inaccurate brand messaging that overpromises or oversees any audience sensitivities is not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are just a few instances where your brand messaging framework may not always need to come into play. Otherwise, you’ll likely want to refer to your brand messaging framework whenever you’re planning marketing campaigns and creating marketing assets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brand-messaging-influencer-positioning-example.jpg" alt="brand messaging - influencer brand positioning example" width="664" height="471" class="aligncenter wp-image-76905 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brand-messaging-influencer-positioning-example.jpg 664w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brand-messaging-influencer-positioning-example-480x340.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bunnyhedaya/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This influencer</a> put her own twist on the typical brand messaging from garbage bag company, Glad.  </em></p>
<h3>How to use your brand messaging framework</h3>
<p>As I just mentioned above, you’ll probably look to your brand messaging framework more often than not when promoting your business. Try to use your framework as an outline any time you’re looking to create or edit marketing copy and creative.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you decide to incorporate <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/ai-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI in your marketing</a> and use a tool like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/08/chatgpt-prompts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chat GPT</a> for a first draft or outline. From there, use your brand messaging framework to edit and ensure that the final copy is on point.</p>

<h2>5 brand messaging examples to learn from</h2>
<p>Aside from looking at your competitors, checking out brand messaging examples from other growing businesses is another smart way to get brand messaging ideas. Here are a few brand messaging examples across platforms:</p>
<h3>1. Brand messaging on social media: example from Liquid Death</h3>
<p>Water company Liquid Death is known to go after a younger audience with its edgy packaging, product placements, and overall brand feel. This is reinforced in its brand messaging on social media with the goofy TikTok they posted using a fun mascot. The messaging focused on slang that resonated with the target market using the word “mid” to describe other types of drinks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brand-messaging-example-tiktok.jpg" alt="brand messaging - example of brand messaging on tiktok" width="291" height="610" class="aligncenter wp-image-76900 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brand-messaging-example-tiktok.jpg 291w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brand-messaging-example-tiktok-143x300.jpg 143w" sizes="(max-width: 291px) 100vw, 291px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@liquiddeath/video/7038733129963654406?embed_source=121355058%2C121351166%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%3Bnull%3Bembed_blank&amp;refer=embed&amp;referer_url=sproutsocial.com%2Finsights%2Fbrand-messaging%2F&amp;referer_video_id=7038733129963654406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<h3>2. Brand messaging in search ads: example from Under Armour</h3>
<p>This brand messaging example from Under Armour conveys a unique personality through the text in the search ad. Addressing users directly using “you” makes the brand seem more friendly, familiar, and personable—which is key for a brand that’s nearly in every neighborhood shopping center selling intimate items like sports bras, under layers, and more.</p>
<p>Additionally, mentioning “technology,” “tech,” and “performance” throughout the ad capitalizes on the brand’s core goal of providing cutting-edge workout gear to shoppers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brand-messaging-example-search.jpg" alt="brand messaging - example of brand messaging on search" width="754" height="440" class="aligncenter wp-image-76901 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brand-messaging-example-search.jpg 754w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brand-messaging-example-search-480x280.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 754px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>3. Brand messaging in display advertising: example from Workday</h3>
<p>Workday’s display ad in this brand messaging example is short and simple. However, it uses power words like “collaboration,” “integration,” and “insight” in its brand messaging to make an impact.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brand-messaging-example-display.jpg" alt="brand messaging - display ad with clear brand messaging " width="772" height="130" class="aligncenter wp-image-76902 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brand-messaging-example-display.jpg 772w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brand-messaging-example-display-480x81.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 772px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>4. Brand messaging on a website: example from Zapier</h3>
<p>The brand messaging on the Zapier website is clear and consistent on every one of its pages. Like the other brand messaging examples above, it reinforces a few core terms.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s “winging it,” and then there’s “cluelessly flailing about until you’re fired.” The former sounds cool, feels cool, and works a lot of the time. But, without any kind of foresight or planning, the latter can quickly become your reality.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-meme.webp" alt="30-60-90-day plan meme dog working" width="901" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76413" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-meme.webp 901w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-meme-480x319.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 901px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Especially when you’re starting a new job. This is why it’s important to know how to write a 30/60/90-day plan.</p>
<p>Realistic expectations go a long way. When you’re a new employee, or even a manager onboarding a new employee, it’s easy to be overzealous. This can result in overpromising and underdelivering.</p>
<p>“By month two I can absolutely increase our leads by 200%.”</p>
<p>“By month two I expect you to increase our leads by 200%.”</p>
<p>No matter which end you’re on, manager or employee, these kinds of incorrect expectations set everyone up for failure. With a proper 30/60/90-day plan, you can create realistic goals, set yourself up for success, and safely “wing it” without all the flailing.</p>

<h2>What is a 30/60/90-day plan?</h2>
<p>A 30/60/90-day plan is used by both employees and employers alike. Typically, a 30/60/90-day plan outlines goals and expectations during the first 30, 60, and 90 days.</p>
<p>The idea behind a 30/60/90-day plan is to add structure to onboarding, with goals around learning the basics, meeting people critical to success, developing an actionable strategy, and eventually executing said strategy. You can also use a 30/60/90-day plan for new projects.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-example.webp" alt="30 60 90 day plan example for social media management" width="840" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76414" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-example.webp 840w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-example-480x343.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 840px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://fanbooster.com/blog/30-60-90-day-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>A 30/60/90-day plan should also include metrics for success. In other words, it’s important your goals are something you can measure with tangible metrics.</p>
<p>Things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete X of Y tasks</li>
<li>Finish X training modules</li>
<li>Develop a strategy for Q3 with X deliverables</li>
<li>Pitch X ideas for Y</li>
</ul>
<p>While the best 30/60/90-day plans are the ones you can stick to, it’s worth pointing out that a plan can change. If you realize a few weeks in that some of the goals aren’t realistic, revisit your plan, tweak the goals or timelines, and ensure everyone else is on the same page.</p>

<h2>How to write a 30/60/90-day plan for an interview</h2>
<p>While not definite, some companies will mention a 30/60/90-day plan during the later stages of an interview. Some may bring up a 30/60/90-day plan ahead of an interview and ask you to prepare one, while others might have you lightly touch on a plan right then and there.</p>
<p>It’s unlikely you need a fleshed-out plan for an interview unless explicitly asked for ahead of time, but it doesn’t hurt to have some of the higher-level points covered. Before putting the plan together:</p>
<h3>Carefully review the job description and the company itself</h3>
<p>Look at the company’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/02/how-to-write-a-business-mission-statement">mission statement</a>, what they call out on their homepage, what they emphasize on the job description, etc. Think about what bigger role the position you’re applying for plays in the company and them reaching their goals.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://www.warbyparker.com/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warby Parker About page</a> serves as a great distillation of their mission: to inspire and impact the world with vision, purpose, and style.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-mission-statement.webp" alt="warby parker mission statement example from website" width="773" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76415" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-mission-statement.webp 773w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-mission-statement-480x373.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 773px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Think about what goals matter to this position</h3>
<p>What might their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/07/agency-profitability-metrics">KPIs</a> be? Metrics of success? Given the company’s size and audience, what types of <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">metrics</a> and goals make sense?</p>
<p>For example: You wouldn’t want to say you can drive 500 leads in 90 days via your marketing role if their audience is smaller and a good quarter is more like 5 qualified leads.</p>
<p>Bonus: Before the later stages of an interview, ask about the metrics of success for the position. Not only is this a great way to see if the role sounds realistic and aligns with your expectations, but it’s also great for informing your 30/60/90-day plan.</p>
<h3>Be realistic and don’t oversell yourself</h3>
<p>What can you feasibly do in 30/60/90 days? Keep in mind you’re new this entire time, so you’re also busy learning about the company, audience, and product or services.</p>
<p>When mapping out realistic goals, don’t neglect time spent on meeting people as well. You’re going to do a lot of meet and greets in your early weeks, and possibly some interviewing or shadowing.</p>
<h3>Emphasize the role of learning and training</h3>
<p>Pay attention to learning, training, and shadowing in your proposed plan. If you’re mapping out specific goals, write down the titles of potential stakeholders you’d want to partner with for these goals.</p>
<p>Learning is an essential part of any job and it shows you’re excited to grow. It’s also a great way to meet your team and those outside your own department as well.</p>
<p>For example, if your role involves Google Ads and you’re not very experienced, call out some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/21/google-skillshop">Google Ads courses</a> you’d take right out of the gate.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-learning-goals.webp" alt="ppc 101 homepage from wordstream" width="578" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76416" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-learning-goals.webp 578w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-learning-goals-480x498.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 578px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Even if a 30/60/90-day plan isn’t asked for during your interview, having a rough idea of one ready to go on a moment’s notice can’t hurt. If you’re really excited about one you put together, you could even mention sending it to the interviewer after your call’s concluded.</p>

<div id="howto"></div>
<h2>How to write a 30/60/90-day plan for a new job</h2>
<p>The 30/60/90-day plan for a new job is similar to that of an interview, only you have the luxury of in-house resources and actually knowing (to some extent) what it is you signed up for. And even if you’re not asked to create one, it’s a good idea to make one yourself to stay on track.</p>
<h3>Days 1-30: Learning, learning, learning</h3>
<p>Typically, the first 30 days of a 30/60/90-day plan are all about learning. You’re new to the company and the role. You need to establish a foundational knowledge of the company, products, audience(s), and of course, your responsibilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Base your goals around learning and growing in your role</li>
<li>Who will you interview?</li>
<li>What training will you need?</li>
<li>Any courses you’d like access to?</li>
<li>Certifications?</li>
<li>Additional resources you’d like?</li>
</ul>
<p>As you embark on your first 30 days, take note of questions you have the moment they arise and follow up on them. This is your chance to learn all you can, and filling in any knowledge gaps as early as possible can save you a ton of confusion down the road.</p>
<p>Also, as you map out goals for your first 30 days and beyond, make sure they’re concrete, measurable ones. Both you and your prospective manager should be able to ask and answer the question, “Is this goal complete?”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/smart-goals-e1685648679235.jpg" alt="" width="936" height="561" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76423" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/smart-goals-e1685648679235.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/smart-goals-e1685648679235-480x288.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Make sure the goals you outline in your 30/60/90-day plan are SMART goals.</em></p>
<p>For example, you could state that by day 60 you want to complete X courses on Y topic, or have published four blogs and interviewed two in-house experts.</p>
<h3>Days 31-60: Strategy and further learning</h3>
<p>During your first 30 days, you’ve hopefully learned what you need to know to start thinking about strategy and upcoming tasks. So, your next 30 days should focus on strategy and further learning. Yes, more learning.</p>
<h4>Get a feel for what people and the department need to succeed</h4>
<ul>
<li>How can you help your department and company reach their goals?</li>
<li>In order of quickest wins/impact, what tasks make the most sense?</li>
<li>What support do you need to make these tasks happen?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Set realistic targets you can hit during this period</h4>
<ul>
<li>What kind of projects can you start working on?</li>
<li>What kind of progress can you expect to make on any projects?</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind you’re still learning at this stage, so you won’t be running at 100% speed in most cases.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-days-31-60.webp" alt="30/60/90-day plan example for days 31-60" width="471" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76424" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-days-31-60.webp 471w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-days-31-60-236x300.webp 236w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px" /></p>
<h4>Map out additional training, resources, certifications, etc.</h4>
<p>You can’t cram all your learning into the first 30 days, so you’ll likely have more to do in the second 30 (and maybe the final, too).</p>
<ul>
<li>Think about what kind of knowledge gaps you might have at this stage, based on the job description, the department goals, and so on.</li>
<li>If you can’t nail down a few concrete topics or knowledge gaps, put in some generic filler space to remind yourself that you’ll likely have more training to do as those 30 days get closer.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Days 61-90: Putting it all into motion</h3>
<p>You’ve learned, interviewed, learned some more, strategized, and continued learning, so now it’s time to execute.</p>
<h4>Map out every project, campaign, strategy, etc. that you plan on rolling out at this stage</h4>
<ul>
<li>What will you need to make these executions go smoothly?</li>
<li>Who needs to be involved? Who are the stakeholders?</li>
<li>What could go wrong here and how can you plan for it?</li>
<li>What kind of support do you need for these things to happen?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Plan to present your work thus far</h4>
<ul>
<li>What kind of reporting needs to be in place ahead of time?</li>
<li>What are the main KPIs or metrics of success for your projects or initiatives?</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, think about how you’ll present your work to your leads and show the impact and progress you’ve made.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-progress.webp" alt="30 60 90 day plan progress chart" width="936" height="493" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76425" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-progress.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-progress-480x253.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://monday.com/blog/project-management/30-60-90-day-plan-template/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<h4>Set aside some time to review how things went</h4>
<p>What good is all this action if you don’t stop to reflect?</p>
<p>While not something you can always plan ahead for in 100% detail, think about how you might go about revisiting your first 90 days, filling in any knowledge gaps, learning from mistakes, and ensuring your next 90 days are even better.</p>

<h2>What is a competitive analysis?</h2>
<p>A competitive analysis is a systematic method of comparing your business to its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/18/ppc-competitor-analysis">competitors</a> with regard to a set of criteria. Systematic, however, does not mean rigid. In fact, competitive analyses are very versatile:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can examine direct or indirect competitors.</li>
<li>You can look at your entire business or just specific strategies.</li>
<li>There is no right or wrong criteria.</li>
<li>There are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/16/marketing-competitive-analysis">marketing competitive analyses</a>, sales competitive analyses, project competitive analyses, and the list goes on.</li>
</ul>
<p>It all comes down to what you are trying to achieve. You can use competitive analysis to:</p>
<ul>
<li>See where you stand in your existing market.</li>
<li>Improve performance in your existing market.</li>
<li><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-make-your-business-stand-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stand out from your competitors</a>.</li>
<li>Bring a new product to market.</li>
<li>Enter into a new market.</li>
</ul>
<p>The world is your oyster, so let’s get crackin&#8217;.</p>

<h2>7 competitive analysis templates and examples</h2>
<p>With the above being said, here’s a look at seven different types of competitive analyses. Use the examples and templates as a starting point, and adjust them according to the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing metrics</a> that are most important to you.</p>
<div id="basic"></div>
<h3>1. Basic marketing competitive analysis template</h3>
<p>If you’re unsure of what you’re trying to measure or what your specific goals are, here’s a super basic marketing competitive analysis template that pulls together the key things to know about your competitors. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tagline: </strong>A short but powerful statement that can help you understand the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">intended value proposition</a> of the business.</li>
<li><strong>Target market:</strong> Who is their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">main audience</a>?</li>
<li><strong>Personas: </strong>What types of personalities, lifestyles, wants, and needs do your competitors cater to?</li>
<li><strong>Top organic keywords:</strong> What topics do they specialize in?</li>
<li><strong>Top paid keywords: </strong>Where are they spending their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/28/small-business-budget">budget</a>?</li>
<li><strong>Main marketing channels: </strong>Email, social, website, listings, reviews?</li>
<li><strong>Content types: </strong>Blogs, guides, videos, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/monthly-email-newsletter-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newsletters</a>, ads?</li>
<li><strong>Reviews:</strong> Do they have a proactive review strategy? Which platforms do they have the most reviews? The best reviews? The worst?</li>
<li><strong>Social presence:</strong> What channels do they use? How active are they?</li>
<li><strong>Overall brand voice: </strong>What is the look and feel of their brand?</li>
</ul>
<p>This will give you a big-picture understanding of each of your competitors and inspire ideas for you.</p>

<div id="swot"></div>
<h3>2. SWOT analysis</h3>
<p>Perhaps the gold standard of competitive analyses, SWOT stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strengths</strong>: What do you do well that your competitors don’t?</li>
<li><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: What do your competitors do well that you don’t?</li>
<li><strong>Opportunities</strong>: What do neither you nor your competitors do well, or where can you harness your strengths for a competitive advantage?</li>
<li><strong>Threats</strong>: What could hinder your business growth? Where could your competitors harness their strengths for a competitive advantage?</li>
</ul>
<h4>SWOT competitive analysis example</h4>
<p>Here’s an example of a SWOT competitive analysis for a local restaurant:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Excellent location, lots of foot traffic, good reputation among the local community, seasonal menu, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/28/green-marketing">eco-friendly brand</a>, locally sourced.</li>
<li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Higher costs and longer wait, less brand awareness, single location means limited reach, no online reservations.</li>
<li><strong>Opportunities</strong>: Growing interest in/support for locally sourced/sustainable ingredients; season keeps things fresh and interesting; potential for growth via food delivery apps/technology.</li>
<li><strong>Threats:</strong> Intensifying competition from established chain restaurants; <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/recession-proof-small-business-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uncertain economic environment</a>; rising cost of ingredients, food delivery apps/technology.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Keyword competitive analysis</h3>
<p>A keyword competitive analysis will take your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/keyword-research-for-ppc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keyword research</a> to the next level. With it, you look at your organic and/or paid keywords in comparison to those of your competitors.</p>
<p>The idea is to find out <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/11/14/how-to-rank-for-a-keyword">what keywords are realistic to target</a> to outrank your competitors and which ones are not. Because targeting keywords you’re not going to rank for—whether for SEO or PPC, is a waste of time and budget.</p>
<h4>Keyword competitive analysis example</h4>
<p>Let’s say you are a communication platform that streamlines email, text, and phone communication for home improvement businesses. Your bread and butter (your S in SWOT, if you will) is text automation, and you want to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/21/how-to-run-google-ads">start running PPC ads </a>for it. Perfect opportunity to do a paid keyword competitive analysis.</p>
<p>There are plenty of<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/09/competitor-keywords"> tools to help you find competitor keywords</a>.</p>
<p>For this example, I put Podium’s domain into Semrush, filtered for keywords NOT containing “podium,” and that have an average position of one, then sorted by traffic to the corresponding landing page.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/competitive-analysis-keyword-analysis.webp" alt="keyword competitive analysis in ahrefs" width="922" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76077" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/competitive-analysis-keyword-analysis.webp 922w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/competitive-analysis-keyword-analysis-480x311.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 922px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As you can see, the top keywords include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reviews for google (310 visits a month)</li>
<li>Converge pay (310)</li>
<li>Online reputation management (310)</li>
<li>Hvac marketing (169)</li>
</ul>
<p>“Sms marketing” is further down the list at 70 visits per month.</p>
<p>It appears as though Podium is more interested in <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-reputation-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online reputation management </a>and payment processing, so this could be an opportunity for me. Also, with” HVAC marketing” getting comparable traffic, I might want to look further and see if this is a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/niche-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">niche</a> Podium specializes in or if this is a particularly fruitful market.</p>

<h4>Keyword competitive analysis template</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/01/competitor-keyword-analysis">WordStream’s competitor keyword analysis template</a> includes columns for the keyword, search volume, competition, cost per click, funnel stage, intent, competing domain, and corresponding page. There are also two columns where you can mark off whether you’re already targeting that keyword and what the action is—you may need to improve your strategy for a particular keyword, start targeting new keywords altogether, or let some go.</p>

<h3>4. 7P competitive analysis</h3>
<p>The “7 P’s” refer to the seven elements of the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-cross-channel-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing mix</a>. It’s a framework designed to help you understand your own company, but you can also run the same framework on your competitors to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/12/growth-marketing"> identify opportunities for growth</a>. The 7 P’s are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Product: </strong>Think about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/20/product-positioning">specific features</a> around quality, variety, customer support, use cases, availability, warranty, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Price:</strong> Not just cost, but, discounts, payment methods, financing options, add-ons, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Place:</strong> Where is the product or service sold, what <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/26/marketing-channels">channels</a> are most successful?</li>
<li><strong>Promotion: </strong>What marketing strategies do you use? SEO, social, branding, PR, <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/ppc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PPC</a>, etc.</li>
<li><strong>People</strong>: What is the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-organizational-chart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organizational structure</a>? How about culture? Skills and talents? Hiring and recruiting methods? For some companies, you can get a pretty good idea of team structure by looking at its employees on LinkedIn.</li>
<li><strong>Process:</strong> How does the product or service get delivered to the customer? Is there interpersonal interaction between business and client? Self-service features?</li>
<li><strong>Physical evidence: </strong>How do you prove that your solution is the right one? What <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/04/marketing-collateral">physical assets</a> exist that legitimize your business?</li>
</ul>

<h4>7P competitive analysis example</h4>
<p>Here’s an example of a 7P competitive analysis for a video advertising company.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Product:</strong> Video advertising services with in-house videographers for custom ad creative, special proprietary budget optimization technology, and access to a unique network. Also, a helpful website to determine which video ad types will be best.</li>
<li><strong>Price:</strong> Prices are higher than most ad agencies, but because it includes custom design services, budget optimization, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/10/15/multi-channel-marketing">multi-channel strategy</a>, the total cost is cheaper. Plus, more effective ads have<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/17/lower-cost-per-click"> lower costs per click</a> and higher ROI.</li>
<li><strong>Place: </strong>Anywhere in the US, as the team can operate and serve remotely.</li>
<li><strong>Promotion:</strong> Able to show its strengths through its own stellar video advertisements, also uses video marketing industry content and DIY how-tos for SEO and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website traffic</a>. Not a lot of PR, a big focus on branding.</li>
<li><strong>People:</strong> Large development team heavily focused on the proprietary software, small marketing team as in-house designers produce much of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/13/content-marketing-strategy">lead-generating content</a>; large sales team that also shares in customer success. Remote team but prioritizes company culture and social responsibility, helps out in communities.</li>
<li><strong>Process:</strong> Mainly do-it-for-me with regular performance review meetings and some self-serve features and tools.</li>
<li><strong>Physical evidence: </strong>Gallery of video ads and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-testimonial-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video testimonials</a> created for clients plus its own content on its site. Large YouTube following and even Spotify playlist following.</li>
</ul>
<h4>7P competitive analysis template</h4>
<p>This 7P competitive analysis template is a spreadsheet that includes each of the seven Ps and then columns for you to fill in for your business and your competitors. There’s also a column to indicate level of importance for each factor and any key takeaways or action items.</p>

<div id="social"></div>
<h3>5. Social media competitive analysis</h3>
<p>A social media competitive analysis is…wait for it…an analysis of your competitor&#8217;s <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/best-social-media-marketing-strategies-for-smb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media strategy</a> in comparison to yours. It’s helpful in getting <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/target-market-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ideas for social media content</a>, distinguishing your brand voice, finding hashtags, and more.</p>
<p>There are dozens of specific<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/social-media-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> social media metrics</a> you can look at, but I recommend just the basics:</p>
<ul>
<li>What platforms are they on?</li>
<li>Which is their favored platform?</li>
</ul>
<p>For each platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>Target audience</li>
<li>Tone of voice</li>
<li>Types of posts</li>
<li>Posting frequency</li>
<li>Follower count</li>
<li>Engagement</li>
<li>Hashtags</li>
</ul>
<h4>Social media competitive analysis example</h4>
<p>Here’s an example of a basic social media competitive analysis I did on Chirrp, a texting automation software.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Platforms they’re on:</strong> Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn</li>
<li><strong>Favored platform: </strong>YouTube</li>
<li><strong>Facebook:</strong> 937 followers, 1-2 posts per month, 790 likes, promotional, testimonial, videos and quotes, 1-3 likes per post, #chiirp;
<ul>
<li><em>Don’t be fooled by the cuteness of our little bird&#8230; she is the most dangerous marketing tool on the planet</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn: </strong>137 followers, only one post, five months ago, for a job listing.
<ul>
<li><em>Chiirp is the ultimate communication and marketing automation toolbox for hind service companies</em>.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>YouTube:</strong> 441 subscribers, 177 videos, 1-2 videos per month; interviews, webinars, and demos promoting the product</li>
</ul>
<p>From this analysis, I can see that Chiirp doesn’t prioritize <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">social media marketing</a> aside from video and YouTube. From here I’ll want to understand if that’s because of limited resources (in which case this is an opportunity to fill a gap) or because social isn’t the best channel for this particular <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/target-market-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">target market</a> (in which case I shouldn’t prioritize social either).</p>
<h4>Social media competitive analysis template</h4>
<p>This social media competitive analysis template covers the points above, for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">the most popular social media networks</a>: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, and YouTube. It also includes columns for top followers, notes, and a link to each profile.</p>

<div id="pest"></div>
<h3>6. PEST competitive analysis</h3>
<p>You can think of a PEST competitive analysis as sort of a deeper dive into the threats of your SWOT analysis. As we mentioned, threats are typically driven by factors that are outside of your control. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Political:</strong> Laws and regulations, taxes, and even political forces that impact the ease of doing business in your market.</li>
<li><strong>Economic:</strong> <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-during-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inflation</a>, stock exchange rates, interest rates, labor costs, supply chain, sales cycle patterns—anything influencing your ability to make and spend money.</li>
<li><strong>Social:</strong> Demographic and population patterns, consumer behaviors, and cultural shifts that impact interest in your business or products/services.</li>
<li><strong>Technological: </strong>Tools, platforms, and technology that may compete with your offerings or give your competitors an advantage.</li>
</ul>
<h4>PEST competitive analysis example</h4>
<p>Here’s a basic run-through of some of the PESTs impacting a communication platform primarily for home service and home improvement businesses.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Political:</strong> New opt-in and consent rules and regulations around texting are ramping up. But this presents an opportunity to create templates, educational content, and product offerings that make these compliance hassles easier.</li>
<li><strong>Economic: </strong>Supply chain shortages and seasonality can dramatically impact any given vertical’s interest in the product.</li>
<li><strong>Social</strong>: With the pandemic over, people are less into DIY home improvement and are turning back to the pros. Also, with millennials and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/09/gen-z-stats">Generation Z</a> getting older and being less interested in DIY home improvement (and more interested in saving the world from itself), the home service industry is expected to grow.</li>
<li><strong>Technological:</strong> <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteAIinMarketingGuide.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_AIMarketing_Download">AI</a>, combined with personalized automation, presents a huge opportunity for call centers to become leaner and more powerful.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Porter’s Five Forces competitive analysis</h3>
<p>This framework got its name from Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter, who created it in 1979. The model examines five market forces that affect companies in any industry, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Threat of new entrants:</strong> The more players in an industry, the higher the competition, but some industries are easier to enter into than others. The ease with which a new business can enter into an existing industry depends on up-front costs, training, and certifications, as well as the power of existing brands in the space.</li>
<li><strong>Bargaining power of suppliers: </strong>How much power do suppliers have to raise prices which would in turn decrease profitability? This depends on how many suppliers are already in the space and the availability of alternatives and substitutes.</li>
<li><strong>Bargaining power of buyers: </strong>This represents how easy it is for customers to switch from one brand to another, such as for better pricing. When there are few customers and many alternatives, bargaining power is high, not to mention that price comparisons are more accessible now thanks to the internet. (This is why <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/11/10/customer-loyalty">building brand loyalty</a> and truly distinguishing your products and services is so important!)</li>
<li><strong>Threat of substitute products: </strong>Think not just about identical products and services but also different ones that meet the same need.</li>
<li><strong>Rivalry among existing competitors: </strong>When rivalry is high, industry players have to invest more in advertising and sometimes partake in pricing wars, which impacts profitability.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.business-to-you.com/porters-five-forces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<h4>Five Forces competitive analysis examples</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Threat of new entrants:</strong> For example, the hotel industry is a lot harder to enter into than say, the home services industry, but home services is still harder to enter into than food and beverage.</li>
<li><strong>Bargaining power of suppliers: </strong>An example here would be in the restaurant industry. Supplies are more abundant for fast food than for farm-to-table, so supplier power would be higher for the latter.</li>
<li><strong>Bargaining power of buyers:</strong> In industries like real estate, hotels, and travel, buyers have access to a wealth of price comparison tools, making buyer power very high.</li>
<li><strong>Threat of substitute products:</strong> Let’s take the beer industry. While spiked seltzer is not the same type of product, it serves the same purpose in many ways, and can therefore be a threat.</li>
<li><strong>Rivalry among existing competitors: </strong>Because of its difficulty to enter, the airline industry has fewer players and therefore higher competition. Add in the high bargaining power of buyers and suppliers and the competition is even more fierce.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you&#8217;ve got a new business or established one, there are lots of different ways to get your name out there in front of the right people. You&#8217;ve got pillar strategies like SEO, PPC, social, and more, and then there are more niche tactics within those strategies that can be wildly effective if you know how to use them right. One such tactic is through the platform Help a Reporter Out (HARO), which can help you to convey your expertise, build brand awareness, and improve your SEO through backlinks.How so? Read on and I&#8217;ll show you:</p>
<ul>
<li>What HARO is and how it works</li>
<li>How it can help you to build backlinks and brand awareness</li>
<li>How to respond to HARO queries the right way</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is HARO?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.helpareporter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Help a Reporter Out</a> (HARO) is a platform by Cision where journalists, businesses, and individuals post queries asking for information, statistics, and perspectives they need for articles they are writing. Experts can then respond to these queries, and the journalist can then quote them in the article and will often provide a backlink to their site (if applicable). <img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/haro-query-example.png" alt="haro query example" width="462" height="441" class="aligncenter wp-image-70546" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An example of a query in HARO</em></p>
<p>Journalists can come from well-known publications, making HARO a great means of <a href="https://splintereconomics.com/why-is-link-building-important/">link building</a>, which is crucial for SEO, while also <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">building your brand awareness</a> and media coverage. This platform is actually so effective that many HARO link-building services have sprung up in recent years, offering to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2010/04/01/build-amazing-backlinks">obtain high-quality links</a> from top media outlets (for a hefty price, of course).</p>
<h2>How to set up a HARO account</h2>
<p>To set up your HARO account, go to the <a href="https://www.helpareporter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HARO website</a> and create a profile. You’ll need to provide your name, email address, and some basic information about your expertise and industry. <img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/cision-haro-signup.png" alt="haro account creation" width="720" height="585" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70544" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/cision-haro-signup.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/cision-haro-signup-480x390.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /> Then, customize your preferences to see requests specific to your area of expertise and define your preferred frequency of email notifications.</p>
<h2>How to respond to HARO queries (template)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/10/link-building-secrets">To get backlinks</a> using HARO, it’s all about responding to the right queries at the right time, in the right way. And that’s what I’m going to walk you through now. Here&#8217;s a basic template I recommend: <div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'>Hi [NAME] My name is [NAME], and I have spent much of my career working as a [RELEVANT ROLE] ] at [COMPANY]. In [X years] of working in this industry, I have [LIST ACHIEVEMENTS]. Here’s my take on your query: Start every pitch following this outline, and you will quickly notice more responses from journalists and new backlinks to your website. Thanks in advance, [NAME]</div></div> Some things you’ll notice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Address them by name.</li>
<li>Thank the journalist for their time.</li>
<li>Say that you are willing to follow up/be interviewed (don’t worry, journalists will virtually never do this, but it’s good to ask)</li>
<li>Say thanks in advance. For some reason, this <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/01/21/email-signature-examples-and-trends">email signature</a> is associated with the most positive responses.</li>
</ul>
<p>But there&#8217;s more to a HARO pitch than this, of course, so in the next section, I&#8217;m going to provide some key tips.</p>
<h2>Tips on using HARO for backlinks and PR</h2>
<p>Below you&#8217;ll find my top tips for responding to HARO queries in a way that paints your business in the best light, actually lands you backlinks and PR, and develops relationships with journalists.</p>
<h3>1. Check the media outlet’s domain rating</h3>
<p>Domain rating, also known as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/12/domain-authority">domain authority</a>—depending on which SEO platform you’re using—is an expression of your website’s SEO value. When you’re looking to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/06/21/b2b-link-building">build backlinks</a>, the higher the backlinker’s DR, the more it will help you to increase yours. That being said, checking the DR of the media outlet in question will help you to identify whether pitching to this journalist will be worth your time.<a href="https://ahrefs.com/website-authority-checker" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> <img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/domain-authority-domain-rating-ahrefs.png" alt="domain rating in ahrefs" width="650" height="207" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53633" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/domain-authority-domain-rating-ahrefs.png 650w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/domain-authority-domain-rating-ahrefs-480x153.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Use a tool like <a href="https://ahrefs.com/website-authority-checker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ahrefs’ Free Website Authority Checker.</a></em></p>
<h3>2. Only respond to relevant queries</h3>
<p>Hundreds of HARO queries get posted every day, so you should only respond to those for which you have relevant experience (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/05/seo-trends">experience is now part of Google&#8217;s E-E-A-T formula</a>, by the way!). In the example above, you can see in the requirements that Cynthia is looking for consumer analysts, so if you are one, have conducted research in the field, or have a relevant degree, you may be the perfect match.</p>
<h3>3. Show your credentials</h3>
<p>On that note, make it clear right away that you are a quality and credible source for them. State your credentials and relevant experience right away. And don’t underestimate the power of your own credibility. You don’t have to be Elon Musk to get a link from The New York Times!</p>
<h3>4. Respond within 30 minutes</h3>
<p>Time is of the essence for journalists, so being proactive with your responses is crucial. Most queries on HARO will have a pitch deadline, but the best advice is to try to be the first one to respond. Journalists are often looking for a quick quote to plug into their articles and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/04/how-to-write-a-press-release">press releases</a>. They want convenience, not a life story. Play to this and try to respond to a query within 30 minutes. Fast responses win HARO links! <img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/submit-new-pitch-haro.png" alt="submit new pitch on haro" width="504" height="380" class="aligncenter wp-image-70549" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/submit-new-pitch-haro.png 504w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/submit-new-pitch-haro-480x362.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 504px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://byjessicala.com/help-a-reporter-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<h3>5. Make it quantifiable and/or quotable</h3>
<p>Journalists will take you much more seriously if you can reference <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/03/how-to-write-a-case-study">case studies</a> and statistics that back up your input. For example, instead of saying “Focusing on B2B sales is important” try “Focusing on B2B sales can lead to a 138% year-over-year return.” Also, be quotable. Try and visualize your response in a Forbes article. Does it fit or sound clunky? Quotable excerpts are intelligent and memorable but brief and to the point. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/06/how-to-write-copy-that-sells">Being clear and concise with your copy</a> will make it easier for journalists to select your pitches over others.</p>
<h3>6. Don’t follow up until after you get a response</h3>
<p>If you don’t get a response, the journalist has probably deleted your pitch because you’re not qualified and time is of the essence. Don’t keep chasing them. This will signal to the journalist you are just desperate for backlinks and/or media exposure and they’ll avoid you in the future.</p>
<h3>7. Don’t expect every pitch to succeed</h3>
<p>On HARO, a success rate between <strong>5-10%</strong> is fairly common. Some specialists can get this a bit higher, but no one will acquire media coverage and a strong backlink for every pitch. Stay positive and consistent with your HARO pitches. You can even delegate this to one of your employees if needed. But please don’t give up after writing a few pitches! It’s not about the quantity of links you build but the quality of the links—and the quality of the relationships! Which is my next tip. <img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/google-ranking-factors-seo-backlinks-link-juice.png" alt="google ranking factors - how backlinking link juice is transferred" width="720" height="475" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63665" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/google-ranking-factors-seo-backlinks-link-juice.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/google-ranking-factors-seo-backlinks-link-juice-480x317.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>8. Focus on relationships</h3>
<p>HARO isn’t a one-way street. It’s give <em>and</em> take. Focus not on building backlinks, but on building relationships with journalists. Share the article with your network, and follow up with journalists to thank them, let them know you’ve shared it, and offer to help with new articles.</p>
<h3>9. Track your success</h3>
<p>As you know, not all links are created equally. Context, relevancy, and authority all influence how search engines determine a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google">website&#8217;s ranking power</a>. Create a spreadsheet to track your success. It can be as simple as “Publication Name” and “Yes/No” or it can be a little more sophisticated (like this one). <img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/how-to-use-haro-backlinks-spreadsheet-tracker.png" alt="haro backlink tracking spreadsheet" width="720" height="368" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70547" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/how-to-use-haro-backlinks-spreadsheet-tracker.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/how-to-use-haro-backlinks-spreadsheet-tracker-480x245.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /> This will help you measure, optimize, and scale your link-building efforts.</p>
<h3>10. Sign up for Google Alerts</h3>
<p>On a similar note, it’s a good idea to sign up for Google Alerts so that you will get a notification every time you earn a new link. Also, be sure to regularly run site searches and check SEO tools to find new backlinks. <div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><strong>Speaking of SEO tools, have you used our <a href="https://localiq.com/website-grader/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free Website Grader</a></strong>? Get a free audit of your website in less than a minute!</div></div> This can help you to identify patterns and trends in the type of backlinks you are getting e.g. topics, pitch style, etc. From here, you can make much more data-driven decisions about HARO link building and whether it can viably fit into your long-term <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO strategy</a>.</p>
<h3>11. Use it as a larger backlink strategy</h3>
<p>In the same way that different backlinks hold different levels of value, there are also many different ways to build links besides HARO. Other ways to build backlinks include <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/06/21/guest-posting-dos-donts">guest posting</a>, niche content, statistic posts, infographics, content syndication, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/15/lead-magnet-ideas">lead magnets</a> like free tools. Diversifying your efforts will help your backlink profile to grow naturally, with varied anchor text, and across multiple channels.</p>
<h2>Start building backlinks with HARO</h2>
<p>HARO outreach is one of the best ways for businesses to increase brand awareness, generate referral traffic, and, most importantly, build high-quality backlinks. Plus, seeing your business get featured in the media is very gratifying. Follow these HARO tips and best practices, and you will get to experience it yourself!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being a content creator can be overwhelming. Keeping up with blog posts, guides, and everything else on the agenda is hard work!</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a way to streamline and speed up your work flow, read on.</p>

<h2>What is an editorial calendar?</h2>
<p>An editorial calendar is more than just a schedule of your content. It’s a visual tool that lets one person or an entire team to plan, create, schedule, and promote content—for the next week, month, or even year. It includes the tasks, team members, and due dates involved at every stage.</p>
<p><a id="why"></a></p>
<h2>Why use an editorial calendar?</h2>
<p>The benefits of using an editorial calendar are many, but here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>More cohesive content. </strong>When you plan out your content in advance, you can organize it into themes and create pieces that support one another each month.</li>
<li><strong>Save time. </strong>You always know exactly what content to work on next, taking writers block out of the equation. Plus, all of your tasks are prioritized and streamlined. Some editorial calendar tools even have integrations where you can publish and promote across multiple platforms at once.</li>
<li><strong>Stay on track.</strong> An editorial calendar ensures that you and every team member can progress along with the timeline of a project, and make sure no task is left undone or delayed.</li>
<li><strong>Store ideas. </strong>Combining an idea bank with your content calendar is very effective idea capturing on the go, especially if you can access your calendar on mobile.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my experience, using an editorial calendar has made a tremendous difference in the way I work and I have never looked back. Procrastination often occurs when we don’t know what to do next, and so we delay the work at hand.</p>
<p>But for me at least, when I know that all I need to do is conduct the different tasks listed in my specific checklists, I am more productive and I procrastinate much less. Now, I hope it can do the same for you!</p>
<p>Keep reading and I’ll show you how you can use a free template of a Trello-based editorial calendar.<br />

<h2>How to create an editorial calendar</h2>
<p>Here are some foundational principles to guide you in the process.</p>
<h3>1. Establish a loose content strategy</h3>
<p>While an editorial calendar can help you to refine your content strategy, you do need to have an initial framework to begin with. You can use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/13/content-marketing-strategy">our guide to creating a content strategy</a> for a deeper dive, but here are some basic questions to start with.</p>

<li><strong>What are your goals? </strong>Are you looking to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">increase organic traffic</a> with blog posts, generate leads with gated content, produce sales enablement materials? This will help you answer the next question…</li>
<li><strong>What type(s) of content are you making?</strong> For organic traffic, you’ll need <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/05/blog-post-templates">SEO blog posts</a>. For <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/18/gated-content">gated content</a>, you’ll need to produce PDF ebooks. For sales enablement, you’ll need to create one-sheets and slide decks. For brand awareness and link building, you’ll likely need to write guest posts.</li>
<li><strong>How much content do you want to publish?</strong> Based on the content type and team size, you should have some realistic goals and objectives for how much content you want to publish each week, month, and year.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Lay out your work flow</h3>
<p>Once you have an idea of what content you want to produce and how much of it, you can lay out your workflow. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your ideation process. </strong>How do you find, store, and manage your content ideas?</li>
<li><strong>SEO optimizations.</strong> You’ll want to include<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/09/18/best-keyword-research-tools"> keyword research</a> and on-site and off-site tasks.</li>
<li>Lay out the different stages and specific activities of your workflow, and assign any tags, color codes, or labels that are important to visualize and maintain production timelines.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Choose an editorial calendar software</h3>
<p>With an understanding of your strategy, workflow, and team size, now you’ll need to find out which software is most suitable for you and/or your team. Which is what this next section will cover.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/editorial-calendar-example-monday.png" alt="editorial calendar example by monday" width="720" height="379" class="size-full wp-image-69762 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/editorial-calendar-example-monday.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/editorial-calendar-example-monday-480x253.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://monday.com/blog/project-management/editorial-calendar-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<p><a id="tools"></a></p>
<h2>Editorial calendar tools</h2>
<p>There are several different approaches and tools you can use to create your own editorial calendar for free.</p>
<h3>Project management software</h3>
<p>Project management software like Asana and Trello are often the go-to for editorial calendars. My coworkers and I use the free version of Trello and we love it! With Trello, you have a workspace and within your workspace you can create boards. Within boards are cards where you can add descriptions, checklists, labels, due dates, attachments, and more. This makes it simple to keep track of various aspects of the content creation process.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/trello-editorial-calendar-template.png" alt="trello editorial calendar template" width="720" height="509" class="size-full wp-image-69753 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/trello-editorial-calendar-template.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/trello-editorial-calendar-template-480x339.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You can also invite others to work on your boards. This is great for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/12/cross-functional-collaboration">collaboration</a>, but not the best for large teams since it can become quite messy with too many cards and labels.</p>
<p>You can upgrade to the paid version for more power-ups and powerful integration features.</p>

<h3>Spreadsheets</h3>
<p>Spreadsheet software like Excel and Google Sheets can be used for editorial calendars if you don’t have the time to learn new software, but they are more manual and not as visual. I have made an example in a spreadsheet to demonstrate what an editorial calendar in Excel/Google docs might look like. Feel free to make your own based on this suggestion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/editorial-calendar-template-spreadsheet.png" alt="editorial calendar template - spreadsheet" width="720" height="406" class="size-full wp-image-69755 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/editorial-calendar-template-spreadsheet.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/editorial-calendar-template-spreadsheet-480x271.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Regular calendars</h3>
<p>Regular calendars like Outlook or Google Calendar can be good choices for visualizing and scheduling tasks fast and easy—plus you’ll get built-in reminders. Furthermore, you can create checklist templates with specific tasks across the different stages of the workflow, and paste them into the calendar note field to keep track of what you have done and what&#8217;s remaining.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, regular calendars might not be the best if you want to keep track of status in an orderly manner and see everything in one glance. Here’s a simple overview of how a month&#8217;s worth of planned content might look like in Google Calendar, with color codes used to identify the type of content and status.</p>

<h2>Free Trello editorial calendar template</h2>
<p>Ok! Let me share with you my Trello editorial calendar template. It works wonders for me in building out my content marketing funnel, so I want to share it with you!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the link:</p>
<p><a href="https://trello.com/b/GgKerIZq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trello editorial calendar template</a></p>
<p>Here’s what it looks like:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/trello-editorial-calendar-template.png" alt="trello editorial calendar template" width="720" height="509" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-69753" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/trello-editorial-calendar-template.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/trello-editorial-calendar-template-480x339.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And here are its three components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lists:</strong> The lists are used to represent the different stages of content, from ideation to promotion.</li>
<li><strong>Checklists:</strong> The checklists are used to add tasks to cards.</li>
<li><strong>Labels:</strong> Colored labels represent statuses, for example “Pending review”.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you decide to make content on one of your ideas, simply move the card into the <strong>“date assigned”</strong> list and set a date for it.</p>
<h3>The lists</h3>
<p>This Trello editorial calendar board consists of 6 lists:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Guest post ideas:</strong> Stores all your ideas for guest content</li>
<li><strong>In-house post ideas</strong> &#8211; Stores all your ideas for own content</li>
<li><strong>Date assigned</strong> &#8211; Content ideas that you have scheduled</li>
<li><strong>In progress</strong> &#8211; Content that are in the making</li>
<li><strong>Published</strong> &#8211; Published content</li>
<li><strong>Resources</strong> &#8211; Checklist templates and other resources.</li>
</ol>
<p>As mentioned above, each list consists of cards, which are your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/27/blog-post-ideas">content ideas</a>. You can add checklists, labels, and dates to each card.</p>
<h3>The checklists</h3>
<p>This editorial calendar has several different checklists, each relevant to different stages of the content creation process. Alright, but what kind of checklist am I talking about here? Well, in fact, checklists for helping you along every step of the process!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Keyword research</strong> &#8211; This is the very first checklist you conduct when creating a piece of content. Here you can choose between the free approach, or the paid approach using Ahrefs. I use both methods. I have made a post on how to do <a href="https://www.themarketingonion.com/long-tail-keyword-research-and-competitior-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free keyword research</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Review draft checklist: </strong>Title, content structure, call to action, images identified.</li>
<li><strong>Review checklist. </strong>Relevant when <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/12/self-editing-checklist">editing your first draft</a> and getting it ready for publication. It’s basically<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/06/on-page-seo"> on-site SEO</a> stuff, optimizing for social media sharing, quality check etc.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/editorial-calendar-template-trellow-review-checklist.png" alt="trello editorial calendar template - review checklist" width="720" height="695" class="size-full wp-image-69759 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/editorial-calendar-template-trellow-review-checklist.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/editorial-calendar-template-trellow-review-checklist-480x463.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></li>
<li><strong>Publishing and initial promotion checklist. </strong>For publishing and promoting your content. It’s a list of several different channels to promote your content in.</li>
<li><strong>Follow-up promo checklist.</strong> Promotion activities one year after publication.</li>
<li><strong>Pinterest publishing checklist:</strong> Step-by-step checklist on how to make pins and schedule them for <a href="https://www.themarketingonion.com/pinterest-marketing-strategy-for-bloggers-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post promotion on Pinterest</a>.</li>
</ol>
<ol></ol>
<p>To import any of these checklists into a card:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the card in which you want to import a checklist</li>
<li>Click the “Checklist” option on the card’s right-hand side.</li>
<li>Choose “Copy items from…” and choose your intended checklist from the menu.</li>
</ol>
<h3>The labels</h3>
<p>In this template, I use labels for content type as well as status. This is great for staying organized and in control of your schedule.</p>
<p>You can add new labels as well to customize it as you wish. Here are the labels I use for content types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog post</li>
<li>Video</li>
<li>Email newsletter</li>

<h2>Pro tips for this editorial calendar</h2>
<p>Now I&#8217;ll leave you with some final tips for getting the most out of this template!</p>
<h3>1. Customize to your liking</h3>
<p>Note that this editorial calendar is a template, and you can edit it the way you want. The more detailed customization is added to it, the better. If it suits your needs as it is, great!</p>
<h3>2. Get Trello for mobile</h3>
<p>Download the Trello app on your mobile phone and use the widget to capture ideas quickly when you’re out and about. Here’s how</p>
<ol>
<li>First, download and install the Trello app from Appstore or Google Play</li>
<li>Second, add the widget to your phone’s widget area</li>
<li>Then, wait until you’re hit with a content idea. Now, quickly get your phone out and click the widget’s “Add card” button</li>
<li>Choose the Trello board and the list that you want the card to be added to. This would be one of your idea lists. Like this:<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/editorial-calendar-trello-template-idea-captured-phone.png" alt="trello editorial calendar template -card example" width="439" height="471" class="wp-image-69754 aligncenter" /></li>
<li>Finally, click the “Add” button, and that&#8217;s it! Your new idea has been saved to your idea list.</li>
</ol>
<h3>3. Use the calendar power-up</h3>
<p>When the calendar power-up is activated in Trello you will see the scheduled posts in the Trello calendar making up to a month&#8217;s worth of content visible at a glance. Simply click the calendar power-up located at the top of your board.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/trello-editorial-calendar-template-calendar-power-up.png" alt="trello editorial calendar template - calendar power up" width="720" height="264" class="size-full wp-image-69752 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/trello-editorial-calendar-template-calendar-power-up.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/trello-editorial-calendar-template-calendar-power-up-480x176.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Now you’ll see a calendar with all your cards visible at the assigned date, with its labels. I have done some demo scheduling with cards in all the different lists to show you how it looks like in the Trello calendar</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/editorial-calendar-example-calendar-layout.png" alt="editorial calendar example" width="720" height="355" class="size-full wp-image-69760 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/editorial-calendar-example-calendar-layout.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/editorial-calendar-example-calendar-layout-480x237.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In the calendar view you may click on the cards and view them directly from the calendar interface. Notice that all the status labels are also showing, which gives you a good overview of status of all the scheduled posts. The labels are explained in more detail below together with the other features of the board.</p>
<h3>4. Use Mammoth</h3>
<p>If you have a WordPress site and write your content in Microsoft Word or in Google Docs, you can use a plugin called Mammoth .docx converter to import a post from your writing client easily into WordPress!</p>
<h3>5. Use Yoast</h3>
<p>Now you can just do the tasks in this checklist and get the stuff done! The YOAST SEO plugin is very helpful when working through this list.</p>
<h2>Start building out your editorial calendar</h2>
<p>Using some form of an editorial calendar is a must for every content creator. I hope you have enjoyed reading this post and that it has provided you with some constructive value.</p>
<p>Enjoy this editorial calendar! I hope it makes a difference in your workflow efficiency. Please leave a comment if you have any questions and I’ll be happy to answer them the best I can!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you want to be successful in business, then you need to know where every dollar goes. It’s not enough to have a rough idea—it needs to be on paper. That’s where a business budget comes in. But according to a <a href="https://clutch.co/accounting/resources/why-small-businesses-need-budgets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study by Clutch</a>, 46% of small businesses don’t have a declared budget. That&#8217;s almost half <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f62e.png" alt="😮" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />.</p>

<p>Budgeting can be intimidating, but don’t worry—you don’t need a financial or accounting background to create a small business budget. In this post, I&#8217;m going to cover all of the budgeting basics you need to know, show you how to create a small business budget, and then provide templates so you&#8217;re not starting from scratch.</p>

<h2>Why you need a small business budget</h2>
<p>In a nutshell, budgeting forces you to focus on your business objectives and serves as a compass to know if you’re headed in the right direction.  Plus, every business goes through financial fluctuations over time. Budgeting helps you navigate these, from late payments to getting the rug pulled out from under you. Here are the key benefits of having a small business budget:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Financial health check</strong>. It lets you know if you have enough funds for generating revenue, operating expenses, and expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Achieve long-term goals.</strong> Know whether you need to cut expenses or increase revenue to achieve your strategic, operational, and financial goals.</li>
<li><strong>Grow your business</strong>. Investors or lenders will first look at your income and expenses before investing in you.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain financial security</strong>. It helps keep the doors open in case of a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/recession-proof-small-business-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recession</a>, off month, a downturn, slow payments, and delayed checks.</li>
<li><strong>Capitalize on opportunities</strong>. With a budget in place, you won’t miss out on any valuable opportunities for profitability.</li>
</ol>
<p>Knowing how much money is coming in and going out allows you to give every penny a “job&#8221; and use every dollar to your business’s greatest benefit.</p>
<p><a id="how"></a></p>
<h2>How to create a small business budget in 6 steps</h2>
<p>Now that you understand how important a budget is, here’s how you can create one so you can ensure smooth business operation and facilitate efficient cash flow:</p>
<h3>1. Separate your business finances from your personal finances</h3>
<p>This is one of the cardinal rules to succeed in business. It’s tempting for small business owners to mix business and personal finances, but it almost always leads to disaster. Disaster in three forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stagnation:</strong> Without an accurate view of your financial position—that is, how the business is performing with regard to its objective, you’re not likely to progress.</li>
<li><strong>Taxation: </strong>It helps you manage things like business expenses for taxation purposes</li>
<li><strong>Litigation: </strong>Mixing budgets blurs the legal line between you (the business owner) and your business. It protects you from liabilities and your personal assets in case of litigation</li>
</ul>
<p>But how do you do that? Here are a couple of steps you can take when creating your budget.</p>

<ul>
<li>Apply for a business checking account and credit card.</li>
<li>Use separate accounting systems for personal budgets and business finance</li>
</ul>
<p>Separating the two helps you treat your small business like an independent entity. Aside from tax advantages, you set your business up for higher profit margins. Note also that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/14/tips-for-minority-owned-businesses">minority-owned businesses</a> can register as a minority business enterprise to receive additional support.</p>
<h3>2. Set aside a contingency fund for emergencies</h3>
<p>Murphy’s law states, &#8220;Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.” That’s why you should set aside a contingency fund for your business.</p>
<p>If this isn’t the first <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/12/06/small-business-ideas">business you&#8217;ve started</a>, you know you’ll always get surprise expenses when you least expect it. For example, let’s say you operate a printing business. Then right after getting a life-changing contract, your main printer breaks down before you even start. That’s when a contingency fund saves the day.</p>
<p>A contingency fund for emergencies will safeguard your business when these unexpected costs arise. So while it’s tempting to spend that extra income to buy that new MacBook you don’t need, don’t do it. For now, set aside some of that money.<strong> A good rule of thumb is to set aside three to six months of your small business operating expenses. </strong></p>
<p>It will prepare you and your business in case one of your pieces of equipment breaks down, or you need to replace it. Of course, you could always take out a loan, but it wouldn’t hurt to have more options.</p>
<h3>3. Identify your revenue streams</h3>
<p>Grant Cardone likes to say “Cash flow is king.” Where does your money come from? How much and how often does it come in? For small business budgeting to work, you must have the answers to these questions.</p>
<p>That means tallying all your revenue (not profit) sources every month. In case you don’t know the <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/revenue-vs-profit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">difference between revenue and profit</a>, revenue is all the money your business generates before expenses. After subtracting expenses, then you’re left with a profit.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/small-business-budgeting-basics-revenue-vs-profit.png" alt="small business budgeting basics - revenue vs profit" width="720" height="217" class="size-full wp-image-64936 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/small-business-budgeting-basics-revenue-vs-profit.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/small-business-budgeting-basics-revenue-vs-profit-480x145.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Sum up your revenue for the year and divide it by 12 to find your monthly income or revenue. Using this information, you can look at how your revenue changes over time. This will help you find and <a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/7394-seasonal-business-stay-profitable.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manage seasonal patterns</a> and downturns.</p>
<h3>4. Determine your fixed costs</h3>
<p>The next step in creating a small business budget is to include all your fixed costs. Fixed costs are recurring costs that are vital for your business operations. These operating costs either come up every day, week, month, or year. That includes everything from rent, debts, utilities, and payroll costs to taxes and insurance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/small-business-budgeting-basics-fixed-costs.png" alt="small business budgeting basics - fixed costs" width="720" height="450" class="size-full wp-image-64934 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/small-business-budgeting-basics-fixed-costs.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/small-business-budgeting-basics-fixed-costs-480x300.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://investinganswers.com/sites/www/files/_750x422_crop_center-center_none/fixed-costs-examples.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>That said, no two businesses are the same. So take some time to identify any <a href="https://bench.co/blog/accounting/fixed-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other fixed costs </a>necessary to run your business. Once you’ve identified them, sum them up to get a precise figure of your fixed costs on a month-to-month basis. If your business is new, then you can project these values.</p>
<p>But ensure you factor in these monthly expenses as part of your business budget. That way, you can set aside money to cover them. Once you’ve done that, the next step is subtracting them from your revenue.</p>
<h3>5. Determine your variable costs</h3>
<p>As you went through your fixed costs, you probably noticed other inconsistent expenses in your business. These inconsistent costs are known as variable costs or expenses because they change depending on how you use them. They include utilities,  <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/online-advertising-benchmarks">advertising costs</a>, professional development , supplies, your salary, etc.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/how-to-create-small-business-budget-fixed-vs-variable-costs.jpg" alt="how to create a small business budget - fixed vs variable costs" width="720" height="482" class="size-full wp-image-64938 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/how-to-create-small-business-budget-fixed-vs-variable-costs.jpg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/how-to-create-small-business-budget-fixed-vs-variable-costs-480x321.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.thebalancemoney.com/a-guide-to-fixed-and-variable-costs-of-doing-business-393479" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>For example, you might increase production costs to get more raw materials to match the increasing popularity of certain products. Or if you are running a SaaS business, you might need to invest more budget in certain seasons to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/09/b2b-sales-strategies">get more clients</a>.</p>
<h4>Discretionary expenses</h4>
<p>Discretionary expenses are also considered variable expenses because while they are nice to have, they’re not essential for your business. These include things like education, consulting, etc., which might help<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/07/agency-profitability-metrics"> increase profitability</a>.</p>
<p>You want to lower your variable costs in lean months, starting with discretionary expenses. And when your profits are on the uptrend, you can allocate more money to variable expenses to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/12/growth-marketing">help you grow faster</a>.</p>
<p>Tally all your variable expenses at the end of each month. This paints a clear picture of how they fluctuate depending on business performance so you can make accurate predictions.</p>
<h3>6. Create a profit and loss statement</h3>
<p>After gathering all the data above, it’s time to assemble all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle to make sense of it all. That means creating a profit and loss (P&amp;L) or income statement, like the one shown below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/small-business-budget-profit-loss-income-statement.png" alt="how to create a small business budget - profit loss income statement" width="720" height="465" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-64939" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/small-business-budget-profit-loss-income-statement.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/small-business-budget-profit-loss-income-statement-480x310.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.accountingcoach.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/profit-and-loss-statement-example-qa@2x.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>You’ve probably heard of a P&amp;L statement, and it’s probably giving you a headache just thinking about it. But it doesn’t have to be that way. That’s because you’ve already done the heavy lifting by collecting all the data points. All that’s left is to sum up your revenue streams and subtract the total of all your expenses for the month.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you’ll get a positive figure in the end—in which case, congratulations because you’re making a profit. If you get a negative figure, don’t worry about it. Why? You now know where your money is going and can make the necessary adjustments to turn a profit.<br />

<h2>What is a customer journey map?</h2>
<p>A customer journey map is a visual representation of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/04/customer-experience-strategy">customers&#8217; experience</a> with your business as they progress through your funnel—but not the overall experience. Rather, it breaks down the entire journey into key stages and touch points and digs into the specific intentions, emotions, and behaviors at each one.</p>
<p>Because of their granular nature, businesses create customer journey maps for specific personas on specific paths to purchase. So if you have more than one offering and/or more than one buyer persona, you&#8217;ll want to create multiple customer journey maps. More on that later.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/customer-journey-map-example.png" alt="customer journey map example" width="720" height="513" class="size-full wp-image-63975 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/customer-journey-map-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/customer-journey-map-example-480x342.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>

<h2>Why is a customer journey map important?</h2>
<p>A customer journey map allows you to identify the micro-moments that make up the full experience of your brand. Micro moments that, when assessed and improved, mean the difference between good service and impressive service; between great products and unforgettable ones; between happy customers and ecstatic, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/16/get-more-google-reviews">review-writing</a>, referring, loyal customers.</p>
<p>Put another way, customer journey mapping is how you understand and improve the experience at every level to deliver the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/22/how-to-personalize-ecommerce-customer-journey">personalized experience</a> that consumers expect today, which:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guides your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/13/content-marketing-strategy">content marketing strategy</a></li>
<li>Improves your products, services, and marketing content</li>
<li>Enables <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/22/cross-channel-marketing">cross-channel marketing</a> and omnichannel marketing</li>
<li>Improves retention along the funnel</li>
<li>Separates you from competitors<br />
(You can even use a customer journey map <em>to </em>further define that separation, as with the example below.)</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this ultimately results in:</p>

<li>More sales</li>
<li>Less churn</li>
<li>A more holistic <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/12/growth-marketing">growth marketing strategy</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Plus, the exercise itself requires the collection of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/17/customer-insights">customer insights</a> through data, feedback, and more, which <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/21/build-client-relationships">strengthens your client relationships</a>.</p>
<h2>The three elements of a customer journey map</h2>
<p>A customer journey map is a marketing mashup. You&#8217;re basically taking the buyer&#8217;s journey, layering on the offers in your marketing funnel, and then stirring in your buyer personas, all to paint a detailed story of the physical and emotional experience of your brand <strong>as experienced by the customer</strong>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s unpack each of those elements, shall we?</p>
<h3>1. Buyer persona</h3>
<p>In order to capture the intentions, experiences, emotions, and actions of your customers at each point in their journey, you need to understand <strong>who</strong> they are to begin with: their lifestyle, what motivates them, what keeps them up at night, what makes them tick. This is what a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/23/buyer-personas">buyer persona</a> is—a fictional character with a life and a brain and a heart who represents your ideal customer.</p>
<p>This is the context you need in order to pinpoint the highly-specific information in a customer journey map. Which is why you need to create separate customer journey maps for each persona. Business Owner Betty is going to be driven by a completely different set of values, motivations, and desires than Marketing Manager Mara.</p>
<h3>2. Marketing funnel</h3>
<p>The second element of a customer journey map is your marketing funnel. This is a visual representation of how leads turn into customers and customers into loyal customers for your business. It&#8217;s broken down into the different stages of this process and what you offer at each stage.</p>
<p>There are a bajillion different ways of naming the stages of the marketing funnel, but in general, they are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Awareness</li>
<li>Interest/consideration</li>
<li>Evaluation</li>
<li>Desire</li>
<li>Action/conversion</li>
<li>Retention</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. The buyer&#8217;s journey</h3>
<p>The last element of a customer journey map is the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-the-buyers-journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> buyers&#8217; journey</a>. While your marketing funnel is the top-to-bottom, business-focused path, your buyer journey is the left-to-right, customer-focused narrative. Here are the five stages of the buyer journey as it pertains to customer journey mapping:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Awareness:</strong> The customer is aware of their problem and searching for ways to solve it or the symptoms associated with it.</li>
<li><strong>Consideration:</strong> The customer is now aware of the solution to the problem, and your particular solution, but they&#8217;re still researching it to see if it&#8217;s right for them.</li>
<li><strong>Decision</strong>: The customer is ready to buy and has decided that your product solves what they need.</li>
<li><strong>Service:</strong> The customer uses the product or service your business offers and receives support as needed.</li>
<li><strong>Retention:</strong> The customer is satisfied with your product or service and continues using you for this particular need.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Place all three in a blender and what you get is a customer journey map.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How to make your own customer journey map</h2>
<p>So now, provided you know your customer personas and which journey you&#8217;re covering, you can create a customer journey map. You&#8217;ll do this by breaking down your buyer&#8217;s journey into the five stages listed above and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/customer-data">collecting the below data points</a> for each one.</p>
<h3>1. Touchpoints</h3>
<p>Touchpoints are the online and offline mediums through which a customer encounters and interacts with your business, like phone calls, pages on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/14/website-examples">your website</a>, social media posts, surveys, flyers, and the list goes on.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/customer-journey-map-touchpoints.png" alt="customer journey mapping - customer touchpoint examples" width="720" height="513" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63687" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/customer-journey-map-touchpoints.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/customer-journey-map-touchpoints-480x342.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There are a number of ways a customer can interact with your business at any stage, but for the purpose of your map, just include 1-3 of the core ones. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Awareness: </strong>Blog posts, social posts, ads.</li>
<li><strong>Consideration: </strong>Reviews, product pages.</li>
<li><strong>Decision: </strong>Phone conversations, emails, pricing page.</li>
<li><strong>Service: </strong>Help articles, live chat support, customer support reps.</li>
<li><strong>Retention: </strong>Help articles, newsletter, account rep.</li>
</ul>
<p>By listing these out first, you&#8217;ll have the context you need in order to establish subsequent data points like pain points, desires, actions, and expectations.</p>
<h3>2. Pain points</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/28/pain-points">Customer pain points</a> are the specific problems your customers are experiencing—problems for which they&#8217;re seeking a solution. Of course, your final product or service solves for a certain set of pain points, but in the case of customer journey mapping, you&#8217;ll also want to address certain pain points that arise in their interactions with your business.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re a company that has a tracking cat collar with an app. Example pain points for your customer along their journey might be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Awareness: </strong>Tired from chasing the cat around the yard.</li>
<li><strong>Consideration: </strong>No way to explore the app without purchasing the collar.</li>
<li><strong>Decision: </strong>Confusing collar size ranges.</li>
<li><strong>Service: </strong>App drains phone battery.</li>
<li><strong>Retention: </strong>Collar takes a long time to charge.</li>
</ul>
<ul></ul>
<p>An important note: Don&#8217;t get pain points confused with solutions. For example, &#8220;needing a trackable cat collar&#8221; is not a pain point. Being tired of chasing your cat around the yard is; the collar is the solution.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/customer-journey-map-pain-points-vs-solutions.png" alt="customer journey map - pain point example" width="720" height="496" class="size-full wp-image-64556 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/customer-journey-map-pain-points-vs-solutions.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/customer-journey-map-pain-points-vs-solutions-480x331.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And remember: Your customer journey map isn&#8217;t meant to be all rainbows and unicorns. It&#8217;s okay if your pricing packages are hard to understand or if your waiting room is small. The point is to identify areas of improvement and/or communicate them to stakeholders so you can resolve them.</p>
<h3>3. Desires</h3>
<p>Your customers&#8217; desires aren&#8217;t for a solution to each pain point. They are the reason, the greater benefit they attain as a result of solving the pain point. For example, the customer who is afraid to let their cat out isn&#8217;t directly desiring a trackable cat collar; but rather a solution because they have a desire to make their cat happy.</p>
<p>Desires may also refer to what the customer is looking for <em>in</em> the solutions to the pain points along their journey, such as to be able to chat with support online.</p>
<p>Back to our cat collar example, here are some desires:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Awareness: </strong>A happy and safe cat.</li>
<li><strong>Consideration: </strong>A free trial or explainer video.</li>
<li><strong>Decision: </strong>Visual sizing chart.</li>
<li><strong>Service: </strong>Be able to use other apps concurrently.</li>
<li><strong>Retention: </strong>Car charging option.</li>
</ul>
<div class='et-learn-more clearfix'>
					<h3 class='heading-more'>4. Actions<span class='et_learnmore_arrow'><span></span></span></h3>
					<div class='learn-more-content'><ul></ul>
<p>Now, given the customer&#8217;s pain point and desire, what action are they going to take at that touchpoint? What action is the customer looking to complete at each stage in the journey? For this section, think about how hard or easy it is for them to do so. The goal, of course, is to reduce friction here as much as possible and make it easy to move on to the next action.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Awareness:</strong> Read a blog post.</li>
<li><strong>Consideration:</strong> Compare product features.</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Make a purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Service</strong>: Track their cat and get the most out of their purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Retention:</strong> Upgrade the collar or app.</li>
</ul></div>
				</div>
<div class='et-learn-more clearfix'>
					<h3 class='heading-more'>5. Expectations<span class='et_learnmore_arrow'><span></span></span></h3>
					<div class='learn-more-content'><p>Given the touchpoint and action they&#8217;re looking to take, what are your customers&#8217; expectations here? This is different from their desires. The desire is what they want for themselves; the expectation is what they&#8217;re looking for out of their interaction with you. You can identify many expectations based on standard best practices and user experiences, but you&#8217;ll also want to look at your reviews, conduct <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/10/best-online-survey-tools">surveys</a> and ask questions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Awareness: </strong>A helpful blog post with additional resources, but not sales pitches.</li>
<li><strong>Consideration: </strong>Reasonable prices, a pricing chart with features.</li>
<li><strong>Decision: </strong>Ability to pay online with credit card.</li>
<li><strong>Service: </strong>Fast customer support.</li>
<li><strong>Retention: </strong>App updates and notifications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Not every unmet expectation leads to disappointment or a complaint, so make sure you ask the right questions to uncover these expectations as well—since meeting these will create a distinguished customer experience.</p></div>
				</div>
<div class='et-learn-more clearfix'>
					<h3 class='heading-more'>6. Emotions<span class='et_learnmore_arrow'><span></span></span></h3>
					<div class='learn-more-content'><ul></ul>
<p>These are not the emotions you want your customer to feel. It&#8217;s the emotions they actually feel at each stage, based on the pain point, touch point, and whether or not their expectations were met. Again, this is not meant to show perfectly happy customers at every stage. Customer journey mapping is about visualizing the journey so you can identify areas of improvement and harness what works.</p>
<p>If applicable, you may want to point out one positive and one negative emotion at each stage. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Awareness: </strong>Satisfied, even delighted with the fun and friendly tone of the blog posts and website.</li>
<li><strong>Consideration: </strong>Impressed with collar but doubtful about the app.</li>
<li><strong>Decision: </strong>Super-confident after talking to rep, but confused and concerned about choosing a size.</li>
<li><strong>Service: </strong>Grateful for the extensive knowledge base, but frustrated at not being able to chat with someone online.</li>
<li><strong>Retention:</strong></li>
</ul></div>
				</div>
<div class='et-learn-more clearfix'>
					<h3 class='heading-more'>7. Business goal/KPI<span class='et_learnmore_arrow'><span></span></span></h3>
					<div class='learn-more-content'><p>Now it&#8217;s time to identify what your business is trying to achieve at each stage in the buyer&#8217;s journey. This is sort of like the third (desires) and fourth (actions) steps, but for you. Ideally, you&#8217;ll be able to pinpoint specific, measurable goals for each stage. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Awareness:</strong> Create awareness; website sessions.</li>
<li><strong>Consideration:</strong> Increase traffic; pageviews, leads.</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Drive purchases; number of orders, average order value.</li>
<li><strong>Service</strong>: Improve reputation; customer reviews and referrals</li>
<li><strong>Retention:</strong> Reduce churn; customer lifetime value.</li>
</ul></div>
				</div>
<div class='et-learn-more clearfix'>
					<h3 class='heading-more'>8. Teams involved<span class='et_learnmore_arrow'><span></span></span></h3>
					<div class='learn-more-content'><p>Last but not least, you&#8217;ll want to indicate who is involved at each stage of the journey. This will help your business to organize actionable steps for making the improvements identified in the exercise with clear owners. This, of course, will all depend on how your business is structured. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Awareness:</strong> Content and SEO teams</li>
<li><strong>Consideration:</strong> Product, sales, and acquisition teams</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Sales team</li>
<li><strong>Service</strong>: Sales and customer success teams</li>
<li><strong>Retention:</strong> Content and customer success teams</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is 30 seconds a long time?</p>
<p>Depends on the situation. If you&#8217;re being asked to sprint as hard as you can for 30 seconds, or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GuinnessWorldRecords/videos/most-skips-on-rollerskates-in-30-seconds-guinness-world-records/2737907572937838/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skip rope</a> on rollerskates for 30 seconds&#8230;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/30-seconds-meme.png" alt="man skipping rope on roller skates" width="385" height="439" class="aligncenter wp-image-63739" /></p>
<p>&#8230;this can feel like an eternity.</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re given 30 seconds to pitch your business—something you have poured your heart and soul into and that offers so many great benefits to customers—well this is not nearly enough time. But that&#8217;s all you have—whether you&#8217;re talking with a prospect, writing website copy, your business description, or an email.</p>
<p>And this is where your elevator pitch comes in. In this post, I&#8217;m going to show you how to quickly and effectively convey the value of your business in a persuasive and memorable way so you can write an awesome elevator pitch for your business—complete with 13 templates and real examples.</p>

<h2>What is an elevator pitch?</h2>
<p>An elevator pitch is a short promotional speech or written blurb presented to a particular target audience to communicate the value of a product or service and get them to take action. Elevator pitches can be used by all types of people in all disciplines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students pitch to colleges, internship programs, and scholarship funds.</li>
<li>Job candidates pitch to employers.</li>
<li>Businesses pitch to clients, investors, and job candidates.</li>
<li>Professionals pitch to stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
<p><a id="elevator-pitch-length"></a></p>
<h2>What makes a good elevator pitch?</h2>
<p>This all depends on what you’re pitching, who you’re pitching to, and what level of familiarity your audience has with what you’re offering. But broadly speaking, all good elevator pitches captivate, communicate, and convince because they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Short:</strong> 30-60 seconds and to the point.</li>
<li><strong>Interesting:</strong> Whether it&#8217;s through storytelling, humor, data, fear, or something else, your elevator pitch needs to be able to capture attention, keep attention, and be memorable.</li>
<li><strong>Personalized:</strong> Just like<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/03/ad-copy-examples"> good ad copy</a>, a good elevator pitch is catered to the audience. The approach, word choice, and features/benefits offered are all carefully chosen based on what is most important to the people receiving the pitch.</li>
<li><strong>Confident:</strong> A good elevator pitch requires a combination of confidence (without being condescending or cocky) and assertiveness (but without being aggressive).</li>

<h2>How long should an elevator pitch be?</h2>
<p>The ideal elevator pitch is 30-45 seconds, or the amount of time people spend in an elevator. And as I just mentioned above,  it comes in written form everywhere. 30-45 seconds of speaking is about 75-100 words, making it perfect for your:</p>

<h2>How to write an elevator pitch</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, elevator pitches come in different shapes and sizes depending on the circumstances, and you&#8217;ll see a number of different styles in the templates and examples later in the post. But for the core of it, here is a basic framework:</p>
<ol>
<li>Establish the problem</li>
<li>Introduce the solution</li>
<li>Share the benefit/value</li>
<li>Include what makes you different</li>
<li>End with a CTA</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4da.png" alt="📚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide download</strong> &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download">The 36 Best Call to Action Phrases Ever (&amp; Why They Work)</a></p>
<h3>1. Establish the problem, ideally with a hook</h3>
<p>The problem/<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/28/pain-points">pain point</a> is what will resonate most with your audience, so it&#8217;s the best way to start off your elevator pitch. You can simply state the problem, or you can make things more interesting with a hook. Try these on:</p>
<ul>
<li>When was the last time you…</li>
<li>Picture this:</li>
<li>Have you ever noticed…</li>
<li>You know how&#8230;</li>
<li>Is it me or&#8230;</li>
<li>You know that feeling when&#8230;</li>
<li>Ever wished you could&#8230;</li>
<li>Let’s be real here:</li>
<li>Did you know that….</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Pro tip <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></p>
<p>Avoid the obvious questions like “Are you looking to get more customers?” or framing questions like “Are you looking for an all-in-one platform that will help you manage subscription invoicing? Be creative here. Be real. Your goal is to capture attention here, not sneak in features or benefits.</p>
<h3>2. Introduce the solution</h3>
<p>Once the problem has been established, you can then introduce yourself or your business as the solution, the hero. Be specific about how you solve the problem. Mention <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/21/features-vs-benefits">features here rather than benefits</a>. And if it&#8217;s not obvious through your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/23/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name">business name</a>, make it clear what type of solution you are—a platform? An agency? An app? This is important so listeners/readers can orient themselves and form a mental picture as you speak.</p>
<h3>3. State the benefit</h3>
<p>So your audience now knows that you can solve their problem and take away their pain point, but you need to also talk about how this benefits them. Why is the elimination of this pain point important? What do they stand to gain by solving this problem? This is essentially your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">value proposition</a>.</p>
<h3>4. Differentiate yourself</h3>
<p>So the audience now knows what you do, how you do it, and what&#8217;s in it for them, but why should they choose you over competitors? How can they be sure that they&#8217;ll get this benefit? This is where you include things like your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/07/unique-selling-proposition">unique selling proposition</a>, social proof, trust signals, or anecdotes.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">[Solution] is the only [category] that [unique feature].</li>
<li class="p1">For over [x years], we’ve helped over [X target personas] [achieve benefit].</li>
<li>Backed by/recommended by [known/influential/trusted institution or person].</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite120WordsforMarketingWithEmotion.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_120WordsPhrases_Download">130+ of the Best Words and Phrases for Marketing with Emotion</a></p>
<h3>5. Close with a CTA or question</h3>
<p>Finish off with some sort of action item. This is typically a classic <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/13/call-to-action-examples">call to action</a>—like buy, register, call, download, sign up—with a reinforcement of the benefit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Try [solution] today to [achieve benefit].</li>
<li>Sign up now so you can experience {feature or benefit} for yourself.</li>
<li>Give me a call so we can plan your [ideal outcome].</li>
</ul>
<p>In other cases, you might end with something a little more thought-provoking, like</p>
<ul>
<li>So let me ask you, how are you going to [solve] your next [problem].</li>
<li>So the choice is yours. You can either [old way] or [new way].</li>
</ul>
<ul></ul>

<h2>Elevator pitch templates</h2>
<p>Putting the above steps together, here is a basic, bare-bones elevator pitch template:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>State the need. Fill the need. State the value prop. Differentiate yourself. Call them to action.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>And here are three fleshed-out elevator templates using the above framework:</p>
<h3>1. Basic elevator pitch template #1</h3>
<p><em>When I first started [your trade], I found a common issue: People needed [solution].</em></p>
<p><em>For [time period], I’ve been [specializing/provding] just that. [State how]. I also [additional differentiator/advantage].</em></p>
<p><em>With this [three adjectives to sum up the above], my customers not only [benefit #1], but they also [benefit #2].</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/elevator-pitch-examples-basic-template-02.png" alt="elevator pitch examples - basic elevator pitch template" width="720" height="494" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63714" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/elevator-pitch-examples-basic-template-02.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/elevator-pitch-examples-basic-template-02-480x329.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Automotive example using this template</h4>
<p>When I began automotive repair, I found a common issue: People needed a choice for transmission repair on late model vehicles other than the dealer.</p>
<p>For three years now, I’ve been specializing in just that: catering to the unique transmission needs of vehicles 10 years or older. I’m also the only shop that provides online guidance first, to help my clients establish a firm price on the transmission replacement first, before their vehicle even comes into my shop.</p>
<p>With this confidence, convenience, and unique specialization, customers not only get more mileage out of their vehicles but also don’t have to cringe when viewing the invoice.</p>
<h3>2. Basic elevator pitch template #2</h3>
<p><em>Between [pain point] and [pain point], [goal] is a challenge no one should have to face alone.</em></p>
<p><em>I help [target personas] [achieve goal] through a combination of [product/service], [product/service], and [product service]. Not only [differentiator #1], but [differentiator #2], so you can [benefit].</em></p>
<p><em>Over [X customers] have [achieved goal] with my [help], and you can too.</em></p>
<p><em>[CTA].</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/elevator-pitch-examples-basic-template-01.png" alt="elevator pitch examples - basic elevator pitch template" width="720" height="594" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63713" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/elevator-pitch-examples-basic-template-01.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/elevator-pitch-examples-basic-template-01-480x396.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Real estate example using this template</h4>
<p><strong> </strong>Between bidding wars and market fluctuations, navigating the home buying process is a headache.</p>
<p>I help first-time homebuyers achieve their dream of homeownership through a combination of education, financial counseling, and proprietary tools that grant access to off-market listings. Not only do I meet with each client personally to make sure we cover all of your questions and goals, but I also share regular updates with new listings, price changes, and recent sales so you can gain an understanding of market trends.</p>
<p>Over 90 first-time home buyers have gained the confidence to make this all-important decision with my help, and you can, too. Schedule a consult call today to find out how.</p>
<h3>3. Basic elevator pitch template #3</h3>
<p><em>For many [target customers], it’s not the [common/obvious pain point], but rather the [pain point your competitors don’t solve] that is most [painful].</em></p>
<p><em>But not at [your business]. In addition to {feature #1} {feature #2} and you can even {feature #3}.</em></p>
<p><em>Intrigued? Our [x] five-star reviews will tell you more, but you really have to experience it for yourself to see just how [adjective] and [adjective] [achieving goal] can be.</em></p>
<p><em>[Call to action].</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/elevator-pitch-examples-basic-template-03.png" alt="elevator pitch examples - basic elevator pitch template" width="720" height="610" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63715" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/elevator-pitch-examples-basic-template-03.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/elevator-pitch-examples-basic-template-03-480x407.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Dentist example using this template</h4>
<p>For many people with chronic dental issues, it’s not the issues themselves, but rather the trip to the dentist, that is the most painful.</p>
<p>But not at X. In addition to being a judgement-free and friendly space, you’ll never wait longer than 15 minutes, and you can even pick the music.</p>
<p>Our 78 five-star Google reviews will tell you more, but you really have to experience X for yourself to see just how convenient, or dare we say enjoyable, a trip to the dentist can be.</p>

<h2>Business elevator pitch examples &amp; templates</h2>
<p>The examples above are good, but if you want to kick things up a notch, you can take a more unique approach. Here are some more business elevator pitch examples and templates to try out.</p>
<h3>4. The wooing elevator pitch template</h3>
<p>With this approach, speak to what your audience is most proud of.</p>
<p>[Describe audience’s scenario in a flattering way]. Built for [target customer] who [want to achieve X/need to solve X], [your offering] is a [category] that [benefit]. Unlike [competition], [product] [unique differentiator.] [CTA] so you can [experienece benefit or feature].</p>
<h3>SaaS example</h3>
<p>Your [SaaS] platform is awesome.</p>
<p>Too awesome, in fact, for new users to see its capabilities right away.</p>
<p>Built for awesome SaaS platforms, Cinch is a user onboarding platform that helps your users discover just how awesome it is.</p>
<p>And unlike other solutions, Cinch also uses engagement analytics to predict churn and send customized prompts to prevent it.</p>
<p>Don’t let the learning curve into a churning curve. Try it out now.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/elevator-pitch-examples-wooing-template.png" alt="elevator pitch examples - wooing elevator pitch template" width="720" height="534" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63709" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/elevator-pitch-examples-wooing-template.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/elevator-pitch-examples-wooing-template-480x356.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>5. The data-focused elevator pitch template</h3>
<p>Use data to illustrate the problem and prove your value. You may need to put some data into context, as with the example below.</p>
<p>[Topic] is a big problem. In fact, [statistic]. [Business/product/service] has helped over [X customers] [solve this problem] and [achieve benefit]. By [special feature], [another stat proving your value]. [CTA] or [thought-provoking question].</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/elevator-pitch-examples-data-driven-template.png" alt="elevator pitch examples - data-driven elevator pitch template" width="720" height="566" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63712" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/elevator-pitch-examples-data-driven-template.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/elevator-pitch-examples-data-driven-template-480x377.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Home services example</h3>
<p>The average home wastes half of the energy that flows through it. For context, the amount of energy wasted in just one day by California and Texas alone equates to how much was wasted in the 2010 BP Oil Spill.</p>
<p>NRGSaver has helped over 3,000 people save money on their utility bills, reduce their carbon footprint, and make the world a healthier place. By incorporating your unique lifestyle and budget into our assessments and then providing 24/7 monitoring, our clients save, on average, $3,000 more per year than those who use other services.</p>
<p>So my only question for you is, what are you going to do with that $3,000? That’s a nice vacation&#8230;</p>
<h3>6. The fear-based elevator pitch template</h3>
<p>This elevator pitch style is similar to the pain-agitate-solution <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/16/copywriting-formulas">copywriting formula</a>. Fear is a big motivator, but you can cater this elevator pitch style to any emotion. These <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">273 emotional words and phrases</a> can help you out here.</p>
<p>[Introduce problem through an alarming fact.]  [Illustrate consequences of the fact]. [State how you&#8217;ve helped prevent the consequences]. [Provide differentiator]. [CTA].</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/elevator-pitch-examples-fear-template.png" alt="elevator pitch examples - fear elevator pitch template" width="720" height="512" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63711" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/elevator-pitch-examples-fear-template.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/elevator-pitch-examples-fear-template-480x341.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Chiropractor example</h3>
<p>Spinal misalignment isn’t just about back or neck pain. In fact, it starts out painless, but when left untreated, can lead to dysfunction in every system of the body—immune, digestive, nervous, endocrine, and more.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve restored countless patients to health after years of suffering chronic conditions—and their only regret is not finding me sooner.</p>
<p>That’s why I offer all clients a free first-time full evaluation. So save yourself time, money, and pain and get an assessment that will catch things that no annual physical will.</p>
<h3>7. The storytelling elevator pitch template</h3>
<p>There really isn&#8217;t a template to offer for this type of elevator pitch. It&#8217;s all about painting a picture and choosing which emotional lens or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/20/copywriting-techniques">copywriting technique </a>you want to apply—humor, sadness, inspiration, sarcasm? The world is your oyster here, but consider this one humorous example.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/elevator-pitch-examples-storytelling-template.png" alt="elevator pitch examples - storytelling elevator pitch template" width="720" height="576" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63710" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/elevator-pitch-examples-storytelling-template.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/elevator-pitch-examples-storytelling-template-480x384.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You can get away with being a little bit longer with this type of elevator pitch, as long as the story is entertaining enough to hold your audience&#8217;s attention.</p>
<h3>Furniture example</h3>
<p>The Montgomery family is sitting quietly out on their beautiful patio furniture. Looks peaceful, right?</p>
<p>What you don’t realize is that they spent the day lugging it out of the shed, spraying it down, bending over backwards trying to figure out the setup. Tears were cried. Sweat was poured. Blood was shed. There were expletives.</p>
<p>The Montgomery family actually is sitting quietly because they (a) can’t move and (b) are no longer on speaking terms.</p>
<p>EZFurniture is on a mission to make spending time outside easy and hassle-free. EZ Furniture is on a mission to make spending time outside easy and hassle-free. Our fold-up, lightweight, and mold-resistant furniture is so simple, you’ll think there are pieces missing.</p>

<p>In addition to excellent visual imagery, <a href="https://heyzolt.com/about/">Zolt&#8217;s about us page</a> has excellent elevator pitch inspo:</p>
<blockquote><p>Plants survive and thrive by releasing endogenous biochemicals that help them flourish under various circumstances, and many of those plant botanicals can help humans perform at their best, too. That’s why Zolt superdrinks are powered by plants (a whole entourage of ‘em) and optimized for performance. Each formulation of adaptogens, antioxidants and terpene botanicals is tailored to key areas of human function like sleep, immunity, energy, balance, and overall cognitive performance.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Final tips to achieve your best elevator pitch</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s close off with some final tips for making your elevator pitch the best it can be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customize it: </strong>Cater it to your audience.</li>
<li><strong>Practice it:</strong> If this is, indeed, a speech, practice it until it’s blue in the face. Write it, rewrite it, say it, recite it, record yourself and listen to it. Recite it in front of someone. Completely internalize it so that you’re speaking as naturally and organically as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Make it easy to understand:</strong> Don’t try to impress your audience with fancy jargon or complex statements. The simpler it is, the easier it will be for them to remember. And speak conversationally.</li>
<li><strong>Be ready for objections/questions: </strong>You’ll get a feel, over time, for common objections and questions. And you may even have a secondary spiel to address those. But be careful not to address them (or too many of them) in your pitch. If you take too much of a defensive approach, you could be discounting your confidence.</li>
</ul>
