										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On average, YouTubers upload <a href="https://blog.youtube/press/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20 million</a> videos each day, while Instagram users place <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-happens-in-an-internet-minute/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">66,000 visuals</a> on that platform every minute.</p>
<p>A vast majority of that content slips by with little fanfare. But every once in a while, something breaks through the barrage of vacation photos and dance clips to go absolutely viral. You know some of them well: the mannequin challenge, sea shanties, “This Barbie is…”</p>
<p>Cultural moments like these hit the algorithm just right, ricochet across the globe, and leave people rushing to get in on the trend.</p>
<p>Brands can tap into these events—a tactic called trendjacking— to capture the attention of new people and expand their circle of influence at an incredible scale. But not all viral trends are created equal. Some can damage your brand just as quickly.</p>
<p>Let’s dig into the phenomenon of trendjacking, how to leverage it for business growth, and when it’s best to proceed with caution.</p>

<h2>What is trendjacking?</h2>
<p>Trendjacking is the act of capitalizing on a viral cultural moment. And the practice can take several forms. If your brand…</p>
<ul>
<li>Reshares a trending meme (Think: “One does not simply…”)</li>
<li>Taps your team to recreate a viral dance or performance challenge (Think: Gangnam Style)</li>
<li>Participates in a challenge for charity (Think: the Ice Bucket Challenge)</li>
<li>Creates its own version of a trending GPT image (Think: the Studio Ghibli image trend)</li>
<li>Shares <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/fall-content-ideas">content</a> related to a trending phrase (Think: “Very demure, very mindful”)</li>
</ul>
<p>…or otherwise creates content that is based on an “of the moment” internet craze, congratulations, you’re trendjacking.</p>

<p>You may also try your hand at trendjacking’s close cousin, newsjacking.</p>
<p>While trendjacking trades in cultural cachet, newsjacking is the art of engaging with a viral news moment. Of course, there’s a bit of a gray area between the two tactics. For example, commenting on the Sydney Sweeney “good jeans/genes” ad campaign is a bit of both. But the crucial component in either practice is the timeliness of the content and commentary.</p>

<div id="why-try-trendjacking"></div>
<h2>Is trendjacking right for your business?</h2>
<p>On the internet, attention is currency. So, finding creative ways to draw attention to your brand can pay dividends. That’s why many brands want to work trendjacking into their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-media-strategy">social media strategy</a>.</p>
<p>Done right, trendjacking can help you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get greater reach without creating your own virality: </strong>You ride the wave of a broader cultural moment.</li>
<li><strong>Prove your cultural <em>bona fides</em>: </strong>Businesses in trend-based industries (fashion, beauty, wellness, etc.) get bonus points for cultural fluency. Engaging with a viral fad signals you know what’s up.</li>
<li><strong>Show off your personality: </strong>Tap into a trend that has a cheeky link to your brand, and you prove your wit. Few things <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/23/how-brand-your-business">make a brand more attractive</a> than a good sense of humor.</li>
<li><strong>Drive traffic:</strong> If your contribution to the trend takes off, you boost traffic to your social pages and website. Hello, new group of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/hot-leads-vs-cold-leads">leads to nurture</a>!</li>
<li><strong>Build </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness"><strong>brand awareness</strong></a>: Even if those new followers aren’t ready to buy, it’s never bad to have more eyeballs on your brand. They might buy from you in six months, or their friends might want to buy today.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8 trendjacking dos and don’ts (with examples)</h2>
<p>Just because trendjacking can produce wins for your brand doesn’t mean it’s always the right choice.</p>
<p>Some trends are too risqué for a brand to take a chance on. Others simply aren’t the right fit for <em>your</em> brand. And some businesses aren’t positioned to move quickly enough to make the most of a viral moment.</p>
<p>If you’ve sat on the sidelines before or you’ve gotten involved without much success, these dos and don’ts can help you assess future trendjacking opportunities and leverage them more effectively.</p>
<h3>Trendjacking dos</h3>
<p>Want to get better at identifying worthy trendjacking moments and capitalizing on the ones with real promise? Start here.</p>
<h4>1. Do target trends relevant to your industry</h4>
<p>When you see a trend and think you might want to participate, start by asking yourself, “Does this make sense with my brand’s focus?” If the answer is yes, you can proceed to further evaluation. If the answer is no, save yourself some time and stop right here.</p>
<p>Not sure what this looks like in practice? Let’s explore the question for some hypothetical brands using the <a href="https://time.com/5929245/sea-shanty-tiktok-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sea shanty trend</a> as an example.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-shanty.webp" alt="Trendjacking - sea shanty video still." width="365" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94883 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-shanty.webp 365w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-shanty-183x300.webp 183w" sizes="(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgsurPg9Ckw" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>In early 2021, COVID was still restricting our lives significantly. Perhaps because being trapped at home for 11 months straight felt a little like taking a long journey across the ocean, a 19th-century sea shanty went completely <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/14/tiktok-trend-discovery">viral on TikTok</a>. What started as duets on the original video soon blossomed into sea shanty versions of contemporary songs. (Smash Mouth’s All Star <a href="https://x.com/JennaGuillaume/status/1349241560936812544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1349241560936812544%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F5929245%2Fsea-shanty-tiktok-2021%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as a sea shanty</a>? Yes, that really happened.)</p>
<p>Imagine you’re leading marketing for your business at this time. You see the sea shanty trend taking off and think to yourself, “Should we get in on this?”</p>
<p><em>Scenario 1: </em>You run a local CPA firm. Your brand has nothing to do with the ocean. You do not need to get involved in the sea shanty trend.</p>
<p><em>Scenario 2: </em>You operate a restaurant with seafood on the menu. Sure, you can consider this trend. (This example was inspired by Arby’s, which found success creating <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@arbys/video/6920243667865226501?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a sea shanty TikTok</a> about its fish sandwich.)</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-wendys-2.webp" alt="Trendjacking - Arby's video still." width="508" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94884 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-wendys-2.webp 508w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-wendys-2-480x567.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 508px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@arbys/video/6920243667865226501?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h4>2. Do ask if this trend matters to your target audience</h4>
<p>Once you’ve assessed a trend’s relevance for your industry, go a little deeper. Will your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a> care if you post something about it?</p>
<p>Think about your audience’s demographics, psychographics, and general demeanor. Will they get the reference? And if they understand it, will they care that you’re engaging with it?</p>
<p>To continue with the sea shanty example, Arby’s passed this test, too. Its target audience, according to <a href="https://www.qsrweb.com/articles/arbys-redefines-target-audience-after-year-long-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview</a> with its VP of brand and corporate communications, is younger consumers (aged 18-34) who “love to have fun.”</p>
<p>An irreverent, purposefully cringe TikTok video? That’s a perfect fit for this audience.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f44b.png" alt="👋" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free resource!</strong> <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteTargetAudience.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_TargetAudineceGuide_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links">How to Find Your Target Audience in 6 Steps</a></p>
<h4>3. Do use related hashtags</h4>
<p>Trendjacking is all about capitalizing on a viral moment to expand your reach. Adding relevant <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags">hashtags</a> to your content can boost your distribution and position your brand alongside fellow trendjackers.</p>
<p>On its fish sandwich video, Arby’s added some strategic hashtags employed on other trending sea shanty videos.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-wendys-1.webp" alt="Trendjacking -Arby's video with hashtags." width="587" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94885 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-wendys-1.webp 587w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-wendys-1-480x491.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 587px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@arbys/video/6920243667865226501?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h4>4. Do be creative</h4>
<p>A viral trend goes stale quickly because it is, by definition, repetitive. There are only so many sea shanty videos a TikToker can watch before their eyes glaze over.</p>
<p>That’s why creativity is essential for brands trying trendjacking. What unique spin can you put on the trend, and how can it help your content stand out from the others?</p>
<p>This is also an opportunity to show off your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/brand-personality-messaging">brand’s personality</a>. Don’t be afraid to take a creative risk within the framework of the trend.</p>
<h3>Trendjacking don’ts</h3>
<p>If you’ve tried trendjacking in the past with little success, these don’ts might be holding you back. Avoid these common mistakes to get further with your viral-inspired content.</p>
<h4>5. Don’t chase bad trends</h4>
<p>Some trends aren’t a good fit for your brand. But other trends aren’t a good fit for <em>any</em> brand. Avoid these types of trends at all costs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mean or offensive trends: </strong>Consumers don’t like brands that punch down or are unnecessarily crass. If getting in on the trend means being petty or gross, don’t do it. <em>*The exception here is brands with an edgy voice. Adult Swim, you can participate!</em></li>
<li><strong>Confusing trends: </strong>If your marketing team doesn’t understand the trend, don’t do it. That means the trend is either: 1) Inscrutable to everyone (in which case, why bother?), or 2) Potentially hazardous. You may be missing a nefarious meaning that resonates on some dark side of the web.</li>
<li><strong>Hollow trends: </strong>This one can be hard to gauge—who’d have thought we’d all still know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannequin_Challenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the mannequin challenge</a> nearly a decade later? But if a trend feels particularly vapid or fleeting, take a pass.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-digiorno.webp" alt="Trendjacking -DiGiornos Tweet." width="937" height="335" class="aligncenter wp-image-94886 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-digiorno.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-digiorno-480x172.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.prnewsonline.com/whyistayed-twitter-campaign-backfires-on-digiornos-pizza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>DiGiorno</em></a><em> had to eat its words after jumping on the wrong viral trend.</em></p>
<h4>6. Don’t trendjack too often</h4>
<p>Chasing every last trend is exhausting for your team. You have limited bandwidth, so think carefully before leaping at a trendjacking opportunity.</p>
<p>Not only that, if your brand participates too regularly in viral moments, you become a one-trick pony. Give your team the breathing room to create meaningful content and your audience the space to be surprised and delighted when you <em>do</em> engage in a trend.</p>
<h4>7. Don’t take forever to post</h4>
<p>Viral trends move fast. A new meme, GIF, or challenge may only last a week or so before it reaches peak saturation and completely sputters out. If you think of trendjacking as existing on a bell curve, you want to get your content out before the peak.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-graph.webp" alt="Trendjacking - Bell curve of popularity." width="937" height="530" class="aligncenter wp-image-94887 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-graph.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-graph-480x272.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If your internal approval process means it will take weeks to get your trendjacking content published, sit this one out.</p>
<p>And if you work in a highly regulated industry where compliance and legal often need to opine on your marketing output, create a fast-track approval process for trend-related posts in advance. Then, when the right trend comes along, you’ve already created a pathway for your team to get content out quickly.</p>
<h4>8. Don’t assume success</h4>
<p>As you try trendjacking, always keep track of your content’s results. Which trendjacking posts move the needle for your brand in meaningful ways (reshares, new follows, great consumer feedback, media mentions), and which fall flat?</p>
<p>As you continue to play with trendjacking, you’ll see patterns emerge. Identifying the elements of a trending moment that resonate with your audience can help you further refine your trendjacking strategy and drive greater social media success.</p>
<h2>Try trendjacking for a big boost in brand awareness</h2>
<p>When done successfully, trendjacking is a proven tactic for gaining a ton of attention, especially on social media.</p>
<p>As you think through your first trend hijacking adventure, remember these dos and don’ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do target trends relevant to your industry</li>
<li>Do ask if this trend matters to your target audience</li>
<li>Do use relatable hashtags</li>
<li>Do be creative</li>
<li>Don’t chase bad trends</li>
<li>Don’t trendjack too often</li>
<li>Don’t take forever to post</li>
<li>Don’t assume success</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s where user-generated content can help.</p>
<p>But what is user-generated content? How can you collect it? And how can you repackage UGC to get more mileage out of it? Keep reading to find out.</p>

<h2>What is user-generated content (UGC)?</h2>
<p>User-generated content (UGC) is any form of original content created by customers and published on social media or other channels.</p>
<p>In a world of sharp and polished visuals, UGC can help you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-differentiate-content">stand out</a> from the crowd. Moreover, using UGC as part of your content strategy gives you a strong <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/better-content-performance">competitive advantage</a>, as that content is unique to your business, and no one else can replicate it.</p>
<p>The best part: Today’s customers crave authenticity and original content.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/why-user-generated-content-matters-how-brands-boost-effectiveness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eMarketer</a>, over a quarter (28%) of ecommerce marketers in North America believe that <strong>images/videos from real customers can have the biggest impact on purchasing decisions</strong>. Moreover, nearly as many (26%) think UGC generates the most customer trust.</p>
<p><a href="https://content-naf.emarketer.com/why-user-generated-content-matters-how-brands-boost-effectiveness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Around 40%</a> of UK and US adults believe UGC is important when deciding to make a purchase, and <a href="https://www.entribe.com/news/entribe-ugc-survey-insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">77%</a> of shoppers are more likely to buy a product they found through UGC.</p>

<h2>Types of user-generated content</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/28/user-generated-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">User-generated content</a> is much more than customers’ photos shared on Instagram. It includes everything from images and videos to social media posts, reviews, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/testimonial-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testimonials</a>, and even comments. Let’s look at some of the most popular types of UGC:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Photos</strong>. User-generated content cuts through the noise of flawless filters, staged photos, and AI-generated images, giving customers something real and relatable.</li>
<li><strong>Videos</strong>. Videos are still one of the most popular type of content, and the same is true for UGC. Whether <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/13/ugc-instagram" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a> and TikTok short videos or unboxing videos, this type of UGC content is very powerful. According to an <a href="https://content-naf.emarketer.com/how-gen-z-engaged-with-beauty-content-q3--sephora-wins-while-legacy-brands-struggle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eMarketer</a> survey, watching videos is the #1 way Gen Z typically discovers new brands and products across all categories.</li>
<li><strong>Social media posts</strong>. Keeping up the pace with social media content creation is hard. Here’s where UGC can help. Use the content your audience creates to spice up your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-media-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media strategy</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Reviews and testimonials</strong>. A real customer’s story hits differently. These days, everyone checks reviews and testimonials before buying anything—good or bad, they’re the first thing people look at to get reassured they’re making the right decision.</li>

<h2>How to collect user-generated content</h2>
<p>So, you’re sold on the power of UGC—great. But how do you get your customers to actually create it? Let’s break down the real strategies to start collecting UGC without the heavy lifting.</p>
<h3>Create a hashtag and ask customers to share photos</h3>
<p>Do you ever wonder if hashtags still work? Well, just look at the #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt—with over 12 million posts, this hashtag has single-handedly sparked millions of impulse buys for products that went viral on TikTok.</p>
<p>To start collecting UGC, create a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags">hashtag</a> and encourage customers to use it. For an extra boost, you can also organize a social media challenge and reward the participants with the most likes. NYX Professional Makeup has done this with its #ButterGlossPop, which generated over 1.7 million posts on TikTok.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/user-generated-content-hashtag-png.webp" alt="how to get user generated content - example ugc hashtag" width="905" height="499" class="aligncenter wp-image-90362 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/user-generated-content-hashtag-png.webp 905w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/user-generated-content-hashtag-480x265.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 905px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Partner with local creators and influencers</h3>
<p>Influencer marketing is not only reserved for big businesses. If you want to make an impact, focus on partnering with local creators and micro-influencers who can reach your target audience. Whether you’re serving a specific area or selling niche products, partnering with local creators can be the right choice for you.</p>
<p>The Lavendaire Shop is a journaling and self-growth brand that has an open call for everyone who wants to be a brand ambassador, offering them different benefits such as a 15% commission on each order, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-run-a-facebook-giveaway-or-contest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product giveaways</a>, early access to launches, and a discount code for their followers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ugc-partnership-opportunities-png.webp" alt="ugc examples - partnership opportunity example" width="900" height="382" class="aligncenter wp-image-90378 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ugc-partnership-opportunities-png.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ugc-partnership-opportunities-480x204.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Create a loyalty program</h3>
<p>Sometimes, you just need to give customers an extra nudge to encourage them to share photos or leave a review that you can later use as user-generated content. Here’s where loyalty programs can help. Building a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-run-customer-loyalty-programs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loyalty program</a> can gamify the experience and encourage customers to take specific actions to earn points.</p>
<p>This is exactly what the men’s apparel brand Chubbies does with its loyalty programs. In addition to making a purchase and creating an account, customers can also earn extra points for leaving a review. It’s a win-win situation—customers earn points, and you gather UGC content.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/user-generated-content-point-system-png.webp" alt="ugc - point system example" width="900" height="344" class="aligncenter wp-image-90356 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/user-generated-content-point-system-png.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/user-generated-content-point-system-480x183.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Organize a buzz-worthy live event</h3>
<p>Getting people to talk about your brand isn’t as hard as it sounds. You just need to create a moment that makes them go, “Whoa!”—and then whip out their phones to share it. Live events or pop-up activations are the perfect way to spark that buzz and get people posting about you. Plus, this is a great way to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/increase-foot-traffic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase foot traffic</a>.</p>
<p>BÉIS is a chic luggage brand that created an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/interactive-content">interactive</a> luggage ‘car wash’ experience that got people waiting in lines and sharing videos, which helped them rack up thousands of views on TikTok.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ugc-event-png.webp" alt="ugc event marketing" width="748" height="487" class="aligncenter wp-image-90380 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ugc-event-png.webp 748w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ugc-event-480x313.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 748px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Turn comments into social media posts</h3>
<p>Comments are underrated user-generated content, and businesses often forget to use them to create content. Platforms like <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/tiktok-video-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok</a> now allow you to engage with a comment by responding with a post. It’s a great way to show customers you appreciate them and an easy way to create content that your competitors can’t copy.</p>
<p>So next time you’re wondering how to collect UGC, check your social media and see what’s already there. Mala is a candle brand that uses this tactic to engage with customers and create an authentic social media presence.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/user-generated-content-social-media-png.webp" alt="user generated content - social media example" width="952" height="431" class="aligncenter wp-image-90357 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/user-generated-content-social-media-png.webp 952w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/user-generated-content-social-media-480x217.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 952px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Use QR codes to generate UGC</h3>
<p>If you want to create a shortcut for customers to share reviews, you can use QR codes. So, instead of asking them to go to your website, you can create a QR code that makes <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-get-home-services-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaving a review quick and easy</a>. This can be especially helpful for professional service businesses. Kind Pest Solution uses its business cards, asking customers to leave a Google review, and in turn, they tip the technicians $10.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ugc-review-employee-benefits.webp" alt="user generated content - marketing a qr code" width="755" height="579" class="aligncenter wp-image-90381 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ugc-review-employee-benefits.webp 755w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ugc-review-employee-benefits-480x368.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 755px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>1. Reshare on social media</h3>
<p>UGC is not only about sharing customer photos or videos. Reviews and testimonials can be the perfect type of UGC to share across your social media channels. This is especially true for home and professional service businesses, where customer reviews are crucial to getting more clients.</p>
<p>Mr. Electric is a local electrical and electrician services business that regularly shares customer testimonials on social media.</p>

<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Ready to learn how to use UGC to keep your audience engaged year-round?</strong> Download our<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/always-on-marketing?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_alwaysonmarketing_Download&amp;itm_source=localiq&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> free, complete guide to always-on marketing</a>!</p>
<h3>2. Use UGC on your product pages</h3>
<p>Adding product reviews and user-generated photos on your product pages can boost your customers’ confidence and encourage them to add the product to their cart.</p>
<p>Beautiful Earth is a jewelry brand that uses authentic product photos on its product pages, giving customers the extra boost they need to make a purchase decision.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ugc-reviews-png.webp" alt="repurposing user generated content - product reviews" width="808" height="442" class="aligncenter wp-image-90360 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ugc-reviews-png.webp 808w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ugc-reviews-480x263.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 808px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>3. Promote through paid ads</h3>
<p>User-generated content is not reserved for your organic channels only. It can be a great way to share authentic, relatable content in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/ppc">paid ads</a>, giving your brand that “real” vibe while boosting your credibility without sounding too salesy.</p>
<p>The outdoor furniture brand Outer uses customer reviews in its paid ads, highlighting the high-quality materials.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/user-generated-content-paid-ads-png.webp" alt="user generated content - ugc paid ad " width="611" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-90354 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/user-generated-content-paid-ads-png.webp 611w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/user-generated-content-paid-ads-480x471.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 611px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Could your Facebook Ads benefit from UGC?</strong> Find out with our free <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-advertising?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FBGrader_FBGrader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Ads Grader</a>!</p>
<h3>4. Create shoppable content on your website</h3>
<p>Creating a customer gallery on your website is great. You know what’s better? Turning it into shoppable content. Instead of putting customers through the hustle of finding the product on your website, turn your UGC into shoppable content that customers can buy with a click.</p>
<p>The waterproof jewelry brand Hey Harper uses this tactic to enhance the customer experience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ugc-landing-page.webp" alt="user generated content - ecommerce example " width="897" height="406" class="aligncenter wp-image-90359 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ugc-landing-page.webp 897w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ugc-landing-page-480x217.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 897px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>5. Use product reviews above the fold</h3>
<p>If you want to grab customers’ attention right away, make sure to add customer photos and videos above the fold. After all, why make them scroll when you can hit them with social proof right from the start?</p>
<p>Dezi is an eyewear brand that focuses heavily on UGC. Besides sharing it on social media and the home page, the brand also uses UGC right below the add-to-cart button on its product pages.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/user-generated-content-product-page-png.webp" alt="user generated content - example ugc themed product page" width="807" height="409" class="aligncenter wp-image-90358 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/user-generated-content-product-page-png.webp 807w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/user-generated-content-product-page-480x243.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 807px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>6. Use UGC for email campaigns</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/12/27/email-marketing-ios15">Email marketing</a> is still one of the best ways to reach your customers. The trick is to share content that resonates with customers and creates value. And since customers appreciate hearing about first-hand experiences, using UGC in your email campaigns can hit a home run.</p>
<p>Cole Hardware is a local, family-owned hardware store that uses UGC in its emails with a spin — sharing product reviews and recommendations from their crew.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/user-generated-content-example-png.webp" alt="user generated content - example ugc email" width="693" height="622" class="aligncenter wp-image-90355 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/user-generated-content-example-png.webp 693w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/user-generated-content-example-480x431.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 693px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>7. Use UGC on your homepage</h3>
<p>Your website is one of the first touchpoints for your customers, and your homepage is your virtual “doormat,” welcoming customers. So if you want to highlight UGC, whether that’s customer photos and videos or reviews and testimonials, your website homepage can be the perfect stage to show off all that real, authentic content that makes your brand feel human.</p>
<p>Brookfield Residential is a real estate developer that showcases customer reviews on its homepage using a third-party, independent reviews platform to boost credibility.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/user-generated-content-testimonial-png.webp" alt="ugc - reviews" width="845" height="390" class="aligncenter wp-image-90353 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/user-generated-content-testimonial-png.webp 845w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/user-generated-content-testimonial-480x222.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 845px, 100vw" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Buyers are absolutely bombarded by marketing every day—and they’ve gotten really good at sifting most of it out. Personalization is how we marketers can get our messages through those thought filters to create a connection with even the most distracted buyer.</p>
<p>Marketing personalization has evolved far beyond addressing customers by name in an email (although that still helps). There are now sophisticated ways to make sure you’re delivering highly relevant ads and content to precisely the right audience at exactly the right time.</p>
<p>The best part is that these strategies are available to every type of business, from large enterprises to local mom-and-pop shops. In this guide, we’ll show you several ways to personalize your marketing and share examples that will inspire your work. We’ll also establish a few guidelines so your personalization doesn’t come off as creepy and you handle your customers’ data with care.</p>

<h2>What is personalized marketing?</h2>
<p>Personalized marketing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">targets individuals</a> with tailored content, products, and offers based on their specific behaviors, preferences, and demographic information. It uses customer data to create relevant messages that resonate with each person&#8217;s unique needs and interests, making it much more attractive to your target buyer.</p>
<p>The idea behind personalization in marketing is to make your prospects feel like a message or offer was designed just for them.</p>
<p>Imagine you see a random ad for a waterproof winter coat. There is a pretty low chance that you’ll need it right then.</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s say you regularly visit REI.com, have signed up for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/01/email-marketing-tips">marketing emails</a>, and have set a preferred store location. Your town is due for its first big snowfall of the year, and you get an email from REI offering a three-day discount on their new line of waterproof winter coats with your name and city mentioned in the email.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-REI-689x1024.webp" alt="Personalized marketing - email from REI" width="689" height="1024" class="aligncenter wp-image-90139 size-large" /></p>

<h2>What are the benefits of personalized marketing?</h2>
<p>Personalized marketing takes a little extra effort, but the payoff is big. Here are a few of the ways personalizing your marking can help you grow.</p>
<h3>Buyers like it</h3>
<p>First and foremost, personalized marketing makes sense because your customers prefer it. <a href="https://wisernotify.com/blog/personalization-stats/#:~:text=71%25%20of%20buyers%20want%20companies,sales%20and%20increase%20brand%20affinity." target="_blank" rel="noopener">71%</a> of buyers say they want companies to deliver personalized interactions. And two-thirds of customers say they expect brands to understand their needs.</p>
<p>That all makes sense. Most people would rather not have their laptop and smartphone screens filled with irrelevant promotions for things they’ll never want to buy.</p>
<h3>Builds trust</h3>
<p>Who would you trust more, a salesperson who asks questions and explains <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/20/product-positioning">product benefits</a> specific to you? Or one who keeps listing fancy features that don’t solve your exact problem?</p>
<p>Most of us would say the first one, and that’s how you can build trust as a marketer with personalization.</p>
<p>Here’s an example. I recently searched online for washable rugs. Washability was my primary concern (my dog and I trek a lot of mud in the house). I searched that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide">keyword</a> on Google and looked at product pages that offered that feature.</p>
<p>I started seeing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/05/22/best-instagram-ads">Instagram ads</a> from rug companies, but this one stood out.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-tumble.webp" alt="Personalized marketing - Instagram ad from Tumble rugs." width="1080" height="1984" class="aligncenter wp-image-90140 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-tumble.webp 1080w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-tumble-980x1800.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-tumble-480x882.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1080px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>It was the only ad to focus on washability. Now, I can’t say for sure that Tumble serves different ads to people who visit different pages on its website. But if they do, this is the perfect execution of personalized marketing. I believe they have a product that solves my main challenge.</p>
<h3>Grabs attention</h3>
<p>You may have heard about <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1647299/#:~:text=We%20found%20greater%20activation%20in,name%20than%20when%20hearing%20the" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies</a> done to show what happens when we read or hear our own name. Essentially, parts of our brain responsible for impulse control and decision-making (among other things) light up. That’s why you can create an instant connection with someone who’s scrolling through their inbox by adding their name to an email.</p>
<p>There are many other ways to stimulate that connection and get people to stop scrolling. Include an image of their favorite hobby, mention their job title in a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/31/email-subject-lines">subject line</a>, or call out a product they’ve been researching. All of these stand out in a crowded field and snap us out of our brain fog.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f9e0.png" alt="🧠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Want to learn more ways to use marketing psychology to influence customers and win business?</strong> Get our free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite26BrilliantWaysToUsePsychology.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_TextLink_guide_26waysPsychGuide_Download">26 Brilliant Ways to Use Psychology in Your Copywriting (with Examples)</a></p>
<h3>Lowers your cost of advertising</h3>
<p>We talk a lot about marketing as a whole, but personalization can also lower your cost of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/online-advertising-costs">pay-per-click (PPC) advertising</a> in three ways. First, you need to collect customer data in order to personalize ads. That data also helps you tighten your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/21/google-ads-audience-targeting-cheat-sheet">ad targeting</a>. So, instead of targeting an expensive keyword like “running shoes,” you can target something less competitive (and less expensive) like “trail running shoes for women.”</p>
<p>Second, personalized ads are more relevant to the people who will see them. Google uses ad relevance to assign your ads a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/09/19/whats-a-good-quality-score">Quality Score</a>. The more relevant your ad, the better your quality score, and the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/17/lower-cost-per-click">lower your ad’s cost-per-click (CPC)</a>.</p>
<p>Third, those super-relevant ads are also good for increasing your click-through rate and decreasing wasted clicks. People are more likely to click an ad when it feels like it’s for them. And they’ll avoid the ones that aren’t. Both of those actions add up to a higher return on your ad investment.</p>
<h3>Increases loyalty</h3>
<p>I love it when a barista at my local coffee shop remembers my name. It’s a little warm and fuzzy feeling that keeps me coming back.</p>
<p>Those personal touches work in digital marketing, too. Sending things like <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/types-of-marketing-emails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">birthday emails</a>, personalized promotions, and reminders when a consumable product may be running out all endears us to a brand.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-regal-615x1024.webp" alt="Personalized marketing - Birthday email from Regal" width="615" height="1024" class="aligncenter wp-image-90141 size-large" /></p>

<div id="guidelines-for-personalized-marketing"></div>
<h2>What are the guidelines for personalized marketing?</h2>
<p>There’s a responsibility that comes with marketing personalization. After all, you’re gathering and handling customer data. Plus, you often have to tread a fine line between making marketing more relevant and looking like a creepy stalker. These guidelines will help keep you on the right path.</p>
<h3>Gather data responsibly</h3>
<p>Personalization relies on customer data to work. Whether it’s personal info you’ve gathered from a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/31/google-lead-form-extensions">lead generation form</a> or behavioral information based on where someone clicks on your website—you have to gather and manage that data responsibly.</p>
<p>In general, you’ll need to keep up with privacy concerns, regulations, and changing data collection options. Here are a few tips for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/customer-data">ethically collecting and storing customer data</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Include an unsubscribe button:</strong> Always give people an easy way to unsubscribe from emails and back out of data collection.</li>
<li><strong>Create and publish a privacy policy:</strong> Make it clear how you gather customer data and what you intend to do with it.</li>
<li><strong>Protect customer data:</strong> Take steps to make sure your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/22/customer-data-privacy">customers’ data stays safe</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Be transparent:</strong> Communicate clearly with your customers if there’s a data breach or a change in your privacy policy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Avoid retargeting too aggressively</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/retargeting-ad-ideas">Retargeting</a> is an important part of personalized marketing since it puts promotions in front of people who have shown interest in a specific product. But if you take it too far, you’ll annoy the audience you want to convert.</p>
<p>Specifically, put a reasonable time frame on your retargeting ads. For small impulse items, a day or two should be enough. For larger purchases where buyers take longer to make a decision, like real estate, you might cap it at a few weeks or a month. Retargeting a potential lead for several months is unlikely to net anything but frustration.</p>
<h3>Don’t over-personalize</h3>
<p>Personalized marketing has a lot of benefits, but if you lean too heavily on it, you’ll stifle customer discovery and drown out your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/27/brand-messaging">brand messaging</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s what I mean. Say someone shows interest in your yoga classes, and all your ads and emails only highlight that service. You may inadvertently keep them from learning about your other offerings, like reiki sessions and activewear shop. Some of your marketing should be very personalized, but much of it should not.</p>
<div id="how-to-create-a-personalized-marketing-strategy"></div>
<h2>How to create a personalized marketing strategy</h2>
<p>Once you get into personalizing some of your marketing campaigns, you’ll find an endless list of ways to do it. Use these steps as your guide to get started.</p>
<h3>Set your goals</h3>
<p>Just like any journey, you need a destination before you can choose a route. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/03/best-marketing-strategies">Your goals</a> will dictate everything from what data you gather to which channels you choose.</p>
<p>It’s okay to start with a broad goal like “increase the effectiveness of our email marketing” or “<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/social-media-lead-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get more leads from social media</a>.” The next few steps will help refine the rest.</p>
<h3>Gather data</h3>
<p>Gathering clean, trustworthy data is the crux of a successful personalized marketing strategy. You’ll need to decide which data is important and how you’ll collect it.</p>
<p>For example, if getting more from your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/email-marketing-strategy-template/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email marketing strategy</a> is important, then you’ll need to gather email addresses to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-build-an-email-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grow your subscriber list</a> and track some behavioral (buying habits) and personal (first name, birthday) data to personalize your emails.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-data-png.webp" alt="Personalized marketing - Graphic of data types." width="936" height="532" class="aligncenter wp-image-90160 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-data-png.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-data-480x273.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The next question is, “How do we gather that data?”</p>
<p>A few options for this example would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/15/lead-magnet-ideas">lead magnets</a> and pop-ups on your website</li>
<li>Sponsoring a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/giveaway-ideas">giveaway</a> or contest</li>
<li>Launching a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/14/referral-program-ideas">customer referral</a> campaign</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-lead-magnet-png.webp" alt="Personalized marketing - email popup from True Classic." width="504" height="429" class="aligncenter wp-image-90142 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-lead-magnet-png.webp 504w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-lead-magnet-480x409.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 504px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Generate customer and segments</h3>
<p>Much of your personalized marketing will target subgroups of your customers (as opposed to a single person). <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/04/customer-segmentation-models">Customer segments</a> help you identify and target those subgroups.</p>
<p>To create a customer segment, first decide which characteristics the people in that subgroup need to share. It could include age, income, interests, behaviors, and many more.</p>
<p>Once you’ve identified the right common characteristics, place all leads and customers who share them into that group. That’s who you’ll target with your personalized messages.</p>
<h3>Decide which channels you’ll personalize</h3>
<p>Each marketing channel presents its own benefits and challenges for personalization.</p>
<p>Email gives you a lot of control and hyper-personalization options, but it’s harder to get people to give up their email addresses. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">Social media marketing</a> gives you access to larger audiences faster, but you’ll rarely be able to match the one-on-one personalization of email.</p>
<p>Think carefully about your goals and what data you’ll realistically be able to gather, then match them to the right channel.</p>
<h3>Map out your personalized content</h3>
<p>The next step is to lay out what <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/email-marketing-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email content</a> or ads you’ll create, who will see them, and when you’ll share them.</p>
<p>This is where your goals and channel really come into play. Let&#8217;s say you sell kitchen goods. Your goal is to increase repeat purchases and loyalty from existing customers. And email is your chosen channel.</p>
<p>You’re content map could look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What:</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post">Write a blog post</a> with cake recipes and create an ad for a stand mixer.</li>
<li><strong>Who:</strong> People who show interest in baking cakes.</li>
<li><strong>When:</strong> When someone buys a cake pan or when an email subscriber looks at baking-related product pages.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-contest-png.webp" alt="Personalized marketing - Contest lead magnet." width="964" height="707" class="aligncenter wp-image-90144 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-contest-png.webp 964w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-contest-480x352.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 964px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Williams Sonoma held a sweepstakes to gather data for future marketing personalization.</em></p>
<h3>Review, edit, repeat</h3>
<p>Just like any marketing campaign, you’ll get a lot more out of it when you review the results and iterate to improve them.</p>
<p>What you review will depend on all of the other factors (goal, channel, etc.). The key here is to set specific timeframes for your analysis. In the early days, you may want to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/10/content-audit">audit results</a> multiple times per week. Once things are dialed in, you may just need a monthly review.</p>
<h3>Improve with AI</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/solutions/help-leads-find-you/?cid=Web_LiQ_TopModule_LeadsFindYou_GetaDemo_Demo&amp;itm_source=localiq&amp;itm_medium=homepage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI lead generation and management tools</a> can help during every stage of your personalization strategy.</p>
<p>For example, you can use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-copywriting-tools">AI copywriting tools</a> to speed up ad and blog post creation. Dynamic websites are powered by AI. And <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/04/google-ads-ai">Google Ads offers several AI-enabled tools</a> to help you target the right audience.</p>
<div id="types-of-personalized-marketing-with-examples"></div>
<h2>6 types of personalized marketing with real-world examples</h2>
<p>Let’s see how successful brands use some of the most popular types of personalized marketing.</p>
<h3>Retargeting campaigns</h3>
<p>Remember my search for the perfect washable rug? Several rug brands remembered it, too. Here’s a retargeting ad I saw while on a completely unrelated website.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-retargeting-png.webp" alt="Personalized marketing - Retargeting ad from rug company." width="774" height="163" class="aligncenter wp-image-90145 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-retargeting-png.webp 774w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-retargeting-480x101.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 774px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>When retargeting, it’s really important to showcase something your target customers will want to see. These may be products they showed interest in, such as in this example. It could also be a bit of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/03/copywriting-examples">clever copy</a> that speaks directly to the problem they’re trying to solve.</p>
<h3>Personalized marketing emails</h3>
<p>Check out this <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/email-marketing-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">example</a> of a simple but effective email personalization tactic from a clothing brand. All they did was add my name to the top of a promotion email.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-true-classic-619x1024.webp" alt="Personalized marketing - Personalized promo email from Lucky Brand." width="619" height="1024" class="aligncenter wp-image-90146 size-large" /></p>
<p>That will certainly catch my attention. Notice that it also highlighted the value of the promotion next. That’s an important lesson. Personalization alone doesn’t convert customers. You need to offer something of value and make sure it’s clearly stated.</p>
<h3>Personalized website experience</h3>
<p>I really like how this direct-to-consumer dental products brand personalizes its website experience. They offer a discount in exchange for you answering a one-question quiz and entering your email address.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-website-personalization-1-png.webp" alt="Personalized marketing - popup quiz." width="984" height="1552" class="aligncenter wp-image-90148 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-website-personalization-1-png.webp 984w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-website-personalization-1-980x1546.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-website-personalization-1-480x757.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 984px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>With that little bit of extra data, the brand can tailor my next website visit by showing me products that help get my teeth whiter. They can also show <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/16/get-more-google-reviews">customer reviews</a> that mention whiter teeth to really help convince me.</p>
<h3>Personalized videos</h3>
<p>It may seem like personalized videos would be really hard to scale, but AI has changed that.</p>
<p>Check out what Disney does to welcome its new vacation club members.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-video-png.webp" alt="Personalized marketing - video from Disney." width="808" height="455" class="aligncenter wp-image-90149 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-video-png.webp 808w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-video-480x270.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 808px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.idomoo.com/blog/personalized-video-examples-from-top-brands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Most of the video is the same for every viewer, but a few frames showing the family’s name give it a personal touch.</p>
<p>Even a small business can do this with an <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/ai-for-small-business-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI video editor</a>.</p>
<h3>Personalized SMS marketing campaigns</h3>
<p>Text messaging is usually a one-to-one communication channel, so it’s the perfect place for a little personalization.</p>
<p>Look at this <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/sms-marketing-examples">example of SMS marketing</a> from another dental products brand.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-sms-marketing-1-1024x321.webp" alt="Personalized marketing - SMS text example." width="1024" height="321" class="aligncenter wp-image-90151 size-large" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-sms-marketing-1-980x307.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-sms-marketing-1-480x150.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This one coupled personalized SMS marketing with an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-agents">AI chat agent</a> to take the experience to the next level.</p>
<h3>Location-based marketing</h3>
<p>There are lots of ways to personalize marketing based on someone&#8217;s location. <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/geofencing-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geofencing</a> and geotargeting are two options.</p>
<p>Check out how Dick&#8217;s Sporting Goods did it. They combined user behavior with geographic data to show recommended products.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-geo-marketing-png.webp" alt="Personalized marketing - geo-targeting personalization on Dick's Sporting Goods website." width="952" height="548" class="aligncenter wp-image-90152 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-geo-marketing-png.webp 952w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-geo-marketing-480x276.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 952px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://getshogun.com/learn/location-based-personalization-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>This is an easy strategy to duplicate on your website. You can incentivize visitors to allow location services by giving them live store stock updates.</p>
<h2>Personalized marketing done right</h2>
<p>The key to great <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/ai-for-hyper-personalized-campaigns">personalized marketing</a> is to go in with the right attitude. It can never be about using personal information to trick someone into clicking a link.</p>
<p>Instead, personalization should always be about prioritizing your audience. What will help them learn? Where’s the best place, and when’s the best time for them to interact with your message? How can you make a more personal connection while protecting everyone’s privacy?</p>
<p>If you go into it with those questions in mind, you’ll attract more loyal customers to your business. And avoid coming off as creepy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s time to plan our 2025 marketing campaigns, and we could all use a little inspiration. So, I asked a cadre of experienced marketers to share their favorite ads and campaigns from 2024.</p>
<p>Now, I love a good rundown of multinational corporations&#8217; biggest, flashiest ads. But most of us market for SMBs, have limited budgets, and need to generate a lot from a little.</p>
<p>I was delighted that the examples I got back have a healthy mix of big-brand bravado and small-business resourcefulness. Plus, the marketers gave us an inside peek into why each campaign was so successful.</p>

<h2>10 of the best marketing campaigns from 2024</h2>
<p>If you’re staring at a blank campaign calendar, get inspired by these super-successful 2024 marketing campaigns.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Want more ideas?</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/sales-promotion-examples?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_15SalesPromoExamples_Download">Get 15 Insanely Effective Sales Promotion Examples to Win More Customers</a></p>
<div id="a-multisensory-ad-you-can-smell"></div>
<h3>1. A multisensory ad you can “smell”</h3>
<p>I’ve always thought selling things like perfume and air fresheners must be tough. Until we get smell-o-vision (<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f922.png" alt="🤢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />), you can’t exactly share your product&#8217;s most important value proposition.</p>
<p>But somehow, and I can’t explain it, you can smell the candles in this Instagram ad that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaleighmoore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaleigh Moore</a>, a prolific <a href="https://www.kaleighmoore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freelance content writer</a>, showed me.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-candle-smell-campaign.webp" alt="best marketing campaigns - instagram ad for candles" width="341" height="574" class="aligncenter wp-image-87935 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-candle-smell-campaign.webp 341w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-candle-smell-campaign-178x300.webp 178w" sizes="(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DC1lTQLsryu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>The scientific name for these sensory crossovers is synesthesia, and it can be hard to pull off.</p>
<p>“This ad is great because it’s simple, it creates a cozy feeling, and it keeps the focus on the product,” she explained.</p>
<p>Every aspect of the ad works together to create a very specific aesthetic. The background color, the track of nature sounds, and the ferns and rocks all direct your hearing and sight to tell your sense of smell what’ll happen if you buy these candles. Even the copy (“warm embrace”) reinforces the vibe.</p>
<p>“So many campaigns I’ve seen are loud and distracting,” Kaleigh says. “This ad aesthetically matches the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/27/brand-messaging">brand tone</a>. It’s simple and elegant.”</p>
<p>Do you market a product that’s difficult to express in digital form? Try connecting with other senses. Maybe it’s the sensation of running your tongue across freshly cleaned teeth or the sound of sitting in your favorite leather chair—feature those feelings in your ad.</p>
<div id="an-ad-that-won-in-a-competitive-industry"></div>
<h3>2. An ad that won in a competitive industry</h3>
<p>On average, it costs more than <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ads-benchmarks-2024">$50</a> for a health and wellness brand to get a lead from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-targeting">Facebook ads</a>. That makes it one of the most competitive industries in which to market on social media.</p>
<p>To win in wellness advertising, you need a strong offer. You also need to make sure every person who spots your ad can instantly understand the offer.</p>
<p>That’s why <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrice-bagby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patrice Bagby</a>, Senior Social Advertising Manager at <a href="http://localiq.com">LocaliQ</a>, pointed to these ads as excellent examples of how to sell in a competitive industry.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-degree-wellness-female.webp" alt="best marketing campaigns - Facebook wellness ad." width="322" height="577" class="aligncenter wp-image-87936 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-degree-wellness-female.webp 322w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-degree-wellness-female-167x300.webp 167w" sizes="(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px" /></p>
<p>“There are a couple of reasons these two ads performed very well for our client, Degree Wellness,” Patrice explains. “First, the photos are high quality, and the colors really pop out to grab your attention. This is important for a business like this in such a competitive field.”</p>
<p>Patrice said they <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ab-testing-examples">A/B tested</a> both versions of the ads to make sure they’d work for their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a>, which was split between male and female clients. “We saw both audiences convert on these,” Patrice says. “We&#8217;ve even seen women covert from the male ad, which just goes to show you never know what might work and should always TEST, TEST, TEST!”</p>
<p>Getting eyes on the ads was important, but the real test was <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/23/facebook-ads-not-converting">ensuring the ad converted those viewers</a>. Patrice said simplicity and consistency made this ad a high-converter. “The offer is what really matters. We added the deal as an overlay but nothing else. Sometimes, when you try to add too much, your message will get lost. Then, we highlighted it within the ad copy and made sure the offer was added to the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">landing page</a>. That’s what made these perform so well.”</p>

<div id="a-campaign-that-stops-you-every-time"></div>
<h3>3. A campaign that stops you every time</h3>
<p>I wasn’t surprised to see a Progressive ad on this list, but I thought it might be Flo and her indomitable optimism for bundling policies. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/srichtsmeier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seth Richtsmeier</a>, an SEO pro and <a href="https://sethrich.journoportfolio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freelance writer</a>, pointed to a different Progressive promotion as one of his favorites in 2024.</p>
<p>“My fave ad is the ongoing Dr. Rick campaign from Progressive. They’re the only ads I drop everything to watch!”</p>
<p>As a refresher, Dr. Rick is the “parenta-life coach” who helps people suffering from parentamorphosis—the early onset transformation into one’s parents (often exacerbated by purchasing a home).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-progressive.webp" alt="best marketing campaigns - screenshot of Progressive ad." width="872" height="517" class="aligncenter wp-image-87937 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-progressive.webp 872w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-progressive-480x285.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 872px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you suffer from a frequent and uncontrolled urge to discuss the weather, you may have a condition known as parentamorphosis.</em></p>
<p>Seth says the secret sauce of these ads is that they’re “so relatable and memorable.” Maybe it’s the first time you groan while standing up. Or you’ve started doling out advice to strangers at the hardware store. At some point, we all see signs of parentamorphosis.</p>
<p>The Dr. Rick character has taken on a life outside of ads. He’s been on the show Hot Ones, has a YouTube channel, and has even published a book titled <em>Dr. Rick Will See You Now</em>.</p>
<p>You don’t need to go as big as Progressive. Just identify a trait, obstacle, or funny challenge your customers share, and talk about it in your ads. I’ve even seen a B2B SaaS business do that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-generation-ideas">using comic strips</a>.</p>
<div id="a-lofi-ad-that-resonates"></div>
<h3>4. A lo-fi ad that resonates with its target audience</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ann-marie-burrage-digital-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ann-Marie Burrage</a>, Founder of <a href="https://purpleoctopus.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Purple Octopus</a>, didn’t hesitate when I asked her which ad belonged on this list. “Our favorite campaign of 2024 is for our client Helen Exley London,” she said. “It achieved remarkable success with total sales up 3,600% YOY and total orders up 4,100% YOY.”</p>
<p>What’s great about these ads is that they&#8217;re successful without big production budgets. Ann-Marie describes them as a series of “stripped-back, family-focused video ads, leveraging authenticity and emotional resonance.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-emotion-video.webp" alt="best marketing campaigns - Screenshot of the video ad." width="466" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-87938 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-emotion-video.webp 466w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-emotion-video-233x300.webp 233w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-emotion-video-400x516.webp 400w" sizes="(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px" /></p>
<p>It was the perfect fit for the brand, an independent gift-book publisher focusing on inspirational and motivational titles. “This resonated deeply with the ideal customer and delivered above-average engagement and conversion rates.”</p>
<p>These types of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/09/free-and-low-budget-marketing-ideas">marketing campaigns</a> are very accessible to even small businesses. Restaurants, home services providers, and automobile dealerships all trade in the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/21/emotional-ad-copy-examples">emotional response</a> to what they sell. They can replicate these results with a smartphone and a little creativity.</p>
<p>“Success isn&#8217;t necessarily achieved through expensive videography or photography,” Ann-Marie says. “Whatever you create must resonate with who you are talking to.”</p>
<div id="an-ad-that-doubles-down-on-personalization"></div>
<h3>5. An ad that doubles down on personalization</h3>
<p>We all know how effective <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/personalized-marketing">personalization</a> is in marketing. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/milena-alexandrova/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Milena Alexandrova</a>, a <a href="https://www.milena-alexandrova.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">copywriter and fractional content manager</a>, likes this campaign from Camper because it personalized the whole product.</p>
<p>“After the madness of Black Friday, I think offering customers the option to customize their shoes is a fantastic way to get their attention,” Milena says.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-camper.webp" alt="best marketing campaigns - Shoe email ad from Camper" width="573" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-87939 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-camper.webp 573w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-camper-480x503.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 573px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Camper lets you mix and match to create up to 64 color combinations. “The brand’s CamperLab series already makes you feel like you&#8217;re wearing personalized shoes because they&#8217;re so quirky and colorful, but this takes it a step further,” Milena says.</p>
<p>I especially love the visual Camper uses in its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/01/email-marketing-tips">marketing email</a>. It creates a sense of collaboration like you get to work as a shoe designer. I don’t know if they do this, but it’d be awesome if each image were personalized with the email subscriber’s name.</p>
<p>“I believe brands that aren&#8217;t doing this are missing a huge opportunity,” Milena says. “Obviously, not all brands have the resources to offer this level of customization, but it can be done in plenty of different ways and still capture customers&#8217; attention.”</p>
<p>How can you customize what you sell? You could simply include a personalized tag with each item. Or, what if you created a personalized product bundle based on what someone bought in the past and called it the “Alex pack?” That could work for both products and services (like a massage business that added a particular aromatherapy and facial treatment to the bundle).</p>
<div id="an-ad-that-hits-every-purschase-trigger"></div>
<h3>6. An ad that hits every purchasing trigger</h3>
<p>The best ads target <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">emotional triggers</a> that motivate action—not in a clickbaity, sleazy way, but in a way that helps the viewer “feel” that an offer can improve their lives.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelekasse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angele Kasse</a>, a Social Media Manager at <a href="https://agims.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AGI marketing</a>, shared an ad that touches on financial security, trust, family, and a sense of urgency. And did it all with remarkably few words (the copy begins, “Limited offer! 20 acres of land for only $24,800. Monthly payments of only $199.&#8221;)</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-land-sale.webp" alt="best marketing campaigns - Facebook land ad." width="362" height="583" class="aligncenter wp-image-87940 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-land-sale.webp 362w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-land-sale-186x300.webp 186w" sizes="(max-width: 362px) 100vw, 362px" /></p>
<p>Angele says this simple, straightforward ad generated over 12,000 leads and 340 land sales.</p>
<p>“The ad performed well because it combines affordable pricing, trust-building elements (money-back guarantee, verified land, A+ BBB rating), and an emotional appeal (a lasting family legacy),” she explains. “It creates urgency with a limited-time offer and highlights accessibility by removing credit checks, making it easy to act now.”</p>
<p>Angele ads that when your offer is strong, you want to make it stand out without muddling the message with fluff. “I went with a text-only design to keep the message clear and direct, ensuring the offer stood out without distractions,” she adds. “The bold red background immediately grabs attention, while the simplicity of the text emphasizes affordability and value.”</p>
<p>There’s a lot to take in here. First and foremost, ask yourself what the most compelling component of your offer is for the specific audience you’re trying to reach. I may not consider creating a legacy for my family, but my target audience might. Place that benefit in the ad&#8217;s strongest, boldest, most contradictory colors.</p>

<h3>7. A multi-channel ad that keeps on delivering</h3>
<p>I’m a huge fan of innovative <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-repurposing">content repurposing</a>, so I was really interested in the campaign <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chloe-stevens-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chloe Stevens</a>, Senior Content Manager at <a href="https://upslide.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UpSlide</a>, shared.</p>
<p>“One of the big wins from this campaign was how the team transformed insights from one report into so much more,” she says.</p>
<p>As is the case with most excellent content marketing, it all started with <a href="https://upslide.net/investment-banking-software-2024-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report full of original information</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-upslide-report.webp" alt="best marketing campaigns - Report cover page." width="878" height="520" class="aligncenter wp-image-87941 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-upslide-report.webp 878w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-upslide-report-480x284.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 878px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://upslide.net/investment-banking-software-2024-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>From there, they created “a webinar, in-person events, SEO articles, a complete <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/18/social-media-advertising">social media campaign</a>, and more. It&#8217;s a great example of how smart, tailored content can be continually repurposed to reach your intended audience on multiple channels,” Chloe says.</p>
<p>The entire set of assets was designed for one highly-targeted group of people. “The team wasn’t afraid to hone in on a niche target audience and focus entirely on senior IT professionals in investment banking,” Chloe says.</p>
<p>The dedication to one audience lent itself to my favorite part of the campaign, the in-person events.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-in-person.webp" alt="best marketing campaigns - live event photo." width="771" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-87942 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-in-person.webp 771w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-in-person-480x374.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 771px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Chloe’s campaign example shows how creative you can be with repurposing efforts. And how important it is to keep your target audience at the center of it all. “Doing so was a win, as it enabled us to speak their language and ultimately have a bigger impact.”</p>
<div id="a-promotion-with-a-purpose"></div>
<h3>8. A promotion with a purpose</h3>
<p>My personal favorite kind of <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/lead-generation-campaigns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing campaign</a> is one that helps your business and does some good for your community. That’s exactly what <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/goranmirkovic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goran Mirkovic</a>, Chief Marketing Officer at <a href="http://freemius" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freemius</a>, brought for this roundup.</p>
<p>“As part of the 10th-anniversary celebration, Freemius launched a 24-hour fundraising campaign supporting Girls Who Code driven by the wish to give back to the community and contribute to a meaningful cause,” Goran says.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-freemius-300x277.webp" alt="best marketing campaigns - Freemius ad." width="300" height="277" class="aligncenter wp-image-87943 size-medium" /></p>
<p>Freemius provides solutions to creators who sell WordPress themes and plugins. Its pricing is based on a revenue-sharing model with those creators, which formed the basis of the direct financial support for Girls Who Code. “The initiative donated 100% of revenue shares during this period to help close the gender gap in technology and support future female coders,” Goran says.</p>
<p>A really cool “win-win” aspect of the campaign was that the creators could also support the cause while gaining valuable exposure for their own businesses. “The campaign united over 50 businesses from the Freemius community of software makers who all had the opportunity to increase their sales right before the BFCM [<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/black-friday-marketing-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Friday</a> and Cyber Monday], as well as build a positive image around their brands by participating in a charity campaign and highlighting the importance of diversity in tech.”</p>
<p>The team promoted the campaign through several channels, including using the branded <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags">hashtag</a> #freemius10.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-feemius-share.webp" alt="best marketing campaigns - Facebook post for freemius campaign." width="345" height="569" class="aligncenter wp-image-87944 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-feemius-share.webp 345w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-feemius-share-182x300.webp 182w" sizes="(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px" /></p>
<p>“The campaign demonstrated how the software community can come together to create an impact and support the next generation of female technologists,” Goran says.</p>
<p>Campaigns like these are incredibly rewarding, extremely effective, and can be pretty easy to run. One simple process is to choose a cause, find a non-profit partner, offer a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/giveaway-ideas">giveaway</a> or financial support, and promote it across your channels. As a little added bonus, you’ll <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">also gain some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand awareness</a> with the non-profit’s audience</span>.</p>
<div id="a-consistent-campaign"></div>
<h3>9. Bonus: A consistent campaign of hilarious social media posts</h3>
<p>This one isn’t a paid ad, but it is one of the best marketing efforts on the internet, in my humble opinion. It’s a model of consistency in message, hilarity in tone, and creativity in visuals. Even better, it’s from a government agency, the last place you’d look for marketing inspiration.</p>
<p>What am I talking about? The National Park Service Instagram page. It’s one of my favorite accounts, so I’ve made it my nomination for this list.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-nps.webp" alt="best marketing campaigns - NPs instagram post" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-87945 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-nps.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/best-marketing-campaigns-wordstream-nps-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The consistent reminder to be safe in national parks is baked into the NPS posts.</em></p>
<p>The account has over 6 million followers. Many of its posts get over 100,000 likes and thousands of comments—often congratulating the social media team.</p>
<p>A fan favorite of the feed is Fat Bear Week. Every October, the NPS holds a contest for followers to vote on the floofiest ursine. It’s an absolute engagement magnet as people jump in to place their vote and share via #fatbearweek.</p>
<p>Amazing images and quippy copy are something we should all aspire to. But the real lesson here is consistency. You can see the persistent throughline of visitor safety and responsible stewardship of outdoor spaces connecting each message. Even the funny photos of fat bear rumps are a reminder that healthy animals mean a healthy planet. It’s a great reminder to make sure your messaging, no matter how frivolous and fun, serves a purpose for your organization.</p>
<h2>What are the best marketing campaigns of 2024?</h2>
<p>As a communication nerd, I geek out over a clever, well-written, emotional ad. But as a marketer who’s seen behind the promotional curtain, I always end up thinking, “But how did it perform?”</p>
<p>The best marketing campaigns will always be the ones that motivate the most people to buy, subscribe, or donate. Based on that criteria, the campaigns on this list prove you don’t need a million-dollar production budget to create the best marketing campaign of the year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lot has changed since last December. SERPs look different. Attribution doesn’t work the same way it used to. And, of course, AI has somehow made marketing easier, harder, better, and worse all at the same time.</p>
<p>I was curious what other marketers think it all means for the next 12 months. So, I asked 10 experienced marketers for their top marketing tips going into 2025.</p>
<p>No surprise, there were several mentions of AI, but not in the way I expected. It wasn’t about bigger, faster, cheaper. The throughline was a return to providing unique points of view, personal experiences, and original data to stand above the oncoming torrent of mass-produced mass communication. And even using AI to help beat AI content.</p>
<p>If you’re about to put pencil to marketing plan, consider these top marketing tips for 2025 from the pros.</p>

<h2>10 best marketing tips for 2025</h2>
<p>These marketing tips aren’t just good advice. They say a lot about the mood of marketers moving into the new year.</p>
<div id="embrace-negative-reviews"></div>
<h3>1. Embrace negative reviews</h3>
<p>A perfect five-star rating sounds pretty awesome. But <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/allenfinn/">Allen Finn</a>, VP of Marketing at <a href="https://www.heatmap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heatmap</a>, said those <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-respond-to-negative-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less-than-stellar reviews</a> are critical to revenue growth.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Expert-marketing-tips-negative-review.webp" alt="Expert marketing tips - screenshot of a negative review." width="827" height="345" class="aligncenter wp-image-87367 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Expert-marketing-tips-negative-review.webp 827w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Expert-marketing-tips-negative-review-480x200.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 827px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Bad reviews hurt, but Allen Finn of </em><a href="https://www.heatmap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>heatmap</em></a><em> says they’re also good for business.</em></p>
<p>“Ecomm brands showcasing one-star reviews are driving 40% more revenue than those hiding behind five stars,” he said.</p>
<p>That’s a pretty counterintuitive conclusion, and Allen brought the receipts.</p>
<p>“The heatmap team analyzed the review and testimonial sections of 50,000+ ecommerce websites,” he explained. “What we found was shocking: Users who click on one-star reviews drive about 40% more revenue than users who click on four and five-star reviews.”</p>
<p>Allen said one-star reviews paradoxically <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-online-reviews-impact-your-business">improve conversion rates</a> for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authenticity:</strong> “The presence of negative reviews suggests that the feedback is genuine and unfiltered, enhancing overall trust in the brand&#8217;s transparency.”</li>
<li><strong>Expectation management:</strong> “Negative reviews can highlight potential issues, allowing customers to set realistic expectations and reduce post-purchase dissatisfaction.”</li>
<li><strong>Trust in positive reviews:</strong> “The existence of negative reviews lends more credibility to the positive ones, as it suggests that all feedback is published, not just favorable reviews.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The study results highlight the “power of authenticity,” Allen said. “Negative reviews can significantly contribute to building consumer confidence and, ultimately, improving revenue.”</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not a great idea to ruin customer relationships in hopes of nabbing some negative feedback. But when you do get a critical review, use it as a learning experience, and don’t try to cover it up. It may just be the revenue boost you’re looking for.</p>

<div id="create-what-ai-cant"></div>
<h3>2. Create what AI can’t</h3>
<p>The commoditization of content started long before AI hit the scene. But <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-copywriting-tools">AI copywriting tools</a> in the wrong hands have hastened the race to SEO sameness. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristianarule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kristiana Rule</a>, a content strategy consultant, said the best marketers will rise above the digital noise in 2025 by creating things AI can’t.</p>
<p>“With so much generic AI content flooding the internet in 2024, the demand for something more authentic will likely increase in 2025,” Kristiana said. “Lean into creating memorable, specific, and useful content for your audience.”</p>
<p>Original studies are high on Kristiana&#8217;s list of content to focus on in 2025. We previously got a similar rec from <a href="https://www.beamcontent.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beam Content’s</a> co-founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brooklin-nash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brooklyn Nash</a>. He has a strategy for using one set of original data to fuel months’ worth of unique content (which you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-marketing-pros-drive-traffic">read about here</a>).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Expert-marketing-tips-beam.webp" alt="Expert marketing tips - screenshot from Beam report." width="875" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-87368 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Expert-marketing-tips-beam.webp 875w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Expert-marketing-tips-beam-480x329.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 875px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Original content, like this report created by Beam Content, is the counterweight to generic AI output, Kristiana Rule said.</em></p>
<p>Kristiana also suggests writing with a distinct <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/07/31/brand-voice">brand voice</a> and creating bottom-of-funnel (BOFU) content that’s based on “actual customer questions vs. keywords.” Those things will become the audiences’ Turing Test to tell whether something was created by human hands or built by a bot.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f913.png" alt="🤓" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong> The best marketing tip of all is to plan ahead.</strong> Use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/marketing-calendar?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2025MarketingCalendar_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links">The Only Marketing Calendar You Need for 2025</a> to make it easy.</p>
<div id="think-outside-the-blog-for-seo-success"></div>
<h3>3. Think outside the blog for SEO success</h3>
<p>Informational SERPs aren’t just a list of links to blog posts anymore. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/krisettecapati/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Krisette Lim</a>, a content marketing specialist with <a href="https://appetiser.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Appetiser Apps</a>, said if you want <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO success</a> in 2025, you’ll need to think beyond the blog.</p>
<p>“In 2025 and beyond, SEO and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/13/content-marketing-strategy">content marketing</a> will cover a broad spectrum of channels where your brand is represented—from websites to social media and community forums,” she pointed out. “Search on Google will capture these touchpoints—not just your website—as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/28/user-generated-content">user-generated content (UGC)</a> becomes more prominent on search results.”</p>
<p>Here’s an illustration of Krisette’s point. Try searching something like “How do I get out of a shadowban.” Below the AI overview and “People Also Ask” feature, you’ll see results from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-smart-bidding">Reddit</a>, Quora, and YouTube. That&#8217;s because SERPs now surface snippets from social media sites, online forums, and video platforms.</p>
<p>If you’re the one answering that question on those platforms, you’ll garner some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">brand awareness</a> and have more shots at SERP placements.</p>
<p>But even if that’s not in your bandwidth, Krisette suggests mining these topical troves for content ideas. “Read and listen to people&#8217;s questions on these forums and answer them on your blog,” she said. That’s a sure-fire way to publish posts people want to read and search engines want to promote.</p>
<div id="empower-your-internal-influencers"></div>
<h3>4. Empower your internal influencers</h3>
<p>If you post <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/types-of-social-media-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media content</a> on your brand’s account, you know how tough of a slog it can be to grow organic engagement. Most people don’t feel connected enough to a faceless brand to drop a comment or even tap “like.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/briannefleming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brianne Fleming</a>, author of the marketing newsletter <a href="https://briannefleming.com/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">By Popular Demand</a>, put it, “We connect with faces, not logos.”</p>
<p>That’s why her top marketing tip for 2025 is to help your employees step out from behind the logo, especially on LinkedIn. &#8220;LinkedIn is having a moment, and your employees are your biggest influencers. Hearing from the people behind a company is the best way to humanize it,” Brianne said.</p>
<p>While individual results will vary, I can vouch for how this works. When I share a content link from my personal LinkedIn account, it gets as much or more engagement as a similar post on our business account. And I have way fewer followers than the company page has.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Expert-marketing-tips-linkedin2.webp" alt="Expert marketing tips - LinkedIn post screenshot." width="537" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-87385 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Expert-marketing-tips-linkedin2.webp 537w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Expert-marketing-tips-linkedin2-480x536.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 537px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The </em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rob-c-glover_can-you-double-your-conversion-rate-by-simply-activity-7259570168677203969-JVe7?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>repost</em></a><em> on my personal LinkedIn page accounted for nearly 80% of the total impressions for this content.</em></p>
<p>Brianne says the trick is that you can’t just ask or force your people to become instant influencers. “Empower your teams to share their thoughts and proudly celebrate their work.&#8221; That means helping them use the opportunity to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/personal-branding-on-linkedin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build their personal network</a> and become thought leaders in their own right. Give them content and topics to share. And maybe even create post templates so it’s less of a burden to stay on brand.</p>
<div id="expand-your-marketing-channels"></div>
<h3>5. Expand your marketing channels</h3>
<p>Have a scroll through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bakerseo/">Jeff Baker’s LinkedIn feed</a>. Tucked in amongst the industry trends and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bakerseo_taco-bell-brings-back-nostalgic-fan-favorites-activity-7260669751306133504-F6GS?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">Taco Bell takes</a>, you’ll see frequent callouts to subscribe to his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/7247014071105925121/?displayConfirmation=true">Work From Anywhere Job Alerts</a> newsletter. He chose to house and promote the newsletter on LinkedIn instead of through the traditional blog and SEO strategy.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Expert-marketing-tips-newsletter.webp" alt="Expert marketing tips - Screenshot of Jeff Baker's LinkedIn post." width="577" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-87371 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Expert-marketing-tips-newsletter.webp 577w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Expert-marketing-tips-newsletter-480x499.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 577px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Jeff publishes his newsletter natively on LinkedIn, which lets him avoid the volatility of search algorithms.</em></p>
<p>Even as an experienced fractional SEO consultant (and fractional CMO), Jeff said the money move in 2025 is to explore beyond search. “With the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-seo-in-2024">volatility we are seeing in search due to algorithm changes</a>, AI Overviews, and ChatGPT, it&#8217;s going to be more important than ever for marketers to expand their channels.”</p>
<p>And which channel did Jeff suggest marketers focus on in 2025? Good old-fashioned <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/01/email-marketing-tips">email marketing</a>. “If you have a large enough email list, you’ll be able to sell your products and services, period.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/05/increase-email-signups#:~:text=Put%20up%20an%20email%20signup,in%20exchange%20for%20a%20resource.">Growing your email list</a> takes time. But when it becomes your goal, you’ll start seeing all sorts of ways to do it. Here are a few of the ways I’ve seen brands speed that process up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run a contest or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/giveaway-ideas">giveaway</a>.</li>
<li>Offer <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/15/lead-magnet-ideas">lead magnets</a> like big content assets.</li>
<li>Put subscription forms in page popups, sidebars, headers, and footers.</li>
<li>Ask new customers to sign up and incentivize them to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/14/referral-program-ideas"> invite friends</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of trying to wring more site visits from an unstable traffic source, consider Jeff’s advice and invest those resources in building an audience on a platform you have more control over. “I would take 10K email addresses over 100K visitors per month.”</p>
<div id="train-ai-t0-write-like-you"></div>
<h3>6. Train your AI to write like you</h3>
<p>AI isn’t going away. Nor should it. You can gain so much efficiency—and free yourself up for more creativity—by letting your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency">AI tools</a> shoulder repetitive work.</p>
<p>But you can’t just throw in an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-prompts">AI prompt</a> and expect to get a marketing asset that stands out from the rest of the robo-content, said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ehtisham-hussain-0b12b860/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ehtisham Hussain</a>, a <a href="https://www.ehtishamhussain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fractional head of marketing</a> with AI experience. “Your competitors will flood the internet with AI-generated written, audio, and video content like never before.”</p>
<p>Ehtisham reckons you don’t need to ditch AI to be different. “Your biggest challenge will be making your content rise above the noise. To do that, I recommend training your AI tools on past, human-written content that embodies your voice and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-create-a-brand-identity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand identity</a>.”</p>
<p>We’ve seen people cajole AI into writing like <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-used-chatgpt-to-rewrite-my-text-in-the-style-of-shakespeare-c3po-and-harry-potter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shakespeare and C3PO</a>. It can because it has content in those voices to train it. You probably have lots of content in your preferred style. Ehtisham suggested feeding it to your AI copywriter. “By doing so, you will get your AI tools to produce new content in your voice and style,” he said.</p>
<p>Once you have your AI co-writer thinking like you, Ehtisham said to apply it to content others aren&#8217;t writing. “Lean heavily into POV-driven content. Everyone will do the AI-generated &#8216;what, why, how&#8217; pieces, and they will all sound the same. Your real stories, opinions, and advice based on personal experiences will give you a better chance of standing out.&#8221;</p>
<div id="focus-on-solving-problems"></div>
<h3>7. Focus on solving problems</h3>
<p>Your customers are arguably busier and more distracted than ever. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/goranmirkovic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goran Mirkovic</a>, Chief Marketing Officer at <a href="https://freemius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freemius</a>, said next year will be all about exposing value over describing products.</p>
<p>“In 2025, B2B SaaS marketing needs to continue to shift from ‘here’s our product’ to ‘here’s how we can help you succeed,’” Goran said. “At Freemius, we’ve seen firsthand how content that focuses on solving problems, not just showcasing features, builds real trust with our audience.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Expert-marketing-tips-freemius.webp" alt="Expert marketing tips - screenshot from Freemius website." width="908" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-87372 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Expert-marketing-tips-freemius.webp 908w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Expert-marketing-tips-freemius-480x317.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 908px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://freemius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Freemius’ website copy</em></a><em> leads with benefits and clearly calls out who can use them.</em></p>
<p>At ground level, that means content and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/03/copywriting-examples">marketing copy</a> that hyper-focuses on your customers&#8217; challenges, Goran said. And then going the extra mile to give them real actions they can take to solve them.</p>
<p>He added that marketing that leads with <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-pain-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer challenges</a> will help people find and trust your business. “As search engines prioritize expertise, thought leadership pieces, case studies, customer stories, and how-to guides will rise above the noise. And they position your brand as a go-to resource.”</p>
<p>Goran explained that this is less of a tactic or strategy than a mindset you have to apply to all your campaigns. “For us, it’s not about convincing customers to buy—it&#8217;s about earning their trust over time by showing we understand their needs and are here to help.&#8221;</p>
<div id="make-a-marketing-moat-with-customer-insights"></div>
<h3>8. Make a marketing moat with customer insights</h3>
<p>The best marketers have always used <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/24/customer-feedback">customer feedback</a> to guide decisions. Unfortunately, there are precious few opportunities to sit and chat with a customer. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stella-inabo-/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stella Inabo</a>, a Content Marketer at <a href="https://www.float.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Float</a>, said you may already have all the customer intel you need.</p>
<p>“It is hard to get people to agree to a 30-minute chat. Instead of opting for direct conversations, I’ve found reading transcripts or watching video recordings from past customer interactions to be a good substitute.”</p>
<p>Diving into customer interactions will help <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/27/brand-messaging">make your messaging more relevant</a>. But the real gold is that it can create a marketing moat other businesses can&#8217;t cross. “None of our competitors have access to this information, so it made our articles unique,” Stella explained.</p>
<p>For example, Stella said she recently conducted a series of customer interviews. The initial goal was to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/03/how-to-write-a-case-study">publish case studies</a> and move on to the next job. “However, as I rewatched the recordings, I realized they held so many insights into our audience,” she said.</p>
<p>Stella listed a few of the takeaways from those interactions and how she used them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Their pain points became article and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-host-a-webinar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">webinar</a> topics.</li>
<li>Their workarounds for problems highlighted objections to address.</li>
<li>Their processes provided expert tips for how-to articles.</li>
<li>Their language helped shape the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/01/13/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing">words and phrases</a> on our homepage and in customer-facing content.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where else can you find these hidden collections of customer comments? Try sales call recordings, onboarding documents, and customer service tickets/recordings.</p>
<p>“Depending on the questions asked, you can use these internal assets to find out who your customers are, what they need, how they buy, and where they go for information,” Stella said. “Just to be safe, you should definitely check in with your customers to ensure it’s okay to use their words and ideas in articles.”</p>
<div id="break-through-selective-attention"></div>
<h3>9. Break through selective attention</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/colby-flood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colby Flood</a>, Founder at <a href="https://www.brighterclick.com/ugc-agency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brighter Click</a>, said that in 2025, marketers will need to really think about what they post on social media.</p>
<p>“People are on social media to find content that entertains, educates, or connects with them emotionally and will likely filter out everything else due to what we call “<a href="https://osheenjain.medium.com/science-of-selective-attention-how-we-filter-information-and-why-it-matters-644582c9e844" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selective attention</a>,” he said.</p>
<p>Selective attention is our brains’ defense mechanism against being overwhelmed in buzzy environments. It’s how we filter out the drone of a city street but can hear a favorite song from half a block away. It’s also how we can scroll through a dozen posts at speed and automatically stop on one that interests us.</p>
<p>So, how do we stop speedy scrollers?</p>
<p>“Lean into UGC and influencer content to craft authentic, engaging ads,” Colby said. “Consider ways to naturally incorporate your product into stories or scenarios that resonate with your target audience.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/13/ugc-instagram">User-generated content works well</a> because it’s peer-to-peer marketing. The content creator will naturally hit themes that resonate with other people like them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Expert-marketing-tips-UGC-1.webp" alt="Expert marketing tips - UGC social media post." width="329" height="566" class="aligncenter wp-image-87373 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Expert-marketing-tips-UGC-1.webp 329w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Expert-marketing-tips-UGC-1-174x300.webp 174w" sizes="(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>UGC features people relevant to your target audience, cutting through their selective attention.</em></p>
<p>Don’t stress out trying to be the next GoPro of user-generated content. Here are a few easy ways you can turn product users into social media content creators for your brand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add user-generated FAQs to your website and share them on social media.</li>
<li>Post snippets from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/03/testimonial-advertising">user testimonials</a>.</li>
<li>Promote your reviews.</li>
<li>Ask users to add a branded hashtag like #[product]results when they post about the great things they’ve done with your product.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/25/social-listening-boolean-search">social listening</a> to find positive conversations about your brand, then ask if you can share them on your feeds.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re talking about marketing here, so Colby added a reminder to use those same attention-grabbing tactics to convert social scrollers. “Cap it off with a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-pros-write-calls-to-action">powerful CTA</a> that speaks directly to your audience’s needs, sparking action that feels rewarding, not forced.”</p>
<div id="leave-negative-space-in-your-campaign"></div>
<h3>10. Leave negative space in your campaigns</h3>
<p>“Negative space” is the blank area that separates design elements on a page. It makes important text and graphics feel more important and helps viewers process the information they’re receiving.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reaserios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rease Rios</a>, Director of Content at <a href="https://qase.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qase</a>, says that you should apply the same principle to your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-calendar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing calendar</a>.</p>
<p>“Don’t become white noise,” she said. “Space out your big launches so your audience has time to get curious about what you’ll come up with next. If you run back-to-back major campaigns all year long, you’ll burn out your audience.”</p>
<p>It’s not just your audience’s attention at risk, Rease warned. “Know when it’s time to push and when it’s time to rest,” she said. “You’ll also burn out your team. They need room to be creative.”</p>
<p>The right cadence depends a lot on your business, especially its size and structure. One large campaign a quarter is a great goal for most, though. That allows time to gather results from a few tactics (like repurposing) that’ll inform the next big campaign.</p>
<h2>The main marketing tip for 2025: Connect authentically</h2>
<p>I didn’t use AI to write this article, but if I had, this is where it would say, “In the quickly evolving landscape of marketing, you’ll need new strategies and ideas to succeed.” And it wouldn’t be wrong.</p>
<p>Just a few years ago, none of us probably thought that Google would use AI to shove our links further down the page. We couldn’t imagine spinning up a dozen clone articles to heist SERP spots. Nor would we guess at the dramatic changes in how Twitter (ahem…X), Facebook, and TikTok operate.</p>
<p>But what’s interesting to me is that the marketing tips I got weren’t a bunch of complex, technical processes to hijack algorithms or game Google Ads. They all described some version of making marketing more human, which makes sense. No matter how many tech tools we throw at the job, we’re still people selling to people.</p>

<h2>17 Small Business Saturday marketing ideas anyone can take advantage of</h2>
<p>No matter your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/niche-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">niche market</a> or preferred promotion channels, these<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-saturday-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Small Business Saturday marketing ideas</a> are sure to be a hit.</p>
<div id="small-business-saturday-sale"></div>
<h3>1. Run a sale or promotion</h3>
<p>This is a classic holiday marketing tactic for a reason: it works. Shoppers not only save up for the events each year, but they browse various retailers for the best deals. In fact, <a href="https://www.tidio.com/blog/black-friday-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">87%</a> of people plan on shopping between Black Friday and Cyber Monday—and Small Business Saturday is a part of this timeframe.</p>
<p>While consumers may assess their willingness to buy from large businesses purely on economics, they often give <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2025-marketing-planning">small businesses</a> a little leeway. Even if you can’t offer the steepest discount, consumers may factor in the sense of satisfaction they get in supporting a local shop.</p>
<p>Your sale or promotion can take several forms. Some popular Small Business Saturday ideas include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Doorbuster or early bird deals:</strong> Offer a special discount to those enthusiastic souls who are waiting outside your door when you open on Saturday morning.</li>
<li><strong>BOGO:</strong> The “buy one, get one” structure is a classic for brands, especially those in retail.</li>
<li><strong>Deals by category:</strong> Cut prices on specific categories of merchandise or service offerings.</li>
<li><strong>Bundle deals: </strong>Offer discounts when customers buy complementary products or services together (wine and cheese, shoes and socks, sheets and duvet cover—you get the idea).</li>
</ul>

<div id="local-events"></div>
<h3>2. Participate in local events</h3>
<p>Many cities and towns use Small Business Saturday as an opportunity to celebrate their region’s brands and encourage neighbors and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/increase-foot-traffic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visitors</a> alike to stimulate the local economy.</p>
<p>If yours is a city that’s hosting an event, be sure to get involved! And if you’re not sure what’s happening in your area, reach out to your local Chamber of Commerce. They may plan something you can take part in.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-social-post.webp" alt="small business saturday marketing - example social post" width="840" height="467" class="aligncenter wp-image-86200 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-social-post.webp 840w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-social-post-480x267.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 840px, 100vw" /></p>

<div id="small-business-saturday-events"></div>
<h3>3. Create your own Small Business Saturday event</h3>
<p>If your town isn’t doing something, why not take the initiative and host a Small Business Saturday event yourself?</p>
<p>Perhaps plan an in-store event designed to draw people to your brick-and-mortar location. Be sure to take your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target customer</a> into account when you create your event.</p>
<p>For example, a local bakery that caters to young families might offer a holiday cookie decorating class for kids. Meanwhile, the sophisticated florist down the street might invite adults to stop by for a holiday centerpiece design demonstration.</p>
<p>Allow your imagination to run wild as you flesh out this Small Business Saturday marketing idea. Whatever event you dream up, promote it in advance with fliers, on social media, and via your email list.</p>
<div id="small-business-saturday-partnership"></div>
<h3>4. Partner with other small business owners</h3>
<p>Don’t feel up to hosting an event on your own? Consider partnering with other local business owners to co-create a Small Business Saturday celebration.</p>
<p>You might all spearhead a larger event, creating a directory of participating small businesses. Go in on advertising together in advance, and offer incentives to customers who stop by multiple stores in your collective.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-partnership.webp" alt="small business saturday marketing ideas - ways to partner with other businesses example for small business saturday" width="657" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-86198 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-partnership.webp 657w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-partnership-480x438.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 657px, 100vw" /></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can pair up with just one or two other small businesses to host a smaller event. Look for natural crossover in your audience to create an event that will appeal to the customers you have in common.</p>
<p>For example, a local cafe might team up with the bookshop down the street and host a “coffee and a book” event. The coffee shop sets up an espresso machine at the bookstore, and visitors can grab a latte and curl up with a great read on the store’s shelves.</p>

<h3>5. Get listed on the American Express Small Business Saturday map</h3>
<p>As the founder of the event, American Express undertakes some Small Business Saturday marketing of its own. It hosts the <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/benefits/shop-small/#smallbusinessowners" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shop Small</a> map each year, and while it looks very similar to a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/02/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Maps</a> or <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/yelp-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yelp listing</a>, it’s special because it only features small businesses.</p>

<h3>6. Share your Small Business Saturday plans on social media</h3>
<p>Organic social media is the perfect vehicle for sharing your Small Business Saturday plans. Whether it’s an event, sale, giveaway, or all of the above, posting about it on social media for Small Business Saturday gets the word out to your followers.</p>
<p>Remember to plan and post in advance to build anticipation. Tease sale items or hint at your big Small Business Saturday surprises to catch your audience’s attention. Some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media platforms</a>, like Instagram, even have features that help you generate excitement. Consider using the countdown sticker in your Stories leading up to the big day.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-social-media.webp" alt="small business saturday - marketing social media post example" width="785" height="479" class="aligncenter wp-image-86199 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-social-media.webp 785w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-social-media-480x293.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 785px, 100vw" /></p>

<p>Finally, don’t forget to use relevant hashtags! This can help people outside your follower count discover your business. <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-use-hashtags-with-hashtag-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Add hashtags</a> related to the broader event (#ShopSmall and #SmallBusinessSaturday are two big ones). Then, include some hashtags related to your city or town to get your posts in front of a local audience.</p>

<div id="small-business-saturday-giveaway"></div>
<h3>7. Start a social media giveaway or contest</h3>
<p>There’s no denying it: People love a social media <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/giveaway-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">giveaway</a>! You can build an online contest around just about any event, and Small Business Saturday is no exception.</p>
<p>Contests and giveaways can get the word out about your plans for Small Business Saturday, all while helping to build up your follower count. Often, businesses ask entrants to follow their accounts as part of entering the contest.

<div id="social-ads"></div>
<h3>8. Try social media ads</h3>
<p>While you’re logged into your social accounts, consider <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/18/social-media-advertising" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running some social media ads</a> before Small Business Saturday to get your message out to an even wider audience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-sale.webp" alt="small business saturday marketing - sale example" width="769" height="470" class="aligncenter wp-image-86201 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-sale.webp 769w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-sale-480x293.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 769px, 100vw" /></p>

<p>You may choose to create an entire ad campaign or simply boost existing organic posts to broaden their reach. How you opt to advertise will depend on your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing budget</a> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/15/marketing-objectives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">objectives</a>.</p>
<p>If you design a full campaign, be sure to focus on setting the right audience within the social platform. You can target based on geography, age, gender, and other demographics to get your ads seen by the people who are most likely to shop with you on Small Business Saturday.</p>

<div id="influencer"></div>
<h3>9. Tap a local influencer for support</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/digital-marketing/influencer-marketing-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Influencer marketing</a> is a wildly effective tactic that’s sometimes overlooked by small businesses.</p>
<p>Some hear the phrase and assume it’s only for big brands with mega budgets, but an ever-expanding pool of micro-influencers—those with thousands, rather than millions, of followers—are making influencer marketing a viable tactic for small brands.</p>
<p>To find the right micro-influencer to promote your Small Business Saturday efforts, look for someone who’s a trusted source for your ideal audience. A gym might partner with a popular wellness influencer, while a clothing boutique might tap a fashion influencer.</p>
<p>And when you work with a micro-influencer, you’re likely to see stronger results than you would with a big name. Influencers with fewer than 15,000 followers typically see a <a href="https://www.upfluence.com/influencer-marketing/influencer-engagement-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3.86%</a> engagement rate on Instagram, while mega influencers with 1 million or more followers see much lower engagement; the average rate is 1.21%.</p>
<div id="online-communities"></div>
<h3>10. Talk your business up in local online communities</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/brand-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Your brand&#8217;s community</a> doesn’t only exist in the real world anymore. Today, it’s easy to connect with neighbors across a wide range of online forums and gathering places. From the local Subreddit to the town Facebook group, your neighbors are gathering together online.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-online-community.webp" alt="small business saturday marketing ideas - online community example" width="944" height="359" class="aligncenter wp-image-86202 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-online-community.webp 944w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-online-community-480x183.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 944px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Community-focused message boards are a go-to spot for neighbors seeking local recommendations. </em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hartford/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Often, these forums become a place where local business owners can market themselves, and where community members shout out businesses they love to neighbors in search of a recommendation.</p>
<p>Join these forums and make your presence known in the digital town square. If group mods allow business owners to promote their work, create a post inviting everyone to stop by your store on Small Business Saturday.</p>
<div id="email-marketing"></div>
<h3>11. Create an email marketing campaign</h3>
<p>Email marketing can play an essential role in building anticipation for your Small Business Saturday plans with your existing audience.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/01/email-marketing-tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Email marketing</a> is at its best when it’s built as a multi-message campaign, rather than a single email. The average open rate across industries hovers around <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/guides/email-marketing-benchmarks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">21%</a>, which means it might take <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/01/automated-email-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than one email</a> to get your readers to open and click.</p>
<p>Your email marketing campaign should serve two main purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Repeat your Small Business Saturday message so everyone gets it, even if they’re not diligently reading every one of your emails.</li>
<li>Create a growing sense of excitement as the day draws nearer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Start with a teaser message, sharing that something big is coming this Small Business Saturday. Then, use each subsequent email to reveal a little bit more about your plan. You might even offer a special discount or deal that’s just for your loyal email subscribers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-contest.webp" alt="small business saturday marketing ideas - email example" width="749" height="465" class="aligncenter wp-image-86197 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-contest.webp 749w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-contest-480x298.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 749px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="ppc"></div>
<h3>12. Add a Small Business Saturday-specific campaign into your PPC rotation</h3>
<p>If you’re already running <a href="https://localiq.com/products/search-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search ads</a>, consider launching a new campaign specifically for your Small Business Saturday marketing efforts.</p>
<p>The key to effective <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/local-ppc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local PPC campaigns</a> is finding the perfect marriage between message and audience. Focus on your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/keyword-prioritization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keyword strategy</a>, and consider targeting some <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/keyword-research-for-ppc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PPC keywords</a> that will help you stand out in local, relevant searches. You might also focus on terms related to Small Business Saturday, holiday shopping, or other timely phrases.</p>
<p>Then, invest in creating attention-getting headlines and body copy to help your search ads stand out on the crowded results page. And, of course, create a customized landing page for your Small Business Saturday campaign. That way, when readers click through, they find information about your plans for the big day.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Are your search ads ready for Small Business Saturday?</strong> Find out with our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free Google Ads Grader</a>!</p>
<div id="local-ads"></div>
<h3>13. Advertise in local publications</h3>
<p>Amex founded Small Business Saturday to encourage neighborhood engagement with local brands. Given the spirit of the day, your local publication is the perfect place to share your Small Business Saturday plans.</p>
<p>Whether your local publication is a citywide newspaper or neighborhood pamphlet, take out some advertising space on its pages. In doing so, you’ll know that your message is being seen by the most relevant, most local audience around.</p>
<div id="local-media"></div>
<h3>14. Drum up local media attention</h3>
<p>In addition to buying ad space in local papers, you might also pitch local journalists with Small Business Saturday story ideas.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-local-media.webp" alt="small business saturday marketing ideas - small business local media coverage example" width="787" height="433" class="aligncenter wp-image-86204 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-local-media.webp 787w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-local-media-480x264.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 787px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://citylifestyle.com/articles/free-ways-to-support-local-businesses-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>If you’re doing something unique for Small Business Saturday, you can approach a local publication to see if they’re interested in covering it. Or, if you’re partnering with several local businesses, the story you can collectively pitch is one of collaboration and a celebration of shopping small.</p>
<div id="direct-mail"></div>
<h3>15. Give direct mail a try</h3>
<p>Just as with local media coverage, direct mail is a tactic that allows you to connect with a local audience and foster a true sense of community.</p>
<p>A direct mailer with a discount is never a bad idea. Send the coupon right to your neighbors’ doors, and it just may kindle a desire to support local businesses and shop small—with you.</p>
<p>And as an added bonus for your Small Business Saturday marketing efforts: Direct mail makes it super easy to measure ROI. Each person who walks up to your register with a coupon in hand represents a sale that’s directly attributable to your campaign.</p>
<div id="google-business-profile"></div>
<h3>16. Update your Google Business Profile with Small Business Saturday marketing specifics</h3>
<p>You likely already have a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/10/create-google-my-business-account" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Business Profile</a>, but is it <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/optimize-google-my-business-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fully optimized</a>?</p>
<p>One way to make the most of your Google Business Profile is to take advantage of its <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/google-my-business-posts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Posts feature</a>. With Posts, you can add timely updates or special promotions to your Google Business Profile.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-google-business-profile.webp" alt="small business saturday - google business profile listing post update" width="773" height="459" class="aligncenter wp-image-86205 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-google-business-profile.webp 773w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-google-business-profile-480x285.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 773px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Add a post that shares your Small Business Saturday plans. When people Google your business and find your listing, they’ll see this timely information that just might inspire them to stop by over the weekend.</p>
<div id="referrals"></div>
<h3>17. Encourage people to come back</h3>
<p>If someone showed up to shop on Small Business Saturday, maybe they deserve a little extra love. Create a deal or promo code they can use in the future as a thank you for shopping small this holiday season.</p>
<p>That generosity is in keeping with the seasonal spirit. Plus, a coupon code or offer for the future nudges these shoppers to return to you again after the holidays are through.</p>
<h2>Big ideas to power your Small Business Saturday marketing</h2>
<p>Small Business Saturday is an opportunity to kick the holiday season off right—with big sales numbers and lots of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/04/customer-experience-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">happy customers</a>.</p>
<p>The best way to ensure your business capitalizes on the event is to implement some marketing tactics leading up to the day. Doing so can remind your existing audience that you’re around and introduce you to new consumers who are excited about shopping small.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you’re marketing a small business, it can be easy to focus on attracting new leads and converting those into customers. After all, customer acquisition is important for growing a business.</p>
<p>But what if each of those new customers also returned to make more purchases, leave glowing reviews, and share their great experiences on social media? Your business would grow exponentially faster with much less work acquiring new leads.</p>
<p>How do you reach that dream scenario? By building brand loyalty.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll cover 12 ways to build brand loyalty by strengthening your messaging, leveling up your focus on customers, and encouraging repeat business.</p>
<p>Before we get to the strategies, though, let’s clarify what brand loyalty is and why it’s worth focusing on.</p>

<h2>What is brand loyalty?</h2>
<p>Brand loyalty describes a consumer’s tendency to purchase from one company repeatedly despite alternate offers and opportunities. This decision to repeat purchases can be motivated by a relationship with the brand, which may include trust in the product, appreciation for the customer service, or shared belief in the company values.</p>
<p>Encouraging a customer to buy again usually costs much less than attracting and converting a new customer.  That means brand loyalty can have real monetary results for your business. According to Bain &amp; Company, businesses get an average <a href="https://media.bain.com/Images/BB_Prescription_cutting_costs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25%</a> increase in profit when they boost customer retention by just 5%.</p>
<p>This isn’t just a cumulative, lifetime value. Some studies suggest that repeat, loyal customers spend more per purchase than their first-time counterparts, even up to <a href="https://www.business.com/articles/returning-customers-spend-67-more-than-new-customers-keep-your-customers-coming-back-with-a-recurring-revenue-sales-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">67%</a> more when they have a long-standing relationship with your brand.</p>
<p>This relationship between your customers and your brand, however, isn’t likely to just happen; you need to focus on building brand loyalty.</p>

<h2>12 ways you can foster brand loyalty</h2>
<p>Consistent and coordinated efforts throughout your product, marketing, and customer service cultivate brand loyalty. Here are some surefire strategies for building brand loyalty with your customers.</p>
<div id="ace-your-brand-story"></div>
<h3>1. Ace your brand story</h3>
<p>Building trust and loyalty requires a connection. A compelling brand that inspires emotional resonance with your audience is an excellent way to foster that connection.</p>
<p>Your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/08/brand-story">brand story</a> captures your company’s origin and its why. It explains the motivation behind certain products or offerings, the gaps they fill in the market, and the vision that led to the brand’s launch.</p>
<p>Take this example from <a href="https://www.puresolutions.com/pure-page/our-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pure Solutions</a>, a family-owned organic lawn care and pest control company based in New England.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/brand-loyalty-wordstream-mission.webp" alt="Brand loyalty - Mission statement from Pure Solutions." width="797" height="296" class="aligncenter wp-image-86144 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/brand-loyalty-wordstream-mission.webp 797w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/brand-loyalty-wordstream-mission-480x178.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 797px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.puresolutions.com/pure-page/our-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>This brief paragraph on the business’ <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/27/guide-to-about-us-pages">About Us page</a> outlines the initial gap in the market, the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">value proposition</a>, the brand’s values, and the commitment to organic-based solutions that are effective and safe for kids, pets, and the environment. Plus, it encourages an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">emotional reaction</a> by including words like “safer” and “protect.”</p>
<div id="offer-consistant-products-and-services"></div>
<h3>2. Offer consistent products and services</h3>
<p>This is going to seem like an obvious one, but it’s worth stating. In order to foster brand loyalty, you need to consistently offer quality products and services.</p>
<p>Consistency is important when you have repeat customers. Last year, I re-ordered the same Warby Parker glasses that I have loved for years (through multiple prescription changes). Except this time, the frames were flimsier, lighter, and smaller, even though they cost more than my previous pair. It was upsetting to lose my glasses and my go-to supplier at once. I’ve been ordering glasses and sunglasses from a different place since.</p>
<p>I’m not alone in craving consistency as a consumer. In a <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/4/9/18296792/starbucks-habit-millennials-money" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vox</a> article on Millennial money habits, Mae Rice writes, “Starbucks’s brand isn’t good coffee so much as predictability: experiences you’ve already had, drinks you’ve already drunk. It promises to sustain your routines.” It’s the familiar consistency maintained in different locations and at different times that keeps bringing many loyal customers back.</p>
<p>But consistency shouldn’t be at the expense of quality. (Chances are, your business doesn’t have the ubiquity and customer base that Starbucks does.) In fact, your brand values might be worth a premium to your ideal customer base. For example, PwC found that <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2024/pwc-2024-voice-of-consumer-survey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80%</a> of consumers are willing to pay more for sustainably produced or sourced products (read how AI can help you deliver <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/ai-for-customer-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistent customer service</a>).</p>
<div id="prioritize-customer-experience-over-transactions"></div>
<h3>3. Prioritize experience over transaction</h3>
<p>Customer service plays a huge role in building and maintaining brand loyalty. You want your customers to become dependable repeat buyers, five-star <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/16/get-more-google-reviews">reviewers</a>, and even your evangelizers on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/drive-traffic-from-reddit">Reddit</a>. The way to get there is to prioritize creating a relationship with exceptional customer experience rather than simply facilitating a seamless transaction.</p>
<p>Take Chewy, for instance. The pet food and goods marketplace sends beautiful condolence notes to customers whose pets have passed away.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/brand-loyalty-wordstream-customer-note.webp" alt="Brand loyalty - Customer note from pet goods supplier." width="878" height="547" class="aligncenter wp-image-86145 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/brand-loyalty-wordstream-customer-note.webp 878w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/brand-loyalty-wordstream-customer-note-480x299.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 878px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/1b93s9e/my_dog_passed_on_tuesday_and_i_got_this_email/?rdt=34603" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>They often offer reimbursement for unused food, an assurance to not worry about returns and donate instead, and a cancellation of any automated orders. The posts are heartbreaking, but the company&#8217;s actions seem genuine and caring during a hard time for any pet owner.</p>
<p>This is a prime example of fostering an emotional connection that guarantees a loyal customer. It also encourages any pet lover who hears about the caring act to start using Chewy.</p>
<div id="personalize-your-outreach"></div>
<h3>4. Personalize your outreach</h3>
<p>When it comes to customer acquisition, <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/digital-customers-research-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">59%</a> of customers say tailored engagement based on past interactions is very important to win their business. That demand for personalized interaction is even greater with your existing customers.</p>
<p>It’s annoying when you get an email from a brand that makes it seem like they’re not paying attention to the data they’re collecting. For instance, I hate it when I get an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/03/17/shopping-cart-abandonment">abandoned cart</a> email with a discount when I’ve already made that purchase without the 10% off code. And I’m not alone. So take the time to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing">personalize your interactions</a>, develop a relationship with your customers, and build that brand loyalty.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f44b.png" alt="👋" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong> For more ways to promote brand loyalty, </strong>check out our free guide on <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite30BestWaysToPromote.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Marketing_The30BestWaysToPromoteYourBusiness_Download">The 30 Best Ways to Promote Your Business (With or Without Money)</a>.</p>
<div id="ask-for-feedback-and-use-it"></div>
<h3>5. Ask for feedback and use it</h3>
<p>If you’re trying to build a relationship with your customers, you need to know how they feel. That means you need feedback.</p>
<p>Soliciting feedback can look different, depending on your goal and business structure. It might mean asking for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">customer reviews</a> about your service on Google or your website, sending an email with a short survey, or offering a gift card for a quick phone call to answer questions about using your app.</p>
<p>No matter where it comes from, when you ask for feedback, you need to take it seriously and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/24/customer-feedback">use it</a>. Responding thoughtfully, using it to consider changes to your product or marketing, and following up with the next steps or updates are important steps.</p>
<p>Remember, if someone took the time to let you know how their purchase made them feel—whether positive, negative, or disappointingly mid—they cared enough to do it. That’s a great place to start building loyalty.</p>
<div id="work-with-your-unhappy-customers"></div>
<h3>6. Work with your unhappy customers</h3>
<p>Unhappy customers who reach out frustrated with negative feedback about a purchase or leave a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-respond-to-negative-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative review</a> about a disappointing product aren’t appealing. But believe it or not, they do present an opportunity to build brand loyalty.</p>
<p>In marketer and entrepreneur Jay Baer’s <em>Hug Your Haters</em>, he explains how customers who reach out with a problem are emotionally invested in the interaction and the outcome. That gives you the opportunity to provide excellent customer service and solve the problem. And if you’re able to do that, you might find yourself with another loyal customer. As Baer explains, when you’re able to solve a customer’s problem, they are more likely to remain loyal and spend more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/brand-loyalty-wordstream-Review.webp" alt="Brand loyalty - Review on Google." width="833" height="359" class="aligncenter wp-image-86146 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/brand-loyalty-wordstream-Review.webp 833w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/brand-loyalty-wordstream-Review-480x207.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 833px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you find yourself in the unfortunate-but-common position of dealing with a frustrated customer, lean into it.</p>
<div id="develop-your-online-presence"></div>
<h3>7. Develop your online presence</h3>
<p>A well-established online presence ensures that customers can easily find and interact with your brand wherever they’re online. That includes your website, social media, review forums, or elsewhere. Being readily accessible encourages your customers to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/27/how-to-increase-instagram-engagement">engage more frequently</a>, which also encourages them to keep coming back to your business.</p>
<p>Plus, this consistent, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/23/how-brand-your-business">cohesive branding</a> across your online presence helps ensure your customers recognize your brand easily. If you’re trying to foster brand loyalty, try <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/17/increase-online-presence">increasing your online presence</a> first.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/brand-loyalty-wordstream-amazon-logo.webp" alt="Brand loyalty - Amazon logo." width="878" height="503" class="aligncenter wp-image-86147 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/brand-loyalty-wordstream-amazon-logo.webp 878w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/brand-loyalty-wordstream-amazon-logo-480x275.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 878px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A partial logo that’s immediately recognizable? That level of </em><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness"><em>brand awareness</em></a><em> is the goal.</em></p>
<div id="engage-on-social-media"></div>
<h3>8. Engage on social media</h3>
<p>Your presence on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/01/09/social-media-marketing-strategies">social media</a> is particularly important. According to Sprout Social’s research, <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/social-media-connection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">65%</a> of consumers feel more connected to brands that have a robust presence on social media. And social media offers more opportunities for direct engagement.</p>
<p>When customers talk about your product on<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/23/tiktok-marketing"> TikTok</a>, comment on your brand’s Instagram grid posts, or even tag you in their<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/05/linkedin-advertising"> LinkedIn</a> updates, you should respond. Take the time to write comments, send DMs thanking them for their business and praise, and even re-share their content with your audience. This goodwill can go a long way.</p>
<div id="get-involved-with-your-community"></div>
<h3>9. Get involved with your community</h3>
<p>Getting involved with your community is an excellent way to deepen your brand identity and strengthen your relationship with your existing customers. Look into organizations in your area. Start with your local chamber of commerce, then look for community business organizations, whether they’re targeted toward small business owners, young professionals, or something else.</p>
<p>For instance, Concord, NH, has a non-profit organization called <a href="https://intownconcord.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In Town Concord</a> that organizes events with local businesses.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/brand-loyalty-wordstream-petals-pedals.webp" alt="Brand loyalty - Community event schedule from a local business." width="845" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-86148 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/brand-loyalty-wordstream-petals-pedals.webp 845w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/brand-loyalty-wordstream-petals-pedals-480x341.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 845px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>That’s a lot of local businesses for one small town.</em></p>
<p>If these organizations don’t exist, or your following is less IRL and more online, consider <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/26/partner-marketing">partnering with other businesses</a> to co-host events or launch specific product collaborations. This is another great way to tap into the community to build brand loyalty.</p>
<div id="launch-a-loyalty-program"></div>
<h3>10. Launch a loyalty program</h3>
<p>To encourage <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-find-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new customers</a> to keep coming back to make more purchases, incentivize them with a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/18/loyalty-marketing">loyalty program</a>. This could take a few different shapes, depending on your business. Your loyalty program could be a discounted bundle for recurring services, a tiered system of offerings based on cumulative purchases, or a points-based system accrued on transactions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/brand-loyalty-wordstream-insider-benefits.webp" alt="Brand loyalty - List of benefits of a brand's loyalty program." width="607" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-86149 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/brand-loyalty-wordstream-insider-benefits.webp 607w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/brand-loyalty-wordstream-insider-benefits-480x474.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 607px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Sephora’s Beauty Insider loyalty program is tiered with points that unlock discounts, sale access, free samples, and more.</em></p>
<p>And if these don’t seem to work for your setup, that’s fine. Your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/loyalty-program-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unique loyalty program</a> could even be a physical punch card to keep your customers coming back in until they fill it out.</p>
<div id="try-a-referral-program"></div>
<h3>11. Try a referral program</h3>
<p>A<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/14/referral-program-ideas"> referral program</a> not only turns good customers into your best salespeople; it also endears them to your brand.</p>
<p>Here’s a personal example. Two friends and I talked about my recent switch to Blueland laundry tablets. They were both considering a similar swap. I shared a lot of information about my laundry habits, like my preference for cold water, my stacked washing machine, and my preference for only washing full loads.</p>
<p>Here’s the interesting part. While I enthusiastically explained how well the product worked for my use case, I was strengthening my own affinity for the Blueland laundry tablets.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the best way to be sold is also to sell. A referral program emboldens your biggest advocates—your repeat customers—to encourage their friends or business contacts to do business with you. That’s next-level loyalty to your brand.</p>
<div id="stick-to-your-brand-values"></div>
<h3>12. Stick to your brand values</h3>
<p>Associating your brand with a specific set of values is a great way to develop strong relationships with like-minded buyers. But it’s important to show commitment to all those values so you don’t chase off your most loyal customers.</p>
<p>Say you promote your products as sustainable and beneficial for the environment. Then, you choose to replace your fully recyclable packaging with a plastic that has to end up in landfills. You’ll break a brand promise and sour your best customer relationships.</p>
<h2>Build brand loyalty to grow your business</h2>
<p>Brand loyalty may not feel as important to growth as generating the next new lead. But when you compare the impact of one customer purchasing ten times versus a one-and-done new customer, the value of a brand-loyalty focus becomes clear.</p>
<p>Use the tips we’ve curated here as a starting point. Test a few to see which ones fit your business and which generate the best response from your customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Search engines are still the best channel for generating long-term, evergreen traffic. But Google’s been messy lately. AI Overviews and recent core updates are making the search engine a less reliable option for marketers.</p>
<p>If you want to mitigate the effects of wild search engine swings, you need to diversify your traffic sources.</p>
<p>That’s an excellent notion, but how do you <em>do</em> it?</p>
<p>I asked some very successful marketers for help. They shared tactics that deliver thousands of qualified visitors without paid ads or reliance on Google.</p>

<div id="Why-should-you-diversify-your-organic-traffic-sources"></div>
<h2>Why should you diversify your traffic sources?</h2>
<p>I firmly believe that knowing why you do something helps inform how you’ll do it. The marketers I spoke with shared why they invest in multiple sources of organic traffic. Their reasoning sets a nice foundation for building the strategy.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>We’re just getting started!</strong> Download the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/increase-traffic-to-your-website?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website</a> for even more ideas.</p>
<h3>Mitigate traffic fluctuations</h3>
<p>Few financial advisers will suggest putting all your money in one asset—even if it’s offering the biggest return. You’ll be too exposed when the value fluctuates.</p>
<p>The same goes for where you invest in marketing. Sure, Google delivers the most <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/03/organic-traffic#:~:text=Typically%2C%20when%20we%20talk%20about,notably%2C%20Google%20and%20Bing).">organic traffic</a> by far. But we’ve recently seen small websites and big publishers <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240524-how-googles-new-algorithm-will-shape-your-internet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lose huge chunks</a> of their traffic from Google overnight.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-bbc.webp" alt="How to get organic traffic - chart showing traffic decline for several websites." width="892" height="541" class="aligncenter wp-image-83501 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-bbc.webp 892w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-bbc-480x291.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 892px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A few small websites became examples of how Google updates can kill traffic overnight, as shown in this graph of Semrush data presented by the </em><a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240524-how-googles-new-algorithm-will-shape-your-internet" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>BBC</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>If you can rebalance your website traffic sources so, say, 40% of it comes from outside of Google, you’ll weather the dips far better.</p>
<h3>Faster feedback loop</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO</a> is like a giant cargo ship. It can deliver a lot, but it takes a long time to get up to speed and a long time to turn. You might spend months publishing dozens of articles before you know if your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/05/seo-strategy"> SEO strategy</a> is working or needs a new direction.</p>
<p>Other channels, like<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/12/is-email-marketing-effective"> email marketing</a> and social media, provide near-instant feedback. Is this topic relevant to your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience"> target audience</a>? Engagements on your social posts will tell you. Are your headlines hitting? Just look at your email click-through rates.</p>
<h3>Lets you become a thought leader</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-content-beginners-guide">SEO-focused content</a> helps you answer questions people already have. But what about things your audience doesn’t know to ask yet? You know, the ideas that let you lead thoughts instead of chasing them.</p>
<p>That’s where discovery channels like social media and<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/19/brand-community"> online communities</a> come in handy. You don’t have to wait for your audience to think up a question. You present them with content that solves problems they didn’t know were solvable. And you get first-mover advantage when those topics take off.</p>
<h3>It supports your search marketing strategy</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/search-engine-marketing">Search engine marketing</a> is changing, but it isn’t going away. The smart money is on marketers who efficiently leverage SEO <em>and </em><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-competitors">other organic traffic</a> sources.</p>
<p>Every idea on the list below will also help you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-algorithm-documents-leak">rank</a> on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-marketing-live-2024">Google</a>.

They can help solidify your topical expertise. And they can help own new search terms as they gain popularity.</p>

<h3>Tactic #1: Creatively distribute original data</h3>
<p>One of the best things about SEO content is that a single asset can generate organic traffic for a long time.<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brooklin-nash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Brooklin Nash</a>, Co-Founder of<a href="https://www.beamcontent.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Beam Content</a>, has a strategy to replicate that long-lasting success without relying on Google.</p>
<p>It starts with gathering fresh data no one else has. “We take original data—whether it’s survey data, platform data, or benchmark data—put it into a cohesive, extensive report, and follow up on it with several articles that dive deeper into different aspects of the report,” Brooklin explained.</p>
<p>But the real magic happens in the distribution. Brooklin and the Beam team use a networked distribution strategy to get the content in front of a lot of people without relying on search or spending on ads.</p>
<p>To illustrate the strategy, Brooklin shared a<a href="https://www.beamcontent.co/resources/closing-the-content-gap" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> recent report</a> the Beam team created for their own marketing. It’s based on seven interviews and a survey of 400-plus content marketers and other go-to-market professionals. The goal is to help close the communication gap between content creators and the larger marketing teams they work in, a relevant topic for Beam’s audience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-beam-report-copy.webp" alt="How to get organic traffic - Screenshot from Beam's report." width="524" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-83502 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-beam-report-copy.webp 524w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-beam-report-copy-480x550.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 524px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Beam left </em><a href="https://www.beamcontent.co/resources/closing-the-content-gap" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>its report</em></a><em> ungated so it could drive organic traffic more effectively.</em></p>
<p>A survey-based report is great, but it’s not novel. What Beam did differently was to start the distribution process long before completing the report.</p>
<p>“Sam, our creative lead, put together a takeover doc for the team and for the people we interviewed,” Brooklin says. It included a little competition, where the person with the most engagement on their social posts got a prize.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-beam-report.webp" alt="How to get organic traffic - Beam's social takeover sheet." width="897" height="563" class="aligncenter wp-image-83503 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-beam-report.webp 897w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-beam-report-480x301.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 897px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Beam gave its internal team and interview sources instructions to facilitate sharing the new report.</em></p>
<p>They also sent a simplified request to the survey respondents, asking them to share it if they found the report insightful.</p>
<p>“Over the course of a few days, we had several posts going out, so it was in a lot of peoples’ feeds,” he said. “We got quite a few organic shares as a result of that.”</p>
<p>Brooklin says they drove 2,500 organic views in just a few days, which, he noted, is significant for their size, especially without spending anything on distribution.</p>
<p>There are a few ways Beam will keep the traffic flowing. They’ve planned a few follow-up articles of their own. They’ve also accepted a pitch from an outside industry expert who’ll write a post, add their commentary, and expose it to the expert’s network.</p>
<p>“We launched in April, but this should support follow-up content through the end of the year,” Brooklin noted. “And none of it is on search.”</p>
<h4>How to use this strategy for your business</h4>
<p>This strategy is accessible to just about any marketing team—Brooklin says they’ve used it for clients in a variety of industries.</p>
<p>For example, a physical therapy office could <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/10/best-online-survey-tools">survey</a> local runners on their favorite routes, recovery snacks, and cross-training activities, then ask them to share the findings in their feeds.</p>
<p>The three keys to success, according to Brooklin, are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make the content good and engaging:</strong> He admits this sounds obvious, but it’s critical. Find an angle that resonates with your audience and surface unique insights you can’t find elsewhere.</li>
<li><strong>Involve people throughout the process:</strong> Set the expectation that your internal team and those who provide the data will distribute the content, then give them tools and incentives to do so.</li>
<li><strong>Take the long view:</strong> Maximize the impact by publishing follow-up content created internally and through external experts.</li>
</ul>
<div id="Tactic-two-Use-YouTube-SEO"></div>
<h3>Tactic #2: Use YouTube SEO</h3>
<p>Let’s say you’ve spent years honing your ability to get content on the top of search results. What do you do with all that SEO knowledge besides spending it on Google? If you’re<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/devin-pickell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Devin Pickell</a>, Founder at<a href="https://www.doineedseo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Do I Need SEO</a>, you apply it to YouTube.</p>
<p>“I’m always devising new ideas to drive traffic for my clients, especially since<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/05/generative-ai-in-digital-marketing"> generative AI</a> has most of us marketers and business leaders scratching our heads,” Devin says. “One way I’ve thought outside the box is how can I take my knowledge of YouTube SEO to not only scale channel views but also be a referral traffic driver to the site?”</p>
<p>Devin points to one instance where a client in the business communications sector—not your typical YouTuber—drove thousands of engaged visitors back to their site through the video-sharing platform. And like Brooklin, he says the strategy starts with the right content.</p>
<p>“A lot of the content in the business comms sector is very boring, lengthy, and technical,” he says. “We sought to make our content more snappy, more fun and digestible, and more educational.”</p>
<p>Devin couldn’t share the specific company from this example (which is common for agencies and fractional marketers). But if you check out<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dollar_bank" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Dollar Bank’s YouTube channel</a>, you’ll get an idea of how to publish interesting videos when you work in an industry that isn’t known for creativity.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-dollar-bank-1.webp" alt="How to get organic traffic - Dollar Bank's YouTube page." width="869" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-83504 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-dollar-bank-1.webp 869w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-dollar-bank-1-480x331.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 869px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dollar_bank" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Dollar Bank’s YouTube feed</em></a><em> is filled with a variety of helpful, educational, and accessible videos.</em></p>
<p>Devin added that the next step was to set a consistent video publishing schedule “to satisfy YouTube’s preference for consistency and keep viewers engaged.”<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/15/youtube-algorithm"> YouTube&#8217;s algorithm</a> looks for topical authority when ranking content, so having a feed full of related videos is a solid move.</p>
<p>“Now came time to master YouTube SEO to get the most visibility on our channel and start driving viewers to the site,” Devin explained. This included a list of<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/10/youtube-seo-tips"> YouTube SEO</a> fundamentals like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Title testing</li>
<li>Creating in-depth,<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/14/youtube-keyword-research"> keyword-rich</a> video descriptions</li>
<li>Adding tags and timestamps</li>
<li>Including<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/09/06/sitelink-extensions-dos-and-donts#:~:text=Sitelinks%20are%20the%20king%20of,to%20say%20just%20about%20anything."> sitelinks</a></li>
<li>Embedding videos in blog posts</li>
</ul>
<p>Devin also “tinkered” with<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/07/youtube-thumbnail"> thumbnails</a> and found styles that led to higher clicks in YouTube results.</p>
<p>While the brand’s YouTube channel was already doing well because of its differentiated content, it really took off after getting the SEO treatment. “[Optimization] was a recipe for success,” Devin says. “YouTube rewarded the channel with record monthly views in May 2024, and it’s still climbing.”</p>
<h4>How to use this strategy for your business</h4>
<p>First off, don’t stress big production budgets. Sure, get a professional videography crew if you can swing it. But check out how this<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F_8qaQ3DD0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> animal shelter</a> racked up over 7 million views with a funny take on over-the-top local ads.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-furkids.webp" alt="How to get organic traffic - screenshot of a YouTube video from an animal shelter." width="906" height="589" class="aligncenter wp-image-83505 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-furkids.webp 906w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-furkids-480x312.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 906px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This</em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F_8qaQ3DD0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <em>animal shelter proved</em></a><em> you can get millions of views with a simple video concept.</em></p>
<p>Devin says the three actions that lead to generating views and traffic on YouTube are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Post regularly and at the right time.</li>
<li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Put those SEO skills to work.</li>
<li><strong>Engagement:</strong> Don’t forget to read and react to viewer comments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Devin noted that the one thing generating non-paid traffic from YouTube and getting it from Google have in common is that you have to stick with it.</p>
<p>“I highly recommend brands, even B2B brands, start taking YouTube more seriously in their content strategies,” he says. “You’ve played the long game with your blog; it’s time to give the video its due diligence.”</p>
<div id="Tactic-three-Be-helpful-in-online-communities"></div>
<h3>Tactic #3: Be helpful in online communities</h3>
<p>One of the core content commandments is to provide value first and sell later. While it’s nice when you can publish a helpful post that people search for on Google, it can be more impactful to actively provide support in places where your ideal customer gathers.</p>
<p>That’s why<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?fetchDeterministicClustersOnly=true&amp;heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAYSHlUBrrpDb3ZLrORPq_LvxEtsWNfdWC4&amp;keywords=rease%20rios&amp;origin=RICH_QUERY_SUGGESTION&amp;position=0&amp;searchId=3d439481-e931-4c5d-ba10-d11c94810b7d&amp;sid=A8b&amp;spellCorrectionEnabled=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Rease Rios</a>, Director of Content at<a href="http://qase.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Qase</a>, is bullish on online communities. “At Qase, we supplement our organic traffic from Google with various efforts across forums and Github.”</p>
<p>For non-developers (<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f44b.png" alt="👋" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />), GitHub is a public repository that lets developers store, work on, and track the code they’re building. It also acts like an online community of sorts, where technical businesses that sell to developer teams can offer value in the form of code and documentation.</p>
<p>Rease shared a wonderful and unexpected way Qase leads with value while earning organic traffic.</p>
<p>“One of our Developer Advocates runs a project called Shelterpaws that involves him mentoring junior QAs and developers as they build websites for animal shelters around the world,” she told us. “All of that work is managed on Qase&#8217;s public Github so that anyone can discover it and help shelters on their own.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-shelterpaws.webp" alt="How to get organic traffic - Shelterpaws write up on Qase blog." width="673" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-83506 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-shelterpaws.webp 673w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-shelterpaws-480x428.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 673px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Qase supports </em><a href="https://qase.io/blog/shelterpaws-introduction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Shelterpaws</em></a><em>, a project to create websites for animal shelters.</em></p>
<p>While developers dip in and out of the GitHub project, they become more familiar with Qase. Rease works with the organizer to share helpful resources on Qase’s GitHub, which builds a community and drives additional organic traffic.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-qase-github.webp" alt="How to get organic traffic - Qase's GitHub." width="856" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-83508 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-qase-github.webp 856w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-qase-github-480x336.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 856px, 100vw" /></p>

<h4>How to use this strategy for your business</h4>
<p>While you may not be writing code to share on GitHub anytime soon, you can still copy this page of Rease’s organic traffic playbook. There are loads of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/drive-traffic-from-reddit">online communities</a> to engage with, from big forums like<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/24/reddit-advertising"> Reddit</a> to niche discussion boards.</p>
<p>Here are a few steps that’ll help you drive more traffic from online communities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Find your forum:</strong> Search online and ask your customers to learn where they gather online.</li>
<li><strong>Lead with value:</strong> Go in with an honest desire to help first and build relationships, then only offer your solutions when appropriate.</li>
<li><strong>Be creative:</strong> You wouldn’t think a company that sells test management software would be involved with small animal shelters, but by thinking outside of the box, Qase built a marketing pipeline that makes it less reliant on Google for traffic.</li>
</ul>
<div id="Tactic-four-Build-a-newsletter-for-email-and-social"></div>
<h3>Tactic #4: Build a newsletter for email and social</h3>
<p>The biggest problem with relying too heavily on Google for traffic is that it owns the platform. One rule change can close the tap of website visitors.<a href="https://www.ajdinperco.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Ajdin Perco</a>, Head of Content at<a href="http://animalz.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Animalz</a>, sees newsletters as the solution.</p>
<p>“We work with a VC investor who&#8217;s been writing a weekly newsletter for over six years, totally by himself,” Ajdin told us. “He’s built up a large audience on both social and email.”</p>
<p>Unpack that short statement, and you’ll find three important lessons about generating organic traffic. First, if you’re going to create assets for one channel, like a newsletter, it’s wise to use it as a traffic driver from another channel, like social media. We can&#8217;t share the name of Ajdin&#8217;s VC investor, but this is an example of how a newsletter LinkedIn post would look.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-newsletter.webp" alt="How to get organic traffic - LinkedIn post with a Newsletter linked in it." width="425" height="586" class="aligncenter wp-image-83509 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-newsletter.webp 425w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-newsletter-218x300.webp 218w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Newsletters can be an organic traffic magnet when you share them on social media.</em></p>
<p>Second, a single person without extensive marketing knowledge can tackle this tactic. Ajdin said the investor “gets thousands of organic visits every month” from the newsletter he writes himself.</p>
<p>Third, Ajdin said that he’s learned the importance of persistence from this example. Building your newsletter audience will take time, but just like SEO, once the ship sets sail, it’ll keep building steam.</p>
<h4>How to use this strategy for your business</h4>
<p>This is probably the most accessible tactic on the list. Many email automation tools are available to help you get started, and there is a nearly endless list of<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/25/email-newsletter-ideas"> newsletter ideas</a>.</p>
<p>To start building a newsletter pipeline that consistently brings new visits to your website:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cross-promote:</strong> Share links to your newsletter subscription page in blog posts, on social media, and even in your email signature.</li>
<li><strong>Write from your expertise: </strong>It’ll be much easier and more authentic to share your own knowledge, successes, failures, and experiences (like, what challenges did you overcome this week?).</li>
<li><strong>Include a compelling</strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action"> <strong>call to action</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The goal is to get people to click from the newsletter to your website, so give them clear instructions and motivation to do so.</li>
</ul>
<div id="Tactic-five-Create-content-teasers-on-social-media"></div>
<h3>Tactic #5: Create content teasers on social media</h3>
<p>We’ve seen a few ways to get traffic from social media on this list. This tactic from<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abbiemood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Abbie Mood</a>, the Marketing Director at<a href="https://www.velocityadvisorygroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Velocity Advisory Group</a>, is brilliant in its simplicity. She creates teasers for social media posts that give away a bit of the value of her most important content assets. “I usually use this for gated content on the website, but it’s been effective for non-gated content, too,” Abbie said.</p>
<p>According to Abbie, the trick is designing the social post so it resonates with your specific audience. Here’s a<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7194335372007387138/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> LinkedIn teaser</a> she used to promote a recent case study for a group of business leaders.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-Velocity-four.webp" alt="How to get organic traffic - LinkedIn post from Velocity Advisory Group." width="437" height="583" class="aligncenter wp-image-83528 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-Velocity-four.webp 437w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-Velocity-four-225x300.webp 225w" sizes="(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Abbie Mood shows off the value of her content on social media with teaser posts.</em></p>
<p>“I create a colorful visual that gives a couple of the stats and/or shares the challenge and results, but viewers have to click and go to the website to read the full case study and find out how that client got those results.”</p>
<h4>How to use this strategy for your business</h4>
<p>Abbie’s example shows that this strategy requires creating something that stands out on a busy social feed. But with that effort comes traffic.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips that’ll help make the most of your content teaser posts:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Find the right platform: </b>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms#:~:text=The%20most%20popular%20social%20media%20platforms%20in%202024,-We%20compared%20Statista%27s&amp;text=The%20top%20four%20most%20popular,YouTube%2C%20WhatsApp%2C%20and%20Instagram.">most popular social media platform</a> isn’t right for every business, so choose the one your target customers spend time on and which has features that let your content shine.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t be basic:</strong> A few words of copy and a link won’t stop scrollers, so add some visuals and a hook that makes people willing to click for more.</li>
<li><strong>Test for a variety of content:</strong> For Abbie, teasers work like a charm for case studies, but you might find it better for your original research or expert round-up posts (yes, that’s an Easter egg for the next tactic).</li>
</ul>
<div id="Tactic-six-Include-industry-experts-in-your-content"></div>
<h3>Tactic #6: Include industry experts in your content</h3>
<p>According to the tenets of Google’s<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/14/google-e-e-a-t"> E-E-A-T</a> quality content guidelines, including first-person experiences and expert accounts in your content can help it rank. But you’ll also bake a powerful organic distribution strategy into the post when you involve pros from your industry.</p>
<p>At WordStream, we call these our expert-led posts (like in the one you’re reading, for example). They reliably generate thousands of organic visits, mostly from non-Google channels.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-expert-led-post.webp" alt="How to get organic traffic - WordStream post." width="426" height="587" class="aligncenter wp-image-83512 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-expert-led-post.webp 426w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-expert-led-post-218x300.webp 218w" sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Including expert voices in our content makes it more interesting and creates an automatic distribution network.</em></p>
<p>Each post features several industry experts who have experience with the post’s topic. We quote them, link to whichever websites or accounts they like, and ask them to share the post in whatever way makes sense.</p>
<p>Once the article is published, we link to it in our regular newsletter and on social media posts. We tag the expert and, if applicable, the business they own or work for. That doubles the repost opportunities.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-linkedin-post.webp" alt="How to get organic traffic - LinkedIn post sharing the WordStream content." width="581" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-83511 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-linkedin-post.webp 581w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Non-google-organic-traffic-wordstream-linkedin-post-480x496.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 581px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>LinkedIn is a great channel for getting reposts of your expert-led content.</em></p>
<p>Many marketing pros we include come from our personal networks. But we also reach out to people we’ve seen post on LinkedIn because we know they have a following and are familiar with the topic.</p>
<p>We completed three of these posts as an initial test. Collectively, they generated over 19,000 organic pageviews. Even better, more than 70% of that traffic came from sources outside of Google.</p>
<p>It takes much longer to produce and promote an expert-led post, so we repost it a couple of times on social channels to squeeze as much value as possible from it.</p>
<p>We also recycle the experts’ quotes. For example, we may reference a quote from the lead generation post in a future search-optimized guide about lead generation. It’s a nice and easy way to add authority to SEO content.</p>
<h4>How to use this strategy for your business</h4>
<p>You can swipe this strategy if you have experts in your industry, especially if they’re active on social media.</p>
<p>Since the experts are at the heart of this strategy, I’d like to share a few tips I’ve found helpful when working with them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Respect their time:</strong> Make your request simple and let them respond however they like (we’ve had LinkedIn messages, emails, Slack notes, Loom videos, and Zoom/Teams calls).</li>
<li><strong>Give something in return:</strong> They’re establishing themselves as thought leaders, too, so offer backlinks, call-outs on social, or any other way you can give them exposure.</li>
<li><strong>Ask for an example:</strong> I love examples in content, so I ask sources to share one they were involved in or seen in the wild.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Diversify your traffic sources beyond Google</h2>
<p>In sales, a single-threaded account is one where you only have one point of contact at the prospect’s company. It’s considered a precarious deal because you won&#8217;t close the sale if that point of contact leaves, gets cold feed, or gets outvoted.</p>
<p>If Google is your single thread for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-referral-traffic">website traffic</a>, your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/01/content-marketing-funnel">marketing funnel</a> is equally at risk. A single algorithm change or expansion of its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/07/agency-profitability-metrics">AI Overviews</a> can disrupt the flow of visitors to your site.</p>
<p>The experts we spoke to in this post have fortified their top-of-the-funnel traffic flow, buffeting their businesses from the whims and whirlwinds of search engine algorithms. Give their tactics a try, track what works, and double down on the winners. Then, the next time other marketers scramble to recover from a core update, you can turn up the heat on a few other channels and hardly miss a beat.</p>

<p>In this guide, we’ll help you address common marketing speedbumps multi-location businesses encounter and share 10 of the most effective franchise marketing strategies.</p>

<h2>What is franchise marketing?</h2>
<p>Franchise marketing means promoting your business across all your franchised locations. Essentially, any effort you’re putting into growing your franchise is considered franchise marketing. This can mean marketing efforts at a top branding level all the way down to marketing for specific locations.</p>
<div id="why-is-franchise-marketing-important"></div>
<h2>Benefits of franchise marketing</h2>
<p>Here are a few reasons franchise marketing is so important:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new franchise location opens every <a href="https://appsthatdeliver.com/insights/franchise-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight minutes</a> during the course of any given business day. This doesn&#8217;t even account for the new businesses opened every day.</li>
<li><a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/guides/franchise-marketing-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">42%</a> of franchise marketing professionals and multi-location business owners feel traditional marketing channels, like TV placements and PR, are no longer worth the investment.</li>
<li><a href="https://thriveagency.com/news/franchise-marketing-statistics-you-should-know-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55%</a> of multi-location businesses believe that social media is the leading franchise marketing channel they rely on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly, there is plenty of competition and opportunity within the franchise and multi-location industries, meaning franchise marketing is crucial to stand out and grow.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbeagelman/2019/08/28/successfully-marketing-your-franchise-opportunity/?sh=428d0ac21608" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keeping up with your franchise marketing</a> is easier said than done. Let’s resolve some franchise marketing pain points next.</p>
<div id="franchise-marketing-strategies"></div>
<h2>10 franchise marketing strategies</h2>
<p>Managing your franchise marketing can be a juggling act. As the classic saying goes “No pain, no gain!” Let’s dive right into how you can turn 10 major franchise <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-pain-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing pains</a> into marketing gains:</p>
<h3>1. Maintain brand consistency throughout your franchise marketing</h3>
<p>It’s no secret that one of the biggest challenges franchise marketers face is location managers or franchisees that go rogue—especially when it comes to branding and brand consistency. But until a teleportation or cloning device gets invented, you’re unfortunately unable to be at all your locations to guide them through their marketing (despite how much you wish you could). This makes <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/brand-consistency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maintaining brand consistency</a> across all locations a difficult task.</p>
<p>But brand consistency is extremely important for the success of your franchise marketing. We know that <a href="https://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/71-of-consumers-more-likely-to-buy-a-product-or-service-from-a-name-they-recognise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">71%</a> of consumers say they’re more likely to buy a product or service from a brand they recognize. Plus, we can’t forget about the age-old marketing “rule of seven” which states that people need to see information about a business at least <a href="https://www.b2bmarketing.net/en/resources/blog/marketing-rule-7-and-why-its-still-relevant-b2b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven times</a> before they become a customer.</p>
<p>So brand consistency isn’t just a “nice-to-have&#8221; element in your franchise marketing plan, it’s a need-to-have!</p>
<p><strong>How to approach it: </strong>The first thing you should do is <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/10/content-style-guide" rel="noopener">create a brand style guide</a>. Once you have your style guide in place, you can use it across all locations. If you already have one in place, now is the time to revisit! The more thorough your brand guidelines the better.</p>
<p>Here’s our list of what should go into your brand guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Company <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-logo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">logo</a> in various sizes and color options (black and white, thumbnail size, banner size etc.)</li>
<li>Your business’s colors in hex codes</li>
<li>Your selected fonts in regular, bold, and italics</li>
<li>Your chosen grammar, mechanics, and style preferences (including punctuation, capitalization, and abbreviation)</li>
<li>Blog post title preferences</li>
<li>Image styles and sizes for digital and print materials</li>
<li>Your business’s boilerplate and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/02/how-to-write-a-business-mission-statement" rel="noopener">mission statement</a></li>
<li>Preferred tone and voice</li>
<li>Social media best practices by platform</li>
</ul>

<p>Brand guidelines will keep your brand consistent and empower your location owners to create their own marketing collateral while knowing they have a cheat sheet to help them along the way.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4da.png" alt="📚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite12SecretsToHigherCTR.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_PPC_HigherCTR_Download">12 Secrets to a Higher Click-Through Rate (&amp; Lower Costs!)</a></p>
<h3>2. Identify your customer base across locations</h3>
<p>Let’s face it—your local customers’ interests at your Boston location will be different from those in your Houston location which differs from those in your San Diego location, and so on!</p>
<p>If you generalize your target audience without consideration for how their lifestyles differ by location, not only does that lack of inclusivity limit your reach, but it also gives your customers a less <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing" rel="noopener">personalized marketing experience</a>.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/data-personalize-marketing-li" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80%</a> of consumers are more likely to make a purchase when brands offer personalized experiences. So identifying your target audience across locations <em>now </em>to deliver a personalized experience at each location <em>later</em> is a marketing tactic you won’t want to miss out on.</p>
<p><strong>How to approach it:  </strong>Taking time to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience" rel="noopener">identify your target audience</a> across all locations when your plate is already full is easier said than done. A more efficient way to execute this is to look at your target audience from a bird’s eye view and zoom in from there.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/identifying-your-target-audience.webp" alt="questions to ask to find your target audience" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77202" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/identifying-your-target-audience.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/identifying-your-target-audience-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Once you identify what makes up your target audience at a high level you can take it down to the regional level. From there, you can use free online tools like <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Trends</a> to understand the interest of topics by location to see how your messaging may slightly differ between regions.</p>
<p>Another workaround would be to create marketing collateral that’s diverse enough to speak to all customers regardless of lifestyle. A healthy mix of both, however, will give your customers that localized experience while saving you as much time and resources as possible.</p>
<h3>3. Know your solution options (+ which ones your brand needs)</h3>
<p>There’s an infinite amount of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples" rel="noopener">value your franchise has to offer</a> its customers. Add that on top of your many convenient locations, a diverse range of employees, and audience segments, you’ll find it can be challenging to know how to deliver all this information to your potential customers in the best way.</p>
<p>With so many potential <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/06/18/marketing-channels" rel="noopener">marketing channels</a> to choose from, how do you know which strategies will be most effective? And how can you communicate your chosen strategies’ effectiveness to your franchise managers?</p>
<p><strong>How to approach it:</strong> We’ve broken down the top marketing channels for franchise businesses into a few core pillars. Introduce your franchisees to the following and encourage them to try it for their own benefit:</p>
<p><strong>Search engine optimization</strong></p>
<p>SEO is at the core of any strong marketing plan for good reason—it’s free! Not only do clicks from organic search results come at no cost to you, but with <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/search-visibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90%</a> of consumers searching online before making a purchase digitally or in-store, SEO can help each of your locations grow sales faster.</p>
<p><strong>Search advertising</strong></p>
<p>With search advertising, there are now more options than ever for dynamic location targeting at the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/03/14/ppc-ad-copywriting" rel="noopener">ad copy</a> and campaign setting level, so your chances of pulling in a click from a select location’s local customer is nearly guaranteed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/localized-google-ads-assets.jpg" alt="how to localize google ads - example of a location asset" width="751" height="255" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81858" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/localized-google-ads-assets.jpg 751w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/localized-google-ads-assets-480x163.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 751px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An example of a search ad for a local Ford dealership.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/search-advertising" rel="noopener">Search advertising</a> ensures you’re showing to potential customers when it matters—as they’re searching on top search engines like Google and Bing. Plus, <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/ppc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paid search ads</a> can increase brand awareness by up to <a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/ppc-stats/#gref" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80%</a>. If you have a location that’s struggling to pull in new customers, paid search ads are the best route for making it known to potential customers that you’re in their area with lots to offer.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Worried you&#8217;re wasting spend in Google Ads?

<p><strong>Video/OTT</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/video-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Video marketing</a> on YouTube or via OTT (over-the-top) streaming allows your franchise or multi-location business to create engaging content for exclusively targeted audiences. Even though you may be juggling various locations and customer bases, you can segment your video marketing in hyper-specific ways to ensure each location gets a piece of the pie.</p>
<p>Plus, video marketing can grow revenue nearly <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/video-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50%</a> faster and pull in 66% more qualified leads per year than businesses that don’t use video.</p>
<p><strong>Display</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-display-advertising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Display ads</a> give you a way to target your audience on sites across the web—when they’re not even actively searching for your business. This increases awareness for your brand. If your branch managers notice a dip in sales, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/benefits-of-display-advertising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">display ads</a> could be the solution since consumers who are retargeted via display ads are <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/horrifying-display-advertising-stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70%</a> more likely to convert.</p>
<p><strong>Social</strong></p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/social-media-marketing-statistics/#gref" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3.5</a> billion active social media users worldwide, it’s no secret that social media marketing is a must if you want to heighten your chances of reaching all the potential customers around each of your locations.</p>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/best-social-media-marketing-strategies-for-smb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The beauty of social media marketing</a> is that you can get results regardless of whether you decide to go the free or paid route. So if you’re struggling to get all your franchisees on board with one marketing strategy, social media marketing is an accommodating solution with endless options that can fit any locations’ budget (or lack thereof).</p>
<p>Of course, there are additional marketing channels you should consider as part of your strategy. Take a look at all the <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/local-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basics of local marketing</a> to find out what would work for you.</p>
<h3>4. Get all locations on board with the right strategy</h3>
<p>Speaking of budgets, with multiple franchises, it can be tough to get them on the same page with the marketing spend and strategy that you encourage. Each location has its own needs and budget which you want to accommodate within your recommended <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-create-a-small-business-marketing-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing plan</a>.</p>
<p>It gets trickier when you want to save yourself time by creating an easily transferrable franchise marketing strategy that can apply store to store but also is flexible enough to not have one set budget applied.</p>
<p><strong>How to approach it: </strong>The first thing you’ll want to look at is all the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-increase-sales-for-your-business-on-a-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free and low-cost marketing options</a> available. Small businesses have been doing this for years, but for a larger enterprise, this feels counterintuitive. However, the kicker of franchise marketing is it’s the same concept as local marketing—just multiplied.</p>
<p>When you present your location owners with low-cost or free options, they’ll have no reason to not want to implement them. Some examples could be setting them up with a social media account for regular posts or facilitating online workshops to foster their SEO expertise.</p>
<p>With that said, we know that a mix of marketing channels maximizes your chances of results. Ideally, you’ll want your location managers to get on board with allocating some of their revenue toward<a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/local-marketing/#section5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a marketing budget</a>. The best way to encourage this is to research statistics to display the ROI if they were to go for it and to provide co-op funds from corporate if possible. For example, paid advertising returns $2 for every $1 spent–a <a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/ppc-stats/#gref" target="_blank" rel="noopener">200%</a> ROI.</p>
<p>It’s helpful to keep in mind that marketing budgets don’t have to be huge. It doesn’t always take a lot of money to make a big impact, but a little can go a long way!</p>
<h3>5. Evaluate your options for franchise marketing execution</h3>
<p>While some franchises are fine with individual locations running their <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-strategies-for-small-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing strategies</a> themselves, others opt to streamline marketing from one central team or group for all locations.</p>
<p>Both options present their own sets of challenges. If you’re managing the marketing strategies for all locations, you have a big job—you must not only execute <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-multichannel-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a successful multi-channel marketing</a> strategy that includes optimizing campaigns, writing ad copy, and deploying offers, but you have to do that for different areas and audiences.</p>
<p>If you allow franchisees to run their marketing themselves, you have to worry about brand consistency, optimized spend, and a lack of control around results.</p>
<p><strong>How to approach it:</strong> It doesn’t have to feel like a lose-lose situation when you choose which route out of the two you want to take. As mentioned above, both managing marketing for your locations versus letting them manage it comes with pros and cons.</p>
<p>To identify what’s best for your brand, we recommend doing a self-evaluation with the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much extra time do I have to oversee my locations’ marketing strategies?</li>
<li>How much time do my location owners have to put into marketing?</li>
<li>Would implementing marketing at the location level require any training?</li>
<li>What types of marketing channels do I need to have running at each franchise location? Can each location handle those themselves?</li>
<li>Has my company struggled with brand consistency in the past?</li>
<li>How would I measure the success if I ran the marketing for all franchise locations? How would those locations measure and report on their own success?</li>
<li>How frequently would I expect to change up the marketing strategy?</li>
<li>Is it easy for me to consistently communicate with all of my locations?</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on your answers, you’ll end up leaning towards one over the other. However, if you’re still unsure then that’s totally fine! Another option would be to involve a marketing partner to help oversee your franchise marketing strategies along with you. That way you won’t have all the locations’ marketing on your shoulders, and you can leverage a resource that has every marketing tool needed at its fingertips.</p>
<p>Whatever you decide, finding the right tool to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-track-leads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">track your marketing</a> across locations and channels will be crucial for measuring success. (We&#8217;ll talk more about this in a minute!)<em></em></p>
<h3>6. Create a strong local SEO strategy</h3>
<p>You need to focus on SEO that is both national and local. National often comes naturally to many franchise businesses at this point, but without a <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong local SEO approach</a>, you won’t be able to show up for searches when and where it counts.</p>
<p><strong>How to approach it: </strong>The easiest way to complement your national SEO with a local SEO strategy is to include keywords related to your locations within your content—this can be easily done through location pages on your website. The next quick fix for <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/multi-location-seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-location SEO</a> is to invest in listings management so local listings are accurate for each location to help drive leads. It may seem minor, but <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/google-my-business-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">64%</a> of consumers have used <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/google-my-business-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Business</a> Profiles to find contact details for a local business.</p>
<p>Additionally, try to position your brand as a partner to each of your locations by creating local-friendly blog content. Brainstorm a blog topic that’s specific to each one of your locations, and you’ll save time on your editorial calendar planning while also staying consistent with local content!</p>
<p>You can also quickly research other local businesses to link to for resources within your content to build trust with your local audiences. That said, maintain a friendly presence in your local communities by encouraging location managers to participate in local events to trigger brand awareness for searches later.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/franchise-marketing-google-business-profile.webp" alt="example of franchise google local business profiles" width="591" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-82330" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/franchise-marketing-google-business-profile.webp 591w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/franchise-marketing-google-business-profile-480x487.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 591px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This multi-location business has Google Business Profile listings for each store location to fit local SEO needs. </em></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f50e.png" alt="🔎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Need help finding the right keywords for your local SEO strategy?</strong> Try our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">Free Keyword Tool</a>!</p>
<h3>7. Be sure to stand out from the competition (including your own franchisees!)</h3>
<p>Franchises have a unique competitor set in that while you compete with other local businesses and large brands, you might also compete with your own locations. For example, you might have two locations down the block from each other that own two completely different territories but could be competing for the same customers. One major hurdle every franchise must jump over is how to run marketing at each location without stepping on one another’s toes—all while stepping on the competition’s toes!</p>
<p><strong>How to approach it: </strong>We can’t stress enough how important geo-targeting is to your multi-location or franchise marketing. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/07/google-ads-geotargeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geo-targeting</a> is a way to ensure that one location’s marketing collateral doesn’t slip onto the screens of consumers in another location’s territory. When you run ad campaigns with geotargeting you&#8217;re maximizing the overall growth of your business by handing out a fair, even slice of the cake (or in this case, audience) to each store.</p>
<p>As for <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-make-your-business-stand-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standing out from the competition</a>, geotargeting can also help here if you want to identify and target their locations too.

<h3>8. Solidify reporting for all locations, solutions, AND channels</h3>
<p>Let’s get this straight: your business has multiple locations, offering multiple products or services, overseen by multiple managers, marketing to multiple different audiences, through multiple different channels. What a handful!</p>
<p>You don’t have time to loop in hundreds of data points into one performance tracking sheet. You need some way to ensure that all your franchise marketing efforts maintain a growth track with proven KPIs.</p>
<p><strong>How to approach it: </strong>For this instance, technology is your new best friend! Take advantage of <a href="https://localiq.com/reporting-analytics/client-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital tools that aggregate reporting</a> across platforms, locations, and more to report on what matters. A few things you should ask yourself while scouting a reporting solution include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you want your location managers to have access?</li>
<li>What performance metrics matter most to your multi-location business?</li>
<li>What does a positive performance look like for you at the national level? At the local level?</li>
<li>What channels need to be tracked? How will they be tracked consistently across locations?</li>
<li>What timeframes will you be looking to run reports on?</li>
<li>What types of downloadable or shareable files, if any, will you want for your reports?</li>
</ul>
<h3>9. Educate your franchisees on franchise marketing</h3>
<p>You and your franchisees are busy running a national brand at the local level—you all don’t have time for in-person pieces of training on all your marketing technology and best practices! Never mind the fact that gathering the resources to help location owners understand your brand’s marketing plan is a feat in and of itself.</p>
<p><strong>How to approach it:</strong> Have fun with it and get creative with your training! You can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/12/free-training-resources-for-agencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hold training online</a> after hours to make it easy for all your branch managers to attend.</p>
<p>Another way to make marketing education more accessible across locations is to create various training materials. For example, you can shoot or share quick “how-to” YouTube<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/26/how-to-do-a-webinar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> videos for visual learners</a>. For busy location owners short on time, you can write and email training articles that they can read in bits throughout the day.</p>
<p>The more training material, the better. If your schedule is so jam-packed you can’t even begin to think about running training or creating training materials, leveraging a marketing partner to facilitate training for you is another great option.</p>
<h3>10. Communicate with your marketing partners</h3>
<p>You may have one agency helping with social that has a totally different approach than your in-house team managing paid search. Or each location might be working with their own team or consultant. How do you keep multiple teams and marketing partners aligned?</p>
<p><strong>How to approach it: </strong>If you’re struggling to keep track of all your marketing solutions, then it may be worth it to find a marketing partner that can bundle all your needs into one. When you leverage a marketing partner that can house all your channels and reports under one roof it’s easier to maintain consistency and <a href="https://localiq.com/products/customer-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">performance tracking</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, though, communication is key! Be sure to hold regular meetings with your in-house team, your location managers, and your agencies to maintain consistent cohesion across channels.</p>
<p>This is also another opportunity to distribute your style guide to all marketing partners so that there’s no confusion across agencies, marketing associates, or consultants on what your brand’s voice is.</p>
