<h2>Google Merchant Center: What to know before you start</h2>
<p>Before we delve into the specifics of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/25/google-shopping-ads-priority-bidding-structure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optimizing your Google Merchant Center feed</a>, it&#8217;s important to understand at a high level the benefits of feed optimization. By improving your feed, you can enhance query matching, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/14/improve-google-ads-click-through-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase click-through rate (CTR)</a>, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/03/improve-conversion-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drive more conversions</a>.</p>
<p>Getting your products live is the first step in feed optimization. It means ensuring that your product feed meets all the requirements set by Google and that all your products are approved and visible in your Merchant Center account. To ensure your products go live <em>and stay live</em>, it&#8217;s crucial to follow <a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6149970?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Shopping guidelines</a>. This will prevent your products from being disapproved and, even worse, your account from being suspended.</p>
<p>The next step after ensuring that you follow Google’s policies is to ensure that your products are shown on the right queries. This involves optimizing your product titles, descriptions, and other attributes to ensure that they contain the right keywords and are relevant to the search queries that users are entering.</p>
<p>The final step for feed optimization involves maximizing the performance of your products. This means ensuring that your product images are high-quality and that your prices are competitive. You should also regularly review and update your product information to ensure that it remains accurate and up-to-date.</p>

<h2>10 Google Merchant Center mistakes to avoid</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s dive deeper into the details of Merchant Center health and feed optimization, taking a more granular approach.</p>
<h3>1. Using irrelevant or inaccurate product categories</h3>
<p>Product categories are critical for organizing your products and matching them to user queries. However, many merchants make the mistake of selecting inappropriate or inaccurate categories, which can confuse customers and hurt their visibility.</p>
<p>For example, if you sell a shirt, you should select &#8220;Apparel &amp; Accessories &gt; Clothing &gt; Shirts &amp; Tops&#8221; instead of &#8220;Home &amp; Garden &gt; Furniture &gt; Chairs.&#8221; You should also avoid using custom categories or creating duplicate categories, as they can create inconsistencies and confusion.</p>
<h3>2. De-optimized product titles</h3>
<p>Crafting titles with relevant keywords and essential information can significantly improve your product&#8217;s visibility and click-through rate. Titles play a critical role in matching search queries with relevant products. To optimize your titles, consider including details such as brand, gender, product type, and attributes (such as color and size) that align with your business goals, such as customer acquisition or brand awareness. By optimizing your titles, you can improve impressions and ranking, leading to better performance. It&#8217;s recommended to experiment with different strategies and choose the most rewarding one for your business.</p>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/search-visibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Improving the visibility of your brand</a> in your titles is very important to highlight in this section. If you notice a high search volume for your brand, consider adding it to the beginning of your title. On the other hand, if the search volume for your brand is low, you may want to remove it or add it to the end of the title. Experiment with different approaches and see what works best for your business.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-basic-naming-structure.webp" alt="google merchant center - product naming chart" width="719" height="355" class="aligncenter wp-image-83841 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-basic-naming-structure.webp 719w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-basic-naming-structure-480x237.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 719px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3><strong>3. Forgetting about your descriptions</strong></h3>
<p>To optimize the quality, triggering, ranking, and visibility of Shopping Ads, it&#8217;s important to provide adequate product information through rich descriptions. When your descriptions are both keyword-rich and meaningful to users, they are more likely to be displayed in search results during relevant queries.</p>
<p>To achieve this, I suggest submitting descriptions that are between 500 and 5000 characters in length. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that currently, the majority of items within the typical advertiser&#8217;s Google Merchant Center have descriptions that are less than 500 characters.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Using low-quality or mismatched images </strong></h3>
<p>Product images are essential for showcasing your products and attracting customers&#8217; attention. However, using low-quality or mismatched images can hurt your credibility, click-through rates, and conversions. To avoid this mistake, you should use<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-media-image-sizes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> high-resolution images</a> that accurately represent your products and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/14/website-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">match your website&#8217;s style</a> and branding. You should also use consistent image sizes and aspect ratios, and avoid adding watermarks, promotional text, or other distractions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-product-image-example.webp" alt="google merchant center - example product image" width="249" height="224" class="size-full wp-image-83843 aligncenter" /><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-product-image.webp" alt="google merchant center - example quality merchant center photo" width="257" height="225" class="size-full wp-image-83842 aligncenter" /></p>
<h3><strong>5. Neglecting mobile optimization</strong></h3>
<p>With the increasing <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/mobile-marketing-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use of mobile devices for online shopping</a>, it&#8217;s crucial to optimize your product data and website for mobile users. However, many merchants neglect this aspect and miss out on valuable traffic and conversions.</p>
<p>To avoid this mistake, you should ensure that your product data is mobile-friendly and displays correctly on smaller screens. You should also optimize your website for mobile speed and usability, such as using responsive design, optimizing images, and reducing page load time.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Overusing promotional text and special characters<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>While it&#8217;s important to highlight your products&#8217; unique features and benefits, overusing promotional text and special characters can be counterproductive. Google may consider them spammy or misleading, and customers may find them annoying or confusing.</p>
<p>To avoid this mistake, you should use promotional text and special characters sparingly and strategically, such as in your product titles or descriptions. You should also follow Google&#8217;s guidelines and avoid using all caps, exclamation points, emojis, or other symbols excessively.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-example-product-name.webp" alt="google merchant center - promotional product name example" width="403" height="154" class="aligncenter wp-image-83844 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-example-product-name.webp 403w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-example-product-name-300x115.webp 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-example-product-name-400x154.webp 400w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px" /></p>
<h3><strong>7. Ignoring feed errors and warnings<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>One of the most common mistakes that merchants make with Merchant Center is ignoring feed errors and warnings. Merchant Center uses a feed to retrieve and update your product data, and any errors or warnings in your feed can prevent your products from showing or cause inaccuracies or disapprovals. However, many merchants don&#8217;t monitor or fix their feed errors and warnings regularly or thoroughly, which can hurt their performance and customer experience.</p>
<p>To avoid this mistake, you should check your feed regularly for any errors or warnings, and use the diagnostic and feed rules features in Merchant Center to identify and fix any issues. You should also ensure that your feed complies with Google&#8217;s requirements and policies, such as data quality, product identifiers, and country-specific regulations.</p>
<p>Finally, you should monitor your feed health and performance regularly and set up alerts or notifications for any critical issues. By taking care of your feed errors and warnings, you can ensure that your products are visible, accurate, and compliant, and you&#8217;re avoiding any unnecessary delays or penalties.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-feed-error-report.webp" alt="google merchant center - feed error report" width="1000" height="406" class="aligncenter wp-image-83848 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-feed-error-report.webp 1000w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-feed-error-report-980x398.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-feed-error-report-480x195.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1000px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3><strong>8. Not using custom labels<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Custom labels are a powerful feature in Google Merchant Center that allows you to group your products based on specific criteria such as margin, seasonality, popularity, or product type. This can help you optimize your bidding, reporting, and segmentation strategies, and tailor your promotions and ad copy to different audiences. However, many merchants overlook this feature or use it inconsistently, which can limit their flexibility and insights.</p>
<p>To avoid this mistake, you should identify the most relevant and useful custom labels for your business and use them consistently and strategically. In the example below, the merchant is leveraging custom labels to differentiate between various sizes of items for distinct ad group segmentation. Additionally, they have implemented the &#8216;shipping-label&#8217; to signify varying shipping charges that are applied to each group of item sizes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-attributes.webp" alt="google merchant center - example custom label attributes in product feed" width="766" height="461" class="aligncenter wp-image-83840 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-attributes.webp 766w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-attributes-480x289.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 766px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3><strong>9. Using vague or generic product identifiers<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>To begin with, let&#8217;s understand the significance of GTIN. A Global Trade Item Number, commonly known as GTIN, is a 14-digit unique code assigned to products (alternatively, EAN or ISBN are also valid options). It is mandatory for all products with an assigned GTIN. Failing to provide accurate GTIN information can cause frequent issues in feeds, but fortunately, they are relatively simple to resolve. By ensuring that GTINs are updated and correct, working with feeds becomes more streamlined and hassle-free.</p>
<p>Product identifiers such as GTINs, MPNs, and brand names are critical for matching your products to user queries and ensuring accuracy and relevance. However, many merchants use vague or generic identifiers that can lead to confusion or mismatching, especially for variations or bundles.</p>
<p>To avoid this mistake, you should use unique and accurate product identifiers that follow Google&#8217;s guidelines and match your website&#8217;s product pages. You should also ensure that your product data includes all the necessary identifiers and variants, and fix any mismatches or missing data.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-gtin-value.webp" alt="google merchant center - gtin product value limitation" width="559" height="103" class="aligncenter wp-image-83839 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-gtin-value.webp 559w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-gtin-value-480x88.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 559px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3><strong>10. Forgetting about sale price annotations<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Differentiating your ads with a &#8220;SALE PRICE&#8221; attribute in your feed can help attract customers and<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-increase-sales-for-your-business-on-a-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> increase sales</a>. However, it is important to meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The base price must have been charged for a period of at least 30 consecutive days in the past 180 days. </strong>This means that the original price of the product should have been valid for a significant amount of time before you can offer a sale price. This ensures that the sale price is not misleading and that customers are actually getting a good deal.</li>
<li><strong>The base price must be valid.</strong> The original price of the product should be accurate and reflect the actual price that the product was sold for in the past. Providing a false base price can be misleading and can lead to customer distrust.</li>
<li><strong>The sale price must be lower than the base price.</strong> This is the most obvious requirement for a sale. The sale price should be lower than the original price, and the discount offered should be significant enough to attract customers.</li>
<li><strong>The discount of the sale must be greater than 5% and less than 90%.</strong> This requirement ensures that the sale is not a minor price adjustment or an attempt to get rid of unwanted inventory. At the same time, the discount offered should not be too high, as this can make customers question the quality of the product or the legitimacy of the sale.</li>
</ul>
<p>By meeting these requirements, you can differentiate your ads and create a sense of urgency and excitement among customers. This can lead to increased clicks, conversions, and ultimately, sales.</p>

<div id="google-merchant-center-example"></div>
<h2>Real-world Google Merchant Center optimization example</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s put what we&#8217;ve learned about Google Merchant Center so far into practice with a real-world example I&#8217;ve seen. The client, an online retailer specializing in outdoor and leisure products such as tents, backpacks, and hammocks, had been using Google Shopping for some time but had not seen much success in terms of clicks and conversions. The client&#8217;s product titles and descriptions were generic and lacked the specific keywords and details that users were searching for. For example, the product title for a four-person tent was simply &#8220;Camping Tent,&#8221; without any information about the size, capacity, or features.</p>
<p>To improve their Google Shopping performance, the client decided to revamp their product titles and descriptions and align them more closely with user search queries. They also added brand names and GTINs to their products to enhance their visibility and credibility. After making these changes, the client saw a significant improvement in their click-through rate and conversion rate (CVR).</p>
<p>Specifically, they saw a 200% increase in their CTR and a 50% increase in their CVR within the first month of implementing these changes. Their new product titles and descriptions were more informative, descriptive, and relevant, and included keywords and phrases that users were searching for. For example, the new product title for the four-person tent was &#8220;Coleman Family Camping Tent for 4 People &#8211; Waterproof, Easy Setup, and Durable,&#8221; which highlighted the key features and benefits of the product and matched user intent.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-shopping-ad-example.jpg" alt="google merchant center - example shopping ad" width="814" height="375" class="aligncenter wp-image-83849 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-shopping-ad-example.jpg 814w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-shopping-ad-example-480x221.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 814px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>By adding brand names and GTINs to their products, the client also improved their online sales, as users tend to trust and click on products that have identifiable and verifiable information. In fact, a <a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6352134" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study by Google</a> found that products with GTINs had a 20% higher conversion rate than those without.</p>
<p>The key takeaway from this example is that optimizing your product titles, descriptions, and data can have a significant impact on your Google Shopping performance and ROAS. By aligning your product data with user intent, adding brand names and GTINs, and using relevant and high-quality images and videos, you can attract and engage more customers and differentiate yourself from competitors.</p>
<h2>Start improving your Google Merchant Center feed today</h2>
<p>Optimizing your Google Merchant Center feed can greatly benefit your business by enhancing query matching, increasing click-through rates, and driving more conversions. To achieve these benefits, it&#8217;s important to follow Google Shopping guidelines, ensure that your products go live and stay live, optimize your product titles and descriptions, and maximize the performance of your products through high-quality images and competitive pricing. By regularly reviewing and updating your product information, you can ensure that your feed remains accurate and up-to-date, providing a positive user experience and ultimately helping to grow your business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year’s ecommerce trends feel a little oxymoronic. Machines and software are helping do more jobs, even communicating directly with shoppers. At the same time, consumers are heading towards online experiences that give them the personalized, human interactions of in-person buying.</p>

<h2>9 ecommerce trends to monitor in 2024</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.couponcabin.com/blog/online-shopping-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ecommerce shopping statistics</a> tell us things are changing. And what do those numbers say? These are the most high-profile ecommerce marketing trends we see heading our way this year. Learn them to stay in tune with customers and ahead of competitors.</p>
<div id="Conversational-marketing-becomes-table-stakes-for-ecommerce-brands"></div>
<h3>1. Conversational marketing becomes table stakes for ecommerce brands</h3>
<p>Conversational marketing is a strategy where businesses have two-way communication with customers in real time. Those one-to-one interactions can happen with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/08/live-chat-rulebook">live agents</a>, but a lot of conversational marketing growth will occur with AI-powered <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/chatbots">chatbots</a>.</p>
<p>For example, one study suggests that by 2028, around <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/press/retail-spend-over-chatbots-to-reach-12bn-globally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$72 billion</a> in retail spending will happen through chatbot interactions. For context, that’s a 470% increase compared to the $12 billion in chatbot sales from 2023.</p>
<p>Two factors are fueling this ecommerce trend: generative AI and consumers’ desire for fast answers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/05/generative-ai-in-digital-marketing">Generative AI</a> models like ChatGPT use natural language processing to understand conversational queries. That’s helped chatbots become highly successful sales agents that can guide website visitors through their buying journey.</p>

<p>For most consumers, the <a href="https://thechatbot.net/statistics-chatbot-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most significant upside</a> of using chatbots is the 24/7 availability of information. Instead of waiting until regular business hours, shoppers can jump in when inspiration strikes and get all the information they need to make an informed purchase.</p>
<p>The great news is chatbots are becoming less expensive and easier to launch, so expect to see them gain traction in <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/ai-in-marketing-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smaller businesses</a>. You can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/04/how-to-build-a-chatbot-your-brand">launch your own chatbot</a> in a jiffy.</p>

<div id="Ecommerce-businesses-will-find-new-uses-for-AR"></div>
<h3>2. Ecommerce businesses will find new uses for AR</h3>
<p>The virtual reality (VR) craze hit its peak when <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/#:~:text=Introducing%20Meta%3A%20A%20Social%20Technology%20Company&amp;text=Today%20at%20Connect%202021%2C%20CEO,find%20communities%20and%20grow%20businesses." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook rebranded as Meta</a>, a signal that the social media giant was turning its vast resources towards developing online worlds known loosely as the metaverse. Despite some optimistic forecasts, most of us still aren’t guiding our avatars down digital promenades in search of the next digital deal. And with Meta still <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/01/metas-reality-labs-loses-4point65-billion-in-q4-ahead-of-vision-pro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">losing millions</a> on its big VR bet, it’s unlikely to happen any time soon.</p>
<p>However, an interesting movement in ecommerce is taking advantage of augmented reality, VR’s cousin that overlays digital imagery on real-world environments in real time.</p>
<p>AR has become very accessible, even offered as free features like stickers and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-do-a-poll-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> on social media platforms. Expect to see online retailers and brands taking advantage of AR in new ways. For example, fashion brands use AR to help mobile shoppers see how they’ll look in this season’s styles.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-VR-1.webp" alt="Ecommerce trends - screenshot of a VR eyeglass try on screen." width="936" height="483" class="aligncenter wp-image-82401 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-VR-1.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-VR-1-480x248.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.smartbuyglasses.co.uk/virtual-try-on" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Users snap a picture in the brand’s app, and AR adds the products. Clothing brands, household goods, and even car dealers are all using AR to help buyers make a purchase decision.</p>
<p>Other retailers are using AR to highlight product details, like price tags or features, in promotional videos.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-AR-price.webp" alt="Ecommerce trends - shopping video with AR price tags." width="328" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-82399 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-AR-price.webp 328w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-AR-price-164x300.webp 164w" sizes="(max-width: 328px) 100vw, 328px" /></p>

<p>With AR&#8217;s near-zero cost for these use cases and more app developers building creative AR solutions, expect to see it used more often and by a wider variety of ecommerce businesses.</p>
<div id="More-sellers-slide-into-their-customers-DMs"></div>
<h3>3. More sellers slide into their customers’ DMs</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-dm-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Direct messaging</a>, like the DMs on your Instagram or TikTok account, is ideal for brands to interact with customers and fans one-on-one. You can send links, images, and product videos. Plus, it doesn’t cost anything to send a DM. That’s why we’ll see more brands connect with their customers in direct message apps this year.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-DMs-two.webp" alt="Ecommerce trends - Promotional direct message." width="348" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-82389 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-DMs-two.webp 348w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-DMs-two-174x300.webp 174w" sizes="(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px" /></p>
<p>Because of their private nature, DMs are a great place to have <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-respond-to-negative-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conversations about customer concerns</a>. You can even use them as a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-generation-ideas">lead generation channel</a> as an alternative to collecting email addresses on your website.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-DMs.webp" alt="Ecommerce trends - Lead generation campaign on Instagram." width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-82388 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-DMs.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-DMs-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CR87iQzFCpq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>A word of warning if you want to try this trend out for yourself. If you start messaging random people, you’ll definitely get blocked and probably reported. Always ask before contacting someone in their DMs. Offer a reason, like giving someone a personal discount code or asking them to share their experience with your products (free <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/28/user-generated-content">user-generated content</a>!).</p>
<div id="Gen-Z-spurs-shift-to-social-shopping"></div>
<h3>4. Gen Z spurs shift to social shopping</h3>
<p>At first, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">social media marketing</a> was mainly a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">brand awareness</a> play. Sellers could share their wares in organic and paid posts and then offer links to their e-commerce shops.</p>
<p>Jumping from one platform to the next adds friction to the sales process. With <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/25/social-shopping">social shopping</a>, consumers can click on the products they see in a post and complete the purchase without leaving their favorite social media apps.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-social-selling.webp" alt="Ecommerce trends - Shoppable facebook post from Nike." width="828" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-82395 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-social-selling.webp 828w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-social-selling-480x348.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 828px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Revenue from social commerce could hit the <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/8757/social-commerce/#topicOverview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trillion</a> (with a “T”) dollar mark in the next few years. Younger adults lead the charge, with nearly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1455174/worldwide-share-of-shoppers-purchasing-via-social-media-by-age/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three-quarters</a> of 18 to 34-year-olds saying they’ve made a purchase from social commerce. But the trend is also permeating through all generations—around 25% of consumers over 65 said they’ve bought through that channel as well. With that kind of cross-generational spread, we expect to see a lot a lot more sales through social selling activities.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Download the newly updated <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteAllStarPlaybook.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_AllStarPlaybook_Download">All-Star Advertising Playbook</a> to get expert-level tips for all four of the most lucrative advertising channels.</p>
<div id="Live-commerce-bridges-the-gap-between-online-and-in-person-shopping"></div>
<h3>5. Live commerce bridges the gap between online and in-person shopping</h3>
<p>If QVC and social shopping had a love child, it would be live commerce. During a live commerce event, a host interacts with viewers via video on a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">social media platform</a>. Those viewers can then purchase the products on offer right from the video.</p>
<p>Live commerce offers the best parts of in-store shopping without fighting traffic or searching for a parking space. Shoppers get instant answers from a knowledgeable brand representative or influencer right from their living room.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-live-shopping-one.webp" alt="Ecommerce trends - live shopping example." width="462" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-82393 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-live-shopping-one.webp 462w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-live-shopping-one-231x300.webp 231w" sizes="(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/instagram-live-shopping-reach-customers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>The most popular social media apps are participating in this trend. Instagram and TikTok offer live shopping features, and <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-shopify-integration-merch-shopping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> inked a deal with Shopify to let creators add shoppable links to videos.</p>
<p>While the most common format for live shopping involves one or two representatives on screen touting the brand’s latest and greatest, there’s another interesting way to use this tactic. Say you’re launching a new line of cosmetics. You could have a launch party and let viewers buy what they see on their screens.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-live-shopping-two.webp" alt="Ecommerce trends - Live shopping example on YouTube." width="357" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-82394 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-live-shopping-two.webp 357w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-live-shopping-two-179x300.webp 179w" sizes="(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-shopify-integration-merch-shopping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>The live commerce trend is expected to grow significantly in the near term, with some suggesting it could account for <a href="https://www.businessdit.com/live-commerce-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20%</a> of all ecommerce sales. Since conversion rates at live shopping events can reach 30%, ecommerce brands would be wise to take advantage of this trend.</p>
<div id="Subscription-services-solidify-customer-loyalty"></div>
<h3>6. Subscription services solidify customer loyalty</h3>
<p>Buy almost any consumable from Amazon, and you’ll be asked if you’d like to save a few dollars by subscribing to auto-refill your order. The initial loss in profit to the seller is well worth the higher potential of repeat business. And the buyer sees the savings as a no-brainer since they’ll need more of the product later.</p>
<p>The trend goes beyond monthly dog food or cosmetics deliveries (although those are common). Now, you can get a regular delivery of all sorts of themed products, like miniature items for your doll house or train set.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-subscription.webp" alt="Ecommerce trends - Promotional social post for a subscription deal." width="374" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-82396 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-subscription.webp 374w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-subscription-187x300.webp 187w" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px" /></p>
<p>Savings and customer loyalty are powerful win-wins that are likely to motivate sellers and shoppers to keep the trend going. <a href="https://www.ebbo.com/insights/blog/subscription-loyalty-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">77%</a> of consumers say they spend up to $499 annually on subscriptions, and 41% say they’ll add more in the next year.</p>
<div id="AI-fuels-customized-buying-journeys"></div>
<h3>7. AI fuels customized buying journeys</h3>
<p>In general, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-marketing-trends-2024">AI is a big trend</a> for all marketers. There are many ways ecommerce brands and marketers can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/05/generative-ai-in-digital-marketing">use artificial intelligence</a> to boost their businesses. One that’s emerging as particularly useful is having AI create complex, personalized customer journeys.</p>
<p>Here’s an example. Say you send marketing texts to your customers, reminding them of sales and new products. If each text of those campaigns were personalized to the individual based on their prior behavior, you’d close a lot more sales. But it’d be nearly impossible to do manually when you’re promoting hundreds of products to thousands of customers.</p>
<p>That’s where <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-in-marketing">marketing experts are applying AI</a>. Using its machine learning capabilities, AI can “remember” how customers reacted to previous messages, which products they bought, and how they interacted with your website. Then, it can create a custom campaign for each text subscriber.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-AI-journey.webp" alt="Ecommerce trends - Example of a promotional SMS text flow.," width="698" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-82398 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-AI-journey.webp 698w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-AI-journey-480x413.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 698px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.attentive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Personalization is a well-documented marketing strategy that often lifts revenue by up to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-value-of-getting-personalization-right-or-wrong-is-multiplying" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25%</a>. Brands that use advanced personalization strategies say they see a <a href="https://www.businessdit.com/personalization-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">200%</a> return on the investment.</p>
<p>In the coming year, we’ll see many more retailers and brands use AI to construct personalized buying journeys through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/21/promotional-email-examples">promotional emails</a>, texts, and social media, individually and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/22/cross-channel-marketing">across multiple channels</a>.</p>
<div id="Dynamic,-personalized-websites-go-mainstream"></div>
<h3>8. Dynamic, personalized websites go mainstream</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/personalized-marketing">Personalization</a> has been the playground of ad campaigns for a while. But what if every person who visited your promotional <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">landing page</a> or home page saw a version that best suited their needs? That’s what <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/dynamic-landing-pages">dynamic landing pages</a> and websites offer.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple example where someone considering your product sees a different home page than someone who bought it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-dynamic-website.webp" alt="Ecommerce trends - two landing pages with different text for customers and prospects." width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-82390 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-dynamic-website.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-dynamic-website-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Dynamic landing pages aren’t new. What’s changed is the scale and scope of personalization available with new AI-powered techniques, making them more attractive to ecommerce shops with many product and sales pages.</p>
<p>Let’s say you have a website with hundreds of sales and conversion pages. AI can analyze huge amounts of data about your products and customer behavior. Then, generative AI can quickly create <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/05/conversational-tone">conversational copy</a> or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">calls to action</a> for each of those pages that are more relevant to each segment of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/09/18/beginners-guide-to-target-markets">target market</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://fibr.ai/blog/significance-of-dynamic-landing-pages-for-your-website" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Most marketers</a> that use personalized landing pages report a lift in engagement compared to static versions. Plus, 91% of customers said they felt more connected with websites featuring dynamic pages, especially those that provided personalized offers and product recommendations.</p>
<div id="Ecommerce-brands-will-launch-more-data-gathering-campaigns"></div>
<h3>9. Ecommerce brands will launch more data-gathering campaigns</h3>
<p>Many of the trends we’ve discussed require extensive data about your customers. Gathering this information has pros and cons. Some shoppers love the personalization it provides, while others are rightfully concerned about their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/22/customer-data-privacy">privacy</a>.</p>
<p>In light of these concerns, lawmakers and big platforms are making it harder to collect data without direct user consent. Google has finally <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/google-turns-off-cookies-30-million-chrome-users-that-s-just-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ended the use of third-party cookies</a>. Some US states and European governments require websites to give visitors a choice to opt in or opt out of being tracked by cookies.</p>
<p>With much less third-party data, ecommerce marketers will need to become really good at convincing shoppers to give up their information willingly, also known as zero-party data.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-data-types.webp" alt="Ecommerce trends - Graphic showing types of data." width="936" height="572" class="aligncenter wp-image-82387 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-data-types.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-data-types-480x293.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In the coming months and years, we&#8217;ll see more creative campaigns designed to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/customer-data"> collect data</a> from willing website visitors and customers ethically. These may be contests, newsletter subscriptions, surveys, or even discounts and free products.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-gather-data.webp" alt="Ecommerce trends - giveaway to collect email addresses." width="931" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-82392 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-gather-data.webp 931w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ecommerce-trends-wordstream-gather-data-480x309.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 931px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>However it’s done, collecting zero-party data is a big ecommerce marketing trend that almost every retailer and brand needs to be aware of.</p>
<h2>What is the future of the ecommerce industry?</h2>
<p>To say last year was one of change for ecommerce stores and marketers is a drastic understatement. With the rapid development of new <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-copywriting-tools">AI marketing tools</a>, customers’ shift to new sales channels, and potential regulations that can change how everyone does business online, it’s nearly impossible to guess the future of ecommerce with 100% clarity.</p>
<p>But if you look at the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2025-marketing-tips">marketing trends</a> ramping up now, you’ll see a few themes that hint at the future. Customers want in-store experiences from online shopping. They’ll choose lower-friction purchase options over clicking through multiple apps and websites. And they’d prefer personalized interactions as long as their privacy remains protected.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With over six years of experience as a performance specialist at Google Canada, I&#8217;ve witnessed firsthand how setting up retargeting campaigns can revolutionize businesses, especially in the retail industry. Among the various retargeting techniques available, <strong>dynamic remarketing stands out as an effective way to target potential customers who have shown interest in your products but haven&#8217;t made a purchase yet</strong>.</p>
<p>Here, I&#8217;ll be sharing best practices for implementing dynamic remarketing for retail businesses. By following these guidelines, you will have a good foundation to create a dynamic remarketing campaign in Google Ads that reaches your target audience with personalized ads, increases your brand&#8217;s visibility, and drives conversions.</p>
<h2>What is dynamic remarketing for retail?</h2>
<p>Google <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/04/01/dynamic-remarketing">dynamic remarketing</a> for retail is an advertising technique that allows retailers to show customized product ads to users who have previously interacted with their website or mobile app. Using Google&#8217;s powerful advertising platform, retailers can create personalized ads that display products that users have previously viewed or added to their shopping cart.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-how-it-works.jpg" alt="how dynamic remarketing works" width="936" height="531" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72127" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-how-it-works.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-how-it-works-480x272.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This technique uses data such as website or mobile app behavior, demographics, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/21/google-ads-audience-targeting-cheat-sheet">interests</a> to create <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-seo-tools">PPC ads</a> that are highly relevant and tailored to each individual user.</p>
<p>The ads are delivered across Google&#8217;s vast network of websites and mobile apps, including Google Search, YouTube, and Gmail, as well as millions of websites and apps that partner with Google.</p>
<h3>Benefits of dynamic remarketing for retail</h3>
<p>Dynamic remarketing for retail can be a highly effective way to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/03/improve-conversion-rates">increase conversions</a> and revenue for retailers.</p>
<p>By reminding users of products they have previously shown interest in, it can help to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/brand-awareness-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase brand awareness</a>, customer loyalty, and overall sales.</p>
<p>With its advanced targeting capabilities and real-time bidding system, Google dynamic remarketing for retail is a powerful tool for retailers looking to take their advertising to the next level.</p>
<h2>How to set up dynamic remarketing in Google Ads</h2>
<p>Use these six simple steps to set up dynamic remarketing for your retail business.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Create a Google Ads account</h3>
<p>The first step in setting up dynamic remarketing in Google Tag Manager (GTM) is to create a Google Ads account. If you already have a Google Ads account, you can skip this step.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t, go to the <a href="https://ads.google.com/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads homepage</a> and follow the prompts to create a new account. You&#8217;ll need to provide some basic information about your business, such as your website URL and your business location.</p>

<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;&lt;div class=&#039;et-box et-shadow&#039;&gt;

<h3><span>Step 2: Add your products to the Merchant Center</span></h3>
<p>Setting up dynamic remarketing with Google Ads involves several critical steps, one of which is creating a <a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/188477">product feed</a>. A product feed is essentially a spreadsheet that contains all the relevant information about your products, including their prices, images, and descriptions. This data is essential for Google Ads to understand which products customers are viewing and to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">promote relevant ads for other products</a>.</p>
<p>Thankfully, creating a product feed is a simple and straightforward process. You can use any standard spreadsheet or CSV file to create your product feed, then upload it directly to the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/18/google-merchant-center">Google Merchant Center</a> (create a Merchant Center account <a href="https://www.google.com/retail/solutions/merchant-center/">here</a>). This process ensures that your product data is accurately and consistently presented to Google Ads, allowing you to create effective dynamic remarketing campaigns that reach the right customers at the right time.</p>
<p>While creating a product feed can seem like a daunting task (especially if you have a lot of products), there are ways to make it easier, particularly for ecommerce websites running on certain platforms. For instance, CMS platforms like Shopify and WordPress (running WooCommerce) have features that can automatically add products to the Google Merchant Center.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-2.jpg" alt="example of one place where dynamic remarketing ads can show in google" width="701" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72108" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-2.jpg 701w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-2-480x411.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 701px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An example of where the Shopping Feed can show in Google Ads.</em></p>
<p>In the case of Shopify, you can use the API method to <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/retail/connect-your-ecommerce-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">integrate your Shopify store with the Merchant Center</a>. This method allows you to automatically synchronize your product data between the two platforms, eliminating the need for a traditional feed. This feature can make it easier and more efficient for e-commerce businesses to set up dynamic marketing with Google Ads, as it eliminates the need for manual data entry and ensures that product information is always up-to-date.</p>
<p>With WooCommerce, you can utilize rich results for products with <a href="https://schema.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schema.org</a> structured data (check out <a href="https://yoast.com/rich-snippets-product-listings/">Yoast</a> for an easy way to do this). This allows the Merchant Center to automatically crawl your website and retrieve all of your products without the need for a traditional feed. This feature can also make it easier and more efficient for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/23/best-ecommerce-marketing-channels">ecommerce businesses</a> to set up dynamic marketing with Google Ads.</p>
<p><strong>Important note:</strong> To ensure that Google Ads can use your product feed in dynamic remarketing campaigns, it&#8217;s crucial to link your <a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/9455541?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merchant Center account to your Ads account</a>. This link ensures that Google Ads knows that you have a product feed available to select when creating your dynamic remarketing campaign.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Add the Data Layer</h3>
<p>To set up dynamic remarketing, one essential step is adding the <a href="https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6106009?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Layer</a> to your website. In the Data Layer, you include information about a specific product that a user viewed on your website, including its ID (which must align with the ID in your Merchant Center feed), its value (the shopping cart and final order value can also be passed), and which page category the user is viewing. This information is then passed on to your remarketing tag, and subsequently to Google Ads.</p>
<p><strong>So how does a Data Layer send this information to Google Ads?</strong> Essentially, when a user interacts with your website, an event is triggered. While the complete event snippet code won&#8217;t automatically appear in your tracking tools, you can install the Data Layer that pushes relevant data from the products on your website to your Data Layer.</p>
<p>For instance, let&#8217;s say a user viewed two products on your website. The event snippet code will contain the value (price) and IDs of the products viewed. The Data Layer can then send this data to Google Ads, allowing you to create effective dynamic remarketing campaigns that target the right customers with the right products.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-3.jpg" alt="an example of how Data Layer sends information to Google Ads as part of your dynamic remarketing campaigns" width="843" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72109" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-3.jpg 843w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-3-480x342.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 843px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Event names are an important part of your Data Layer code, as they describe the specific event being measured. In the example provided below, the code is using the &#8220;add_to_cart&#8221; event to track when a user adds a product to their cart. It&#8217;s important to choose the right event name as Google Ads uses it to assign users to automatically generated user lists.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-3b.jpg" alt="example of event names using Data Layer" width="936" height="301" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72110" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-3b.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-3b-480x154.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Assuming you have already installed Google Tag Manager (if you do not, please refer to this <a href="https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6103696" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Help Center article</a>), the next step is to implement the Data Layer code customized for your website <strong>above </strong>the GTM code snippet.</p>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;&lt;div class=&#039;et-box et-shadow&#039;&gt;

<h3>Step 4: Create a Google Ads Remarketing Tag in GTM</h3>
<p>To set up a Google Ads Remarketing Tag in your Google Tag Manager account, follow these simple steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Log in to your Google Tag Manager account.</li>
<li>Click on &#8220;Tags&#8221; in the left-hand menu, then click on the red &#8220;New&#8221; button.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-4a.jpg" alt="setting up dynamic remarketing in google ads" width="936" height="283" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72111" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-4a.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-4a-480x145.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></li>

</ul>
<ul></ul>
<ul></ul>
<h3>Step 5: Make your Remarketing Tag dynamic</h3>
<p>If you want to leverage custom parameters for your Google Ads Tag&#8217;s dynamic remarketing events, there&#8217;s one more step you need to take: Making your Remarketing Tag dynamic!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-5a.jpg" alt="making remarketing tag dynamic" width="566" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72115" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-5a.jpg 566w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-5a-480x508.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 566px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Choose the predefined variable &#8220;Event,&#8221; which appears with a gear icon.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-5b-e1684267179702.jpg" alt="dynamic remarketing set up - making tag dynamic" width="727" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72116" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-5b-e1684267179702-727x551.jpg 727w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-5b-e1684267179702-480x270.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 727px) 727px, 100vw" /></li>
<li>Now it&#8217;s time to add the Event Value. Simply click on the &#8220;+&#8221; icon located next to the text box.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-5c.jpg" alt="how to set up dynamic remarketing for retail" width="698" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72117" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-5c.jpg 698w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-5c-480x412.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 698px, 100vw" /></li>
<li>To continue, click the plus sign located in the top right corner of the screen. Give the variable a name such as &#8220;dlv &#8211; value&#8221; and click on &#8220;Choose a variable type to begin setup&#8230;&#8221; Then, select &#8220;Data Layer Variable&#8221; from the available options.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-5d.jpg" alt="how to set up dynamic remarketing for retail" width="936" height="352" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72118" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-5d.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-5d-480x181.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></li>
<li>Now, assign the appropriate name from your site&#8217;s code to the Data Layer Variable. For example, we used the name “value” in the Data Layer code, so assign that name to the Data Layer Variable.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-5e.jpg" alt="how to set up dynamic remarketing for retail" width="936" height="453" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72119" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-5e.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-5e-480x232.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></li>
<li>To complete this step, you will need to fill in the Event Items field. The items array can be found in the Data Layer and retrieved using a Data Layer Variable, just as you did with the value Data Layer Variable. Click on the &#8220;Event Items&#8221; dropdown menu and look for the option labeled &#8220;New Variable&#8221; (click this option). Name it &#8220;dlv-items&#8221; and click on &#8220;Choose a variable type to begin setup&#8230;&#8221; Then, select &#8220;Data Layer Variable&#8221; from the available options.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-5f.jpg" alt="how to set up dynamic remarketing for retail" width="731" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72120" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-5f.jpg 731w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-5f-480x393.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 731px, 100vw" /></li>
<li>Now, assign the appropriate name from your site&#8217;s code to the Data Layer Variable. For example, we used the name &#8220;items&#8221; in the Data Layer code, so assign that name to the Data Layer Variable.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-5h.jpg" alt="how to set up dynamic remarketing for retail" width="936" height="577" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72121" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-5h.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-5h-480x296.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></li>
<li>Your completed remarketing tag with custom event Data Layer Variables should look like this:<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-5i.jpg" alt="how to set up dynamic remarketing for retail" width="548" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72122" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-5i.jpg 548w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-5i-480x526.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 548px, 100vw" /></li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 6: Create a trigger in GTM for your new dynamic Remarketing Tag</h3>
<p>Your goal is to fire the Remarketing Tag when specific events occur, such as a product view, product search, category list view, add to cart, or purchase. To achieve this, we need to create a custom event trigger that will only activate when these predefined events take place.</p>
<p>To start, check the &#8220;Use regex matching&#8221; option. This is a powerful tool that enables us to use an &#8220;or&#8221; function with a pipe symbol. You can then copy all of your predefined event names from the Google documentation and separate them with the pipe symbol, like so: view_search_results|view_item_list|view_item|add_to_cart|purchase</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-6a.jpg" alt="how to set up dynamic remarketing for retail" width="936" height="425" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72123" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-6a.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-6a-480x218.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Your Tag will only be triggered when a visitor traverses through these various remarketing events (think of them as steps down the lower half of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/07/marketing-funnel">marketing funnel</a>). Give the trigger a name and save it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-6b.jpg" alt="stages dynamic marketing ads show" width="599" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72124" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-6b.jpg 599w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-6b-480x481.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 599px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/paid-search-marketing-ppc/full-funnel-ppc-works-best/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Important Note: </strong>To ensure maximum <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/13/retargeting-ad-ideas">retargeting</a> coverage and flexibility when it comes to creating audiences, it is a good practice to set up a standard Remarketing Tag in addition to the dynamic Remarketing Tag you just created. Begin by creating a new Remarketing Tag in GTM, using the same conversion ID as the dynamic Remarketing Tag. However, do not add any custom Data Layer events to this tag.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Also, make sure to set the trigger to fire on all pages, except for the pages where the new dynamic Remarketing Tag is being triggered. To achieve this, add &#8220;custom &#8211; remarketing events&#8221; as an exception to the trigger.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-6d.jpg" alt="how to set up dynamic remarketing for retail" width="936" height="585" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72126" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-6d.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dynamic-remarketing-setup-step-6d-480x300.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>

<h2>The top 7 marketing strategies for ecommerce stores</h2>

<h3>1. Influencer marketing</h3>
<p>As a new store owner, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/digital-marketing/influencer-marketing-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">influencer marketing</a> is one of the guaranteed ways to fast-track your journey to market. There are micro-influencers in every industry, and consumers respect and follow the recommendations and words of authority figures they know.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/how-to-increase-instagram-engagement-influencer-post.png" alt="how to increase instagram engagement - influencer post" width="600" height="386" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-64888" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/how-to-increase-instagram-engagement-influencer-post.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/how-to-increase-instagram-engagement-influencer-post-480x309.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Builds trust.</li>
<li>Easiest way to spread word of mouth.</li>
<li>Cheaper than mainstream media.</li>
<li>Very effective if executed properly.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Difficult to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/12/20/content-marketing-roi">predict ROI</a>.</li>
<li>A change in the influencer’s reputation could impact your brand.</li>
<li>Can be hard to identify and get responses from influencers.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Tips</h4>
<p>Gretta Van Riel, a multiple 7-figure ecommerce store owner, uses influencer marketing as her primary marketing channel. Here are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKivhEayDxU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some tips from her on how to get the best out of influencer marketing</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give your influencers creative freedom. They know their audience better.</li>
<li>Do not overwhelm influencers in your initial outreach message.</li>
<li>Be clear with deliverables. Quantify where possible. For example, they will write one round-up blog post mentioning your product and three social media mentions (Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok). And what are you giving them in exchange? A free trial, unlimited or early access, or a discount?</li>
<li>Stay small. Micro-influencers oftentimes have better engagement than macro-influencers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Social media marketing</h3>
<p>Organic social media marketing refers to using the free posting and online store options available on major social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, TikTok, and more.</p>
<p>Many consumers use social media to learn about brands and ecommerce stores and will look to see how other customers engage with your brand before they buy from you.</p>

<h3>5. Search engine optimization (SEO)</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO</a> is the science of optimizing a website so that it <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google">ranks high in search engine results</a> for terms relevant to your business and services. The more relevant traffic you get, the more you can convert that traffic into leads and sales.</p>
<p>The key to the blog is to write articles that target informational intent keywords. For example, Quip is an ecommerce site for oral care, and it’s got a blog on topics like how to use an electric toothbrush, how to clean an electric toothbrush, and more.</p>

<h3>6. Pay per click advertising</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/pay-per-click-advertising">Pay-per-click advertising</a> (PPC) is a great choice for new <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2024-ecommerce-trends">ecommerce</a> store owners with some marketing budget. It simply means paying ad networks to show your marketing messages or banners across search engines or other online media.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ppc-advertising-examples-1.png" alt="ppc ad examples for search, shopping, display, social" width="720" height="464" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-64739" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ppc-advertising-examples-1.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ppc-advertising-examples-1-480x309.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>While SEO takes time to gain traction, PPC yields immediate results.</li>
<li>Because you can target highly specific audiences with PPC, and because you&#8217;re only paying when someone clicks on your ad, this method is cost-effective.</li>
<li>Data! With clear visibility into which campaigns are working and which ones aren&#8217;t, you can make data-driven decisions to optimize your campaigns and maximize your ROI.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Running effective Google Ads and other PPC campaigns requires regular maintenance, audits, and reporting.</li>
<li>You need to pay to play. If you underfund your campaigns, they won&#8217;t generate enough volume and data needed for machine learning to take place and optimize your campaigns for profitability.</li>
<li>The online advertising landscape is always changing, so it&#8217;s important to stay on top of platform updates.</li>

<h3>7. Video marketing</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible to overlook the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/08/video-marketing-statistics">power of video marketing</a>. Most social media platforms now favor video content over any other form of content. You can use video to create educational tutorials, ads, educational ads, product demonstrations, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/13/explainer-videos">explainer videos</a>, and more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/video-ad-tools-ripl.png" alt="video ad tools - ripl" width="500" height="977" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61792" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/video-ad-tools-ripl.png 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/video-ad-tools-ripl-480x938.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Video gives you a competitive edge because it allows you to not only tell but show your value and demonstrate how your product provides benefits.</li>
<li>While it can be hard to take creative freedom with SEO and PPC content, video affords plenty of room for<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/03/video-marketing-ideas"> ideas and creativity</a> to help you distinguish your brand.</li>
<li>Live shopping streams are becoming more popular and accessible.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Video marketing can be resource heavy—it takes time to edit, and you need to have the right equipment so that you&#8217;re working with quality footage from the start.</li>
<li>Requires consistency. To gain traction with your YouTube Channel, you need to be consistently posting content and monitoring your YouTube analytics.</li>
<li>Lots of influencers use video, so your business can be up against some heavy competition with large audiences.</li>

<h2>Final tips for choosing the best ecommerce marketing strategy</h2>
<p>Not sure which marketing strategy to start with for your new ecommerce store, or which one will be best for you? Here are some final tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/10/15/multi-channel-marketing">multi-channel strategy</a> is the way to go. Each channel has its strengths and weaknesses, but employing multiple channels in concert with one another will bring you the best results.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">Research your target audience.</a> Find out the platforms your target audience uses most. For example, Tik Tok works more with Gen Z than the baby boomer generation. And emails work better with the baby boomer generation than with Gen Z.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll only know how each strategy works with your niche if you pay attention to your metrics. Use tools like Google Analytics,<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/18/how-to-use-google-data-studio"> Data (Looker) Studio</a>, a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/09/crm-for-small-business">CRM</a>, and the native analytics tools within each channel to monitor and measure your results. This will allow you to see which channels bring in the highest ROI as well as to A/B test different approaches within each channel.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For any ecommerce business, improving ROI and ROAS are among its many goals, and there are a number of ways to do this. If you&#8217;re running Google Shopping campaigns, you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/25/google-shopping-ads-priority-bidding-structure">prioritize your campaign structure</a>.  If you&#8217;re only using search ads, you can expand to social or display. And of course, you can optimize the shopping experience as a whole.  That last option yields many benefits, one of which is increasing average order value.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/average-order-value-by-industry-growcode-1.png" alt="average order value benchmarks" width="720" height="534" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62969" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/average-order-value-by-industry-growcode-1.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/average-order-value-by-industry-growcode-1-480x356.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As you can see above, <a href="https://www.growcode.com/blog/average-order-value/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average order value benchmarks</a> vary by industry. But the methods to increase average order value can often apply across industries. So read on to learn 10 practical, but not-pushy ways to increase average order value for your business. Let’s dive in!</p>
<h3>Table of contents</h3>

</ul>
<p><a id="what"></a></p>
<h2>What is average order value (AOV)?</h2>
<p>Average order value (AOV) is a metric that measures the average amount spent per transaction on a website, in an online store, or within a specific time period. It is often used by businesses to track customer behavior, find profitable sales channels and segments, and ultimately to assess and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/03/increase-sales-online">improve their sales performance</a>.</p>
<p>AOV can be calculated for an entire company or for specific product lines, channels, or regions. For example, a company might compare its AOV from year to year or examine how different <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/28/best-marketing-campaigns-examples">marketing campaigns</a> affect AOV.</p>
<p>By understanding how AOV is calculated and what factors influence it, businesses can take steps to increase their average order value and improve their bottom line.<br />
<a id="formula"></a></p>
<h2>How to calculate average order value</h2>
<p>To calculate your AOV, simply take the total revenue from all orders in a given time period and divide it by the total number of orders placed during that same time period.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/average-order-value-formula.png" alt="average order value formula" width="720" height="334" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62968" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/average-order-value-formula.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/average-order-value-formula-480x223.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total revenue: $2,300,000</li>
<li>Number of orders: 56,450</li>
<li>Average order value = $2,300,000 / 56450 = $40,744<br />
<a id="how"></a></li>
</ul>
<h2>10 ways to increase average order value</h2>
<p>Let’s go through nine practical ways that you can actually increase your average order value and boost your business&#8217;s profit margins.</p>
<h3>1. Boost your website&#8217;s social proof</h3>
<p>When a new website visitor comes to your website, they might have only just become <a href="https://blog.appsumo.com/top-of-funnel-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aware of your brand</a> for the first time. This is when you have the chance to impress them and show them proof of why they should buy from you.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/01/10/social-proof-guide">Social proof</a> shows potential customers that others are happy with your product or service, giving them confidence to buy. There are a few different ways you can use social proof, but for increasing AOV, try these:</p>
<h4>Add reviews to your product page and homepage</h4>
<p>If you have <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">customer reviews</a> on your specific products, add them to their respective product pages. Here is an example of a brand called Oodie that showcases its customer reviews on the homepage.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-oodie-reviews.png" alt="how to increase average order value - customer reviews on website" width="720" height="257" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62945" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-oodie-reviews.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-oodie-reviews-480x171.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Use testimonials and other trust signals</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/19/customer-testimonial-examples">Customer testimonials</a> and influencer endorsements help build trust and credibility, which can lead to more sales and a higher average order value.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-social-proof.png" alt="how to increase average order value - trust signals on website" width="720" height="384" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62944" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-social-proof.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-social-proof-480x256.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>List your achievements</h4>
<p>Adding your achievements and awards to your website is another good way to increase social proof and AOV. This helps build trust with potential customers and show them that you&#8217;re a credible company.</p>
<p>For example, LARQ features their awards on their website.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-larq-awards.png" alt="how to increase average order value - awards on website" width="720" height="265" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62947" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-larq-awards.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-larq-awards-480x177.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>2. Test out different website copy</h3>
<p>The copy on your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/08/how-to-build-an-ecommerce-website">ecommerce website</a> plays a big role in whether or not customers decide to make a purchase.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not happy with your current conversion rate, it might be time to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/02/26/ab-testing-best-practices">A/B test</a> your website copy. This simply means creating two versions of a particular element and then seeing which version performs better.</p>
<p>You can A/B test just about anything on your website and landing pages, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Headlines</li>
<li>Call-to-action buttons</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/06/26/product-descriptions">Product descriptions</a></li>
<li>Product images</li>
<li>Website layout</li>
<li>Checkout processes</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re not sure where to start, check out these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/25/ecommerce-marketing-trends">ecommerce website trends and examples</a> for inspiration.</p>
<h3>3. Make customer service your priority</h3>
<p>Website customer service is often seen as a low priority, but it should be taken seriously as it removes purchasing barriers and helps to build trust—both of which will help to increase your average order value.</p>
<p>In addition, good customer service can help to resolve problems quickly and efficiently, saving time and money in the long run.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add 24/7 live chat:</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/08/live-chat-rulebook">Live chat</a> allows website visitors to get their questions answered in real time, which can help to reduce any hesitation or confusion they may have about making a purchase.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-24-7-help.png" alt="how to increase average order value - 24/7 help" width="720" height="210" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62948" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-24-7-help.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-24-7-help-480x140.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create a help/<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-create-an-faq-page-with-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAQ page</a>:</strong> By providing your customers with a resource page they can rely on, you&#8217;ll show them that you&#8217;re committed to providing them with the best possible experience, which will increase your average order value.</li>
<li><strong>Add a contact number:</strong> Make your business as easy to reach as possible, with a tap-to-call option if you can.</li>
<li><strong>Add a contact email:</strong> If you don&#8217;t have a contact email yet, it is crucial to have one. Any questions your customers have, they should be able to contact you and get help.</li>
</ul>
<p>Excellent customer service is especially important if you&#8217;re selling expensive items or items that require a significant investment or commitment.</p>
<h3>4. Include upsell options&#8230;</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/30/cross-selling-upselling">Upselling</a> is when you encourage customers to purchase a more expensive version of the product they&#8217;re interested in. For example, if someone is looking at buying a basic pair of shoes, you might try to upsell them by offering a more expensive option that&#8217;s made with better quality materials, is a limited edition, or offers customization options.</p>
<p>In the example below, Proflowers has not just a standard bouquet option, but also a Deluxe, Premium, and Exquisite option.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-upsell-example.png" alt="how to increase average order value - upsell example" width="720" height="322" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62949" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-upsell-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-upsell-example-480x215.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>5. &#8230;and cross-sell options</h3>
<p>Cross-selling is when you encourage customers to purchase complementary products. For example, if someone is buying a dress, you might try to cross-sell them by offering jewelry or shoes that would go well with the dress.</p>
<p>This is a great way to increase your AOV because it allows you to sell multiple products to the same customer. It&#8217;s also a great way to get rid of any leftover inventory you may have.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-cross-selling-example.png" alt="how to increase average order value - cross-sell example" width="720" height="253" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62955" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-cross-selling-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-cross-selling-example-480x169.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Upsells and cross-sells work especially well for a<a href="https://litextension.com/blog/is-dropshipping-worth-it/"> dropshipping business model</a>, but you need to be careful not to come across as too pushy. The key is to make sure you&#8217;re only offering products that are genuinely relevant and useful to the customer.<a href="https://litextension.com/blog/is-dropshipping-worth-it/"></a></p>
<h3>6. Bundle products together</h3>
<p>Bundling products together is a common tactic used by many businesses to get customers to spend more money per order.</p>
<p>For instance, if you are selling beauty products, you could create a bundle that includes a few different items like shampoo, conditioner, and a hair mask.</p>
<p>Let’s look at this example from Target. When you add a product to your cart, the website creates a bundle of frequently bought together products.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-bundle.png" alt="how to increase average order value - bundle example" width="720" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62952" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-bundle.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-bundle-480x245.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> The key to creating successful bundles is to make sure that the products complement each other and work well together. You also want to make sure that the bundle is priced in such a way that it represents a good deal for the customer.</p>
<h3>7. Add limited-time offers</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/limited-time-offers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Limited-time offers</a> create a sense of urgency that encourages customers to make a purchase before it’s too late. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give a free gift with the next purchase for a limited time</li>
<li>Offer discounts on certain products or segments</li>
<li>Use different seasons and anniversary days to make limited-time sales</li>
<li>Run a stock clearance and creating a limited stock sale</li>
</ul>
<p>You could also add a countdown timer to your website to let customers know how long they have to take advantage of the offer, like Pura Vida below:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-puravida-promo.png" alt="how to increase average order value - countdown timer" width="720" height="113" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62946" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-puravida-promo.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-puravida-promo-480x75.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> No matter what type of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/13/sales-promotion-examples">sales promotion</a> you run, make sure that it&#8217;s clearly visible on your website. You want to make sure that customers don&#8217;t miss the offer and end up missing out on a great deal.</p>
<h3>8. Use exit-intent popups</h3>
<p><a href="https://elmerpal.com/exit-intent-popup-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exit intent popups</a> are a great way to increase your AOV, and they&#8217;re also a great way to boost sales in general. These appear when a customer is about to leave your website, but you can also set other conditions, such as after a certain amount of time on your website or after scrolling down a certain percentage on a page.</p>
<p>The popup typically contains an offer, such as a discount or a free gift. The goal is to get the customer to stay on your website and make a purchase or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/05/increase-email-signups">sign up for an email newsletter</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-lyftlyfe.png" alt="how to increase average order value - promo offer example" width="720" height="334" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62950" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-lyftlyfe.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-lyftlyfe-480x223.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> You need to be careful not to overuse exit intent popups. If you&#8217;re constantly bombarding customers with pop-ups, they&#8217;re likely to get annoyed and leave your website without returning. Use them sparingly and only when it makes sense. For example, you might want to use an exit-intent popup on a product page, but you wouldn&#8217;t want to use one on your home page.</p>
<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'> </span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f3a8.png" alt="🎨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong> Get creative ideas for your popups!</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Free guide</strong> &gt;&gt; </span><strong><a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download" class="waffle-rich-text-link">The 36 Best Call to Action Phrases (Ever)</a></strong><span> </span></p>
<p><span></div></div></span></p>
<h3>9. Add a free shipping threshold</h3>
<p>This method encourages customers to add more items to their cart in order to reach the free shipping threshold. For example, if your free shipping threshold is $50 and a customer has only purchased $42 worth or items, they&#8217;re likely to add more to reach that $50 mark.</p>
<p>You can either set a dollar amount or a quantity threshold for free shipping. For instance, you could offer free shipping on all orders over $50, or you could offer free shipping on all orders over five items. In the example below, the threshold is $35.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-free-shipping.png" alt="how to increase average order value - free shipping threshold example" width="720" height="245" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62961" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-free-shipping.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-free-shipping-480x163.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> The key is to find a free shipping threshold that works for your business. You don&#8217;t want to set the threshold too high, or else customers won&#8217;t bother trying to reach it. You also don&#8217;t want to set the threshold too low, or else you won&#8217;t be making enough money to cover the cost of shipping.</p>
<h3>10. Start a customer loyalty program</h3>
<p>Customer loyalty programs are a great way to boost your AOV, create loyal customers, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/09/customer-retention-strategies">increase customer retention</a>. This is because they encourage customers to make repeat purchases—or even to purchase more within one order—to earn rewards.</p>
<p>There are a few different ways that you can start a customer loyalty program. For example, you could offer discounts to customers who make repeat purchases, or you could offer points that can be redeemed for free products.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-florasis-loyalty.png" alt="how to increase average order value - loyalty rewards program example" width="720" height="410" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62958" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-florasis-loyalty.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-florasis-loyalty-480x273.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You could also start a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/14/referral-program-ideas">referral program</a>, where customers earn rewards for referring new customers to your business.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> No matter what type of customer loyalty program you choose to start, make sure that it&#8217;s clearly explained to customers. You want to make sure that they know how the program works and what they need to do in order to earn rewards.</p>
<p>You also want to make sure that the rewards are something that customers will actually want. Otherwise, they&#8217;re not going to bother participating in the program.</p>
<h2>How to increase average order value (recap)</h2>
<p>These are just a few of the many ways you can increase your average order value. Experiment with different strategies and see what works best for your business. Remember, even a small increase in AOV can have a big impact on your bottom line.</p>
<p><strong>Here are the 10 ways to increase average order value:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Boost your website&#8217;s social proof</li>
<li>Test out different website copy</li>
<li>Make customer service your priority</li>
<li>Include upsell options&#8230;</li>
<li>Cross-sell options</li>
<li>Bundle products together</li>
<li>Add limited-time offers</li>
<li>Use exit-intent popups</li>
<li>Add a free shipping threshold</li>
<li>Start a customer loyalty program</li>
</ol>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to track your results so you can see how your efforts are paying off. With the right approach, you can quickly boost your AOV and take your business to the next level.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>No built-in A/B testing feature in Google Ads for Shopping campaigns? No problem.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/20/google-shopping-ab-testing">5 Crafty Ways to Split Test Your Google Shopping Ads</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the best ways to increase your profitability? A/B split testing. Google Ads has a feature called the Experiments where you can create custom experiments for your campaigns and compare how your test group performs against your original campaigns (control group) over time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/google-shopping-ab-testing-experiments.png" alt="google ads experiments tab" width="720" height="284" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62893" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/google-shopping-ab-testing-experiments.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/google-shopping-ab-testing-experiments-480x189.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Only problem is, this is only available for Search and Display campaigns. Not for Shopping. Luckily, I’ve come up with five ways you can test multiple variations of your Shopping campaigns, which is what we&#8217;ll be diving into in this post.</p>
<h2>How to A/B test product information</h2>
<p>A/B testing product information like titles, images, or extensions can be useful for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/18/google-shopping-feed">optimizing your product feed</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/google-shopping-ab-testing-product-copy.png" alt="google shopping ab testing product copy" width="448" height="431" class="aligncenter wp-image-62890" /></p>
<p>This can be done in the set-up of your feed, either via a feed management tool or manually in Google Merchant Center. Once you&#8217;ve decided what you want to test, you’ll need to create equal groups of products. This can be done in several ways, I mainly use the following two methods:</p>
<h3>1. The cluster analysis method</h3>
<p>With a cluster analysis you’ll divide based on historical performance (e.g., dividing your products into equal groups based on metrics like clicks, revenue, costs, and conversion value). You can do this via spreadsheet for smaller datasets or in R (or other programming languages) for larger datasets.</p>
<h3>2. The random split method</h3>
<p>A random split can be done based on the ID of your product. For example, if you use numeric values as product IDs, you can assign group A to all even numbers and B to all uneven numbers.</p>
<p>The most important thing while splitting your products is to make sure that all groups of your experiment have an equal number of products and that your key metrics are also very close.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve made the split, make the changes to the product IDs in your test group. Make sure you&#8217;re able to report on all of your product IDs and corresponding groups. This way you can analyze them and find winners. Below you can find an example of how this would look in your feed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/google-shopping-ab-test-experiment-setup.png" alt="google shopping a/b testing - title experiment setup" width="720" height="438" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62891" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/google-shopping-ab-test-experiment-setup.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/google-shopping-ab-test-experiment-setup-480x292.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>How to A/B test campaign settings</h2>
<p>If you want to split test campaign settings like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/02/target-roas">ROAS</a>, targeting, or different campaign types, you’ll need to make splits based on something other than product IDs. Ideally, you&#8217;ll want to offer the same products in both your control and test groups because performance can vary by product. There are three different splits you can make to test your settings. Just like the test set-up on product content, creating equal groups is key. With all methods, you need to do the data cluster analysis yourself. Create two or more equal groups and analyze based on the differences.</p>
<h3>3. The Customer Match split method</h3>
<p>With Customer Match, you can target <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/12/first-party-data">first-party</a> audiences in Google Ads. It works by uploading a list of email addresses from your existing database that you want to target, and Google will match those email addresses to Google accounts.</p>
<h4>How to do it</h4>
<p>If you’re using Customer Match, you should be able to create a cookie split in your CRM software.  Then you can create two different campaigns using two different Google Customer Match Audiences. Change the setting that you want to test in your test campaign, and keep everything else the same in your control campaign. And that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>If you’re using Customer Match, make sure you have a third campaign running for all potential customers that are not inside of your database. This way you don’t lose any potential conversions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/google-customer-match-google-shopping-upload-list.webp"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/google-customer-match-google-shopping-upload-list.webp" alt="google ads customer match setup" width="670" height="389" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62894" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/google-customer-match-google-shopping-upload-list.webp 670w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/google-customer-match-google-shopping-upload-list-480x279.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 670px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.datafeedwatch.com/blog/attract-past-buyers-customer-match-google-shopping-campaigns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Random split: By splitting cookies you actually have a random split which is often used in other A/B tests.</li>
<li>Reliable data: Because of the random split, the results are reliable and reproducible.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Hard to implement: Not every advertiser has the resources to implement Customer Match or make the random split in their CRM.</li>
<li>Not 100% complete: This experiment only applies to existing customers in your database. That means the results aren’t valid for new potential customers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. The geo split test method</h3>
<p>Geo splits are often used to find incremental uplifts in campaigns. This could answer questions like: Is there incremental value in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/06/12/bidding-on-competitor-brands">advertising on branded keywords</a>?</p>
<h4>How to do it</h4>
<p>In a geo test, a market is divided into smaller geographical regions called geos. Each geo gets assigned either a control or a test group. Users in the test geos are exposed to the changed campaigns while users in the control geos are served the control campaigns. The split can be done on country or region, as long as both regional groups are highly correlated. You&#8217;ll need to use the cluster anaysis to determine your groups.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Easy to set up: Everyone with a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/how-to-use-google-adwords">bit of Google Ads experience</a> can set this up.</li>
<li>Reliable: Since we split the same campaigns, seasonality cannot be an influence.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Behavior can vary widely by geo. It’s essential to have two highly correlated groups. Also, seasonality can differ by geo-location. It’s not ideal to compare Alaska with Texas if you sell outdoor gear.</li>
<li>Somewhat hard to prepare: Cluster analysis on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/07/google-ads-geotargeting">location targeting</a> can be tricky when dealing with smaller geo-locations.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/google-shopping-geo-test-setup.png" alt="google shopping a/b testing - geo experiment setup" width="720" height="440" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62892" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/google-shopping-geo-test-setup.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/google-shopping-geo-test-setup-480x293.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /><a href="https://www.peak.express"></a></p>
<h3>5. The campaign split method</h3>
<p>In a campaign split, you simply divide your campaigns or accounts into two highly correlated groups. Both groups need to have an equal number of key metrics like clicks, conversions, and costs.</p>
<h4>How to do it</h4>
<p>In one group of campaigns (test group), you make the changes while in the control group your current best practices will serve. If you label and track the different groups of campaigns, you can tell something about the differences in performance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/google-shopping-bidding-options.png" alt="google shopping bidding options" width="720" height="365" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62910" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/google-shopping-bidding-options.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/google-shopping-bidding-options-480x243.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Budget and bidding strategy are two settings you could test.</em></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Very easy to set up: You only need to change settings in half of your campaigns and that’s it.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Least reliable: Seasonality can play a part in different campaigns, especially if your campaigns are divided by product category (have you tried the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/25/google-shopping-ads-priority-bidding-structure">priority bidding campaign structure</a>?).</li>
<li>Preparation can be hard: Cluster analysis on campaign groups can be hard when dealing with smaller sets of campaigns and data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>That’s it! Five different ways to run A/B tests for your Google Shopping ads:</p>
<ol>
<li>Test product feed attributes, creating groups with a cluster analysis.</li>
<li>Test product feed attributes, creating groups with a random split.</li>
<li>Test campaign settings with Customer Match groups.</li>
<li>Test campaign settings with geos.</li>
<li>Test campaign settings with campaign groups</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The quality of the outcome is dependent on the quality of your preliminary (cluster) analysis and setup. What you get out is what you put in. Hopefully this helps you with the optimization of your Google Shopping campaigns. If you try any of these methods, share the results in the comments! For now, have a wonderful day and keep optimizing!</p>

Let&#8217;s take a look at a few of the ecommerce website strategies and features that are working for businesses in 2022.</p>
<h3>1. Buy now pay later</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.adobe.com/experience-cloud/digital-insights/digital-economy-index.html">Adobe’s 2021 Digital Economy Index</a>, buy now pay later (BNPL) options increased 166% YoY in March 2021. Names like Klarna and Square have boomed recently, with their ads popping up all over YouTube. According to this<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/04/buy-now-pay-later-boom-shows-no-signs-of-slowing-this-holiday-season.html"> CNBC article</a>, BNPL options have been largely driven by younger shoppers.</p>

<h3>2. Conversion rate optimization</h3>
<p>This is one of those always trending trends. For many sites, getting more customers isn&#8217;t about getting more traffic, but converting more traffic. This is what <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/conversion-rate-optimization">conversion rate optimization </a>(CRO) is all about, and as UX technology becomes more accessible to us, so too do consumers’ expectations on our sites.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/02/ecommerce-seo">ecommerce SEO</a> is still important, some businesses will be wise to reallocate some budget that would be used for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">driving traffic</a>, to efforts to better convert that traffic such as by adding calls to action in more places, A/B testing elements, and improving page speed. Page speed will also<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/02/improve-core-web-vitals"> improve your Core Web Vitals</a>—a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/25/seo-trends">2022 SEO trend </a>for all businesses and industries.</p>

<h3>3. Serverless architecture</h3>
<p>As ecommerce grows, sites will continue to look for ways to cope with spikes in demands. With serverless architecture (for example, AWS Lambda), the cloud provider dynamically allocates resources, so you can scale elastically without having to provision or manage any servers.</p>
<p>The technology has proven itself in other industries, so it&#8217;s natural that<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/08/how-to-build-an-ecommerce-website"> ecommerce websites</a> are adopting this flexible option. The benefits are obvious: no downtime due to scaling issues, significantly decreased costs (no need for extra servers), easy debugging from a single point of entry from the developer side, among other things.</p>
<h3>4. Headless CMS</h3>
<p>Headless technology eliminates page templates, backend code, and other cumbersome components that can slow down a website. Gi<a href="https://medium.com/tech-tajawal/why-headless-cms-is-becoming-so-popular-57d262b1e096"></a>ven that consumer expectations are always on the rise, the headless approach enables businesses to quickly enhance their platform&#8217;s performance so they can better handle spikes in traffic or increases in sales volume without having to create new pages or otherwise employ unnecessary resources for delivering an optimized experience.</p>

<h3>5. Conversational commerce</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/04/chatbots">Chatbots</a> help to increase engagement with your customers, provide personalized experiences, and offer faster support. You can use them to answer common questions, suggest products, route leads, or make announcements. Using chatbots for direct sales is also on the rise: around 60% of millennials are buying basic goods like food and clothes via conversational software.</p>

<h2>Ecommerce marketing trends 2022</h2>
<p>While we see new strategies emerge each year, there is often overlap with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/31/2020-ecommerce-marketing-trends">ecommerce marketing trends</a> from one year to the next. Below is a mix of new and emerging trends to jump on.</p>
<h3>6. Shoppable live streams</h3>
<p>More and more users prefer to engage with their products using a video rather than just pictures. In 2022 there will be a stronger focus on creating videos that personalize the experience while interacting with your products or services.</p>
<p>Remember good old-fashioned home shopping channels? Well they’ve made a bit of a comeback, namely via streaming channels. Think YouTube, Facebook Live and Switch. The premise is pretty much the same &#8211; except your presenter is an influencer. It’s unedited, and the audience can interact with the host in real-time. It boomed during the pandemic as it offered customers a safer way to shop, but it’s showing no sign of going anywhere fast. In fact, in November 2021 alone, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/13/digital-marketing-trends-2022">Moriarty’s made $30,000 from its livestream show</a>.</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-live-example.png" alt="ecommerce marketing - shoppable youtube live example" width="720" height="322" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53600" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-live-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-live-example-480x215.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></h3>
<h3>7. Buy online, pick up in store (BOPIS)</h3>
<p>This trend, also known as click and collect, surged <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2020/05/12/april-digital-economy-index-how-covid-19-continues-to-shift-e-commerce-trends">208%</a> during the peak of the pandemic—but this convenient shopping method will continue to be important.</p>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="https://hbr.org/2021/05/how-buy-online-pick-up-in-store-gives-retailers-an-edge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">75% </a>of shoppers who have used BOPIS say they will continue using these services after the pandemic.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/us-consumers-use-buy-online-pickup-in-store-2019-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">85%</a> of consumers who have used BOPIS say that they have made additional unplanned in-store purchases when picking up an order placed online.</li>
<li>An <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/05/how-buy-online-pick-up-in-store-gives-retailers-an-edge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HBR study</a> showed that one company&#8217;s sales dropped by over 5% as a result of a competitor launching a BOPIS service.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ecommerce-marketing-trends-BOPIS.png" alt="ecommerce marketing trends - buy online pick up in store" width="720" height="453" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59245" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ecommerce-marketing-trends-BOPIS.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ecommerce-marketing-trends-BOPIS-480x302.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>8. Virtual payment methods</h3>
<p>Cryptocurrencies saw a huge rise in popularity over the last year, and we expect this trend to continue – but only after overcoming some hurdles.</p>
<p>These currencies (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum) don&#8217;t yet have the big-name recognition necessary for wide-scale adoption, but they will become more widespread as people see how cryptocurrencies work. While cryptocurrencies don&#8217;t make sense for every business, those who do adopt them could provide an edge over their competition due to reduced fees and faster payment processing times.</p>
<p>Mobile payments is another field that has seen enormous growth: According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/911914/number-apple-pay-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statista</a>, Global iPhone users that activated Apple Pay grew by more than 65 million people in 2020, with the number of people using Android Pay also on the increase. Mobile payments now account for one-third of digital purchases, and this is expected to rise as alternative methods such as Bitcoin gain further traction.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ecommerce-marketing-trends-apple-pay.png" alt="ecommerce marketing trends - growth of apple pay" width="720" height="546" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59246" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ecommerce-marketing-trends-apple-pay.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ecommerce-marketing-trends-apple-pay-480x364.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>9. B2B ecommerce</h3>
<p>The lines between B2C and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/02/b2b-marketing-strategies">B2B marketing</a> are becoming increasingly blurred, and the global B2B ecommerce market is expected to reach <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/business-to-business-b2b-e-commerce-market">$256 trillion</a> by 2028. This can be attributed not only to advancements in technology and the corresponding reductions in costs, but also because these companies are feeling pressure to keep up – and growing their turnover online is an increasingly popular option.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/18/ecommerce-tools-for-local-business">ecommerce tools for small and local businesses</a> become more widely available, we&#8217;ll see more B2B businesses, large and small, shifting to online or creating an ecommerce revenue stream.</p>
<h3>10. Augmented reality</h3>
<p>Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are predicted to have a big year, and not just in the ecommerce world! In fact, <a href="https://mobidev.biz/blog/augmented-reality-trends-future-ar-technologies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysts </a>predict that the AR market will reach $198 billion in 2025. That&#8217;s a lot of money!</p>
<p>AR is great for ecommerce because it can create an interactive and engaging experience for customers. For example, they can try on clothes or accessories without having to go into a physical store, or they could see how furniture would look in their home before making a purchase. This is an important trend to tap into.<a href="https://techsee.me/blog/augmented-reality-use-cases/"><br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://swankyagency.com/augmented-reality-fashion-ecommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<h3>11. Omnichannel experience</h3>
<p>The omnichannel experience is proving a big trend for 2022. Customers want to be able to switch seamlessly between different devices and platforms when shopping. If they start a purchase on their phone, they should be able to finish it on their laptop, and companies that aren’t up to scratch will miss out.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ecommerce-marketing-trends-omnichannel.jpeg" alt="ecommerce marketing trends - omnichannel marketing" width="720" height="443" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59250" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ecommerce-marketing-trends-omnichannel.jpeg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ecommerce-marketing-trends-omnichannel-480x295.jpeg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.knorex.com/blog/articles/omnichannel-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>Customers say that being able to use more than one channel while shopping is important to them. This makes perfect sense when you consider how people now use technology: we often move between devices several times a day, so it&#8217;s only natural that we would want our shopping experience to reflect that.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, according to <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/01/a-study-of-46000-shoppers-shows-that-omnichannel-retailing-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one study</a>, customers who used 4+ channels spent 9% more in the store, on average, when compared to those who used just one channel.</p>
<h2>Align with these ecommerce marketing trends</h2>
<p>We&#8217;re spending more money online than ever before, making it more important than ever for ecommerce sites to optimize performance and for traditional businesses to incorporate ecommerce into their strategy. Use these ecommerce website and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2024-ecommerce-trends">marketing trends</a> to guide you in growing your business this year and beyond:</p>

<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/02/target-roas">What is Target ROAS in Google Ads &#038; When Should I Use It?</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those who are conversion-focused in their paid search strategy, maximizing the profitability of your advertising efforts is a top priority. Google offers a variety of Smart Bidding strategies that can allow you to drive more conversions at a cost you are comfortable with. However, if you want to take that strategy to the next level and focus solely on driving a positive return on investment, you may want to consider Target ROAS (tROAS) bidding. This automated bidding strategy isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution to making every advertiser money on Google Ads, however, for many, it can make a huge impact. In this post, I will dive into:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is Target ROAS?</li>
<li>Who should use it</li>
<li>How to set your tROAS</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ll also be sharing tips throughout to get the most out of your budget. Let&#8217;s begin.</p>
<h2><span>What is Target ROAS?</span></h2>
<p><span>Target ROAS or “tROAS&#8221; stands for “target return on ad spend” and falls under Google’s category of Smart Bidding strategies. These are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/19/google-ads-automated-bidding">automated bid strategies</a> that use “auction-time bidding”—meaning Google will optimize for conversion or conversion value in every auction that you enter. </span></p>
<h2><span><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/google-ads-bidding-strategies-chart.png" alt="what is target roas - google ads bidding strategies chart" width="700" height="430" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58094" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/google-ads-bidding-strategies-chart.png 700w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/google-ads-bidding-strategies-chart-480x295.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" /></span></h2>
<p><strong>What is ROAS?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/16/return-on-ad-spend-roas">Return on ad spend</a> measures the amount of revenue your business earns for each dollar it spends on advertising. It&#8217;s ROI, where the investment is your spend on ads—in this case, Google Ads. You can measure ROAS at the account, campaign, ad group, and ad level in Google Ads. In the case of bidding strategies, these are set at the portfolio, campaign, or ad group level.</p>
<h2><span>The path to Target ROAS</span></h2>
<p><span>In order to truly understand tROAS, you need to understand its relatives on the bidding strategy evolutionary tree.</span></p>
<h3>Max Conversions</h3>
<p><span>Maximize Conversions or “Max Conversions” is an automated bid strategy that is designed to get you as many conversions as possible within your daily budget. This automated setting has a number of pros and cons that I won&#8217;t go too far into in this post—you can find the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/19/google-ads-automated-bidding">pros and cons of every automated bidding strategy here</a>)—but I will say that <strong>conversion quality is not taken into consideration </strong>when using this bidding strategy as Google bids aggressively for you in order to drive as many conversions as possible. It is essentially a stripped-down version of the next two strategies.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-roas-max-conversions-bidding.png" alt="target roas vs maximize conversions bidding strategy" width="720" height="233" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57895" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-roas-max-conversions-bidding.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-roas-max-conversions-bidding-480x155.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Target CPA</h3>
<p><span>Target CPA stands for Target Cost Per Action and is the next level on the conversion-focused automated bidding evolutionary scale. This is an additional option within Max Conversions that allows you to specify a desired target cost per action (also known as cost per acquisition (different from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/09/lower-customer-acquisition-cost">customer acquisition cost</a>). Google adjusts bids in order to meet the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/19/conversion-rate-benchmarks">average cost per conversion</a> number you&#8217;ve specified.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-cpa-google-ads-bidding.png" alt="target CPA bidding in google ads" width="720" height="416" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57898" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-cpa-google-ads-bidding.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-cpa-google-ads-bidding-480x277.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Max Conversion Value</h3>
<p><span>This bidding strategy works very similarly to the Max Conversions Strategy but instead of optimizing for conversion <em>volume</em>, it looks to maximize <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/25/conversion-value">conversion <em>value</em></a>. In order to use this strategy (and tROAS for that matter) you will have to have <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/10/how-to-determine-conversion-value">assigned conversion values</a> for the actions you are looking to drive. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-roas-google-ads-max-conv-value.png" alt="target roas vs target cpa bidding strategy google ads" width="720" height="267" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57900" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-roas-google-ads-max-conv-value.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-roas-google-ads-max-conv-value-480x178.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span>This means that if you are driving simple<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/31/google-lead-form-extensions"> lead form submissions</a> without any direct value associated with them, then you wouldn&#8217;t use either of these bidding strategies.</span></p>
<h3><span>Target ROAS </span></h3>
<p><span>Target ROAS is located under the Max Conversion Value option:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-roas-max-conv-value-google-ads-bidding.png" alt="target roas vs max conversion value bidding strategy in google ads" width="720" height="180" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57899" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-roas-max-conv-value-google-ads-bidding.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-roas-max-conv-value-google-ads-bidding-480x120.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Google Ads predicts future conversions and associated values (using those conversion values you have assigned on the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/24/google-ads-conversion-tracking"> conversion tracking</a> level). Google will then set maximum cost-per-click bids to maximize your conversion value while attempting to achieve an average return on ad spend equal to the target that you have specified.</span></p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the difference between tCPA and tROAS?</strong></p>
<p><span>These two bidding strategies operate very similarly, but the </span>main difference between Target CPA and Target ROAS  is that while Target CPA adjusts your bids to meet a predefined cost per conversion goal, Target ROAS adjusts bids to maximize the value of those conversions.</p>
<h3><span>When to use Target ROAS bidding strategy</span></h3>
<p>In order to properly use tROAS, you have to assign values to conversion actions. By nature of the name “return on ad spend” these conversion values should reflect revenue that you generate as a result of the users converting on your ads.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t use tROAS if:</strong> your Google Ads conversions do not generate a direct return on investment (i.e., ebook downloads or free tools).</li>
<li><strong>Do use tROAS if:</strong> your Google Ads conversions do drive a direct return on investment (i.e, online sales).</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s run through some examples to see if tROAS is the correct strategy for your business:</p>
<p><strong>Scenario #1:</strong> You run or work for a business that needs to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/25/lead-qualification">drive qualified leads</a> to a sales team. Your conversion actions revolve around signing up for a sales demo in addition to some ebook downloads.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-roas-request-demo.png" alt="what is target roas in google ads - request a demo example" width="720" height="405" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57904" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-roas-request-demo.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-roas-request-demo-480x270.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In this scenario, you may be better off with Max Conversions or Target CPA bidding. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/25/optimize-lead-generation-process">Driving leads to a sales team</a>, no matter how qualified, always has a cycle that is not immediate. It takes time for sales representatives to get prospects on the phone and then for those prospects to subsequently complete the purchase process.</p>
<p>Now if you really wanted to, you could <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7538740?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connect Salesforce to Google Ads</a> and in that scenario, you would be able to utilize tROAS. However, you would need to be rather savvy with Salesforce or work with someone who is in order to set this up properly. <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Scenario #2:</strong> You run an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/08/how-to-build-an-ecommerce-website">ecommerce store</a> that allows users to directly buy or order from your website. In this scenario, tROAS would be recommended as your conversions have direct values associated with them. Whether you offer one or multiple products for different prices, tROAS would allow you to optimize each campaign to generate its desired return on investment.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-roas-google-ads-shopping-results.png" alt="what is target roas in google ads - google shopping results" width="720" height="294" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57903" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-roas-google-ads-shopping-results.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-roas-google-ads-shopping-results-480x196.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2><span>How to set up tROAS</span></h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/03/increase-sales-online">business that sells online</a> or sees a direct return on investment from conversion actions, you have a couple of options in regards to set-up prior to running a tROAS bid strategy on your campaign(s). How you decide to set up conversion values will subsequently dictate <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/25/google-shopping-ads-priority-bidding-structure">how you structure your campaigns to optimize for ROAS</a>.</p>
<h3>Setting up conversion values</h3>
<p>You have the ability to assign conversion values to either existing or newly created conversion actions within your Google Ads account. In the top right of your Google Ads dashboard, select the “Tools and Settings” icon and then “Conversions” under measurement:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-roas-google-ads-conversions.png" alt="what is target roas in google ads - conversion value setup in google ads" width="720" height="294" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57896" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-roas-google-ads-conversions.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-roas-google-ads-conversions-480x196.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Once there, create a new conversion or select the one you want to edit. Within the settings for your conversion, there will be a section labeled “Value&#8221;:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-roas-google-ads-conversion-action-settings.png" alt="what is target roas in google ads - conversion action settings" width="720" height="447" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57897" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-roas-google-ads-conversion-action-settings.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-roas-google-ads-conversion-action-settings-480x298.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll then have two options to assign value to your conversion:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use the same value for every conversion:</strong> This assigns a fixed value to the lead or purchase. For example, if you only sell one type of product, enter the value of each sale.</li>
<li><strong>Use different values for each conversion: </strong>If you sell multiple products at different prices, you can assign a unique value to each conversion. You (or a web developer) will need to edit the Google Tag on your website for this to work. For more information on this, head to <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6095947?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google&#8217;s help article on transaction-specific conversion values</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>What should I set my target ROAS to?</h3>
<p>When selecting tROAS as your bidding strategy, you&#8217;ll notice that you&#8217;ll have to specify a percentage of return that you would like the campaign to target:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-roas-max-conversion-value.png" alt="target roas option in the max conversion value bidding strategy in google ads" width="720" height="421" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57902" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-roas-max-conversion-value.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-roas-max-conversion-value-480x281.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>When determining this percentage, take into consideration a couple of factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>The conversion value(s) you are optimizing for</li>
<li>ROAS = (revenue/ad spend) X 100</li>
<li>ROAS does not take into account everything that ROI does</li>
</ol>
<p>So for example, if you spend $50 to generate $100 in revenue, your ROAS for that campaign would be 200%. But although that looks great, it does not take into consideration everything involved in your business side. This is why it&#8217;s important to plan your target ROAS so that it maximizes profitability for your business and its goals.</p>
<h2>Final tips for tROAS</h2>
<p>On a platform as complex as Google Ads, choosing the right bidding strategy for your campaigns is one of many important decisions marketers have to make.</p>
<p>Google’s Smart Bidding has proven to be an effective method to optimize Search, Display, and Shopping campaigns. Outside of intelligent campaign planning and structure, the most important factor in efficient Smart Bidding is how much data Google is receiving to make the proper optimizations for you.</p>
<p>Correctly establishing the proper tracking is half the battle when it comes to running successful tROAS campaigns. You will want to make the necessary adjustments at the ad group level as well as make data-driven decisions in regards to the ROAS percentage that you are trying to accomplish. Google Ads is a marathon, not a race, and it is important to keep this in mind if your efforts don’t appear to be successful on the first try.</p>

<p>​​Congratulations! You’ve gotten through the tough part of Google Shopping: getting your account and your shopping feed running. But are you getting the most out of your campaigns?</p>
<p>Today, we&#8217;re going to show you a Google Shopping campaign structure that will help you to get the highest return on your ad spend. It’s called the priority bidding structure.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="3f828d38-08e8-4fe3-b570-af2d82e66a5b" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-shopping-priority-bidding-structure.png" width="715" height="497" alt="google shopping priority biding structure simple version" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>It’s a bit involved but I’m going to walk you through it. We’ll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>How the priority bidding structure maximizes your ROAS</li>
<li>Everything you need to know to implement it in your account</li>
<li>Additional bidding, subdivision, and keyword tips to get your best results yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you want to save on spend without sacrificing growth, read on!</p>
<h2>What is the priority bidding campaign structure?</h2>
<p>To understand this structure, you&#8217;ll first need to know that when you create a Google Shopping campaign, there is a priority setting feature. All campaigns default to &#8220;low,&#8221; but you can set campaigns to medium or high.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="5884abae-90d3-42b9-a64d-e49e76efa876" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-shopping-priority-settings.png" width="720" height="371" alt="google shopping ad setup: priority settings tab" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Normally, if you have multiple campaigns (all at the default &#8220;low&#8221; priority) that could all enter the auction for the same search, Google will just choose the highest bidding campaign. But by setting different priorities, you can have Google choose campaigns regardless of bids.</p>
<h2>Why use the priority bidding structure?</h2>
<p>Let’s say that you’re a clothing company and Levi&#8217;s 311 Skinny Jeans is one of your products.</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll want to capture users who simply search “jeans” as this will expand your brand awareness and capture top-of-funnel traffic.</li>
<li>But you&#8217;ll <em>also</em> want to capture users who search &#8220;levi&#8217;s jeans&#8221; since these searchers will be more likely to convert.</li>
<li>And you&#8217;ll <em>definitely</em> want to capture users who search &#8220;levi&#8217;s 311 skinny jeans.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the volume and quality of traffic for each of those terms is going to be different. You&#8217;ll want to keep your bids low for those high traffic generic product searches so you&#8217;re not capturing too many low-converting clicks. And you&#8217;ll want to keep your bids high for those specific terms that have high purchase intent.</p>
<p>The priority bidding structure allows you to do this, making it so that you only have high spend on clicks that bring in a high return.</p>
<h2>How the Google Shopping priority bidding structure works</h2>
<p>With the priority bidding structure, you’ll have your campaigns split out so you can raise and lower your bids <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/23/shopping-campaign-optimization">according to search intent</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what it looks like.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="ed2a20bd-ebdf-46f4-89d4-68316dbb7b6d" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-shopping-priority-bidding-campaign-structure.png" alt="google shopping priority bidding campaign structure" width="720" height="487" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54252" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-shopping-priority-bidding-campaign-structure.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-shopping-priority-bidding-campaign-structure-480x325.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></article>
</div>
<p>So, back to our jeans example, you&#8217;ll have three campaigns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Campaign A: </strong>This campaign negates brand and brand+style keywords to only capture generic searches (like &#8220;jeans&#8221;), resulting in a low-risk, “wide net” functionality. Your bids are low and the priority is set to high.</li>
<li><strong>Campaign B: </strong>This campaign negates brand+style keywords to only capture branded searches (like &#8220;levi jeans&#8221;) and you set average bids so you can bid competitively and attract this more qualified traffic. Priority is set to medium.</li>
<li><strong>Campaign C: </strong>Because of campaign A and B&#8217;s negatives, this campaign will only capture spot-on searchers that are ready to convert. Your bids are high and priority is set to low.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, because you&#8217;ve assigned different negative keywords, bids, and priority settings to each campaign, Google will know to enter the appropriate bidding campaign for each type of search intent—preventing wasted spend on low-value clicks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader"><strong><em>Speaking of wasted spend, identify even more ways to maximize your budget using our Free Google Ads Performance Grader.</em></strong></a></p>
<h2>Bidding strategies for the Shopping priority structure</h2>
<p>Unlike Search and Display, there is no keyword or group bidding available, so <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/03/04/google-shopping-campaigns-tips-tricks">Google Shopping best practices</a> are a bit different.</p>
<p>However, the beauty of the priority structure is that it guides you on how you should be adjusting your bids. And, these are the three <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/19/google-ads-automated-bidding">bidding strategies</a> that you’ll want to adjust:</p>
<h3>1. Manual bidding</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re just dipping your toes into <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/shoppable-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shoppable ads</a>, manual bidding is a safe bet. Tried and true, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/30/switch-automatic-bidding-to-manual">manual bidding</a> allows you to dictate how much you’re willing to spend per click—in this case for products of a specific product group.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="db0fdf4a-7405-4b8a-b7fb-ad24a27979d1" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-shopping-ads-average-cpc.jpeg" width="500" height="509" alt="google shopping ads average CPC" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/01/shopping-ads-benchmarks" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Check your CPC against Google Shopping ads benchmarks here.</a> </em></p>
<p>You’ll have full control over your bids, but of course, depending on the size of your Shopping account, you’ll have to carve out time to tediously manage bids.</p>
<h3>2. Maximize clicks</h3>
<p>Maximize clicks is great for Shopping because it focuses on that end goal of driving traffic to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/08/how-to-build-an-ecommerce-website">your ecommerce site</a>. In comparison to manual bidding, maximize clicks has the option to layer on a max CPC bid limit at the campaign level—which helps keep the automated strategy a bit more in control while saving you time on individual bids.</p>
<p>The option to set a bid cap is a game changer for Shopping campaigns on max clicks, because <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/13/learning-period">Google’s algorithm</a> is solely focused on pulling in as many clicks as possible within your budget—even if it means that the cost of a click that leads to a conversion is unusually high.</p>
<p>If you want to leverage max clicks on your Shopping campaign, the trick is to set a max CPC bid, but set one realistic to where <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/17/lower-cost-per-click">your current CPC</a> is at.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="de77a705-0e0a-4787-9d35-2c4c5906ee58" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-shopping-bidding-models-analysis/370771/"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>While you may not be able to adjust individual bids, you can still make priority bidding work on Max clicks by tweaking your Max CPC bid according to each campaign priority.</p>
<h3>3. Target ROAS</h3>
<p>I saved the best for last! Target return on ad spend (or tROAS) is one of the most common Shopping bid strategies because it focuses on a popular Shopping metric: <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/16/return-on-ad-spend-roas">ROAS</a>.</p>
<p>ROAS is somewhat more relevant to Shopping than CPC because it takes into account the value of a purchase, rather than just the path to the purchase itself. For example, you could have a low CPA due to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/17/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate"> a high conversion rate</a> in relation to your CPC, but if all those purchases are below $5 you’re most likely not pulling in a healthy return.</p>
<p>Similar to setting a max click bid cap, you’ll want to set a target ROAS in a healthy spot above where your current ROAS lies, but also where your priorities lie.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="d4b95499-970f-450f-b539-6acc4279b5e6" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-shopping-priority-bidding-structure-maximize-conversion-value-target-roas-example.png" width="720" height="207" alt="target ROAS option in google ads" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>For tROAS and priority bidding, you need to think about how the algorithm bids according to your target. When the target is higher, it will bid lower to maximize your return (therefore, applying to your high priority/low bid campaign) and vice versa.</p>
<h2>Product subdivisions with the Google Shopping priority structure</h2>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">You’ll notice that each of the campaigns in the priority structure subdivides by product type. Think of subdividing as an opportunity to bid more specifically on groups of products in your inventory based on priority and appeal. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Start by identifying which products in your inventory are the most important or that would drive the most revenue. From there, you can <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6275317?hl=en">start subdividing by product type</a> within each campaign to set a higher bid with your priority items and a lower bid with your lower margin products.</span></p>

</div>
<h2>Negative keyword tips for Google Shopping priority bidding</h2>
<p>We know that, since Google Shopping relies on product attributes over keywords, a negative keyword list can make or break your shopping campaign. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/04/negative-keyword-list">A thought-out negative keyword list</a> will help direct your Shopping searches to the correct priority campaigns at the different stages of your funnel.</p>
<p>As we covered earlier, you want to funnel your product-specific terms down to the high intent, bottom campaign by negating those terms out of the top-of-funnel campaign.</p>

<p>Your Google Shopping negative keywords could also vary by your goals and specific situation. For example, there may be some competitor brand names that you don’t want to show for because those auctions are more expensive and may cause you to have a lower click-through rate.</p>
<p>Negating out your own brand name is another common practice in the priority-based Shopping structure. This is because people who search for you specifically may be <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-run-customer-loyalty-programs/">repeat customers</a> or have a high likelihood of converting—which are worth a high bid.</p>

<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://www.storegrowers.com/negative-keywords/"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>And the best way to find negative keywords is through the <a href="/blog/ws/2021/09/16/google-ads-search-terms-report-changes" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">search terms report</a>. While it doesn’t give us the complete full picture anymore, you can still get an idea of the types of searches you’re showing for and whether your SERP results are too broad or too narrow.</p>
<h2>Get your [Shopping] priorities straight!</h2>
<p>As you can now see, the priority-based <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/23/shopping-campaign-optimization">Google Shopping campaign structure</a> allows you to tell Google where you want your valuable bids to go. With the ability to raise and lower your bids according to the stage of funnel each campaign is targeting, you can avoid wasting spend on irrelevant clicks and maximize your ROAS.</p>

<p>As people have adapted to an uptick in at-home working, online engagement has surged. In 2020, retail ecommerce sales grew <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/global-ecommerce-update-2021#page-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">27.6%</a> year over year, which totals $4.3 trillion. This opens up opportunities for ecommerce businesses but also presents the challenge of standing out.</p>
<p>If you want to improve your customers&#8217; experience, cultivate a connection with them, and ultimately boost sales and retention, personalizing your buyers&#8217; journey is essential.</p>

</div>
<p>Think about how traditional brick-and-mortar businesses personalize things for their patrons. Employees get to know their most frequent customers, throw in freebies they know they like, take note of the most (and least) popular products, and more. With today&#8217;s technology and some creative thinking, you can offer the same personalization in your ecommerce strategy.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll be covering in this guide. We&#8217;re going to talk through five ways to turn your buyers&#8217; journey into an experience they&#8217;ll want to repeat:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create personalized homepages</li>
<li>Display recently viewed items</li>
<li>Cater to location</li>
<li>Develop campaigns based on user behavior</li>
<li>Personalize your emails</li>
<li>Make recommendations</li>
</ol>
<p>But first, let&#8217;s go over the basics.</p>
<h2>What is ecommerce personalization?</h2>
<p>Personalization is vital to a successful <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/12/18/ecommerce-marketing-strategies">ecommerce marketing strategy</a>. What we&#8217;re referring to is the art of delivering a shopping experience catered to individuals, based on their behaviors and the information they&#8217;ve provided to you. The more personalized you get, the more they&#8217;ll engage with your business, and the more they engage with your business, the more information you have to customize even more. The result? An <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/04/interactive-content">interactive</a> experience with your users that improves their satisfaction and drives the results you want.</p>
<p><strong>Personalization programs can yield <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/personalizing-the-customer-experience-driving-differentiation-in-retail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20%</a> higher customer satisfaction rates and a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/personalizing-the-customer-experience-driving-differentiation-in-retail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10-15%</a> increase in sales conversion rates. </strong></p>
<p>In addition, by delivering highly relevant content, you can avoid wasting time and money on marketing material they are not interested in.</p>
<h2>What to consider before personalizing your ecommerce strategy</h2>
<p>Before you start deploying ecommerce personalization strategies, there are important things you need to consider. You need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A way to collect data on users. This includes behavioral, demographic, and transactional data you collect through <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-run-customer-loyalty-programs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loyalty programs</a> and cookies (but hopefully, <a href="/blog/ws/2021/04/12/first-party-data">first-party data</a>).</li>
<li>A way to analyze the collected data. From there, you can aggregate pools of visitors for specific marketing campaigns.</li>
<li>A way to deliver an experience to each <a href="/blog/ws/2017/08/28/behavioral-segmentation">segment</a> effectively.</li>
</ul>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="82cfe12a-6faf-4c33-a802-c6717b3ade17" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/personalize-ecommerce-customer-journey-what-to-consider-1.png" alt="personalize-ecommerce-customer-journey-what-to-consider" width="800" height="318" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Once you establish your targeting rules, you can then set up conditions in your marketing software to personalize content based on that criteria. For example, you may want to send a personalized email with an offer to any customers inactive for more than 60 days.</p>
<p>Another option for implementation is to use machine learning. AI technology is getting better and better at making large-scale and complex processes (like individual personalization) simple. The two strategies of human versus computer do not need to be mutually exclusive. For example, <a href="https://www.automationanywhere.com/rpa/robotic-process-automation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">robotic process automation (RPA)</a> uses robots that learn, mimic, and execute rules-based business processes. They interact with the application or system the same way a human would, except they can operate around the clock with reliability and precision.</p>
<h2>How to personalize your customers&#8217; ecommerce journey</h2>
<p>Now that we have a foundation of what ecommerce personalization is and where to start, let&#8217;s look at the different ways you can create an individualized <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/19/customer-journey-map-templates">customer journey </a>for your users. Keep in mind that even though <a href="/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing">personalization</a> can lead to significant payoffs in customer satisfaction and conversions, it still requires resources. Consider the feasibility of personalization within your <a href="/blog/ws/2021/01/04/best-marketing-strategies-2021">marketing strategy</a>. Depending on your industry and audience, some of the methods below may be easier to implement or effective than others. So aim to deliver an impactful experience that makes it worth the investment.</p>
<h3>1. Create personalized homepages</h3>
<p>This type of personalization is suited for existing users. When a customer is logged into their account, you will be able to deliver welcome pages that highlight offers and items most likely to be of interest to that individual.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="d3abecdb-391a-48db-b178-61397c259b3d" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>The offers on their personalized homepages can include things like time-sensitive <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/13/sales-promotion-examples">promotions</a> or suggestions based on previous purchases. These can help encourage customers to move through your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/01/ecommerce-sales-funnel">ecommerce sales funnel</a>, which illustrates the process an individual undertakes to go from potential customer to loyal customer.</p>
<h3>2. Display recently viewed items</h3>
<p>Users may browse your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/08/how-to-build-an-ecommerce-website">ecommerce site</a> multiple times before placing items of interest in their carts. Allowing them to see items they’ve already clicked on provides that nudge to resume their browsing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="6fc09388-8b28-4eb9-943e-399c6553317c" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/personalize-ecommerce-customer-journey-recently-viewed-1.png" alt="personalize-ecommerce-customer-journey-recently-viewed" width="798" height="453" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">You can go one step further and create offers on these recently viewed products. This can make the difference between a customer committing to a product or leaving it behind. Or if you offer free shipping, they may be more likely to throw additional items in their <a href="/blog/ws/2016/03/17/shopping-cart-abandonment">cart</a>. It may also be a good idea to create a sense of urgency by making the offer time-sensitive.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Recently viewed items can be located on the homepage or a landing page linked to from a marketing email. However, they can also be located at the bottom of all the pages in your ecommerce store. This allows customers to keep track of all the items in which they were interested enough to click on. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Keeping data on recently viewed items requires aggregating customer data. If you do not want to spend the time and money on the infrastructure to protect and carry out the storage and utilization of this data, consider investing in an IaaS offering. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ringcentral.co.uk/gb/en/blog/definitions/infrastructure-as-a-service-iaas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What is IaaS?</a> It is Infrastructure as a Service, a type of online computing infrastructure. IaaS delivers computing resources over the internet and can be scaled and financed according to demand. Servers, hardware, virtualization, and cloud storage are all handled through your IaaS product.</p>
<h3>3. Cater your offerings to location</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">If you have a business with a large reach or an <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/06/international-google-ads">international market</a>, consider personalizing your ecommerce feeds based on location, such as by displaying items in the local currency and language. Many <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/enterprise-ecommerce-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enterprise ecommerce</a> platforms are customizable to suit your business’s specific needs and can handle a higher volume of clients.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">This personalization can also be directed regionally. For example, if you run an online clothing store, you will have different items based on the season. However, the winter season in California is different than that of Michigan. Catering to <a href="/blog/ws/2020/06/30/weather-based-facebook-targeting">climates</a> and regional fashion styles can make your campaigns that much more effective.</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e6a264fd-b6bc-4013-94e4-26fb3d13f8ec" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/personalize-ecommerce-customer-journey-fashion-1.png" alt="personalize ecommerce customer journey fashion" width="800" height="578" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>As you can see, what is considered &#8220;comfortable clothing&#8221; varies by country (Source: <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/search/business-casual-fashion-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a>).</em></p>
<h3>4. Develop special campaigns based on user behavior</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Your customers’ needs and interests vary, so why offer them the same products? This type of personalization requires the collection of data on how users interact with your website. Using that data, you can then employ <a href="/blog/ws/2017/08/28/behavioral-segmentation">behavioral segmentation</a> to create special campaigns for specific groups within your customer base</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">You can use this strategy to target both existing and <a href="/blog/ws/2015/02/10/google-display-network-targeting">new customers</a>. For example, you can offer first-time visitors an incentive to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/11/call-to-action-examples-for-email-newsletter-signups">sign up for an email list </a>or loyalty program. If an existing customer has recently received items from your company, you can ask them to <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">leave a review</a>. </span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="9686e818-73d2-4cd6-b2c4-db324f6ffa83" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://www.modcloth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN"><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/reviews-matter-for-your-small-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reviews are vital </a>to any business&#8217;s success. In fact, <strong>if a product gets just five reviews, its likelihood of being purchased increases by </strong><strong><a href="https://learn.g2.com/customer-reviews-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">270%</a></strong><strong>. </strong> </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">As a customer interacts with your website over a period of time, you can offer them more personalized offers based on their interests. Some things to consider when developing personalized campaigns are: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">What is the user clicking on?</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">What pages do they frequently visit? </span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">What is in their cart or on their wish list? </span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">What category of products do they show particular interest in? </span></li>
<li>How long has it been since their last purchase?</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Personalize your emails</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">In the world today, there are <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3.9 billion</a> daily email users. That gives businesses an excellent opportunity to connect with their audience, but with so many users comes high competition. So how can you stand out in your subscribers&#8217; inboxes? Personalization.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">If a customer has <a href="/blog/ws/2014/08/05/increase-email-signups">opted in for marketing emails</a>, you can use their behavioral data to send them offers and information targeted at their interests. They&#8217;ll be much more likely to click on your links. Just be sure to include personalization in your<a href="/blog/ws/2014/03/31/email-subject-lines"> subject lines</a> too—you&#8217;ve got to get them to open the email first! </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Sending these types of emails is beneficial for all types of ecommerce businesses. However, it may be a good way for DTC businesses to compete in a world that now includes businesses like Amazon. <a href="https://www.brightpearl.com/sales-channel-strategy/direct-to-consumer-dtc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What is DTC</a>? It stands for Direct to Consumer, and is a new way for manufacturers to eliminate the hassle of traditional distribution by delivering their products directly to consumers. </span></p>
<h3>6. Make product recommendations</h3>
<p><span lang="EN"><strong>Product recommendations account for 31% of ecommerce site revenues</strong>, according to a study by <a href="https://www.barilliance.com/personalized-product-recommendations-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barilliance</a>. This means that its cost-benefit potential for your business is impossible to ignore. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">If your <a href="/blog/ws/2021/01/11/increase-online-store-sales">online store</a> has a substantial number of products, a customer may lose interest before they find the product they love. Personalized recommendations act as a guide for your customers within your website. </span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0cacbed3-413b-416f-b71d-eaf2b5e44311" data-langcode="en">

<p><span lang="EN">If this was a brick-and-mortar store, the personalized recommendation portion would essentially be the employee that assists a customer in the changing room. They may not have loved that item, but what about this? Or, if you loved this item, here&#8217;s one just like it!</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">You can base these personalized recommendations on abandoned carts or on pages the user has visited. The more data you get on that user, the better recommendations you can give them. </span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">Personalization is a vital component of a successful <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/05/ecommerce-digital-marketing">ecommerce marketing strategy</a>. You want customers to have the same experience they would get at a brick-and-mortar store, from the comfort of their own home. </span></p>
