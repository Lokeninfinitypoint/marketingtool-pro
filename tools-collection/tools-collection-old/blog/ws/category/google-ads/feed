										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Performance Max campaigns are the farthest-reaching ads you can have on Google. In a single campaign, you can reach users on Google Search, Display, YouTube, Gmail, Discover, and Maps.</p>
<p>Advertisers using PMax can leverage many different types of assets that will be adjusted, combined, and reorganized to fit into each of the unique placements across those six channels. With that level of variability, it can be difficult to create compelling ads that fit into each place. Knowing what portion of an ad is going to show where, if you’re not already familiar with these ad placements, can be a challenge.</p>
<p>In this article, I&#8217;ll outline which assets from your ad unit can be used in which placements across the Google ecosystem so you’ll be able to create compelling ads that capture attention and convert.</p>

<h2>What does every PMax ad example include?</h2>
<p>Remember, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/performance-max" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PMax ads</a> shift and adapt to multiple placements that work best for your business. Check out the examples of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-audit-pmax-display-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all the possible PMax ad placements</a> below.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-placements.webp" alt="performance max placements" width="900" height="424" class="aligncenter wp-image-92109 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-placements.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-placements-480x226.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But what’s even more interesting is that not only can you reach all of these users in a single campaign, you can reach them in a single ad unit/asset group. Honestly, the ad builder is so large it’s impossible to get all of it in one screenshot, but the image below gives you a little taste of what’s in there.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-ad-builder.png" alt="pmax ad examples - performance max ad builder screenshot" width="750" height="631" class="aligncenter wp-image-95169 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-ad-builder.png 750w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-ad-builder-480x404.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>To give us a working vocabulary, let&#8217;s run through the asset types you can leverage in PMax asset group ad units and talk about what they are.</p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US" class="TextRun SCXW112171623 BCX0"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW112171623 BCX0"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span></span>Are common Google Ads mistakes preventing your PMax campaigns from bringing in results?</strong> Find out, and learn how to fix them, with our free guide to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/google-ads-mistakes?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_googleadsmistakes_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six common (but costly) Google Ads mistakes</a>!</p>
<div id="pmax-ad-examples-brand-guidelines"></div>
<h3>Brand guidelines</h3>
<p>The first portion of the ad unit will be your <strong>brand guidelines</strong>. This helps you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/23/how-brand-your-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">control how your brand will look</a> across many different placements in the Google ecosystem. These controls are pretty self-explanatory.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-brand-guidelines.png" alt="pmax ad examples - brand guidelines" width="840" height="363" class="aligncenter wp-image-95170 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-brand-guidelines.png 840w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-brand-guidelines-480x207.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 840px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/08/business-name-ideas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business name</a> is required to run a PMax campaign. The only issue is that it can only be 25 characters long. This can be either the name of the business or your outward-facing brand name, but it needs to stick within that character limit.</p>
<p>Next are your logos. You can add up to five, but again, you need to stick within Google’s guidelines. They require only the square logo, but I encourage you to also upload the landscape version. It just looks so much better in some placements.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-logos.png" alt="pmax ad examples - brand logos" width="356" height="359" class="aligncenter wp-image-95166 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-logos.png 356w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-logos-297x300.png 297w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-logos-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px" /></p>
<p>Last will be some optional features you can use under the “more options” dropdown. Here, you can input custom color hex codes to ensure Google uses the exact right colors from your brand guidelines. This will come in really helpful for some placements where they regularly add in accent colors to make your ads stand out. There’s also a dropdown to customize the font used in your ads in case you want some control there as well. The list isn’t huge, but it’s nice to have some options to choose from.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-custom-brand-colors.png" alt="pmax ad examples - brand colors" width="801" height="387" class="aligncenter wp-image-95171 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-custom-brand-colors.png 801w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-custom-brand-colors-480x232.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 801px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="pmax-ad-examples-ad-assets"></div>
<h3>Ad level assets</h3>
<p>Next come the core ad unit assets. These will be the main foundation of the ad units, and all are featured in most ad units across the other campaign types.</p>
<h4>Text components</h4>
<p>These are all short snippets of text that will be combined to create the ad units.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Headlines: </strong>Up to 15 headlines, three are required, each with up to 30 characters.</li>
<li><strong>Long Headlines: </strong>Up to five long headlines, one required, with up to 90 characters.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Up to five descriptions, two required, with up to 90 characters.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/performance-max-ad-examples-copy.png" alt="pmax ad examples - ad text assets" width="594" height="857" class="aligncenter wp-image-95168 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/performance-max-ad-examples-copy.png 594w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/performance-max-ad-examples-copy-480x693.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 594px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Visual components</h4>
<p>These visual components will be used only in placements that require them and help you to<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-make-your-business-stand-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> stand out from the competition</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Images</strong>: Up to 20 images, but the minimum requirement is two (one square image and one landscape image).</li>
<li><strong>Videos</strong>: Up to five videos; zero are required, though. But as you can see, if you don’t provide a video, then Google will automatically create one for you using other assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these assets will be used and combined in all sorts of different combinations, which we’ll cover later on.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/performance-max-ad-example-images-videos.png" alt="pmax ad examples - image and video assets" width="731" height="415" class="aligncenter wp-image-95167 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/performance-max-ad-example-images-videos.png 731w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/performance-max-ad-example-images-videos-480x273.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 731px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="pmax-ad-examples-expanded-assets"></div>
<h3>Expanded assets</h3>
<p>As a side note, the naming convention in this section is confusing simply because Google insists on using “assets” all over the place. For those of you who have been around a while, you’ll recognize these<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-assets"> assets formerly known as ad extensions</a>. For those of you who are new, these are effectively other portions of your ad that are fundamentally different from the regular headlines, descriptions, videos, and images from above.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sitelinks</strong>: Additional links that operate as landing pages, combined with a short headline of 25 characters and up to two 30-character descriptions.</li>
<li><strong>Call to action:</strong> A short call to action message like “Learn More” or “Contact Us” that will accompany your ad. You can select your preference from a dropdown of provided options or select Automated to let Google choose the one it believes makes the most sense.</li>
<li><strong>Callouts</strong>: Short snippets of text, 25 characters or less, that provide additional context to your ads.</li>
<li><strong>Structured snippets</strong>: A short list of items accompanied by a header category selected from a dropdown.</li>
<li><strong>Promotions</strong>: Show off sales or discounts alongside your ad to create more interest.</li>
<li><strong>Prices</strong>: Highlight prices of specific products or services on your site.</li>
<li><strong>Locations</strong>: Show relevant, physical locations to your target audience based on your Google Business information.</li>
<li><strong>Calls</strong>: Advertisers have the option to add a phone number to help generate calls from ads.</li>
<li><strong>Lead forms</strong>: A customizable form hosted by Google that can collect user data just like a form on your landing page.</li>
<li><strong>Messages</strong>: A feature allowing users to send your company a message through WhatsApp rather than going through a more traditional landing page conversion route.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Performance Max ad examples by placement</h2>
<p>Now that we have all of the building blocks out of the way, let’s start to look at some PMax ad examples across each of the networks Google hosts, so you’ll have an idea of what your ads could look like.</p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US" class="TextRun SCXW112171623 BCX0"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW112171623 BCX0"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span></span>PMax is an AI-powered campaign type, but did you know there are more ways to incorporate AI into your strategy?</strong> Download our free guide to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/ai-advertising?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_AIAdvertising_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 9 powerful ideas to use AI in Google and Facebook Ads</a>!</p>
<div id="pmax-ad-examples-search"></div>
<h3>Search</h3>
<p>More than likely, you’re already familiar with search ads on Google. Performance Max variants of those ads are pretty straightforward and mostly leverage the text components you provide in your asset group.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ads-pmax-ad-examples.webp" alt="google ads pmax ad examples - google search" width="717" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-95162 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ads-pmax-ad-examples.webp 717w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ads-pmax-ad-examples-480x402.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 717px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In the examples below, you can see the headlines and descriptions I’ve provided in all different combinations. Some have shorter versions of the ads, and some are longer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ads-pmax-ad-examples-serp.png" alt="pmax ad examples - search placement" width="756" height="629" class="aligncenter wp-image-95165 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ads-pmax-ad-examples-serp.png 756w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ads-pmax-ad-examples-serp-480x399.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 756px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Others have some of the assets we talked about earlier, and others don’t. They stick only to the text components.</p>
<p>While these ads do function very similarly to Responsive Search Ads, there is one big difference. Performance Max ads do not allow advertisers to pin assets into certain placements. Since these assets are used for all networks on Google, it doesn’t apply to all placements.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-headlines.png" alt="google ads pmax ad examples - ad headlines" width="721" height="499" class="aligncenter wp-image-95174 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-headlines.png 721w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-headlines-480x332.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 721px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>So when you’re writing your ads for Performance Max, keep the dynamism of RSAs in mind, but remember you don&#8217;t have the option to pin. All of these components can show in just about any combination, so it’s in your best interest to make sure all variants can combine with all other variants and still make a compelling ad.</p>
<div id="pmax-ad-examples-display"></div>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The display network variants for Performance Max ads have quite a wide range of spaces they can fit in. Because of that, there are lots of different examples we can look at to see how our same components will show up.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-dynamic.png" alt="pmax ad examples - display" width="821" height="337" class="aligncenter wp-image-95172 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-dynamic.png 821w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-dynamic-480x197.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 821px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>On mobile, ads can show with all different combinations of headlines, descriptions, images, and even videos.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-mobile.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - mobile" width="817" height="335" class="aligncenter wp-image-95175 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-mobile.webp 817w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-mobile-480x197.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 817px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Even in this next set, you can see that the colors of the ads are quite a bit different, and they include just one of the headlines in big text with small supporting text or the entirety of the video running with some surrounding text.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-dynamic-headlines.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - dynamic mobile search ads" width="964" height="394" class="aligncenter wp-image-95173 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-dynamic-headlines.webp 964w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-dynamic-headlines-480x196.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 964px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>When we get to the desktop examples, the ads look pretty similar, but they could show in either the top of the page&#8230;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-display.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - display desktop ads" width="604" height="398" class="aligncenter wp-image-95177 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-display.webp 604w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-display-480x316.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 604px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>&#8230; in between text, or&#8230;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-display-network.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - desktop display network" width="612" height="306" class="aligncenter wp-image-95157 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-display-network.webp 612w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-display-network-480x240.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 612px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>&#8230; on the right-hand rail.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-on-site.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - right hand rail" width="600" height="328" class="aligncenter wp-image-95156" /></p>
<p>As you can tell from the previews, these ads are going to show in placements where the user is engaging with a website external to Google. While search ads need to answer a user’s query, display ads need to capture their attention enough to make an impact. Providing assets to PMAX ads that are eye-catching and attention-grabbing will be very useful for the display placements.</p>
<div id="pmax-ad-examples-youtube"></div>
<h3>YouTube</h3>
<p>For each asset group, you can add up to five selected videos. But it’s important to know that all Performance Max ads will have video assets, even if you don’t include your own.</p>
<p>The message below that you&#8217;d see in the builder states that if you don’t provide your own videos, Google will make one for you with the image assets you provide. And let me tell you, those videos are…not super pretty. I highly encourage you to use your own compelling videos that follow the regular <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/15/youtube-algorithm">YouTube video best practices</a>.</p>

<p>Here are a few previews of what the YouTube placements will look like. Some use the image assets (which, yes, are cropped horribly in my examples), but others will use the videos. There are some with headlines and descriptions, others with long headlines.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-youtube.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - youtube placements" width="714" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-95160 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-youtube.webp 714w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-youtube-480x403.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 714px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-youtube-placements.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - youtube" width="737" height="616" class="aligncenter wp-image-95153 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-youtube-placements.webp 737w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-youtube-placements-480x401.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 737px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>It’s important to note that some of these variants have the title of the video included as well, so be sure the videos you utilize will combine well with the text and image assets you leverage, or else you may end up with some inconsistent ads.</p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US" class="TextRun SCXW168540966 BCX0"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW168540966 BCX0"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/26a1.png" alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span></span>PMax campaigns are just one strategy out of tons that SMBs are taking advantage of this year!</strong> Get the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/smb-marketing-trends-report/?cid=Web_LiQ_InContent_Guide_2026SmallBusinessMarketingTrendsReport_Download&amp;itm_source=localiq&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Small Business Marketing Trends Report for 2026</a> to find out what else beyond PMax you should be trying!</p>
<div id="pmax-ad-examples-discover"></div>
<h3>Discover</h3>
<p>Google Discover is likely one of the more unique placements for Performance Max ads, and if you don’t use the platform, this placement might seem a little mysterious to you.</p>
<p>Google Discover is a personalized content feed that proactively serves content on mobile devices in the Google app. This happens even before the user conducts a search and is based on their previous behaviors.</p>
<p>Using our same set of assets, here are a few looks at how a Performance Max can appear on Discover.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-discovery-ad-examples.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - discover" width="965" height="396" class="aligncenter wp-image-95154 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-discovery-ad-examples.webp 965w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-discovery-ad-examples-480x197.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 965px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>These ads look a bit like a cross between some of the display and YouTube placements. They leverage only the image assets and include headlines and descriptions, but just one of each.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that out of the images I have, they only used the landscape and square versions. There’s no preview option that leverages the more mobile-friendly 9&#215;16 format.</p>
<p>This content type promotion on a personal newsfeed should feel a bit like a social ad, and you’ll benefit from keeping social best practices in mind when writing variants that could show in the Discover feed.</p>
<div id="pmax-ad-examples-gmail"></div>
<h3>Gmail</h3>
<p>The last placement for Performance Max is<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/gmail-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Gmail ads</a>, and these are the only format that has two different views for each placement: one for the closed version and one for when the user opens the email line item.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-in-gmail.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - gmail" width="900" height="263" class="aligncenter wp-image-95161 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-in-gmail.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-in-gmail-480x140.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>On mobile, most of the closed versions are just text, but there is an option to have the image included. These also leverage headlines and descriptions, but no long headlines are to be found.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-gmail-1.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - gmail screenshot" width="900" height="348" class="aligncenter wp-image-95176 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-gmail-1.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-gmail-1-480x186.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Once those ads are opened, they all have images, but usually just repeat the same ad copy only in a bigger font.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-promotions.webp" alt="pmax gmail ad examples" width="966" height="343" class="aligncenter wp-image-95164 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-promotions.webp 966w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-promotions-480x170.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 966px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They look pretty similar on desktop devices. Relatively minimal copy in both the open and closed versions, but repeated in each. If anything, the headline disappears in the open version and is replaced by the image and a call-to-action button.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-gmail-inbox.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - gmail inbox ad" width="877" height="360" class="aligncenter wp-image-95163 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-gmail-inbox.webp 877w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-gmail-inbox-480x197.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 877px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The biggest priority for these ads is still to make sure that all components can work together, but also expect that they might need to stand alone. In the open version on desktop, there’s only the description text left behind to convey your messaging, and although my image has text in it, yours might not.</p>
<h2>How to recreate these PMax ad examples</h2>
<p>Performance Max ads have many, many iterations of how they can manifest depending on what platform your ads are triggered for. Overall, it’s important to keep the dynamism in mind. Some ad units leverage lots of components and need to make sense in any combination. Others use very few assets and also need to be compelling in just a short portion of text, and maybe an image. Your goal should be to make as many compelling components as possible and assume that they all can show alongside any other asset or by themselves and still be compelling as a whole.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AI is becoming an increasingly integral part of online marketing as more advertisers adopt “smart” options in platforms and use AI tools to help generate, manage, optimize, and report on campaigns.</p>
<p>But from another angle, AI has also been impacting how and where our ads can show in a Google search results page. Earlier this year, Google released AI Mode, a new user experience that will continue to change the SERP game. That announcement immediately prompted many people to ask, “What will ads in AI Mode look like, and how can I get my ads to show there?”</p>
<p>Google is now testing ads in AI Mode, so ahead of a larger rollout later this year, we want to give an overview of what AI Mode is, discuss the settings you need to employ to be included, and what that could mean for your advertising strategy moving forward.</p>

<h2>What is AI Mode in Google?</h2>
<p>AI Mode is a self-contained search experience designed to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-experiments">use AI</a> in a conversation-type experience to answer complex queries. It’s powered by <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-use-google-bard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gemini</a>, Google’s largest and most capable AI model, and compared to normal search, which is more of a one-and-done type of experience, AI Mode is intended to drive further research and learning with multiple rounds of questions or query refinement. It will then deliver a range of information based on how that exchange goes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ai-mode-example.webp" alt="example of google ai mode with query for how to fix sink" width="900" height="519" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94858" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ai-mode-example.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ai-mode-example-480x277.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As a quick aside, here’s the next question we almost always get after defining AI Mode: “Is AI Mode different from AI Overviews?”</p>
<p>In short, yes and no.</p>
<p>Yes, from the user experience, AI Mode is different from AI Overviews.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-overviews-statistics">AI Overviews</a> show up within the regular search results and are just a single component of that page of answers compared to AI Mode’s contained experience. They also don’t allow for direct reengagement based on the answers provided. You can click on the supporting documentation links or the ads in AI Overviews, but if you want to go further than that, you have to conduct another search, effectively losing the thread of the previous one, and you may or may not be served another AI Overview.</p>
<p>But also, no, AI Mode and AI Overviews are extremely closely related to each other. The information served in them is usually pretty close (you can compare by clicking between the AI Mode and All tabs in Google), and the way advertisers can engage with them is pretty similar.</p>

<h2>The types of queries best suited for AI Mode (and AI Overviews) ads</h2>
<p>To try and discern the impact AI Mode may have for advertisers, we need to understand the types of queries that it’s best suited for.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-mode">AI Mode</a> is relatively new, we need to take some direction from the documentation around AI Overviews to understand how AI Mode might be impacted. Let’s dig into what we do know about AI Overviews and see how that can inform our expectations about AI Mode.</p>
<p>AI Overviews are not shown for all query types. They’re usually shown for queries that require a longer, in-depth answer rather than a series of links. That means AI Overviews are likely only going to show when the search is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broad and information-based</li>
<li>Comparison based</li>
<li>Multi-step</li>
<li>Explanatory</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these is heavily focused on transactions or sales. They’re all more research or learning based and, more often than not, an ad likely won’t show for this type of query anyway.</p>
<p>If you are getting search volume through your campaigns for these higher funnel, more generalized queries, you could likely already be seeing a decrease in impressions as AI Overviews are being shown more often and are likely pushing ads down the page.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong> Looking for more ways to drive people to your site?</strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website</a></p>
<div id="requirements-to-show-ads-in-ai-mode-and-ai-overviews"></div>
<h2>Requirements to show ads in AI Mode</h2>
<p>To know the impact AI Mode may have on advertising, we also need to know the criteria required to show your ads in AI Overviews. As ads on Google AI Mode are in the experimental stage, there&#8217;s very little documentation around it (just <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-ai-mode-ads-internal-document-459931" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this brief from Google</a> to brands in August).</p>
<p>Unlike regular <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/ppc-keyword">keyword targeting</a>, where the search term simply needs to closely match what your keywords are for an ad to show, ads on AI Mode require much more cohesion for the searcher. Not only does your keyword need to be relevant to the query, but your ad content and landing pages also need to be relevant to the answers provided by AI Mode as well (this is also how ads work in AI Overviews).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ads-ai-mode-benefits.webp" alt="google ads ai mode details from google" width="900" height="715" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94871" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ads-ai-mode-benefits.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ads-ai-mode-benefits-480x381.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-ai-mode-ads-internal-document-459931" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>Additionally, just like AI Overviews ads, Google is requiring advertisers to opt into AI-powered targeting solutions like broad match, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-max-for-search">AI Max for Search</a>, or keywordless targeting that accompanies Dynamic Search Ads or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/performance-max">Performance Max</a>.</p>

<div id="what-could-ai-mode-mean-for-advertisers"></div>
<h2>What could ads in AI Mode mean for businesses?</h2>
<p>Between the types of queries best suited for AI Mode and the settings required for advertisers to show up there, the implications for advertisers could be pretty large.</p>
<h3>A varied marketing approach</h3>
<p>For your ad to show in AI Mode (or in AI Overviews), you’re likely going to have to shift away from hard selling, as the queries these features are showing for aren’t the right fit. Additionally, you’re likely not going to get away with short landing pages with the minimum viable content to make the sale. Odds are, those pages aren’t going to be supportive enough of the AI answer experience to qualify your ads.</p>
<h3>Targeting expansion</h3>
<p>You’re also going to have to lean into Google’s intent-based query matching to leverage these placements. Without broad match or keywordless matching, you won’t be eligible for these new placements. Additionally, the expanded reach of campaigns like Performance Max goes beyond Search and into many other Google properties like YouTube and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/gmail-ads">Gmail</a>, which is obviously quite a big change.</p>
<h3>A bigger role for creative assets</h3>
<p>If you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-performance-max-pre-launch-optimizations">opt into Performance Max campaigns</a> or leverage the Text Customization and Final URL expansion features within AI Max for Search, you’re giving at least some control to Google when it comes to your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/21/emotional-ad-copy-examples">ad copy</a>. They’ll be able to create new text and visual components to leverage in your ads as you compete for these queries or expand into new placements that are much more creative forward.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/asset-optimization-ai-mode.webp" alt="ai mode asset optimization" width="900" height="369" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94862" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/asset-optimization-ai-mode.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/asset-optimization-ai-mode-480x197.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="should-you-be-focused-on-showing-ads-in-ai-mode"></div>
<h2>Should you be focused on showing ads in AI Mode?</h2>
<p>It’s no secret that things are changing quickly with AI and that Google is vying to be at the forefront of that industry. But it’s also no secret that Google still heavily relies on ads to account for much of its revenue each year. With those two truths in mind, it&#8217;s hardly a surprise that ads are being integrated into Google’s AI offerings from its search platform.</p>
<p>In my estimation, <strong>getting your ads to show with AI Mode (or AI Overviews) likely shouldn’t be your main goal with advertising.</strong> Your goal is still to hit your profitability or volume goals, but that doesn’t mean this shouldn’t be on your mind.</p>
<p>At this point in time, the advertisers who test and iterate on their strategy to both continue to see success with existing campaigns as well as find out what works for them in an AI-centered search experience will end up reaping the rewards in the future. Maybe it makes sense to opt into <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-max-for-search">AI Max</a> for a little while and see how it does. Have you run Performance Max campaigns recently? There have been a ton of updates to give advertisers better controls, and if you leverage them, maybe this campaign type can be profitable and get you eligible to show in AI experiences.</p>
<h2>What to do next</h2>
<p>In the immediate future, I don’t foresee AI Mode having a large impact on advertisers who have a dialed-in campaign strategy. At least not while user behavior is still relatively the same. That will almost certainly change over time as users get more used to AI and figure out ways to be more efficient with it. The advertiser who tests and learns in these early stages will be ahead of the game when these AI features are more widely adopted.</p>
<p>For now, it’s important to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/category/google-ads">keep up with the latest changes</a>, keep an eye on your existing Google Ads campaigns, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-experiments">use AI in smart ways</a> to further your marketing strategy.</p>

<h2>Why is your Google Ads account structure so important?</h2>
<p>Let’s take a step back–what is even meant by account structure, and why is it so important?</p>
<p>I’m glad you asked. Put simply, the way you structure your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-not-working">Google Ads</a> account allows you to control how you want your ads to be triggered and when and where you want them to appear. Not having a well-structured account is like attempting to drive a car that’s not properly built&#8211;accidents are bound to happen.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that having a well-structured account will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that the searches triggering your ads are relevant to your audience.</li>
<li>Result in better Quality Scores, which, in turn, brings better results and lower prices. Quality score is essentially the scale of how much Google likes you (and trust me, you want Google to love you!).</li>
<li>Keep you organized and able to optimize. If your account is a mess, then you’re likely to get lost in the mess, your results will plummet (or never arrive), and optimizing to get better results will be out of the question. So keep in mind organization (and your own sanity) when structuring your account.</li>
</ul>

<div id="overview"></div>
<h2>Google Ads account overview</h2>
<p>A Google Ads account is more than just one account with a bunch of ads. So let&#8217;s start with a big-picture overview of its key components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account:</strong> This is the outer shell, with your business and payment information that houses everything.</li>
<li><strong>Campaigns:</strong> Campaigns house your ad groups. You can only have one <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/05/types-of-google-ads">ad type</a> (Search vs. Display, for example) per campaign, but you can (and should) have multiple ad groups within a campaign, and you can (and should) have multiple campaigns per account.</li>
<li><strong>Ad groups:</strong> These contain your ads and keywords and are grouped by theme.</li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>These are the terms that you want to trigger your ads to show in the search engine results page (SERP).</li>
<li><strong>Ads: </strong>This is the actual copy and creative that appears on the SERP.</li>
<li><strong>Landing page:</strong> The page viewers land on once they click your ad. You will have only one landing page per ad group. Given<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/15/landing-page-best-practices"> landing page best practices</a>—namely, how specific it should be to the offering and the ad promoting it—you can get a feel for how ad groups are organized.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-account-structure.webp" alt="google ads account structure chart" width="818" height="613" class="aligncenter wp-image-91558 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-account-structure.webp 818w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-account-structure-480x360.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 818px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There are different groupings and levels, and certain features and settings are only available at certain levels within your account.</p>
<p>At first, this may feel confusing, but in the end, it&#8217;s designed this way to help you streamline things as much as possible and customize where necessary.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s dive into each layer within your account so you can see what I mean.</p>
<div id="account"></div>
<h2>The account level</h2>
<p>The shell of your Google Ads account is the first layer of PPC management that is often referred to as the “account level.” This is where big-picture portions of your Google Ads get taken care of, like your billing, user permissions, and more.</p>
<h3>How do I create a Google Ads account?</h3>
<p>To <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-run-google-ads">create a Google Ads account</a>, go to <a href="https://ads.google.com/home/#!/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ads.google.com</a> and have an email address handy. It doesn’t necessarily have to be a Gmail account.<a href="https://ads.google.com/home/#!/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em></em></a><em> </em></p>
<h3>What is a Google Ads Manager account? Do I need one?</h3>
<p>Google Ads Manager accounts were designed with agencies in mind, as they have <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/01/19/agencies-sell-more-ppc">multiple clients using PPC</a>. This acts as an umbrella account where you can manage multiple accounts in one place.</p>
<p>However, you don’t have to be an agency to have a Manager account. You may be an independent consultant, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/12/06/small-business-ideas">own multiple businesses</a> or brands, or just have different needs in your PPC plan that require totally separate setups.</p>
<p>In short, if you manage more than one account, you’ll want to follow the prompts to create a Manager account. If you’re just working in one individual account, though, a Manager account is not needed.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f926-200d-2640-fe0f.png" alt="🤦‍♀️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Are you making mistakes in Google Ads?</strong> Find out with the <strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Free Google Ads Performance Grader</a></strong>!</p>
<h3>Account-level settings</h3>
<p>Here are a few of the highlights within the settings found at the account level. Changes to any of these settings will apply to every campaign, ad group, and ad in your account.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account name: </strong>Usually your business name. Just keep it simple and easy to reference in case technical support ever needs to hop in.</li>
<li><strong>Account status: </strong>Enabled, disabled, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Data protection contacts:</strong> Who you’d want to be notified by Google regarding data and privacy terms.</li>
<li><strong>Time zone: </strong>Your ad scheduling will automatically set to this.</li>
<li><strong>Auto-tagging: </strong>A required setup that will add a GCLID (Google click identifier) to your URLs.</li>
<li><strong>Tracking template:</strong> Any parameters you want included in your URLs for all of the ads in your account.</li>
<li><strong>Third-party measurement:</strong> Where you can link your CRM for data integration.</li>
<li><strong>Call reporting: </strong>How you’ll track calls (if you’re running call extensions, location extensions, or call ads).</li>
<li><strong>Negative keywords: </strong>Terms you negate at the account level (we’ll cover more on negative keywords later).</li>
<li><strong>Auto-apply:</strong> Where you select which optimizations you want Google to apply across your account’s campaigns automatically.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Account-level tips</h3>
<p>As you poke around the account level, here are three general <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/losing-money-in-google-ads">Google Ads tips</a> to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decide how you want your account to be structured: </strong>This question arises constantly: <em>What is the perfect account structure</em><em>? </em>I hate to break it to ya, but there is, truthfully, no magic recipe for structuring your account, and more than one strategy can prove successful. Luckily, there are a few different methods that work well:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Based on the structure of your website:</strong> How is your website structured? Do you have different tabs or pages for different products or offerings? Do you value different product pages over others? If your website is well-structured (which it should be), then it makes sense to structure your Google Ads account in a similar fashion.</li>
<li><strong>By products/services offered: </strong>This is likely the same as the structure of your website, but think about your different services or products offered and structure your account in a similar fashion. For example, let’s say you sell tennis gear; you would want to create a campaign for tennis rackets, tennis balls, tennis clothing, etc. Then, under the tennis rackets campaign, you might create separate ad groups for the brands you sell or perhaps for the size or gender the racket is for. Take a look at your various offerings and decide which ones are most valuable. Is there a very large demand for tennis bags online? Then you might want to run a campaign for tennis bags with a higher budget. Spend some time mapping out your products and deciding how you want to divvy up your budget between campaigns.</li>
<li><strong>Based on locations: </strong>Is location important to your business? Maybe you’re a law office that has <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing/opening-new-location-7-ways-promote-it/">multiple locations</a> across New England, or perhaps you sell development courses in major cities ranging from London to Tokyo. If location targeting is important, then structure it based on this. For example, create a London campaign to sell your development course to only those in a particular radius of the city.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there are many other tactics to structuring your account, but it’s all about taking the time to come up with a rational structure that will be easy to manage, track, and <a href="/blog/ws/2014/04/24/ppc-performance">optimize</a> to get the best results over time. So take the time to ponder various structuring techniques, and decide on the one that works best for your business. Once you’ve decided, I’d recommend actually mapping out the structure on a piece of paper or in an Excel doc to get a full visual of the campaigns and ad groups you’ll be creating. Now, onto a couple more Google Ads account structure tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perform regular audits: </strong>Like with anything in small business marketing, you need to check in on your Google Ads performance regularly. When you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/15/google-ads-account-audit-post-covid">audit your Google Ads account</a> on a scheduled basis, you’re able to find areas for optimization before they turn into headaches.</li>
<li><strong>Be wary of auto-apply recommendations: </strong>Advice from Google Ads is like advice from a stranger—take it with a grain of salt. Google’s auto-applied ads and other optimization recommendations can be helpful at times where you’re short of ideas, but at the end of the day, you will know what’s best for your account.</li>
</ul>
<div id="campaigns">
<h2>The campaign level</h2>
<p>In general, a marketing campaign can mean anything, but in Google Ads, the term “campaign” is the bucket that houses your ad groups. You&#8217;ll set your budget, targeting, the type of ad you want to run, and more at the campaign level. As mentioned above, you can only have one ad <em>type</em> per campaign, but you&#8217;ll have multiple ad <em>groups</em> per campaign and multiple campaigns per account.</p>
<h3>What are the different campaign types in Google Ads?</h3>
<p>Here are the seven different campaign types in Google Ads to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Search: </strong>Text ads that appear on Google Search<span>.</span></li>
<li><strong> Display:</strong> Image ads that appear on websites in the Google Display Network<span>.</span></li>
<li><strong> Shopping: </strong>Product ads on Google Search and the Shopping tab<span>.</span></li>
<li><strong> Video: </strong>Animated ads on YouTube and the Display Network<span>.</span></li>
<li><strong> Demand Gen:</strong> Immersive ads that appear on multiple Google networks<span>.</span></li>
<li><strong> App: </strong>Ads for your app across multiple Google networks<span>.</span></li>
<li><strong>Performance Max: </strong>Ads created from various assets shown across all of Google’s eligible networks.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Another note: </strong>For this post, our anatomy will follow that of an advertiser using Search, Display, and/or Video campaigns. Some components may vary by campaign type, which will be noted throughout.

<h3>Which campaign type should I use?<strong> </strong></h3>
<p>It’s a best practice to run a few different campaign types within your Google Ads account to maximize your performance across Google’s advertising networks. Different campaign types can help you hit different<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/19/ppc-metrics"> PPC metrics</a>, so it’s in your best interest to try at least one or two when starting out.</p>
<p>For example, you may want to run a search campaign to catch folks while they&#8217;re searching on Google, as well as a display campaign for when they&#8217;re browsing other sites across the web. Some campaigns are industry-specific and may not be needed, like Shopping (for ecommerce businesses) or App campaigns.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-account-structure-example.jpg" alt="google ads account structure - example account layout" width="935" height="558" class="aligncenter wp-image-94410 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-account-structure-example.jpg 935w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-account-structure-example-480x286.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 935px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>How many campaigns should I have?</h3>
<p>This will all depend on your business size, business model, budget, and more. There’s no right or wrong answer when it comes to what campaign types you should have or how many of them, but it’s a best practice to keep it as manageable as possible.</p>
<p>So, for example, if you’re a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/19/google-ads-for-small-businesses">small business running Google Ads</a> and don’t have the overall budget or bandwidth to realistically stretch across 10 or 20 campaigns, it’s better to start small with one or two for effective advertising rather than be overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you might not always have all your campaigns running at once. You might have seasonal offers, for example, or campaigns that you only run when you have the inventory or budget.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s the best Google Ads campaign structure?</h3>
<p>This is all going to depend on your business size, type, model, and more. There isn&#8217;t a one-size-fits-all formula, but there are some options to consider. Similar to how you&#8217;d approach your overall account structure, take a look at how you group your offerings on your website to inspire your campaign makeup. What do you have unique pages for? Which pages are most popular or of the highest value? If your website is well-structured, you might want to adopt the same system for your campaigns. For <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/franchise-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-location businesses</a>, it might make sense to run campaigns by location since location targeting is set at the campaign level.</p>
<h3>Campaign-level settings</h3>
<p>There’s a lot to play around with at the campaign level, like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Campaign name:</strong> Similar to account name, this is how you’ll refer to your campaign and has no impact on performance.</li>
<li><strong>Status:</strong> Paused, enabled, or removed.</li>
<li><strong>Conversion goal:</strong> What you want your campaign to achieve in relation to your conversion actions.</li>
<li><strong>Budget:</strong> Roughly how much your campaign will spend per day.</li>
<li><strong>Bid strategy:</strong> How aggressively you want to bid, based on your goals. See our complete guide to bidding strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Locations:</strong> Where in the world you choose for your campaign’s ads to show, also known as geotargeting.</li>
<li><strong>Languages:</strong> This is not the language of your ad, but what languages you want your ad to show for.</li>
<li><strong>Networks:</strong> In some campaign types, like Google Search, you can opt to show your campaign solely on the Google SERP or also on Google’s subsidiary search engines within its Search Partner Network.</li>
<li><strong>Start and end dates:</strong> If you don’t want to worry about enabling or pausing your campaign, start and end dates can sometimes come in handy.</li>
<li><strong>IP exclusions:</strong> Any specific IP addresses you’d rather not show to.</li>
<li><strong>AI Max for Search campaigns:</strong> For Search campaigns, advertisers have the option to opt into AI automation for asset optimization and more.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Campaign-level tips</h3>
<p>When it comes to running Google Ads, there are a few campaign tips to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Run a variety of campaign types. </strong>This will help you hit different business goals. Plus, they often work synergistically. For example, display campaigns can build brand awareness and improve your search ad performance. Of course, some campaign types are industry-specific and may not apply to your business.</li>
<li><strong>Keep them organized. </strong>Break out your campaigns so they map to your business <span>goals</span>, such as by product or service type, conversion action type, sales funnel stages, or locations. And establish a naming convention that makes sense to anyone managing the account.</li>
<li><strong>Separate out branded campaigns. </strong>These campaigns behave and perform differently from <span>non-branded</span> campaigns, so it’ll be best to budget for, strategize, and report on these separately.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </strong><strong>Is your Google Ads account structure in need of a refresh?</strong> Find out, and get an instant account report, using our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Free Google Ads Grader</a>!</p>
<div id="ad-groups"></div>
<h2>The ad group level</h2>
<p>Going down one tier under campaigns, we have ad groups. Each ad group contains a group of related keywords, their associated ads, and a landing page. One sidenote, though, for PMax campaigns, these are known as asset groups.</p>
<h3>I only want to create one ad&#8211;why do I need an ad group?</h3>
<p>You’ll notice when creating an ad that you’re prompted to create an ad group. This is a required part of the process, even if you just want one ad. But as we’ll talk about later, it’s best to<strong> have at least two different versions of your ad</strong> so you can test and see what performs best.</p>
<p>In most cases, you won’t have just one ad in your Google Ads account.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s an example to explain why: </strong>Let’s say you’re a home service business and you want to advertise two main offers: installations and repairs. Installations are of higher value to you than repairs, so you separate these into two different campaigns.</p>
<p>That way, you can allocate more budget toward installations (because, as we just learned, budget is set at the campaign level, not the ad level). But you have different types of installations, like windows, gutters, and more.</p>
<p>You want to keep the same location, network, and device targeting for each of these offers—so it works to keep them in the same campaign—but the targeted keywords and ad copy for your window installation ad will, of course, be totally different from your gutter installation ad.</p>
<p>The same goes for your different types of repairs. So, you’ll want to have a separate ad group for each type of installation. Not only will this keep your account organized, but it will also keep your costs low.</p>
<h3>How do thematic ad groups lower my ad costs?</h3>
<p>The higher your Quality Score, the lower your cost per click, and you achieve high Quality Scores by keeping your ads and landing pages super relevant to their keywords. So, if you put all of your installation ads in one ad group, you’ll have window installation ads connected to gutter installation keywords—not very relevant.</p>
<p>Plus, you can only have one landing page per ad group, so you’d need to make it general enough to cover everything—once again, not very relevant.</p>
<p><strong>If you separate your ad groups out, you can ensure tight alignment between your keywords, ad, and landing page for a better play in the Google Ads auction.</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-cost-google-ads-auction-formula.jpg" alt="google ads cost - google ads auction formula" width="935" height="326" class="aligncenter wp-image-91781 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-cost-google-ads-auction-formula.jpg 935w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-cost-google-ads-auction-formula-480x167.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 935px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>How many ad groups should I have per campaign?</h3>
<p><strong>You should have no more than roughly 7-10 ad groups per campaign. </strong>You’ll most likely need even less than that. The more centralized to your main goals or offerings, the better. If you have a ton of ad groups, that’s a sign you need another campaign!</p>
<h3>How many keywords should I have per ad group?</h3>
<p>You should have only one keyword theme per ad group (as we established), so you may only need to start with 10-20 keywords max. With all the keyword matching updates, we don’t need as many as we once did, so stick to your core terms and avoid muddying up the waters with a ton of variations.</p>
<h3>How many ads should I have per ad group?</h3>
<p>You should aim to have two or three ads per ad group. This is a little confusing since responsive search ads themselves rotate through different copy combinations within the same ad, but you should still always be testing more than one overall approach or tone at a time, such as an RSA with a set of positively-framed headlines and descriptions vs one with those that are negatively framed.</p>
<p>Note that<strong> you can only have three enabled RSAs per ad group</strong>, or otherwise you’ll get a flag that looks like this when you try to create another ad:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-account-structure-rsa-flag.jpg" alt="google ads account structure flag" width="505" height="210" class="aligncenter wp-image-94405 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-account-structure-rsa-flag.jpg 505w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-account-structure-rsa-flag-480x200.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 505px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Ad group-level settings</h3>
<p>Here is a quick preview of what you can adjust at the ad group level:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ad group name:</strong> Same as campaign and account levels, name your ad groups what would make the most sense to you. Again, the names of your assets are not a performance factor.</li>

<h3>Ad group-level tips</h3>
<p>Recommended best practices for ad groups are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Do organize your ad groups systematically.</strong> Stick to core <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/29/single-theme-ad-groups">ad group themes</a> and break them out in a way that makes the most sense for you. Themed ad groups will help to keep your ad relevance high, which is essential if you want to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/24/how-to-compete-in-google-ads">compete in Google Ads without having to hike up your bids</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t use too many or too few ad groups. </strong>While you don’t want to stuff everything into one ad group, you also don’t want to break them out too much into a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/03/the-case-against-skags">SKAG (single keyword ad group) </a>structure as either option can equally be a pain to manage.</li>
<li><strong>Do get ready to change these regularly</strong>. As a PPC expert, pausing, adjusting, and moving around ad groups and their components is the bulk of my optimization work.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t add in ad group components just to hit our recommended numbers above.</strong> Those are guidelines, so don’t break your back squeezing in an unnecessary keyword or ad group to hit an ideal number.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>The keyword level</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/ppc-keyword">Keywords</a> act as your “north star” within your Google Ads account. For Search, they indicate to Google which types of queries you want your ads to show for.</p>
<p>Note: PMax campaigns use <span>s</span>earch <span>t</span>hemes instead of keywords.</p>
<h3>What are Google Ads keyword match types?</h3>
<p>When you select or edit your keywords, you’ll also have to assign them a <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7478529?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">match type</a>. There are three match types to choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul></ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong> Broad match:</strong> Least restrictive; matches your ad to any queries related to that keyword.</li>
<li><strong> Phrase match: </strong>Matches your ad to any queries that include your keyword or include anything that means the same thing as the keyword.</li>
<li><strong>Exact match: </strong>Most restrictive; matches your ad to queries that are your keyword or are of the same meaning as the keyword.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/keyword-match-type-chart-e1758567069313.webp" alt="keyword match types in google ads" width="680" height="432" class="aligncenter wp-image-87112 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/keyword-match-type-chart-e1758567069313.webp 680w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/keyword-match-type-chart-e1758567069313-480x270.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 680px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Keyword-level settings</h3>
<p>As you add keywords, these are the settings you will apply:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Keyword bid:</strong> Only necessary if you’re using manual bidding.</li>
<li><strong> Match type: </strong>This will depend on your strategy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Keyword-level tips</h3>
<p>Check out these quick Google Ads keyword tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do your PPC keyword research.</strong> This is non-negotiable! Use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">keyword research tools</a> to identify the most relevant keywords for your offerings and make sure you’re capturing transactional or commercial intent.</li>
<li><strong>Mix up your match types.</strong> This will give you flexibility to see which match type works best for your core terms.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain your keyword lists. </strong>Adding your keywords to your ad group is just the first step in the process. You need to be regularly mining your search terms report to find new keywords to add, negative keywords to negate, and low-performing keywords to remove, pause, or separate out.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t just go for the lowest CPC keywords. </strong>Some keywords are going to have a higher average cost per click than others, but these will typically bring in higher value clicks and conversions.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t ignore other targeting options in favor of keywords. </strong>These may be the building blocks of Google Ads, but you still need to pay attention to your location, device, and audience targeting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The ad level</h2>
<p>We’re now down to the most granular part of your Google Ads account anatomy: the ad level. This is where we get to the good stuff: your ads! These, of course, are what your targeted users see. Who knew that for the one ad you see on a website or SERP, there are so many doors to open to get there?! When building out a campaign, the ad level is where you input text and upload or generate creative assets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-benchmarks-example-ads-on-serp.webp" alt="google ads benchmarks - example ad serp" width="800" height="379" class="aligncenter wp-image-91526 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-benchmarks-example-ads-on-serp.webp 800w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-benchmarks-example-ads-on-serp-480x227.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An example of what ads look like on the SERP. </em></p>
<p>If you’re creating a search ad, it’s important to stick to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/10/responsive-search-ads">responsive search ad copy best practices</a>, like pinning headlines and descriptions sparingly, and using keywords carefully, rather than excessively.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/responsive-search-ads-wordstream.webp" alt="how responsive search ads work" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92499 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/responsive-search-ads-wordstream.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/responsive-search-ads-wordstream-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Ad-level settings</h3>
<p>There are a couple of components you can change within the ad creation portal:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ad components:</strong> Assets like your headlines, descriptions, videos, or images.</li>
<li><strong>Landing page URL: </strong>Where you’ll be pointing your ad to. All ads within the same ad group have to point to the same landing page URL. All ads within a campaign have to point to the same domain.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ad-level tips</h3>
<p>Remember the following when creating your Google Ads:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be strategic with your ad copy. </strong>A great ad includes the right mix of features, benefits, differentiators, and CTAs. Use these tips for writing exceptional ads.</li>
<li><strong>Always be testing. </strong>Until mind-reading becomes widely available, this is the only way you’ll know what type of ad best appeals to your customers. Try swapping different keywords to go along with your ads, different images on Display ads, video lengths on Video ads, or include different language that speaks to a specific product price or service offering.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is a Google Ads budget?</h2>
<p>Your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-cost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads budget</a> is how much money you’re ready to spend for user interactions with your ads, like clicks, views, or other engagements (depending on your campaign type and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-smart-bidding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bidding strategy</a>). You set your Google Ads budget at the campaign level.</p>
<p>Google Ads budgets help inform the platform’s algorithms to know how much you’re looking to spend on a campaign. This budget will be broken out into bids for each ad auction, so your Google Ads bidding strategy can impact <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-automated-bidding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how quickly or slowly your budget gets spent</a> throughout the day.</p>

<div id="google-ads-budget-types"></div>
<h2>Types of Google Ads budgets</h2>
<p>There are four different types of Google Ads budgets advertisers may refer to, so let’s clarify them a bit.</p>
<h3>Daily budgets</h3>
<p>A daily budget is a budget <strong>every advertiser must assign to individual campaigns</strong>. Daily budgets guide Google Ads to know how much you want to spend on that campaign each day.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-budget-daily-budget.webp" alt="google ads budget - campaign daily budget screenshot" width="763" height="361" class="aligncenter wp-image-94150 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-budget-daily-budget.webp 763w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-budget-daily-budget-480x227.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 763px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>Note that Google Ads can (and usually will) spend more or less than your daily budget </strong>on any given day. This is called overdelivery. Typically, though, these fluctuations in spend average out to your daily budget over a 30-day period. So, it can be helpful to<strong> start with your ideal monthly spend and work backwards to determine your daily budget from there</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-budget-overdelivery.webp" alt="google ads budget - overdelivery explanation screenshot" width="867" height="228" class="aligncenter wp-image-94145 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-budget-overdelivery.webp 867w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-budget-overdelivery-480x126.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 867px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A breakdown of </em><a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1704443" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Google Ads budget overdelivery</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<h3>Shared budgets</h3>
<p>Found in the <strong>budgets and bidding section </strong>within the Google Ads<strong> tools menu</strong>, and <strong>less common than daily budgets</strong>, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-shared-budgets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared budgets</a> are lump sum budgets you can spread or “share” across multiple campaigns.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-budget-shared-budget.webp" alt="google ads budget - shared budgets screenshot" width="900" height="294" class="aligncenter wp-image-94138 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-budget-shared-budget.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-budget-shared-budget-480x157.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Monthly account spend limit</h3>
<p>This is a cap you can put on your total spend at the account level, regardless of your assigned daily budgets. You can find your account spend limit options under the<strong> settings</strong> menu within the<strong> billing</strong> section of the platform.</p>
<p>Account spend limits can sound appealing at first, and they are definitely helpful for businesses with hard budget stops. But know that <strong>setting your spend limit too low will restrict your campaign performance</strong>. Regardless of whether you assign a monthly spend limit to your account,<strong> you still have to assign a shared or daily budget to your campaigns.</strong></p>

<h3>Campaign total budget</h3>
<p><a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10486938?hl=en#:~:text=When%20you%20already%20know%20how,after%20a%20campaign%20is%20created." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Campaign total budgets</a> are only available for Demand Gen, <a href="https://business.google.com/us/accelerate/announcements/retail-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Search, Shopping, and Performance Max campaigns</a> with specific start and end dates, so this isn&#8217;t the most popular strategy for Google Ads budgeting just yet. It will pop up as an option when you&#8217;re creating these types of campaigns, and Google uses your campaign&#8217;s total budget to spend evenly throughout the campaign&#8217;s duration while still accounting for higher or lower traffic days.</p>

<h2>How is your Google Ads budget spent?</h2>
<p>To fully understand how Google Ads spends your budget, let’s first refresh on how the Google Ads auction functions.</p>
<p>If you’re running a search campaign, when a user you’re targeting searches on Google for a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/keyword-prioritization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keyword you’re bidding on</a>, your ad is entered into the ad auction, where Google evaluates how much you’re willing to pay for a click (or view, etc.) from the user, and the Google Ads algorithm <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/14/how-does-google-ads-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranks your ad</a> accordingly.</p>
<p>If you’re using a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/05/types-of-google-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads campaign type</a> outside of search, like Display, Demand Gen, PMax, Video, or Shopping campaigns, the same concept applies when a targeted user browses content you&#8217;re targeting.</p>
<p>When considering your Google Ads budget and your campaign spending behavior in the auction environment, it can be helpful to remember that Google has a job to do. It’s constantly trying to balance the best quality ad for the user while also showing ads that will provide the platform with the most ad revenue.</p>
<p>That’s why your keyword <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/19/does-quality-score-still-matter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quality Score</a> plays a role in Google Ads budget and bid planning. The better your ad relevance, expected click-through rate, and landing page experience (the three factors that go into Quality Score), the less you’ll have to pay per click. This is because Google’s algorithm views your ad as one that provides a higher-quality experience for its users—making them want to come back to Google for more.</p>
<p>All that to say, <strong>your Google Ads budget should reflect how you expect to perform in the ad auction</strong>. If you want your ad to rank at the top of the search engine results page (SERP), it may require a bit more budget.</p>

<h2>What is a good Google Ads budget?</h2>
<p>A good Google Ads budget is going to look different for every account out there. Factors that impact your Google Ads budget include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overall marketing budget</a></li>
<li>Your industry competition</li>
<li>Your chosen campaign types</li>
<li>Your advertising goals and objectives</li>
<li>And more</li>
</ul>
<p>We typically see small businesses starting their Google Ads budget at around <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/google-ads-spend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1,000-$2,500</a> per month. However, that number tends to climb as an account settles and scales, and<strong> most businesses have a Google Ads budget of </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-for-startups" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>$1,000 and $10,000</strong></a><strong> per month</strong>.</p>
<p>For reference, <strong>a new Google Ads campaign usually costs around </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-for-startups" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>$20-50</strong></a><strong> per day</strong>.</p>
<p>Additionally, nearly 20% of small businesses have an overall annual marketing budget of $20,000-49,000, with advertising being the top channel using that budget, according to our <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-marketing-trends-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small business trends report</a>.</p>

<p>So, we know the average Google Ads budget is anywhere between $1,000 and $10,000 for SMBs, but that’s still a pretty big window. Follow these steps to identify the exact right budget for your business.</p>
<h3>1. Review baseline Google Ads metrics</h3>
<p>To narrow in on a budget number that fits your business size, industry, and objectives, first take into account the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The average cost per click in Google Ads in 2025 is $5.26.</li>
<li>The average cost per lead in Google Ads in 2025 is $70.11.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Review Google Ads benchmarks specific to your industry</h3>
<p>Next, zone in on your industry-specific metrics using our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2025-google-ads-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads benchmarks report</a>. You can use industry-specific data on average costs like this to predict how much you can expect to pay to achieve your click or conversion goals.</p>

<p>If you already have your Google Ads budget but you’re thinking of adjusting it due to industry competition or other factors, you’re not alone. Our trends report found that 36% of businesses were increasing their budgets this year due to increasing ad costs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/marketing-trends-report-2025-budget-investments-e1757606415462-664x1024.webp" alt="google ads budget - trends report" width="664" height="1024" class="aligncenter wp-image-94148 size-large" /></p>
<h3>3. Calculate your Google Ads budget</h3>
<p>Ready to calculate your own Google Ads budget? There are a couple of ways you can do just that:</p>
<p><strong>Calculate your Google Ads daily budget(s) by&#8230; </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your monthly spend. </strong>To get your total daily budget, you can take your ideal monthly spend and divide it by 30.4 (to account for the average number of days in a given month).</li>
<li><strong>Your goal number of clicks or leads per day.</strong> Take your industry’s average CPC (or CPL) and multiply it by your ideal number of clicks (or leads) per day. At a minimum, your daily budget will likely need to be slightly above that (accounting for cost fluctuations) to cover the costs of your desired results.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to set up your Google Ads budget</h2>
<p>You can set your Google Ads budget within<strong> campaign settings</strong>, or by <strong>clicking the pencil </strong>directly within the <strong>budget column</strong> of the platform’s <strong>campaign-level reporting</strong>.</p>

<h2>Google Ads budget tips</h2>
<p>Here are some tips to help you navigate your Google Ads budget planning.</p>
<h3>Be flexible</h3>
<p>The most important Google Ads budget tip to keep in mind is to stay flexible with your PPC spending. Be ready to shift and reallocate budgets across campaigns according to performance fluctuations. You’ll also have to revisit your Google Ads budgets regularly and increase or decrease them based on factors like <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/always-on-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seasonality</a>, competition, CPA targets, and more.</p>
<p>However, just be aware that it takes Google’s algorithmic learning period some time to adjust to any campaign changes—including budget shifts. That’s why it’s so important to never fully pause your staple campaigns, because Google uses any historical data you continuously collect to optimize your performance.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Regardless of seasonality, you should never fully stop your campaign spending! </strong>Download our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/always-on-marketing?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_alwaysonmarketing_Download&amp;itm_source=localiq&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free guide to always-on marketing</a> and see why it’s the key to unstoppable growth year-round!</p>
<h3>Know your goals</h3>
<p>Your goals directly align with what you’re setting for your Google Ads budget. If you set smart goals for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/19/ppc-metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">key PPC metrics</a>, you can predict from there how much money your budget will need to cover the costs of achieving those goals.</p>
<h3>Consider costs outside of just campaign spend</h3>
<p>Speaking of covering costs, be aware that additional purchases outside of campaign spend may be necessary to make your Google Ads successful. For example, you may also need to invest in a marketing partner, freelance designer, and more. This might not directly impact what you set as your campaign&#8217;s daily budgets, but it’s good to keep in mind when you’re considering your total Google Ads costs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-budget-considerations.webp" alt="google ads budget - considerations chart" width="762" height="367" class="aligncenter wp-image-94155 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-budget-considerations.webp 762w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-budget-considerations-480x231.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 762px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Use AI sparingly</h3>
<p>It can be tempting to use AI in your Google Ads budget calculations. It’s so easy to simply <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-prompts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ask an AI tool</a>, “How much should my Google Ads budget be?” But it’s been proven that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-accurate-is-ai-for-ppc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one in five AI answers to PPC questions are incorrect</a>.</p>
<p>We recently asked five different <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-ai-tools">AI tools</a> the same PPC cost questions, and many answers were totally off base. That said, if you want AI to provide an added reference point for your budget estimations, it was found that Gemini and Perplexity had the most accurate Google Ads cost and performance data.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you, like me, have been running Google Ads for quite some time, you may remember something called Gmail Sponsored Promotions (GSP). This was a short-lived option as part of a Display campaign where you could show ads to people within Gmail. And get this: you could target those ads based on the content of people’s emails! As you can imagine, this was highly effective for advertisers but also a serious privacy concern for users. Google nixed that many years ago, and the Gmail placement was eventually folded into Demand Gen and PMax campaigns. Standalone Gmail Ads died&#8230;or so we thought.</p>
<p>Recently, Google introduced a new option in Demand Gen campaigns that allows you to pick your channels. Demand Gen campaigns can place ads on YouTube, Discover, Gmail, and the Display Network. Now, if you only select the “Gmail” option, you can run ads exclusively on Gmail. This presents a unique opportunity for email marketers, Google Ads practitioners, small business owners, and more.</p>
<p>In this guide, I&#8217;m going to share everything you need to know about Gmail Ads in 2025 so you can decide if this is the right next step for your marketing strategy.</p>

<h2>What are Gmail Ads?</h2>
<p>Gmail Ads are ads that show directly in users&#8217; inboxes. When users are on their Promotions or Social tabs in Gmail, the ad will look like they have an email from your business. It will say &#8220;Sponsored&#8221; next to your business name and then display one of your headline options and one of your description options. This is called the “teaser ad.”</p>
<p>Sometimes, your image, video, or products may be shown, too, before the user even clicks on the ad.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gmail-ads-example.jpg" alt="example Gmail ad" width="309" height="594" class="aligncenter wp-image-93817 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gmail-ads-example.jpg 309w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gmail-ads-example-156x300.jpg 156w" sizes="(max-width: 309px) 100vw, 309px" /></p>

<div id="types-of-gmail-ads"></div>
<h2>Types of Gmail Ads</h2>
<p>Since a Gmail Ad is part of a Demand Gen campaign, you can create a <strong>single image ad</strong>, a <strong>carousel image ad</strong>, or a <strong>video ad</strong>. Here is a breakdown of all these different types of Gmail Ads:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single image and video ads</strong>: You can have up to five headlines and five descriptions per ad. With an image ad, you can add up to 20 images per ad, and with a video ad, you can add up to five videos per ad. Note that, currently, the Google Ads Help Center says that video ads are not compatible with Gmail, but this is outdated information! Video ads can run in Gmail, though for now, they only serve on mobile devices.</li>
<li><strong>Carousel image ads</strong>: These ads only get one overall headline and one overall description. This is because when a user clicks on your ad, it will open an email that has multiple “cards” forming your carousel. Each card then has its own image, headline, description, and final URL. Think of this as similar to a Carousel ad you might run on Meta. (This is actually the only place in Google Ads where carousel ads are supported.)</li>
<li><strong>Product Ads</strong>: If you have a product feed from Google Merchant Center connected to your Google Ads account, you can also choose to include this as part of your ad. You can select this in your Campaign settings.</li>
</ul>

<div id="targeting-gmail-ads"></div>
<h2>How to target users with Gmail Ads</h2>
<p>Because Gmail ads are part of a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/22/demand-gen-campaigns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demand Gen campaign</a>, you have a variety of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-audience-targeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">audience targeting options</a> available to you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google&#8217;s audiences</strong>: You can target using detailed demographics, in-market segments, life event segments, and affinity segments.</li>
<li><strong>Custom segments</strong>: You can target based on the things people search for, the types of websites they visit, and/or the types of apps they use.</li>
<li><strong>Your data segments</strong>: You can<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/retargeting-ad-ideas" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> reach people who have visited your website</a>, used your app, interacted with your YouTube content, or are on a customer list you’ve uploaded. You can also target a Google Engaged audience, which is made up of users who have visited your website from Google or YouTube search results.</li>
<li><strong>Lookalike segments</strong>: You can build a lookalike segment of people who are similar to any of your data segments.</li>
<li><strong>Basic demographics</strong>: You can narrow your audience further using basic demographics such as age, gender, and parental status.</li>
<li><strong>Location targeting</strong>: As with any other type of Google Ads campaign, you can use location targeting.</li>
<li><strong>Optimized targeting:</strong> This option turns your audience <em>targeting</em> into audience <em>signals</em>, giving Google permission to show your Gmail Ads to people who might not match the audiences you&#8217;ve chosen, but who it thinks are likely to convert. Proceed with caution because optimized targeting can quickly consume your budget, leaving little room for the specific audiences you&#8217;ve selected.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/google-ads-audience-targeting-cheatsheet.webp" alt="google ads audience targeting chart" width="929" height="358" class="aligncenter wp-image-91285 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/google-ads-audience-targeting-cheatsheet.webp 929w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/google-ads-audience-targeting-cheatsheet-480x185.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 929px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You should note that <strong>content targeting</strong> options are not available to you with Gmail Ads or any Demand Gen campaign. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>No keyword targeting</li>
<li>No placement targeting (because the placement is Gmail)</li>
<li>No topics targeting (because, again, you are only targeting the Gmail placement)</li>
</ul>
<p>One more tip: If you regularly send out promotional emails, and you have a list of people who have unsubscribed from your emails, I recommend uploading that list to Google Ads and excluding it from your Gmail campaigns. Otherwise, you may end up showing ads in Gmail to people who have unsubscribed from your emails, which creates a poor user experience.</p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US" class="TextRun SCXW91369322 BCX0"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW91369322 BCX0"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4e7.png" alt="📧" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span></span>Be sure your Gmail Ads are hitting the right inboxes</strong> with our free guide to <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteTargetAudience.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_TargetAudineceGuide_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redefining your target audience</a>!</p>
<div id="gmail-bidding"></div>
<h2>How bidding works with Gmail Ads</h2>
<p>When you set up your Demand Gen campaign, you can choose to optimize for clicks or conversions. If you have enough data in your account, you may also have the option to optimize for conversion value.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are running your Gmail Ads to a <strong>warm audience</strong> that is already familiar with your business, then you should optimize for conversions, either through the Maximize Conversions or Target CPA <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-smart-bidding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bid strategy</a>.</li>
<li>If you are targeting your ads to a <strong>cold audience</strong> that is not yet familiar with your business, I recommend using the Maximize Clicks or Target CPC bid strategy. Yes, Target CPC! That&#8217;s the newest bid strategy in Google Ads, and it is only available in Demand Gen campaigns.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to create a Gmail-only campaign in Google Ads</h2>
<p>Now that you understand all the basics of Gmail Ads, it&#8217;s time to get started. The process for creating a Gmail-only campaign is simple. Here are the steps you need to follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Google Ads, <strong>create a new campaign</strong></li>
<li>Choose the objective &#8220;<strong>create a campaign without guidance</strong>.&#8221;</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Demand Gen</strong> campaign type. Confirm your conversion goals and proceed to the next step.</li>
<li>After you enter the various campaign settings like budget, bid strategy, etc., you will be taken to your <strong>ad group settings</strong>.</li>
<li>One of the options under ad group settings is<strong> channels</strong>. By default, your Demand Gen campaign will be opted into all channels. You’ll want to uncheck the boxes for the Google Display Network, YouTube, and Discover, so that your ads will now only be shown in users&#8217; Gmail inboxes.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Examples of Gmail Ads in the wild</h2>
<p>Want to see some examples of effective Gmail Ads? Here are a few we ran across!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gmail-ads-teaser.webp" alt="gmail ads - example gmail ad with image" width="294" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93818 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gmail-ads-teaser.webp 294w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gmail-ads-teaser-147x300.webp 147w" sizes="(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An example of Gmail ads within the standard inbox. Our Generation is showing a plain text teaser ad, and you can see that organic emails, like the one from PC Express Rapid Delivery, are also eligible to show images as part of their teaser.</em></p>
<p>If the user clicks to open your ad, to “view the email,” this is called the “expanded ad.” This is where they’ll see your full image(s) and/or video(s) and call-to-action button.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gmail-ads-expanded.webp" alt="google gmail ads - example" width="276" height="564" class="aligncenter wp-image-93820 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gmail-ads-expanded.webp 276w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gmail-ads-expanded-147x300.webp 147w" sizes="(max-width: 276px) 100vw, 276px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>When expanded, the ad from Google Ads is a single-image ad with a “Visit Site” call to action.</em></p>

<div id="measuring-gmail-ads"></div>
<h2>How to know if your Gmail Ads are working</h2>
<p>To determine whether your Gmail Ads campaign is working, you&#8217;ll want to add a few columns to your report that you may not typically use: <strong>engagements</strong>, <strong>engagement rate</strong>, and <strong>average cost per engagement</strong>.</p>
<p>Why? When your Gmail ad appears in someone&#8217;s inbox, that counts as an <strong>impression</strong>. If they click to open the ad, that does not actually count as a click; that counts as an <strong>engagement</strong>. Once someone opens the ad and sees the full details, they then have the option to <strong>click</strong> and be taken to your website.</p>
<ul>
<li>If your goal is <strong>engagement</strong>, then you should measure the success of your campaign based on its <strong>engagement rate</strong> and <strong>cost per engagement</strong>. A low engagement rate suggests that your headlines and descriptions may need improvement. And because we know that sometimes images can show in the teaser ad, you might also want to try using more engaging imagery. The more engaging your ad is, the more Google will want to show it to people, so focus on <em>increasing</em> engagement rate in order to <em>decrease</em> cost per engagement.</li>
<li>If your goal is <strong>website visits (clicks)</strong>, then you should measure the success of your campaign based on its <strong>click-through rate</strong> and <strong>cost per click</strong>. A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/14/improve-google-ads-click-through-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">low click-through rate</a> suggests that people who were interested enough to expand your ad didn’t find it compelling enough to follow through to your website. Experiment with different calls-to-action and different image and/or video assets to improve this metric. The more people who click on your ad, the more Google will want to show it to people, so focus on <em>increasing</em> click-through rate in order to <em>decrease</em> cost per click.</li>
<li>If your goal is <strong>conversions</strong>, then you&#8217;ll want to measure success based on <strong>conversion rate</strong> and <strong>cost per conversion</strong>. Remember that Gmail Ads are meant to complement Search or Shopping campaigns. Your conversion metrics will also look very different if you’re targeting a warm audience, like previous website visitors, vs. a cold audience, like an affinity segment. With those caveats in mind, if your campaign has been running for at least four weeks and you have no conversions, you can try changing your bid strategy, optimizing for a micro-conversion that occurs earlier in the customer journey, or testing different audiences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, if people don&#8217;t engage, they can&#8217;t click. And if they don&#8217;t click, they definitely can&#8217;t convert. The key takeaway here is to focus on <strong>engagement first</strong>, then focus on <strong>clicks</strong>, and then, if you&#8217;re trying to get conversions, focus on your <strong>conversion metrics</strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google Ads has been rolling out changes that nudge advertisers toward using more and more automation. If the idea of letting Google handle every aspect of your campaigns once made you nervous, you’re not alone—but with AI getting smarter and Google fine-tuning its tools, most businesses now use at least some automation in their accounts.</p>
<p>One big piece of that puzzle is automated bidding. Automated bidding simplifies your bidding strategy for you based on your budget and goals.</p>
<p>But just because it’s “automated” doesn’t mean it’s simple. There are different automated bidding strategies, each with its own pros and cons. So, should you use automated bidding? And if you do, which strategy makes the most sense for your business?</p>
<p>That’s exactly what we’re going to cover here. We’ll break down manual, automated, and Smart Bidding in Google Ads—plus when to use each—so you can make the most of your ad budget.</p>

<h2>What is automated bidding?</h2>
<p>When you set up a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-run-google-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads campaign</a>, you have to tell Google how much you’re willing to pay for your ad to be shown. This is called your bid, and there are two different ways to set your bids: manual or automated.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistakes" data-cke-saved-href="/blog/ws/2014/10/30/switch-automatic-bidding-to-manual">manual bidding</a>, you tell Google the maximum amount you’re willing to pay per click on your ad (CPC), and you can make adjustments to that bid based on your ad’s performance as determined by the metrics available in your reports.</p>
<p>With automated bidding, Google uses <a href="/blog/ws/2018/10/01/google-ads-automated-rules" data-cke-saved-href="/blog/ws/2018/10/01/google-ads-automated-rules">automated rules</a> to adjust your bids for you, based on the ad’s likelihood of getting a click or conversion. Automated bidding may use additional data points that aren’t available in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/07/ppc-reporting" data-cke-saved-href="/blog/ws/2021/09/07/ppc-reporting">reporting metrics.</a></p>
<p>There are eight types of automated bidding options in Google Ads:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enhanced cost per click (ECPC)</li>
<li>Maximize Clicks</li>
<li>Maximize Conversions</li>
<li>Maximize Conversion Value</li>
<li>Target Cost Per Action ( tCPA)</li>
<li>Target Return on Ad Spend (tROAS)</li>
<li>Viewable CPM (vCPM)</li>
<li>Cost Per View (CPV)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Automated bidding vs. Smart Bidding: What&#8217;s the difference?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-smart-bidding" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7065882#zippy=%2Cautomated-bidding-signals">Smart Bidding</a> and automated bidding often get used interchangeably, but they’re not the same thing. Smart Bidding refers only to Google’s automated bidding strategies that use “auction-time bidding,” meaning it will optimize for conversion or conversion value in each and every auction. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximize Conversions</li>
<li>Maximize Conversion value</li>
<li>Target CPA</li>
<li>Target ROAS</li>
</ul>
<p>So while all Smart Bidding strategies are automated, not all automated bidding strategies are Smart Bidding strategies.</p>

<div id="types-of-automated-bidding"></div>
<h2>Every automated bidding strategy in Google Ads</h2>
<p>Here are all your automated bidding strategy options and their pros and cons.</p>
<div id="maximize-conversions"></div>
<h3>1. Maximize Conversions</h3>
<p>Maximize Conversions is a fully automated bidding strategy, meaning there are no individual keyword bids set by advertisers that Google factors in. It simply chooses a CPC bid based on the goal of the bidding strategy.</p>
<p>The Maximum Conversions bid strategy is designed to get as many conversions as possible while spending your daily budget. Max Conversions also gives you the option to add a target CPA to help guide its bidding.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-ads-automated-bidding-maximize-conversions.jpg" alt="Maximize Conversions" width="1246" height="240" /></div>
<p>Although this bid strategy is relatively straightforward, it warrants an abundance of caution. Here are some tips to keep in mind and precautions to take.</p>
<h4>Each campaign needs its own daily budget</h4>
<p>It’s important that each campaign using Maximize Conversions has its own daily budget assigned, as opposed to being part of a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-shared-budgets">shared budget</a>, as this strategy will always try to spend the full daily allotted budget per campaign. If included in a shared budget, Maximize Conversions will spend the daily budget of the entire shared group, not just its own allotment.</p>
<h4>You need conversion tracking in place</h4>
<p>Do not run this strategy without having conversion tracking in place. Google’s goal is to maximize the number of conversions being tracked, so if no tracking is enabled, the algorithm is more likely to make bad decisions to find a person willing to convert.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36587 aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-conversion-tracking.png" alt="google ads conversion tracking setup" width="720" height="233" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-conversion-tracking.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-conversion-tracking-480x155.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Keep an eye on CPC</h4>
<p>Remember, Google’s algorithm is going to bid whatever it needs to bid to get you the most conversions possible. You may see your spend or average CPC creep up as Google is bidding more aggressively to meet your conversion goals.</p>
<p>However, while Max Conversions has a history of potentially spending more aggressively, the increased <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization-marketing">conversion rate</a> balances you back out. Your spend or average CPC may be higher, but you’ll have more conversions coming in—resulting in an overall lower CPA and higher ROI. Plus, with the new option to add a target cost per action (CPA), these risks can be kept in control.</p>
<p>In short, if your goal is to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/performance-max-lead-generation">get more leads for cheaper</a>, Max Conversions might just work for you. However, if you’re tight on budget, try a target CPA with Max Conversions or go for another strategy instead!</p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US" class="TextRun SCXW31673628 BCX0"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW31673628 BCX0"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4b8.png" alt="💸" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span></span>Are you wasting any spend in Google Ads? </strong>Find out instantly with the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Free Google Ads</a><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader"> </a><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Grader</a>.</p>
<div id="maximize-clicks"></div>
<h3>2. Maximize Clicks</h3>
<p>This strategy is very similar to Maximize Conversions but instead focuses on clicks. With Maximize Clicks, Google will work to get as many clicks as possible while spending your daily budget.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-ads-automated-bidding-maximize-clicks.jpg" alt="Maximize Clicks" width="1248" height="372" /></p>
<p>This strategy can be great if you’re trying to drive more volume to your site for <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/14/use-branding-to-improve-advertising" data-cke-saved-href="/blog/ws/2020/09/14/use-branding-to-improve-advertising">branding</a> and list building, or if you have very strong <a href="/blog/ws/2019/08/19/conversion-rate-benchmarks" data-cke-saved-href="/blog/ws/2019/08/19/conversion-rate-benchmarks">conversion performance</a> and want to find more volume.</p>
<p>Here are some other tips to keep in mind.</p>
<h4>Set a max CPC</h4>
<p>Always set a max CPC and keep an eye on your average max CPC as well. Google will work to get as many clicks as possible for your campaign, but as with Maximize Conversions, it will also work hard to spend your entire daily budget each day, even if clicks are far more expensive than normal.</p>
<h4>Regularly check on CPC performance</h4>
<p>Regularly check in on the CPC performance this bid strategy is generating (and any other goal metrics you have in place) to ensure it’s still meeting your goals. If not, then adjust your settings or potentially look to a new bid strategy.</p>
<div id="maximize-conversion-value"></div>
<h3>3. Maximize Conversion Value</h3>
<p>Max Conversion Value is the older sibling of the Max Conversions strategy because it’s slightly more advanced.</p>
<p>While the two strategies are fundamentally the same, Max Conversion Value looks to bring in conversions that will give you the highest return.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36586 aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-strategies-pros-cons-maximize-conversion-value.png" alt="google ads automated bidding strategies pros and cons: maximize conversion value setup" width="720" height="154" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-strategies-pros-cons-maximize-conversion-value.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-strategies-pros-cons-maximize-conversion-value-480x103.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In other words, it doesn’t necessarily look at how<em> many </em>conversions it’s bringing in, but the<em> value</em> within each conversion. It’s a strategy that looks at quality over quantity.</p>
<p>Similar to how Max Conversions allows you to set a Target CPA, Max Conversion Value gives you the option to set a Target ROAS to help guide its bidding.</p>
<p>There are two points of caution for this bidding strategy.</p>
<h4>Track conversions</h4>
<p>Just like with Max Conversions, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/24/google-ads-conversion-tracking" data-cke-saved-href="/blog/ws/2021/05/24/google-ads-conversion-tracking">properly setting up conversion tracking</a> is vital to the success of this strategy.</p>
<h4>Assign values</h4>
<p>Be sure <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/10/how-to-determine-conversion-value">each action is assigned a value</a>, or else the algorithm will be confused.</p>
<p>After all, a conversion worth $1000 to your business deserves a higher bid than one worth only $5. If your tracking is not properly set for value-based bidding, this won’t work.</p>
<div id="target-cpa"></div>
<h3>4. Target CPA (tCPA)</h3>
<p>Target CPA stands for target cost per action (or conversion). It used to be a separate bidding strategy but is now only available as an option within the Max Conversions strategy (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/google-retiring-tcpa-troas" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/google-retiring-tcpa-troas">learn more here</a>).</p>
<p>With tCPA, you set a target cost per action (conversion) and then Google adjusts bids to generate as many conversions as possible at that CPA.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36585 aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-target-cpa.png" alt="google ads automated bidding strategies: target CPA setup" width="600" height="227" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-target-cpa.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-target-cpa-480x182.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Advertisers are able to set bid minimums and maximums to ensure Google doesn’t adjust bids through the floor or ceiling, but only for <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6263072" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portfolio-</a>level</span> use. If you’re targeting for individual campaigns, these bid caps aren’t available.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36584 aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/gogle-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-target-cpa-options.png" alt="google ads automated bidding strategies: target CPA min and max setup" width="500" height="600" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/gogle-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-target-cpa-options.png 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/gogle-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-target-cpa-options-480x576.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There are three things to note about tCPA bidding.</p>
<h4>Set up conversion tracking</h4>
<p>Like Max Conversions and Max Conversion Value, Target CPA bidding requires conversion tracking enabled in your account. Without it, this bidding strategy is useless—it will never know if it’s driving conversions or not.</p>
<p>But that’s not all. Just because you have conversion tracking turned on doesn’t mean you’re off to the races just yet.</p>
<h4>Provide minimum conversion data</h4>
<p>To drive conversion performance, Google needs to have a certain amount of conversion data to be able to make smart decisions. If you don’t have enough conversion volume, then the algorithm can’t make smart decisions, and tCPA isn’t the right bidding option for you.</p>
<p>At the campaign level, Google says the minimum is 15 conversions in the last 30 days, but we’ve found this to be on the low side. Ideally, you should have at least 30 conversions, if not 50, in the past 30 days before testing tCPA bidding.</p>
<p>If your campaigns don’t reach this level individually, they might at a portfolio level. If they still don’t, tCPA likely shouldn’t be on your list of eligible bid strategies.</p>
<h4>Set a realistic target</h4>
<p>Lastly, when getting started with tCPA, it’s important to set realistic initial goals. If your campaign has had an average CPA of $40 over the past six months, it’s not in your best interest to set a target CPA of $20, as it will limit Google right away in the auctions it can enter in and learn.</p>
<p>If you’re planning to use tCPA bidding, plan on the first two weeks to a month being a learning phase. Set your target CPA slightly higher than what your average CPA has been recently, or use the Google-suggested CPA target to let Google find a groove, then slowly bring it down over time to your target CPA.</p>
<div id="target-roas"></div>
<h3>5. Target ROAS (tROAS)</h3>
<p>Target ROAS is nearly the same as Target CPA, but with return on ad spend (ROAS) instead. And just as tCPA has been reorganized under Max Conversions, tROAS has been reorganized under Max Conversion Value (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/google-retiring-tcpa-troas" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/google-retiring-tcpa-troas">learn more here</a>).</p>
<p>With this strategy, Google Ads will predict future conversion and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/25/conversion-value" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/25/conversion-value">conversion value</a> performance based on your historical data to enter auctions, and then adjust bids in real time to maximize conversion value while trying to achieve the target ROAS goal you’ve set at the ad group, campaign, or portfolio level.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36583 aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-target-ROAS.png" alt="google ads automated bidding: target roas setup" width="720" height="261" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-target-ROAS.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-target-ROAS-480x174.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As with tCPA, individual conversions may have higher or lower ROAS than your goal, and Google will work to balance those out over time to achieve your ROAS target.</p>
<p>With tROAS, advertisers can set bid limits (minimums and maximums) at the campaign or portfolio level to help keep the Google algorithm from straying too far, but Google cautions against this as it can limit the machine&#8217;s decision-making.</p>
<p>All the same cautions for tCPA apply to tROAS.</p>
<h4>Set up accurate conversion tracking</h4>
<p>Ensure you have accurate conversion tracking in place including conversion values and that you have enough conversion performance in the recent past to leverage this strategy.</p>
<h4>Don&#8217;t set your target ROAS too high</h4>
<p>Also, be careful not set your target ROAS at a restrictively high level right off the bat. Start off with a goal slightly lower than what your performance has been recently, then slowly raise the target over time to achieve a more profitable ROAS.</p>
<div id="target-impression-share"></div>
<h3>6. Target Impression Share</h3>
<p>With Target Impression Share, advertisers set a goal impression share percentage in the same way you would set a target CPA for that bidding strategy.<br />
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-ads-automated-bidding-target-impression-share.jpg" alt="Target Impression Share" width="1072" height="558" /><br />
There are three placement options you have to bid for with Target Impression Share:</p>
<ul>
<li>Absolute Top of Page</li>
<li>Top of Page</li>
<li>Anywhere on the Page</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these will tell the Google algorithm different things about your preferences, and it will adjust bids accordingly.</p>
<p>Advertisers are also able to set a max CPC bid with Target Impression Share bidding to help guard against overspend, but Google cautions against setting it too low and throttling performance.</p>
<p>Like any other bidding strategy, this one has the potential to increase your bids beyond the profitability level if you’re not careful. This strategy is focused on awareness and reach (though it can be used for performance), but there are still limits to what makes sense monetarily for your campaigns.</p>
<h4>Keep an eye on CPC</h4>
<p>Always set a max CPC bid to ensure you don’t pay too much for any individual click. Although Google cautions against it, don’t worry about setting this bid too low to start. Try setting it at a percentage increase over your current bid of 20%-50%. If that works well, then leave that cap. If you’re not seeing the volume you’d like, increase the max CPC.</p>
<h4>Have realistic expectations</h4>
<p>Very few auctions will actually see 100% coverage anymore. So although you set a target to 100%, don’t be surprised or frustrated if you show up closer to 95% as a top achievable number.</p>
<p>Always keep an eye on CPCs and performance outcomes to ensure this bidding strategy is achieving your goals before continuing with this strategy.</p>
<div id="viewable-cpm"></div>
<h3>7. Viewable CPM</h3>
<p>Viewable CPM (vCPM) refers to cost per thousand viewable impressions. According to <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6026409?hl=en" data-cke-saved-href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6026409?hl=en">Google</a><em>, </em>an ad is counted as viewable when 50% of your ad shows on screen for one second or longer for Display ads, and two seconds or longer for video ads.</p>
<p>This is a Display-only bid strategy designed to let advertisers bid for impressions when your ad is shown in a viewable space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36582 aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-strategies-viewable-cpm.png" alt="google ads automated bidding strategies pros and cons: viewable CPM setup" width="600" height="153" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-strategies-viewable-cpm.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-strategies-viewable-cpm-480x122.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>vCPM bidding is great if you’re working on expanding your brand coverage and simply want to get your message in front of a large group of people.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things to watch out for with vCPM bidding: frequency and placements.</p>
<h4>Be mindful of frequency</h4>
<p>With this strategy, Google will look to maximize the number of viewable impressions your ad receives. When using this strategy with a finite audience, your chances of hitting a high frequency count for each user go up.</p>
<p>We’ve all had the ads that seem to stalk us as we peruse the internet, so be sure that although you’re trying to maximize ad views, you’re not doing it at the expense of a small audience who now feel overwhelmed by your brand.</p>
<h4>Keep an eye on placements</h4>
<p>Additionally, not all viewable impressions are created equal. Just like any other display campaign, it’s important to keep an eye on your placements report to ensure you’re not showing up on unwanted sites.</p>
<div id="cost-per-view"></div>
<h3>8. Cost Per View (CPV)</h3>
<p>Bidding on individual views is only available for video ads. With Cost Per View, you set a campaign-level bid limit that implies the maximum you’re willing to pay for each view or interaction with your video (whichever comes first).</p>
<p>In this case, you’d only be charged for a view if someone watched your video for more than 30 seconds (or the entire video if it’s shorter than 30 seconds). Otherwise, if the viewer instead clicks on a link the video shares or takes part in other calls to action (app download, etc.), you will be charged for that interaction.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36581 aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-cpv-automated-bidding-strategy.png" alt="google ads automated bidding strategies: cost per view setup" width="600" height="349" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-cpv-automated-bidding-strategy.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-cpv-automated-bidding-strategy-480x279.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The nice thing about CPV bidding is it also allows you to “bid up” when you show alongside popular YouTube videos that may be more likely to bring you in a return.</p>
<h4>Set up the right targeting</h4>
<p>Beware if you have loose targeting on your video campaigns! If you’re bringing in TONS of views at a cheaper cost, it most likely won’t make sense for you to use CPV.</p>
<h4>Only spend when it counts</h4>
<p>Since you’re bidding on individual views, you only want to spend when it really counts. So if you have looser targeting this will be tougher to gauge. Additionally, video views and average costs per view tend to be relatively cheap.</p>
<p>This makes CPV a great strategy for a hyper-focused video campaign in a highly competitive space, but not the best for those just starting out in video ads.</p>
<div id="manual"></div>
<h3>A note on Manual Cost Per Click (CPC)</h3>
<p>Although Manual CPC is not an automated bidding strategy, it&#8217;s still worth mentioning in our bid strategy roundup as it&#8217;s the easiest bid strategy to grasp on the Google Ads platform. Advertisers set their bids manually at the keyword level, and the bids stay where they are until the advertiser changes them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36589 aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-manual-cpc.png" alt="pros and cons of every automated bidding strategy in google ads: manual cpc setup" width="720" height="207" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-manual-cpc.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-manual-cpc-480x138.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Despite the friendly warning from Google, this is the best place to start for folks starting out in PPC or using their spare time to manage their account but has its drawbacks.</p>
<p>Despite the friendly warning from Google, this is a recommended place to start for folks starting out in PPC or using their spare time to manage their account.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistakes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manual bidding</a> has two drawbacks:</p>
<h4>It takes a lot of time</h4>
<p>When it comes down to it, manual bidding requires a time investment to look at performance, judge if the keyword bid needs to change, decide what that change needs to be, and then actually make that change.</p>
<h4>You could be underinformed</h4>
<p>When we review our <a href="/blog/ws/2011/05/10/common-ppc-metrics" data-cke-saved-href="/blog/ws/2011/05/10/common-ppc-metrics">performance metrics</a>, we’re at the whim of the metrics Google allows us to see for our campaigns. With automated bidding strategies, Google is able to take data points into account that we don’t even know exist.</p>
<p>These two downsides don’t mean all automation is good and that manual bidding isn’t the right solution for you. But they are something to consider when determining bid strategies.</p>
<div id="set-up-automated-bidding"></div>
<h2>How to set your automated bidding strategy</h2>
<p>Once you determine which automated bidding strategy is right for you, how do you select it?</p>
<p>It’s important to note that when you’re setting up your campaign, <strong>Google will automatically choose an automated bidding strategy for you based on your goals. </strong></p>
<p><strong>You do not have to use this strategy!</strong></p>
<p>You can choose any other automated bidding strategy, or instead choose to bid manually.</p>
<p>Simply select the blue text at the bottom where it says “Select a bid strategy directly (not recommended)”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36590 aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-default.png" alt="bid strategy setup in google ads" width="600" height="270" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-default.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-default-480x216.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Alright, so now that you know the basics of Google Ads bidding, let’s go through every option you have for bidding.</p>
<div id="choosing-a-strategy"></div>
<h2>Which automated bidding strategy should you choose?</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve covered all the automated bidding strategies, it’s time to choose the one that’s right for your whole account, right?</p>
<p>Wrong!</p>
<p>The best thing about automated bidding and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/17/google-ads-bid-management">bid management</a>: we can pick and choose what we use where.</p>
<p>Google Ads allows for automated bidding strategies to be set at either the ad group, campaign, or portfolio level, depending on the strategy you choose. This means you can direct different aspects of your account to rely on different bid strategies depending on their goals.</p>
<p>When choosing a bid strategy, evaluate at the campaign level to determine if the strategy will help accomplish your goal and if you have enough data to make it work (e.g., enough conversion volume to make Target CPA effective). If not, you might benefit from another bid strategy, a portfolio-level strategy, or even an adjustment in account structure to better leverage it later on.</p>
<h2>Set it and <em>don’t</em> forget it</h2>
<p>Automated bid strategies in Google Ads are a fantastic way to save time while leveraging algorithms to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/offset-lower-website-traffic">optimize your account</a>, but only when evaluated and chosen wisely.</p>
<p>And even though automated bidding strategies require less maintenance than manual bidding, there’s no such thing as “set it and forget it.” Once these strategies are leveraged in your account, set reminders to check in on them to ensure they’re still accomplishing the goals they set out to hit. Happy automating!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve been paying attention to the Google Ads landscape over the past couple of months, you’ve likely heard of the release of AI Max for Search. I’ve heard from many advertisers that they’re worried that Google is messing with Search campaigns, but I think those worries are a bit premature.</p>
<p>In this article, I want to talk about what AI Max for Search is (and some of what it isn’t) and talk about when it might make sense to test in your account.</p>

<h2>What is AI Max for Search?</h2>
<p>First, let’s get something out of the way: AI Max is NOT a replacement for Search campaigns.</p>
<p>So, let’s talk about what AI Max <em>is</em> and how it will work.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-marketing-live-2025#:~:text=3.-,AI%20Max%20for%20Search%20campaigns,-AI%20Max%20for">AI Max</a> is a new set of optional features you can enable with your Search campaigns in Google Ads to help with targeting and creative assets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-for-search-campaigns.webp" alt="ai max for search campaigns" width="755" height="565" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93380" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-for-search-campaigns.webp 755w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-for-search-campaigns-480x359.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 755px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="ai-max-for-search-new-features"></div>
<h3>New features for AI Max</h3>
<p>Here’s a quick rundown of the new features available within AI Max:</p>
<h4>Search term matching</h4>
<p>This is a new form of keywordless targeting that combines a few different features. It uses Broad match (i.e., the Broad match campaign setting) plus keywordless matching that uses signals from keywords, assets, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">landing pages</a>.</p>
<p>From what I can tell, when it comes to keyword prioritization, AI Max will fall in line with the existing hierarchy in one of two ways.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-search-term-matching.webp" alt="ai max search term matching" width="684" height="687" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93381" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-search-term-matching.webp 684w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-search-term-matching-480x482.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 684px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If your ad is triggered for a search term based on the Broad match setting, that will fall into the level of the list alongside Phrase match and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/11/search-themes-for-performance-max-campaigns">Search themes</a> for PMax. If your ad is triggered with the keywordless matching option, i.e., the search term was determined by your keywords, assets, or landing pages, then it will fall into the last row where only Ad Rank serves to determine prioritization.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-for-search-campaigns-example-e1753987829552.webp" alt="ai max for search keywordless targeting" width="884" height="507" class="aligncenter wp-image-93386 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-for-search-campaigns-example-e1753987829552.webp 884w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-for-search-campaigns-example-e1753987829552-480x270.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 884px, 100vw" /></p>

<h4>Updates to reporting</h4>
<p>Since AI Max gets to choose search queries, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2025-google-ads-keywords">keywords</a>, landing pages, and assets for you, each of those reports will now have a portion that shows when AI Max selected them. Within search terms, you will also be able to see if the query was selected based on Broad match expansion or keywordless matching.</p>
<div id="ai-max-for-search-existing-features"></div>
<h3>Not-so-new features in AI Max</h3>
<p>There are some features in the AI Max for Search announcements that are effectively just carryovers from what’s usable in regular Search or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/10/dynamic-search-ads">Dynamic Search Ads</a> (DSA) campaigns currently.</p>
<h4>Brand settings</h4>
<p>With AI Max for Search, you’ll still be able to utilize Brand Inclusion and Exclusion lists just as you do with regular Search campaigns.</p>

<h4>URL rules</h4>
<p>Just like with Dynamic Search Ads campaigns, you’ll be able to control which URLs your ads are eligible to use with inclusions and exclusions. Advertisers will also be able to utilize Page Feeds, as well, if that’s a simpler option than having two separate inclusion-exclusion lists.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-url-rules.webp" alt="ai max for search brand rules" width="720" height="140" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93383" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-url-rules.webp 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-url-rules-480x93.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Text customization</h4>
<p>This feature is new to Search, but exists in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/23/optimize-performance-max-campaigns">Performance Max campaigns</a>. With Text Customization, Google will use text from your existing ads, landing pages, and assets along with generative AI to create a customized ad copy that’s relevant to your user&#8217;s query.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6e0.png" alt="🛠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Get the tools and tips you need to build the perfect landing page in our free guide &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLiQContentDLHowToMakeGreatLandingPages.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_LandingPages_HowToMakeGreatLandingPagesGuide_Download">How to Make Great Landing Pages (with Crazy-High Conversion)</a></p>
<h4>Final URL expansion</h4>
<p>Also, available in PMax campaigns, Final URL Expansion lets Google choose a more specific page from your site as the landing page for your ad if it believes it’s more relevant than the landing page you selected. This requires Text Customization to be turned on.</p>
<h4>Locations of interest</h4>
<p>These controls will be able to be adjusted at the ad group level to include people based on either their location, Presence or their Presence or Interest in a given location. The key difference here is the control at the ad group level rather than the campaign level as with existing Search campaigns.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-locations-or-interest.png" alt="ai max for search locations or interest" width="602" height="93" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93390" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-locations-or-interest.png 602w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-locations-or-interest-480x74.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 602px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Many other features, like negative keywords and location exclusions, will still apply to your AI Max campaigns just like they do for regular Search.</p>
<div id="ai-max-for-search-note"></div>
<h3>A note about AI Max options</h3>
<p>One thing I want to stress about AI Max in its current form is its optionality. There are LOTS of features within this new set that you can pick and choose à la carte to apply or not apply as you wish. Each of the options listed below are features that can be opted into or out of based on your preferences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keywordless Targeting</li>
<li>Text Customization</li>
<li>Final URL Expansion (must have Text Customization enabled to use this)</li>
<li>Location of Interest</li>
<li>AI Max: You can toggle this on or off at your discretion</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> You still have lots of control, even when ceding some control to Google.</p>
<div id="requirements-for-ai-max"></div>
<h2>Requirements for AI Max</h2>
<p>There are just a couple of requirements for you to use AI Max.</p>
<p>First, your campaign type must (obviously) be a Search campaign. If you want to use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/04/google-ads-ai">Google’s AI features</a> with other campaign types, there are plenty of others to choose from.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-ads-campaign-type-search.webp" alt="google ads campaign types with search selected" width="830" height="397" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93384" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-ads-campaign-type-search.webp 830w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-ads-campaign-type-search-480x230.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 830px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Second, you must be using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-smart-bidding">Smart Bidding strategies</a> focused on conversions. This means Max Conversions or Max Conversion Value are eligible, as well as their augmented styles of tCPA and tROAS, respectively. No other bid strategies are supported at this time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-ads-bidding-strategies-conversion-focused.webp" alt="google ads smart conversion focused bidding strategies" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93379" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-ads-bidding-strategies-conversion-focused.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-ads-bidding-strategies-conversion-focused-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>

<div id="when-not-to-use-ai-max"></div>
<h2>When not to use AI Max</h2>
<p>While some of these features are really just a different packaging for options that are already available in Google Ads, there are some scenarios where I wouldn’t recommend using AI Max for Search.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Poor website:</strong> Just like with DSA campaigns, if your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/no-website-traffic">website isn’t a strong representation of your company</a>, AI Max for Search might not be a great idea if you leave the Text Customization and Final URL expansion on.</li>
<li><strong>Regulation-heavy industry:</strong> Just like with other automated features in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-run-google-ads">Google Ads</a>, if you need to have strict messaging in ads based on regulatory compliance, AI Max might not be a great option.</li>
<li><strong>Low conversion volume:</strong> Although Google touts its Smart Bidding as being able to generate results without much history, I’ve personally never found success with that. I’d always suggest following the 30/30 rule, meaning at least 30 conversions in the last 30 days, with 50 conversions in the last 30 days being an even better threshold to meet.</li>
<li><strong>Lead quality considerations:</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-generation-ideas">Lead generation</a> is always a tough route with Google Ads automation. The platform is really good at getting leads, but <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-quality">generating quality leads</a> can be a challenge. If you have high thresholds to hit for quality, AI Max could still be an okay option, but will likely need to take a backseat to classic Search. Speaking of…</li>
</ul>
<div id="when-to-try-ai-max-for-search"></div>
<h2>When to try AI Max for Search</h2>
<p>For now, I’m thinking of AI Max for Search as a combination of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/performance-max">Performance Max</a> and Dynamic Search Ads. The biggest common factor in those campaigns: they’re here to drive incremental volume outside of my reach with my existing Search campaigns.</p>
<p>What does all this mean for me? I’m still going to build out a robust, old-school Search strategy that leverages Exact match terms just like I have for the last 15 years and manage it as usual. Given the prioritization schedule above, Exact match still outranks everything else, and since that’s where I’ll have the most control, that’s where I’m going to start.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I’ll leverage AI Max as an expansion tool, just like I would for DSA. If anything, AI Max, in my mind, just translates to a slightly more AI-centered Dynamic Search Ads strategy. It functions relatively the same, but just has a few more bells and whistles.</p>
<p>TL;DR: If you’re a fan of classic Search paired with Dynamic Search Ads for extra reach, then AI Max for Search might be your new favorite tool.</p>
<div id="how-to-get-started-with-ai-max"></div>
<h2>How to get started with AI Max for Search</h2>
<p>AI Max for Search started its rollout as of early 2025 but is going to take until Q3 of 2025 to be fully available to all accounts. If you want to test this campaign type, you’ll have to wait for it to hit your account.</p>
<p>Once the feature is available for you, there will be an option to use Google Ads Campaign Experiments to test AI Max for Search before jumping in full force. It’s not clear at this time exactly what the logistics of that setup will be, but there will be some functionality around it.</p>
<h2>Is AI Max for Search right for you right now?</h2>
<p>Google is continuing to roll out new features powered by AI to help advertisers find their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/target-audience-examples">target audience</a>. If you’re a classic marketer like me, this might be a nice addition to what you already have running. If you’re new to marketing and Search in general, this might be an easy option for you to get things started and see results.</p>
<p>Just like all other new features, I don’t think AI Max is for everyone, and it certainly can be a slippery slope for advertisers who aren’t sure what they’re doing, but it also could be a great option for folks who have maxed out traditional search and need to see incremental results.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A common critique of Performance Max campaigns (and many of the advertising updates from Google over the last decade, to be honest) is that they’re not well suited for generating leads. However, with recent PMax advancements, this is no longer the case.</p>
<p>Since the launch of Performance Max, there have been tons of updates to make generating leads easier using this particular campaign type. However, it’s still not a &#8220;set it and forget it&#8221; lead gen strategy. You&#8217;ll have to find ways to consistently optimize your PMax campaign so that it can acquire as many leads as possible.</p>
<p>Plus, in my opinion, it’s a good strategy to find ways Performance Max can work for you and your business because it’s never guaranteed that the other campaign options will continue to stick around.</p>
<p>So with that, let’s talk about the strategies you can use to make PMax impactful for lead generation.</p>

<div id="funnel-conversion-tracking"></div>
<h3>1. Use a full(er) funnel approach to conversion tracking</h3>
<p>We’re going to start at the most foundational part of a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/are-google-ads-worth-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign in Google Ads</a>: the campaign objectives and goals.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge I’ve seen with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-audit-pmax-display-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PMax campaigns for lead gen</a> is that they can definitely generate leads. The problem is that some of the leads are straight up crap.</p>
<p>While it’s true that you’ll need to technically generate leads with PMax to build a funnel, it’s a simple but important distinction to make the goal of the campaign something other than those form fills that correlate with leads.</p>
<p>The better approach is to set your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-performance-max/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PMax campaigns</a> to optimize for a qualified lead, or some other action that’s further down the funnel than the initial lead itself.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-pmax-lead-generation-conversion-funnel.webp" alt="pmax lead generation - conversion funnel" width="823" height="410" class="aligncenter wp-image-92487 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-pmax-lead-generation-conversion-funnel.webp 823w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-pmax-lead-generation-conversion-funnel-480x239.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 823px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>To do this, you’ll need to use some combination of enhanced conversions and offline conversion imports from your CRM.</p>
<p>This process can be a bit finicky to set up, but it will really pay off in the end. The outcome will be a Performance Max campaign that uses Google Ads’ machine learning to generate qualified leads for your business.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-performance-max-conversion-funnel.webp" alt="pmax lead generation - enhanced conversions" width="773" height="477" class="aligncenter wp-image-92483 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-performance-max-conversion-funnel.webp 773w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-performance-max-conversion-funnel-480x296.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 773px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="audience-signals-buyer-funnel"></div>
<h3>2. Use audience signals that match the buyer funnel</h3>
<p>Similar to choosing a performance goal that’s further down the funnel, we can also leverage audience signals that are further down the funnel.</p>
<p>With Performance Max campaigns, Google will start by targeting the audiences you provide it, then extend beyond those lists once it feels like it has a good understanding of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a> and can find similar users who are likely to complete your given campaign goal.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-performance-max-audience-data.webp" alt="google ads pmax -lead generation audience targets" width="806" height="447" class="aligncenter wp-image-92490 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-performance-max-audience-data.webp 806w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-performance-max-audience-data-480x266.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 806px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>To help them find higher-quality users who are more likely to convert on your down funnel actions, you should give it as qualified an audience as possible. Website visitors and lead form submissions aren’t enough.</p>
<p>Use your customer lists, qualified form fills, opportunities, and lost contracts. Yes, even lost contracts are qualified. They got all the way to the final stages of your sales cycle, so my guess is you wouldn’t mind having more of them.</p>
<p>Although there are lots of options you can choose from in the preset Google audiences like In-Market, Life Events, and Detailed Demographics, for the most part, I find these to be too broad for lead gen companies trying to drive high-quality leads. Like most things Google develops, they can be excellent for ecommerce, but lead gen is just a different beast. I’d recommend sticking to your own audiences with PMax.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-performance-max-audience-options.webp" alt="google ads performance max - lead generation" width="863" height="354" class="aligncenter wp-image-92489 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-performance-max-audience-options.webp 863w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-performance-max-audience-options-480x197.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 863px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="search-themes-buyer-behavior"></div>
<h3>3. Leverage search themes based on buyer behavior</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/11/search-themes-for-performance-max-campaigns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Search themes</a> operate similarly to keywords in search, but not exactly the same. They help guide Google to certain themes your audience may search. They have the same prioritization as phrase and broad match terms in Search campaigns, but will be outranked by your exact match keywords.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-performance-max-search-themes-1024x221.webp" alt="google ads performance max - search themes" width="1024" height="221" class="aligncenter wp-image-92488 size-large" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-performance-max-search-themes-1024x221.webp 1024w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-performance-max-search-themes-980x211.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-performance-max-search-themes-480x103.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For this reason, have a robust <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/offset-lower-website-traffic">search account set up</a> with exact match terms in place. Not just phrase and broad, even though Google prefers them. Let your Search campaigns tackle the exact match versions of your keywords, even if it will be to the detriment of PMax performance.</p>
<p>Instead, use PMax to find incremental conversions (remember, those high-quality, bottom-funnel conversions).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-pmax-bidding-priority.webp" alt="google ads pmax - bidding priority" width="793" height="451" class="aligncenter wp-image-92493 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-pmax-bidding-priority.webp 793w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-pmax-bidding-priority-480x273.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 793px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>To do this with search themes, create tightly themed asset groups, just like you would with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keywords in search</a>. Too often, advertisers will throw all their high-volume keywords into a single asset group, no themes included, and hope for the best.</p>
<p>With tightly themed groups, you’ll have a narrower focus for Google to go off of and have a better chance of finding the right type of users when they&#8217;re in the right state of mind.</p>

<div id="negative-keywords-low-quality"></div>
<h3>4. Use negative keywords to exclude low-quality users</h3>
<p>Google didn’t have negative keywords in the initial version of PMax. Since then, they’ve slowly rolled out increasing options for negative keywords. As of early 2025, advertisers now have the ability to add up to 1,000 negative keywords at the campaign level to a PMax campaign, giving quite a bit of control over which search terms you show for.</p>
<p>To generate high-quality leads with PMax, there’s a simple rule: take full advantage of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/06/negative-keyword-guide">negative keywords</a>. This includes all of the regular, foundational negatives you likely have in your existing Search campaigns (read: the ones that are irrelevant to your business), but it also should include relevant, but lower quality queries. Make sure you’re focusing on the users with high intent and excluding those who are just window shoppers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-negative-keywords-.webp" alt="google ads performance max lead generation - negative keywords" width="707" height="623" class="aligncenter wp-image-92491 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-negative-keywords-.webp 707w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-negative-keywords--480x423.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 707px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="asset-groups-personas"></div>
<h3>5. Treat asset groups like personas on LinkedIn or Meta</h3>
<p>PMax campaigns operate similarly to a social media campaign in that they have a broad network reach, and each asset group houses a different set of audiences and contextual targets. Put that structure to work, similar to how you would in LinkedIn or Meta Ads.</p>
<p>Use each asset group as a different persona: have the proper audience signals that align with those users, layer in any specific demographics or interests that match, include the proper <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/11/search-themes-for-performance-max-campaigns">search themes</a> they would be looking for (make a couple asset groups to target drastically different search themes if you need to), and tailor the creative assets to the messaging that would resonate best with this specific persona.</p>
<p>If need be, you can use Google’s AI tools to help you develop creative assets based on your website. There have been some great advancements in how this works, and it can help you better tailor your asset groups to each persona without taxing your design department too heavily. There’s even a portion for brand guidelines below where you can control your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/small-business-logo">logos</a>, color schemes, and more.</p>

<h2>What are Google Ads Performance Max campaigns?</h2>
<p>Google Ads <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-performance-max/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Performance Max</a> campaigns are a fully automated way to show ads for your business across all of Google’s networks including Search, Display, YouTube, Discover, Maps, and Gmail.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-placements.webp" alt="performance max placements" width="900" height="424" class="aligncenter wp-image-92109 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-placements.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-placements-480x226.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>

<div id="performance-max-how-it-works"></div>
<h2>How do Google Ads Performance Max campaigns work?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/performance-max-lead-generation">PMax campaigns</a> serve your ads based on indicators you provide to the platform, such as campaign objective, conversion goals, audience signals, and more. Google takes media you provide or generate with AI (like images, ad text, or videos) and uses that to automatically create ads that fit any Google placement that aligns with your selected audience signals.</p>
<p>Audience signals, like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/11/search-themes-for-performance-max-campaigns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search themes</a> or your business’s first-party data, guide Google’s automation to choose the right users to fit into your target audience for you. As your PMax campaign continues to run, Google is constantly optimizing when and where to best serve your ad using your historical data.</p>
<p>This is why an <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/always-on-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">always-on strategy</a> is so important when it comes to running PMax campaigns (or any PPC campaign, for that matter). If you pause and enable your campaign frequently throughout the year, it won’t be able to escape the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/13/learning-period" target="_blank" rel="noopener">algorithmic learning phase</a> required for Google’s machine learning to understand how to effectively advertise your business to the correct audience.</p>

<h2>Benefits of using PMax campaigns</h2>
<p>Wondering if <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/20/performance-max-pros-cons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Performance Max is worth it for your business</a>? Consider these benefits of running Google Ads PMax campaigns.</p>
<h3>You can save time</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a ton of bandwidth to manage and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/05/types-of-google-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optimize multiple Google Ads campaign types</a>, Performance Max campaigns make it easy to still advertise your business across various placements.</p>
<h3>You can activate the Power Pack</h3>
<p>At <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-marketing-live-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Marketing Live 2025</a>, Google announced that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-performance-max-updates-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using PMax campaigns</a> in tandem with AI Max for search campaigns, as well as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/22/demand-gen-campaigns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demand Gen campaigns</a>, activates the Power Pack. The Power Pack includes performance reports by channel for PMax campaigns, targeting and creative enhancements in AI Max for search, and more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-power-pack.webp" alt="Google Marketing Live 2025 - Power Pack image." width="936" height="444" class="aligncenter wp-image-91746 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-power-pack.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-power-pack-480x228.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>You can view performance by channel</h3>
<p>Performance Max campaigns now have advanced reporting capabilities that other campaign types may not offer. For example, Google is <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-marketing-live-2025#:~:text=4.-,Channel%20reporting,-in%20PMax">rolling out a Channel performance page in accounts using PMax</a>, so that advertisers can see which channels are most effective with customers. This reporting is crucial, since this campaign type is showing ads across various placements.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-channel.webp" alt="Google Marketing Live 2025 - PMax channel chart." width="936" height="533" class="aligncenter wp-image-91749 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-channel.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-channel-480x273.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3><span>Your ads have more chances to show across the web</span></h3>
<p>Unlike channel-specific campaigns such as search or display, Performance Max allows you to reach your audience no matter where they are across the web. Since you can package together text, image, and video <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-assets">assets</a> under one campaign with PMax, you’re able to have different ad types for your business spread across all of Google’s platforms in one sweep.</p>
<h3>You can run PMax on Microsoft Ads</h3>
<p>Most businesses find increased PPC success with a cross-platform approach. If you’re already <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/replicate-google-ads-on-bing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replicating your Google Ads on Microsoft Ads</a> using the import tool, you can easily import your PMax campaigns, too.</p>
<p>Microsoft Ads offers <a href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en/blog/post/july-2023/introducing-microsoft-advertisings-performance-max" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its own version of Performance Max</a> campaigns similar to the Google Ads version. With this, advertisers can transition between platforms smoothly while still reaping the benefits of this campaign type across both Google and Bing placements.</p>

<h2>How much do PMax campaigns cost?</h2>
<p>The cost of Google Ads Performance Max campaigns depends on various factors, including your budget, industry competition, and the ad formats most frequently used, among others.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/15899323?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Google</a>, advertisers only pay for the performance an ad accrues, and there are no startup costs involved with creating or running a PMax campaign. For instance, you could be billed for video views, clicks, and other user engagements.</p>
<p>Visually-oriented placements like display and video are typically cheaper than spots on the SERP (search engine results page).  So, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/01/is-performance-max-right-for-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another benefit of PMax</a> to keep in mind here is that you’ll have more chances to potentially secure lower-cost ad placements. This usually makes PMax campaigns a good fit for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/19/google-ads-for-small-businesses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small business ad budgets</a>.</p>
<p>All that to say, there isn’t a set cost associated with Performance Max campaigns as your costs will vary by day, placement, and more. According to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2025-google-ads-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our latest Google Ads benchmarks</a>, the average cost per click for Google search ads is $5.26 and $70.11 per lead on average. However, display ad costs per click or impression can be lower, typically less than $1. So, you can expect to start spending roughly in that range for your PMax search and display placements.</p>
<p>Some other<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-costundefined" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Google Ads cost notes</a> to keep in mind when assigning a daily budget to your PMax campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li>The average starting budget to cover Google Ads costs for SMBs is <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/google-ads-spend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1,000-2,500</a> per month.</li>
<li>Most new Google Ads campaigns can cost around <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-for-startups" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$20-50</a> per day.</li>
<li>Most businesses spend between <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-for-startups" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1,000-10,000</a> per month on Google Ads.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your Performance Max costs are more likely to fluctuate when you first enable it, as Google’s algorithms require time to collect historical data. After this learning period, your PMax campaign will be able to make more cost-effective optimizations automatically.</p>

<h2>Quick PMax tips</h2>
<p>Ready to try out Google Ads PMax campaigns? Here are three quick <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/05/performance-max-tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Performance Max tips</a> to help you get started.</p>
<h3>Solidify your conversion tracking</h3>
<p>Since Performance Max campaigns use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-smart-bidding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smart Bidding</a>, these campaigns are meant to automatically allocate budget to the highest-performing channels and assets. In other words, you’re able to focus on driving more conversions or a higher conversion value with PMax. That said, you’ll need a highly optimized<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/30/google-ads-conversion-tracking" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> conversion tracking strategy</a> to use PMax effectively.</p>
<p>For example, you might consider <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-conversion-values" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adding values (and value rules) to your conversion action events</a> so that the PMax machine learning is able to differentiate which conversions are higher priority for your business.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-campaign-conversion-value-rules.webp" alt="performance max - conversion value rules screenshot" width="849" height="377" class="aligncenter wp-image-92228 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-campaign-conversion-value-rules.webp 849w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-campaign-conversion-value-rules-480x213.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 849px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Focus on high-quality creative assets</h3>
<p>Your PMax campaign will be only as good as the creative assets you provide or choose to generate with AI. For example, you may want to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-image-prompts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fine-tune your AI image prompts</a> to ensure any AI-generated visual content is tightly aligned with your brand.</p>
<h3>Provide as many audience signals as possible</h3>
<p>Audience signals, like search themes, brand lists, and more, can help <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-audit-pmax-display-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guide your Performance Max campaign</a> to the right target market for your desired results. This campaign type is the perfect opportunity to lean into your business’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/12/first-party-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first-party data to upload customer lists</a> your campaign can build audiences from.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It happens all the time. You do your best to build out a set of campaigns in Google Ads that follow industry best practices and that are aimed at your goals, but you just aren’t seeing the results you’re looking for. So what do you do?</p>
<p>Luckily, there are some pretty common issues that arise to cause poor performance and, for the most part, they can be pretty easily addressed assuming you’re willing to put in a little elbow grease.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of the things you should be looking at to get your performance turned around and make sure you’re hitting the goals you’re out to achieve.</p>

<h2>How to fix poor-performing Google Ads in 7 steps</h2>
<p>Follow these steps to turn your performance around.</p>
<div id="check-your-conversion-tracking-setup"></div>
<h3>1. Check your conversion tracking setup</h3>
<p>A foundational aspect of paid media campaigns is their trackability. It’s one of the key factors that sets these campaigns apart from other tactics. But it can also be a very easy mistake to overlook when trying to figure out why performance isn’t where you want it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-active-conversion-settings.webp" alt="conversion settings in google ads showing status" width="900" height="350" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92102" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-active-conversion-settings.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-active-conversion-settings-480x187.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Whenever I have a campaign that has started performing poorly, or that has never performed well, I always go back and check on the conversion tracking setup to ensure everything is working well. Only when that’s confirmed do I move on to other potential issues.</p>
<h4><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Action items</h4>
<ul>
<li>Confirm your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/14/how-to-use-google-tag-manager">Google Tag</a> is on all pages of your website.</li>
<li>Confirm your conversion pixels are firing on the right pages or events for all individual conversion actions on your site.</li>
</ul>

<div id="look-into-your-goal-optimization-settings"></div>
<h3>2. Look into your goal optimization settings</h3>
<p>Just because your conversion actions are firing properly doesn’t mean we’re finished with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/17/how-to-set-up-google-ads-enhanced-conversions">conversion action setup</a>. Depending on how you have your account set up, you can be either prioritizing or de-prioritizing different conversion events.</p>
<p>Here are three things to look into:</p>
<h4>Account default goals</h4>
<p>In the conversion manager, each action item is organized into a conversion category. That conversion category is then considered either an account default goal, meaning the conversion actions in that category will be counted in the conversions column, or not.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-account-default-goals.webp" alt="google ads account default goals" width="900" height="350" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92103" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-account-default-goals.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-account-default-goals-480x187.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If the conversion actions you’re trying to optimize for are not in an account default goal category, then you may need to make some adjustments. (There are other settings you can use to overcome this that we’ll cover soon.)</p>
<h4>Secondary vs. Primary goals</h4>
<p>Issues can arise when your conversion action is set to a Secondary goal rather than a Primary one. Primary goals are counted in the conversions column and used as optimization events for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-smart-bidding">Smart Bidding</a>, but Secondary actions are not used as optimization signals and are only counted in the All Conversions column&#8211;not Conversions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-secondary-goal.webp" alt="google ads secondary goal" width="786" height="498" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92105" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-secondary-goal.webp 786w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-secondary-goal-480x304.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 786px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Individual campaign setting goals</h4>
<p>At the campaign level, advertisers can opt to use account-level or campaign-level conversions. If your campaigns are set up to focus on conversions that are different from your account-level goals, that could also be causing issues in performance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-campaign-specific-conversion-goals.webp" alt="google ads campaign specific goal" width="900" height="317" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92106" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-campaign-specific-conversion-goals.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-campaign-specific-conversion-goals-480x169.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Action items</h4>
<ul>
<li>Confirm all conversion tracking is working properly.</li>
<li>Ensure all account default goals are set up to your liking.</li>
<li>Make sure all goals are assigned either Primary or Secondary status as needed.</li>
<li>Don’t forget to confirm that all campaign-level settings are in line with your goals.</li>
</ul>
<div id="adjust-your-bid-strategies"></div>
<h3>3. Adjust your bid strategies</h3>
<p>All of the Google Ads bid strategies are designed to do a very specific thing, so if you’re using the wrong one, it could be causing issues.</p>
<p>For the most part, all of these bid strategies are pretty self-explanatory. Maximize Conversions and Maximize Conversion Value work to get you good results, but sometimes they can be less efficient than those same bid strategies with additional controls like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/google-retiring-tcpa-troas">tCPA and tROAS</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-bidding-strategies-smart.jpg" alt="google ads bidding strategies" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91784" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-bidding-strategies-smart.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-bidding-strategies-smart-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But in addition to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/19/google-ads-automated-bidding">picking the right bid strategy</a>, it’s also important to make sure the bid strategy is set up for success. Smart Bidding requires enough success points and wiggle room to see results.</p>
<p>Here are some common problems we see with bid strategies that hinder performance:</p>
<h4>Unrealistic goals</h4>
<p>While we would all like to have extremely high ROAS or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead">super low CPLs</a>, that doesn’t mean they’re realistic and achievable in the long run. To help keep your goals realistic, start out with targets that are in line with your performance as a business.</p>
<p>If your entire site sees a 300% ROI, then 300% is likely a reasonable ROAS to set. When you leverage unrealistic goals, like 1,000% ROAS on a site with 300% ROI, you’ll stifle the bid strategy, and it will slowly stop serving ads since it likely can’t hit your target.</p>
<h4>Limited performance indicators</h4>
<p>A common issue I see with bid strategies centers around the volume of conversions being tracked. A general rule of thumb is one conversion per day.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-smart-bidding-suggestion-for-volume.webp" alt="google ads smart bidding volume suggestion" width="900" height="185" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92108" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-smart-bidding-suggestion-for-volume.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-smart-bidding-suggestion-for-volume-480x99.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If your account (not campaign, account) isn’t averaging at least 30 conversions in 30 days, then you might not have enough volume to optimize for that action.</p>
<p>Without those positive indicators coming in regularly, Google won’t get enough positive signals that a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization-marketing">click leads to a conversion</a> and will, again, slowly stop serving ads.</p>
<h4>Restricted budgets</h4>
<p>Even if you have realistic goals and enough conversion volume, keeping your budget too low can cause issues. Yes, we know Google always tells you to increase your budget, but this could be a performance killer.</p>
<p>If your target CPL is $100, but your daily budget is only $50, then you’re setting that campaign up to hit only one conversion every couple of days, falling below our regular rule of thumb.</p>
<h4>Not adjusting bid strategies with time</h4>
<p>Just because a bid strategy works for you for a time, that doesn’t mean it will work forever. You may need to change bid strategies or tweak the settings for that bid strategy over time. These require regular maintenance and adjustment right alongside all the other aspects within your account.</p>
<h4><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Action items</h4>
<ul>
<li>Review your bid strategies and ensure they’re the right ones to achieve your goals.</li>
<li>Be sure the goals for your campaigns are realistic.</li>
<li>Ensure your campaigns have enough budget for your bid strategy to operate.</li>
<li>Only use Smart Bidding strategies for conversion actions that have enough volume to support the machine learning cycles.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-audit">Regularly review your bid strategy settings and performance</a>, and don’t be afraid to test and iterate as needed to keep seeing strong results.</li>

<h3>4. Evaluate your targeting</h3>
<p>There are tons of different types of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-audience-targeting">targeting options in Google Ads</a>, and depending on what your goals are, many of them can cause issues with your performance.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look into a few targeting options to evaluate:</p>
<h4>Keyword match types</h4>
<p>Even though Google loves them, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/29/succeed-with-google-ads-broad-match">Broad match terms</a> can reach a very wide range of users. They have the widest reach of all the match types and can end up showing for quite a bit of traffic that isn’t relevant to your business. Broad match isn’t categorically bad, but without oversight, it can get out of hand very quickly.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/keyword-match-types-broad-match-png.webp" alt="keyword match types chart with arrow pointing to broad match" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90367" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/keyword-match-types-broad-match-png.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/keyword-match-types-broad-match-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Performance Max</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/01/is-performance-max-right-for-you">Performance Max</a> targets users across all networks within the Google Ads ecosystem, and each of those placements has their own set of best practices when it comes to targeting.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-placements.webp" alt="performance max placements" width="900" height="424" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92109" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-placements.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-placements-480x226.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Within the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/23/optimize-performance-max-campaigns">Performance Max campaign setup</a>, you have some controls over where you show, but they’re less specific than other campaign types. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/11/search-themes-for-performance-max-campaigns">Search themes</a> are just suggestions, not keywords. Audience signals are just a starting point for targeting, not exclusive targeting settings that Google stays within.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-search-themes.webp" alt="google performance max search themes" width="900" height="728" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92110" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-search-themes.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-search-themes-480x388.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Without full control over those targeting settings, you could see good results from Google’s machine learning, or you could struggle to hit goals as their system gets further from your intended targets.</p>
<h4>Optimized targeting</h4>
<p>In Display campaigns, there’s a setting that operates similarly to the expansion tactics in Performance Max&#8211;<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/22/google-ads-optimized-targeting">Optimized Targeting</a>. The difference is that you can opt out of this within Display campaigns.</p>

<p>Google will warn you that your campaigns might not perform as well, but if the expansion is the reason for the low performance, then you’re likely on the right path.</p>
<h4><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Action items</h4>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/search-term">Review search queries</a> to determine if your match types need to be tightened up.</li>

</ul>
<div id="determine-whether-or-not-you-have-segment-inefficiencies"></div>
<h3>5. Determine whether or not you have segment inefficiencies</h3>
<p>Expanding on the idea of targeting inefficiencies, some pockets of performance aren’t necessarily targeting but are still sneaky subsets of targeting that can drive your account to underperform.</p>
<h4>Network problems</h4>
<p>For Search campaigns, you can opt into the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-search-partner-insights">Search Partner Network</a>, which is an expanded network of listings on sites other than Google, but powered by Google Search. These placements can range from totally legit to completely sketchy.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-network-segmentation-report.webp" alt="google ads network segmentation report" width="900" height="298" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92112" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-network-segmentation-report.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-network-segmentation-report-480x159.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Whenever I have bad performance in a Search campaign, one of the first places I look is at the Search Partner performance. On the campaigns tab, just segment your data by Network, and you’ll see how it’s doing compared to regular Google Search.</p>
<p>If things look bad, you can opt out in your campaign settings.</p>
<p>While we’re here, this brings up another Network issue. By default, Google will opt Search campaigns into the Display Network. Please, please, please, don’t do this. If you want a cross-platform campaign, use Performance Max. Just uncheck this box every time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-display-network-opt-out.webp" alt="opt out of google display network" width="900" height="234" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92113" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-display-network-opt-out.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-display-network-opt-out-480x125.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Device performance</h4>
<p>Another segment you can check on is Device. If you’re alive in 2025, you’re probably more than aware of the differences between being on a mobile device vs. a computer vs. a tablet vs. a television. Those differences can cause performance variance between the device categories.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Google has kind of buried the Device report in the newly rearranged interface. You can find your accounts’ device performance in the Insights and Reports section, in the When and Where Ads Showed report, then choose the Devices tab. Depending on the other settings for your campaign, you can either opt out of a device category as a whole or you can adjust your bids to be more or less aggressive for a specific device category.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-device-performance.webp" alt="google ads device performance" width="900" height="390" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92114" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-device-performance.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-device-performance-480x208.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Additional segments to review</h4>
<p>Other categories that are good to check include your Ad Scheduling, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/17/google-ads-location-targeting">Location targeting</a>, and Audience segments. These can each be found in different sections of the interface and don’t typically have runaway poor performance, but each could be the key to finding smaller-scale inefficiencies that cause performance to be lower than desired.</p>
<h4><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Action items</h4>
<ul>
<li>Keep Search campaigns focused on Search and opt out of the Display network.</li>
<li>Understand how different device categories, locations, ad schedules, and audience segments are performing in your account and adjust as needed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Assess your copy and landing pages</h3>
<p>Google Ads campaigns definitely have lots of technical considerations that go into them to see good performance. The previous sections should highlight that pretty well.</p>
<p>But these campaigns also require you to have a personal marketing touch, which means the content and designs that feed your campaigns need to be compelling and user-friendly.</p>
<p>One problem area can be your ad copy. If your ads aren’t coherent and or action-oriented, you likely won’t see good results. There are tons of resources available that can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-copy">help you write great ads</a>. Just take advantage.</p>

<p>The same goes for your landing page. If the landing page is particularly slow, light on details, or is laid out confusingly, you’re likely not going to see the conversions you want from your campaigns. Again, there are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/adwords-landing-page">so</a> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/15/landing-page-best-practices">many</a> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/10/high-converting-landing-pages">resources</a> available for you to review to get ideas.</p>

<h3>7. Get on a good optimization schedule</h3>
<p>Just because you put in all that time and effort to launch a shiny new campaign strategy doesn’t mean it’s going to perform well forever. These are living, breathing things and need to be regularly maintained to see good results.</p>
<h4>Regular optimizations</h4>
<p>If you’re not regularly optimizing your account, you’re likely going to see issues. The good news is that the regular cadence of optimizations addresses many of the points in this post, but also, WordStream has a ton of posts that you can review to see all sorts of things you should be doing to your accounts at all times.</p>

</ul>
<h4>Automated optimizations</h4>
<p>Although you might think it’s in your best interest, one of the other problems I regularly see with accounts is when optimizations are left to the machines. Despite what they may say, Google doesn’t always know what your goals are with their automated optimizations. Some of them can be good, but without regular human oversight, they can “optimize” your account right into the ground.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-automated-optimizations.webp" alt="google ads automated optimizations option" width="900" height="245" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92116" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-automated-optimizations.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-automated-optimizations-480x131.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The Auto Apply Recommendations within Google Ads are easily turned off by visiting the Recommendations tab, then clicking the Auto-apply icon in the upper right of the screen, then turning off any or all of the automatic updates.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/turn-off-automated-optimizations.webp" alt="how to turn off automated optimizations in google ads" width="900" height="528" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92117" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/turn-off-automated-optimizations.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/turn-off-automated-optimizations-480x282.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There are also Automated <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-assets">Assets</a> that Google opts every account into that you can remove. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJKIe7c-9W8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">These have a few more hidden steps to deactivate</a>, but can be well worth it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a regular cadence of tasks to execute on your account and stick to it.</li>
<li>Don’t let Google make changes on your behalf that you’re not aware of. Opt out of the recommendations you don’t want and keep the ones you’re okay with.</li>
<li>Do the same for Automatically Applied Assets and make sure all customer-facing messaging is approved by you.</li>
</ul>
