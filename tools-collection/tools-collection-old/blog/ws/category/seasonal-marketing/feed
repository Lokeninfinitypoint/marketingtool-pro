<p>In fact, <a href="https://woocommerce.com/posts/black-friday-stats-and-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">73%</a> of businesses report that 20% of their annual revenue comes from Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Christmas, and New Year campaigns. 28% of businesses say the holidays account for 30 to 50% of their revenue, and 8% attribute the peak holiday season to over 50% of revenue.</p>
<h3>Black Friday deals can attract new customers to your business</h3>
<p>Your Black Friday marketing and advertising can help you tap into audiences you might not always reach year-round. For example, if you’re primarily an in-store or in-office operation looking to grow online, you can use Black Friday to gain traction for your mobile site as <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2024/12/04/cyber-week-ai-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70%</a> of Black Friday purchases are made on a mobile device.</p>
<h3>Consumers (and competitors) have Black Friday top-of-mind early on</h3>
<p>Having a Black Friday marketing strategy ready to go sets you up for success and gets you ahead of the holiday game. Over <a href="https://www.bcg.com/press/14november2024-consumers-black-friday-genai-shop-bargains" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60%</a> of holiday shoppers start their buyer’s journey in October or early November. Plus, <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/blog/email/bfcm-stats-2023/">57%</a> of consumers say they prefer to get details about holiday discounts in advance. In other words, knowing what Black Friday deals to expect beforehand is a priority for most shoppers.</p>
<p>Your customers aren’t the only ones with Black Friday top-of-mind early on, either. <a href="https://woocommerce.com/posts/black-friday-stats-and-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">36%</a> of businesses plan to start their holiday marketing about a month ahead of time, and 31% plan to do it up to three months ahead of time. If you want to stay ahead of your competition, then the earlier you start your Black Friday marketing the better.</p>
<h3>A smart Black Friday strategy connects you with customers when it matters most</h3>
<p>You can use Black Friday as an opportunity to place your business in front of customers when they’re ready to buy. For instance, purchases made directly in an app, rather than on a website or in-store, increased by <a href="https://appdevelopermagazine.com/in-app-purchases-surged-on-black-friday-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14%</a> during Black Friday last year. In this case, you might want to consider <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launching an Instagram Shop</a> for the holiday season.</p>
<p>Being present on the right channels is crucial to your holiday success. <a href="https://scontent-den2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/517243945_736430135604467_9059314080577066169_n.pdf?_nc_cat=107&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=e280be&amp;_nc_ohc=y5KHe56OXVgQ7kNvwEYIF_K&amp;_nc_oc=AdkrW_MYF3GQUaO2bD09OX2OJ48YQdRVsKYOFPVKaalqeKP0HA24-h88-pmBilLU6iM&amp;_nc_zt=14&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-den2-1.xx&amp;_nc_gid=2MB_GmGvPGgRgL0DwZA2mw&amp;oh=00_AfeKgBUwfiaICrqSz16ZY3WX8lf1ehfEjlOpNy2D3YMzqw&amp;oe=68F6E013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">63%</a> of shoppers say posts and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/scale-meta-ads-with-first-party-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ads across Meta-owned apps</a> are likely to influence their holiday purchases. <a href="https://scontent-den2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/517243945_736430135604467_9059314080577066169_n.pdf?_nc_cat=107&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=e280be&amp;_nc_ohc=y5KHe56OXVgQ7kNvwEYIF_K&amp;_nc_oc=AdkrW_MYF3GQUaO2bD09OX2OJ48YQdRVsKYOFPVKaalqeKP0HA24-h88-pmBilLU6iM&amp;_nc_zt=14&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-den2-1.xx&amp;_nc_gid=2MB_GmGvPGgRgL0DwZA2mw&amp;oh=00_AfeKgBUwfiaICrqSz16ZY3WX8lf1ehfEjlOpNy2D3YMzqw&amp;oe=68F6E013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Over half</a> of consumers look across Meta’s platforms for holiday research and evaluation. <a href="https://scontent-den2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/519201665_2256835098083571_8716989386968032493_n.pdf?_nc_cat=100&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=e280be&amp;_nc_ohc=mSrmCsHsa3AQ7kNvwFU1ojw&amp;_nc_oc=AdnfDSu8gM-qywdooVTvygA7syEzFnLdXyCFKgQoAPVz4xrQ7g0o7EE5K4G2oQdWWvQ&amp;_nc_zt=14&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-den2-1.xx&amp;_nc_gid=r1783OEhHb8TrwBJA8Am3A&amp;oh=00_Aff0OyMAHJBkWK9VhrOBAIieJBQ0_oZAZxt-vy-S37gDxA&amp;oe=68F6DF5A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nearly 60%</a> of weekly Facebook and Instagram users prefer to get holiday shopping recommendations from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/22/instagram-reels-ideas-for-businesses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reels</a>.</p>

<h2>When should you start Black Friday marketing?</h2>
<p>Whether this time of year is your business’s busy or slow season, there are ways to make Black Friday work for your business. But it can be hard to know for sure exactly <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/when-should-you-start-holiday-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when to start capitalizing on Black Friday</a> and the holiday season.</p>
<p>Remember, Black Friday isn’t just one day. It encompasses a series of days you can make moves on, known as “Black Fiveday.” Let’s quickly review each key date within this timeframe:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thanksgiving: </strong>The fourth Thursday in November, this holiday signifies the start of the holiday season for many. Most consumers will be eyeing holiday deals by this time.</li>
<li><strong>Black Friday:</strong> Immediately after Thanksgiving is Black Friday, the official holiday for seasonal shopping.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/small-business-saturday-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Small Business Saturday</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Next, after Black Friday, all small businesses should be taking advantage of this day that’s dedicated to encouraging consumers to shop small and work with local businesses.</li>
<li><strong>Sofa Sunday/Cyber Sunday: </strong>While the Sunday within this big week of deals doesn’t have a widely popular name or theme, many know it as “Sofa Sunday” or “Cyber Sunday” as shoppers make purchases virtually from the comfort of their homes.</li>
<li><strong>Cyber Monday:</strong> This is the final day of Black Fiveday, where customers will be searching for your business’s online offers.</li>
</ul>
<p>An honorable mention goes to Giving Tuesday, the day after Cyber Monday, which is all about giving back to your community, volunteering time with organizations that matter, and other philanthropic activities. You can still use Giving Tuesday to market your business or continue your holiday deals by showing customers how you care about causes that matter to your brand.</p>
<p>Basically, you’ve got a whole week’s worth of marketing and advertising you’ll have to prepare in order to squeeze all that you can out of Black Friday. You’ll likely need some time in advance to be sure you’re set up for success.</p>
<p>While there’s no right or wrong way to start your Black Friday marketing and advertising, here are a few things to keep in mind when you begin planning:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/08/26/2024-holiday-shopping-season-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Experts predict</a> shoppers will shop earlier this year to grab gifts before prices increase too much or inventory decreases. This year, <a href="https://www.insideradio.com/free/holiday-shopping-2024-plans-to-visit-big-box-retailers-up-20/article_39ec8590-6441-11ef-a741-6b0e5a1f0df3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">28%</a> of consumers starting holiday shopping before Labor Day.</li>
<li><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/2022-holiday-marketing-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">57%</a> of people plan to complete their holiday shopping before December.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, <strong>short answer for when to start your Black Friday marketing: As early as possible</strong>. However, don’t feel like you’re too late in the game if you haven’t started yet. When it comes to Black Friday marketing and advertising, <em>something</em> is always better than <em>nothing</em>.

<h2>Black Friday advertising strategies</h2>
<p>If you’re running ads this Black Friday, here are four holiday strategies to keep in mind.</p>
<h3>Use Google Ads Performance Max campaigns to secure more placements</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/performance-max" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Performance Max (PMax)</a> is an automated campaign type that’s a staple in most <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-account-structure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small business Google Ads accounts</a> year-round. PMax can allow your business to show ads across multiple placements from a single campaign, which can be ideal when you’re trying to maximize your Black Friday ad reach.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-placements.webp" alt="performance max placements" width="900" height="424" class="aligncenter wp-image-92109 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-placements.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-placements-480x226.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>When you use PMax, your Black Friday ads can be shown on any of the placements shown above. </em></p>
<h3>Enable Smart Bidding strategies to stretch your budget across Black Fiveday</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-smart-bidding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smart Bidding</a> is a form of automated bidding with Google Ads that dynamically shifts your bids based on factors like conversion value. During Black Friday, you’ll likely need your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-budget" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads budget</a> to juggle multiple goals, so having each campaign on a Smart Bidding strategy will help you stretch your dollars further.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-ads-bidding-strategies-conversion-focused.webp" alt="google ads smart conversion focused bidding strategies" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93379 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-ads-bidding-strategies-conversion-focused.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-ads-bidding-strategies-conversion-focused-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>Use Meta Advantage+ to reach holiday shoppers</h3>

<h2>Fall content ideas for September</h2>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/september-social-media-holidays/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September</a> is one of those amazing shoulder-season months. It starts full of warm weather and long days, and by the end, we get the first taste of what autumn has to offer. So we’re making September an honorary fall month, even if much of it is in summer.</p>
<h3>Back to school</h3>
<p>Most students are back in the classroom by the beginning of September. Your content can be less about preparing for the new semester and more about coping with the first few days of class.</p>
<p>For a fun blog post, try writing about some <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/back-to-school-marketing-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back-to-school</a> craft ideas.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-back-to-school.webp" alt="Fall content ideas -Back to school craft ideas post." width="329" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94478 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-back-to-school.webp 329w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-back-to-school-165x300.webp 165w" sizes="(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px" /></p>
<p>That’s just the start. Whether it’s pre-schoolers on their first day away from home or college kids moving into their new dorm, there’s a lot to cover. Use these ideas to help smooth the transition, and you’ll build a lot of goodwill with your customers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/03/video-marketing-ideas">Video</a> funny skits about getting kids up and going in the morning.</li>
<li>Share some time-management plans for parents in your newsletter.</li>
<li>Create a menu of ideas for people who pack their kids’ lunches.</li>
<li>Have a photographer give tips on how to take the perfect back-to-school photo.</li>
<li>Get inspired by back-to-school<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/14/tiktok-trend-discovery"> TikTok trends</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Labor Day (changes annually)</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/12/labor-day-messages-greetings">Labor Day</a> weekend is the unofficial end of summer. Some of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/13/content-creation">content creation</a> should lean into the “one last hurrah” theme. But don’t forget that Labor Day is also about celebrating workers&#8217; contributions. A little appreciation post can go a long way to building relationships with your followers.</p>
<p>We all want to maximize our Labor Day weekend. Help your followers do that by putting together a list of Labor Day weekend events around town. Go the extra mile by listing restaurants and shops offering special deals. Or make it a roundup of local hiking trails and parks to get outside before the days get shorter.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-labor-day.webp" alt="Fall content ideas - Labor Day activity ideas post." width="364" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94479 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-labor-day.webp 364w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-labor-day-182x300.webp 182w" sizes="(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px" /></p>
<p>Let’s take the hard work out of Labor Day content. Use a few of these ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share a funny video or meme of what it feels like to get out of work on Friday before Labor Day.</li>
<li>Show your appreciation to parents with a heartfelt parents&#8217; appreciation post.</li>
<li>Create a list of fun family-friendly activities in your area.</li>
<li>Send grilling season off with a bang and post your favorite grilling recipes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>International Talk Like a Pirate Day (September 19)</h3>
<p>Well, shiver me timbers, me hearties! It’s Talk Like a Pirate Day—possibly the most fun day on social media.</p>
<p>There are so many content ideas to consider here. If it’s too much, try a simple punny pirate post. Cats are optional.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-coffee.webp" alt="Fall content ideas - funny pirate post." width="369" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94480 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-coffee.webp 369w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-coffee-185x300.webp 185w" sizes="(max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px" /></p>
<p>There’s a bounty of content riches on Talk Like a Pirate Day. Let these ideas put a little wind in your marketing sales:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a pirate dress-up day at work and share the images, or ask followers to share their best pirate getups and gather some<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/user-generated-content"> user-generated content</a>.</li>
<li>Share pirate jokes (What do you call a pirate with three eyes? A piiirate).</li>
<li>Hold a pirate drawing contest; the best picture wins the booty.</li>
<li>Show people how to make the perfect pirate party platter.</li>

<h2>Fall content ideas for October</h2>
<p>October is a magical month filled with the first falling leaves and the promise of holidays to come. From Halloween to Back to the Future Day, there are many events to celebrate this month.</p>
<h3>Breast Cancer Awareness Month</h3>
<p>You don’t need to be directly involved in a particular field to share awareness for an important cause. For example, this information technology company launched a campaign to help spread the word for Breast Cancer Awareness Month.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-think-pink.webp" alt="Fall content ideas - Think Pink post." width="383" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94481 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-think-pink.webp 383w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-think-pink-192x300.webp 192w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /></p>
<p>The campaign was clever. The brand asked followers to share the message on their own social media accounts using the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags"> hashtag</a> #thinkpink. For every share, the brand donated to a foundation that supports women dealing with cancer. Thousands of women were reminded to book checkups, and the foundation received vital financial support.</p>
<h3>National Pitbull Awareness Day (October 25)</h3>
<p>Pitbulls have a reputation that sometimes leaves them last to be adopted and first to be excluded. But on National Pitbull Awareness Day, you can change the conversation and help these pooches have a better life.</p>
<p>This insurance provider did it by publishing a post on its blog.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-pit-day.webp" alt="Fall content ideas - National Pitbull Day post." width="385" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94482 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-pit-day.webp 385w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-pit-day-193x300.webp 193w" sizes="(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px" /></p>
<p>Try this for yourself and tell the story of shelter dogs, share anecdotes from pitbull owners, or just show off some local dogs ready for adoption.</p>
<h3>Halloween (October 31)</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/halloween-promotion-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Halloween</a> still stands out as the tentpole of many October<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-calendar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> content calendars</a>, even with so many other motifs to tackle this month. Not only is it uber-popular (Americans spent over<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1012/how-much-americans-spend-on-halloween.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $10 billion</a> on Halloween in 2022), but it’s also full of visually engaging<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-marketing"> content marketing</a> possibilities.</p>
<p>Let’s start off with an easy and fun one. A vintage shop curated a carousel of offbeat costume ideas.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-costume.webp" alt="Fall content ideas - Costume ideas post." width="398" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94483 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-costume.webp 398w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-costume-199x300.webp 199w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px" /></p>

<h3>National Donut Day (November 5)</h3>
<p>Donuts are so well-loved that they get two days each year: National Donut Day is celebrated on June 6 and November 5. That’s understandable since donuts bring so much joy to the world.</p>
<p>This parent-focused magazine posted all the donut deals for its readers in one eye-catching image.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-donut.webp" alt="Fall content ideas - Donut Day post." width="389" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94484 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-donut.webp 389w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-donut-195x300.webp 195w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></p>

<ul>

<li>Find the funkiest donut creations (like the bacon-wrapped maple donut) and share them in a social media post.</li>
<li>Write up a blog post or email describing wild and wonderful donut-themed events like the donut mile (contestants eat a dozen donuts while running a mile).</li>
<li>Host a donut-eating contest or free donut giveaway at your location. Film the event, post it to YouTube, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-promote-your-youtube-channel">promote it</a> with clips on social media.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Veterans Day (November 11)</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/veterans-day-posts/">Veterans Day</a> is when a grateful nation shows appreciation for the people who’ve served in the US military. Millions of men and women gave their time, talents, and often much more, so whatever content you post should focus on sincere appreciation for their sacrifice.</p>
<p>A simple, understated appreciation social media post with a<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/veterans-day-greetings"> Veterans Day greeting is</a> a great option. See how Hydro Flask goes one step further by offering useful information along with it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-hydroflask.webp" alt="Fall content ideas - Veteran's Day post." width="353" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94485 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-hydroflask.webp 353w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-hydroflask-177x300.webp 177w" sizes="(max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px" /></p>

</ul>
<h3>Thanksgiving (changes annually)</h3>

<h2>What to include in your Instagram captions for summer</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-algorithm">Instagram</a> is a visual platform first. It’s where you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-media-image-sizes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">share photos and videos with your audience</a>. You can even go live and provide real-time video updates. But alongside this visual content, there is space to caption your work.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/summer-instagram-caption.webp" alt="summer instagram captions - example fun summer instagram caption" width="793" height="480" class="aligncenter wp-image-91463 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/summer-instagram-caption.webp 793w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/summer-instagram-caption-480x291.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 793px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Cloudless skies, big smiles, and a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C9VJ2PruUNm/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caption</a> that leans into those summer holiday vibes.</em></p>
<p>As on all social platforms, take advantage of all the features — an empty or underutilized caption is a missed opportunity!</p>
<p>When crafting your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/summer-instagram-captions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">summer Instagram captions</a> (or, really, any Instagram captions), these tips can help you appeal to readers and even boost your reach and engagement.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f5d3.png" alt="🗓" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Download our free <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteMonthlySocialMediaCalendarTemplate.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Template_MonthlySocialMediaCalendar_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2025 social media calendar</a> for more caption, hashtag, and post ideas to last you all year long!</strong></p>
<h3>Summer Instagram caption do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts</h3>
<p>Let’s start with some “dos:”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DO </strong>use hashtags. Research has found that posts with <a href="https://mention.com/en/blog/instagram-hashtags-engagement/">11 or more</a> hashtags see the highest engagement on Instagram.</li>
<li><strong>DO</strong> watch your caption length. Captions with fewer than <a href="https://www.socialinsider.io/blog/instagram-caption-length/">30 words</a> typically perform best.</li>
<li><strong>DO</strong> try emojis. These little characters can add some visual interest to your caption. Including one or two lends your post levity and whimsy. Don’t overdo it, though. A caption that treats emojis as hieroglyphs can be hard to understand.</li>
<li><strong>DO</strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/05/best-call-to-action-phrases" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> include a CTA</a>, where appropriate. Not all of your Instagram content needs to drive audience action. But when a post aims to achieve a specific marketing goal (e.g., “We want to encourage more sign-ups for our upcoming event”), then include a CTA that asks your audience to take action (e.g., “Follow the link in bio to register!”).</li>

<p>Just as important are the “don’ts:”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DON’T</strong> be inauthentic. Stay true to your brand voice. Don’t adopt a cooler or younger persona just because you’re on a social platform.</li>
<li><strong>DON’T</strong> forget about your audience. Social media is a place for you to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/27/brand-messaging" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> build your brand</a>, increase awareness, and establish yourself as a trustworthy presence in your industry. You can only do those things if you keep your audience — their needs and pain points — in mind as you draft your content.</li>
<li><strong>DON’T</strong> skew to sales-focused messaging. Because social media is a “<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/sales-funnel-template/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top of the funnel</a>” channel, it’s not a place for the hard sell. If you have a specific goal in mind (e.g, promoting an upcoming sale), then you can include more overt sales language. But mostly, Instagram is a place to build awareness and interest.</li>

<h2>Fact-based Memorial Day captions</h2>
<p>We all know what Memorial Day is, but few of us know the real details behind the holiday. Incorporate some of these <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/holidays/memorial-day-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Memorial Day facts</a> into your captions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Memorial Day was originally known as Decoration Day, as men and women would decorate the graves of fallen soldiers with flowers.</li>
<li>It originated in the years after the Civil War (1865), but it wasn&#8217;t a federal holiday until 1971.</li>
<li>Every Memorial Day at 3:00 p.m. local time, a national moment of remembrance takes place.</li>
<li>In 1966, the federal government declared Waterloo, New York, the official birthplace of Memorial Day.</li>
<li>According to legend, &#8220;founder&#8221; General John A. Logan chose May 30 because it was one of the few days that didn’t fall on the anniversary of a Civil War battle. Some, though some historians believe the date was selected to ensure that flowers across the country would be in full bloom.</li>
<li>More than 36 million people will travel at least 50 miles from home to celebrate Memorial Day with friends and family <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f62e.png" alt="😮" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> What are you doing to celebrate Memorial Day?

<h2>Diversity, equity, and inclusion marketing ideas in May</h2>
<p>We all hear about diversity, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/05/accessibility-inclusivity-advertising">accessibility, and inclusion in marketing</a> but what does that look like? Let&#8217;s take a look.</p>
<h3>National Honor Our LGBT Elders Day</h3>
<p>This holiday, celebrated every May 16, was created by Chase Brexton Health Care, an LGBT health resource center. It is focused on honoring protestors, supporters, doctors, politicians, influencers, and others who blazed the trail with the LGBT movement.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/may-marketing-ideas-lgbt-elders-day-graphic-header.jpeg" alt="may marketing ideas - national honor our lgbt elders day" width="720" height="360" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60334" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/may-marketing-ideas-lgbt-elders-day-graphic-header.jpeg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/may-marketing-ideas-lgbt-elders-day-graphic-header-480x240.jpeg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.iona.org/honor-our-lgbt-elders-day-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Here are some ways to honor them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do some research and identify LGBT trailblazers in your geographic or industrial niche and write a blog post or social media fun fact post about them.</li>
<li>Ask your audience to share older LGBT mentors and thought leaders in their lives.</li>
<li>Raise awareness about the importance of taking care of LGBT elders who may still lack the care and support they need.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Jewish, Haitian, Asian &amp; Pacific Island Heritage Month</h3>
<p>In May, we celebrate individuals of Jewish, Haitian, Asian, or Pacific Island descent. Here are some ways to do just that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider learning about each of these groups and sharing your findings in a blog post or on social media.</li>
<li>Interview a coworker, client, or friend who identifies with one of these groups on a topic relevant to your audience.</li>
<li>Put a request out there to your network for individuals within those groups to write a guest post or share their experience about something with a dedicated hashtag.</li>
</ul>
<h3>National Foster Care Month</h3>
<p>Contrary to what we often see in sitcoms or novels, most people grow up with varying family dynamics. <a href="https://www.childwelfare.gov/fostercaremonth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Foster Care Month</a> is meant to <span>recognize &#8220;the important role that members from all parts of child welfare play in supporting children, youth, and families.&#8221;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Update your marketing copy to be more inclusive. For example, instead of promoting a sale for moms and dads, you may want to extend your offer to caretakers, grandparents, or guardians as well.</li>
<li>Post foster care facts on social media to inspire your audience to take action. For example, did you know that foster youth are <a href="https://www.afs4kids.org/blog/29-surprising-foster-care-facts/#:~:text=6%20percent%20of%20all%20children,more%20likely%20to%20have%20Anxiety." target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven times</a> more likely to have depression, and five times more likely to have anxiety? There are tons of interesting (and eye-opening) statistics like this on the current state of the foster care system that your followers could find both interesting and action-worthy. This will show that your business truly cares for the cause.</li>
<li>Connect with local foster care organizations to find ways you and your audience could donate or volunteer. For example, many foster care parents and case workers share Amazon wish lists and more on social media to allow people to support foster children or former foster youth.</li>
</ul>

<h3>National Silence the Shame Day</h3>
<p>This day is observed every May 5 and is dedicated to erasing the shame and stigma around mental health challenges and disorders. Consider these ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share eye-opening stats about mental illness in the United States (or the world).</li>
<li>Share a few resources for those who are struggling with anxiety, depression, and other symptoms.</li>
<li>Participate in #silencetheshame textathons and fundraisers like the one below.</li>
</ul>

<h3>National Barrier Awareness Day</h3>
<p>Every May 7, National Barrier Awareness Day encourages us to advocate for and educate others about breaking down barriers—visible and invisible—that prevent individuals with disabilities from living independent, fulfilled lives.</p>
<h2><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/may-marketing-ideas-national-barrier-awareness-day.png" alt="may marketing ideas - national barrier awareness day" width="600" height="440" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60336" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/may-marketing-ideas-national-barrier-awareness-day.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/may-marketing-ideas-national-barrier-awareness-day-480x352.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></h2>
<p>To participate in this day:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the #nationalbarrierawarenessday hashtag to post information, resources, and stats.</li>
<li>Do an Instagram Story takeover by someone with a disability so they can share a day in the life.</li>
<li>Ask your audience about their experiences with barriers and how they overcame them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional observances in May that help promote diversity, equity, and inclusion include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>National Interpreter Appreciation Day – first Wednesday in May</li>
<li>Join Hands Day – first Saturday in May</li>

<p>This fitness center took their spin class outdoors to shake things up a bit. This is a great idea, especially during the pandemic. If lugging out equipment isn’t an option, go for a yoga class, dance class, or boot camp. This is also a great way to show potential customers how awesome your classes are.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a triumph or underdog theme. This holiday comes from Mexico’s unlikely victory over the French in the Battle of Puebla. Give your customers the victory over high prices, long lines, slow service, and more with particular deals.</li>
<li>Use the number five in your <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/13/sales-promotion-examples">promotions</a>, such as: get the fifth one free, $5 specials, 5% off, 5 for 5, etc.</li>
<li>Throw a party or cooking class revolving around Mexican food and culture.</li>
<li>Consider offering your followers information about where to enjoy Cinco de Mayo. Remember, not everything you post should be in an effort to make a sale. Providing useful information gives your followers another reason to keep watching you on <a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/19/social-media-for-small-business">social media</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Teacher Appreciation Day</h3>
<p>May 7 is Teacher Appreciation Day—a perfect time for preschools to market themselves to new parents in anticipation of the new school year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Throw a party for teachers or have students write thank you letters to show off on your blog, in <a href="/blog/ws/2021/01/05/creative-newsletter-names">email newsletters</a> to parents, or on social media.</li>
<li>Update your <a href="/blog/ws/2017/11/15/website-copy">website content</a> with new teacher bios and pictures.</li>
<li>Did anyone receive a new degree or have a teacher accomplishment to share? This is the perfect time to showcase them on an “<a href="/blog/ws/2016/05/27/guide-to-about-us-pages">About Us</a>” page on your website. Doing so not only highlights your teaching staff, but it also can <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-improve-seo-for-your-local-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improve your SEO</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>ALS</h3>
<p>Not only is it important to support worthy causes, but statistically, people are more apt to do business with companies that share their values. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CdV9vnCOVGT/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This restaurant</a> got a repost from an ALS-focused organization to help drive customers to their fundraiser:</p>

<h2>More May marketing themes and ideas</h2>
<p>Want marketing ideas beyond holidays? We&#8217;ve got you covered there too!</p>
<h3>Warm weather/spring cleaning</h3>
<p>Take advantage of the warmer weather and provide information and helpful tips to your customers in accordance with your business.</p>
<ul>
<li>Contractors, landscaping companies, and painters should boost their May marketing efforts to <a href="/blog/ws/2014/01/16/get-more-clients">get new clients</a> for the spring and summer months. Try sending out postcards encouraging homeowners to get their homes and gardens in top shape for summer.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/may-marketing-ideas-landscaping-postcard-1.png" alt="may marketing ideas—landscaping postcard &quot;enjoy your yard this summer&quot;" width="800" height="566" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.postcardmania.com/designs/landscape-postcards/">Image source</a></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Now’s the time to run that gutter cleaning sale or post pictures on Facebook of your most recent outdoor paint job. Build your content authority with SEO-optimized blog posts about <a href="/blog/ws/2014/04/09/adwords-tips-for-seasonal-businesses">seasonal</a> maintenance.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/may-marketing-ideas-spring-cleanup-1.png" alt="may marketing ideas—blog post about spring cleaning" width="700" height="633" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>Speaking of <a href="/blog/ws/2016/03/22/ppc-account-audit-tips">spring cleaning</a>, why not do a little of your own by going through your website, ad campaigns, social media profiles, and listings to make sure information is up to date, photos are relevant to the season, and links are working properly? You may want to refresh some of the evergreen <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/may-content-ideas">May content</a> from last year that performed well around this time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gather up your top reviews from last year and share them on social media. These make for enjoyable Tweets with no pressure to click a link or read more. You might also share success stories with before-and-after photos to get clients excited about the warm weather.</li>
<li>What better time to get the chatter going about your business when people are getting excited about the warm weather? <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/26/word-of-mouth-marketing">Word-of-mouth marketing</a> is important for small businesses. Offer existing clients a discount or incentive for each new client they refer who becomes a paying customer.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/may-marketing-ideas-referral-1.png" alt="may marketing ideas—referral program example" width="800" height="561" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>April showers bring May flowers. If you own a flower shop, May marketing is your time to shine! (If you don’t, there are still opportunities!).</p>
<ul>
<li>Host that flower-arranging workshop you’ve been thinking about.</li>
<li>Start a Pinterest board to see if Pinterest is right for your business, or grow your <a href="/blog/ws/2012/05/01/pinterest-marketing-guide">Pinterest</a> following with your creations linked to your online store or blog.</li>
<li>You don’t have to be a florist to use flowers in your marketing. Spruce up your office, <a href="/blog/ws/2015/01/14/restaurant-marketing">restaurant</a>, or storefront with flowers. Nothing says “spring” like fresh-cut flowers that add a pop of color to your business space.</li>
<li>Buy flowers from a local florist and introduce yourself. Supporting other small business owners is the first step to getting more word-of-mouth <a href="/blog/ws/2019/05/06/referral-marketing">referrals</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Weddings</h3>
<p>May is the start of wedding season and a perfect time to market your business to new people who are in town. Unless, of course, you’re hosting a virtual wedding this year due to the pandemic. Here are some wedding-based marketing ideas for both live and virtual weddings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Caterers, event planners, DJs, photographers, bakeries, and other wedding-friendly services: Use social media to engage customers as much as possible. Whether you’re hosting the bachelorette party at your restaurant, baking the wedding cupcakes at your bakery, or photographing the event, be sure to take pictures and <a href="/blog/ws/2018/07/02/facebook-marketing-for-small-business">share them on Facebook</a> and other social media platforms. You may also want to ask and see if you can use the special custom hashtag for the event. This is a great way to put a name to the features of the wedding that stick out to guests (who can become or refer you to new customers) and their social media audiences.</li>
<li>Landscapers can capitalize on wedding venue owners looking to perfect their property.</li>
<li>Or perhaps you want to run a virtual wedding planning campaign, through organic content or <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/local-advertising-ideas-for-small-businesses/">paid ads</a>.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/may-marketing-ideas-virtual-wedding-1.png" alt="may marketing ideas—wedding season ads and blog posts in the SERP" width="800" height="636" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<ul>
<li>Fitness and nutrition businesses can provide workouts, recipes, <a href="/blog/ws/2014/07/17/headline-writing">blog posts</a>, and tips on getting to your healthiest and best version of yourself in time for these heavily photographed events.</li>
</ul>
<h3>More May marketing magic</h3>
<p>Show how busy your business has been by simply providing some updates for the month of May. You could frame it as &#8220;May mayhem&#8221; to showcase to your audience how your business is rapidly progressing. You might:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://localiq.com/free-business-listings-grader/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Check your business listings</a> for anything that needs updating, like adding more images, new seasonal hours, etc.</li>
<li>Share a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-testimonial-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer testimonial video</a> of a standout product or service offering you completed in May.</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Final tips for your May marketing</h2>
<p>Whatever you decide to do to promote your business in May, be sure to recap your events, promotions, and festivities in your next email newsletter or blog post so that those who missed out will want to join in the fun next year. Also, be sure to send <a href="/blog/ws/2021/03/18/how-to-follow-up-with-sales-leads">follow-up emails to any new leads</a> for your business. And during your campaigns, post real-time photos and user-generated content to encourage more participation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring is a time of growth. And that can go for your business, too!</p>
<p>The trick is to catch people with the right messaging as they’re thinking about all things spring. And that’s what we’re here to help you with.</p>
<p>This big list of spring content ideas will help you connect with all your followers and customers, regardless of their springtime proclivities. Travel, spring cleaning, holidays…we’ve got something for all of it.</p>
<h3>Contents</h3>

<h2>Spring-themed content ideas</h2>
<p>Let’s get right to the good stuff. These spring content ideas tap into primordial drives we all feel as the weather warms, like refreshing our spaces and reinvigorating ourselves.</p>
<h3>Spring cleaning</h3>
<p>You know that feeling when you crack open your windows and let that first burst of spring air through your house? That’s what your followers are feeling right about now. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/27/how-to-increase-instagram-engagement">Engage them</a> with some cleaning tips to make the most of this transition time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/spring-content-ideas-wordstream-cleaning-576x1024.webp" alt="Spring content ideas - spring cleaning tips on Instagram." width="576" height="1024" class="aligncenter wp-image-90221 size-large" /></p>
<p>Maybe it’s a list of spring cleaning things to do (like getting the gunk out of the dishwasher filter). Or it could be a showcase of new cleaning products and implements (new mop, anyone?).</p>
<p>That’s just a start. Here’s a handful of other spring-cleaning content ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tweak your list and send a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/27/blog-post-ideas">blog post</a> full of house maintenance tasks to tackle in the spring (cleaning gutters, reattaching hoses, etc.).</li>
<li>Create similar lists for yards and vehicles (maybe even post a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/03/video-marketing-ideas">YouTube video</a> explaining how to deep clean your vehicle)</li>
<li>Interview a cleaning or yard-care <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/digital-marketing/influencer-marketing-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">influencer</a> on any of the topics we’ve mentioned.</li>
<li>Share the mental and physical benefits of having a clean space.</li>
<li>Create a springtime maintenance calendar with to-dos specific to each month of the season.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4aa.png" alt="💪" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Get a year’s worth of marketing ideas! </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Download </span><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/marketing-calendar?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2025MarketingCalendar_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Only Marketing Calendar You Need</span></a></p>
<h3>Spring health and fitness</h3>
<p>New Year’s resolutions may be a faded memory by the time spring rolls around. But the fresh air often re-ignites the need to be active. That’s what these spring content ideas will address.</p>
<p>This is a pretty organic topic for healthcare professionals to cover. Dedicating your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/april-newsletter-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monthly newsletter</a> to offering injury-avoidance tips is a great place to start.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/spring-content-ideas-wordstream-fitness-591x1024.webp" alt="Spring content ideas - Fitness-themed blog post." width="591" height="1024" class="aligncenter wp-image-90222 size-large" /></p>
<p>But you don’t have to be a physical therapist to help your fans live their healthiest life. Here are a few options any brand can take part in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get your staff to share their favorite healthy spring recipes and send them to your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/18/loyalty-marketing">loyalty program</a> members.</li>
<li>Talk to your local farmer’s market and send out a list (or an infographic) of when local produce will be ready and ripe.</li>
<li>If your typical customer has kids, they’re probably looking for places to take them this spring. Help them find the newest and best kid-friendly adventures.</li>
<li>Same idea as above, but do it for doggos (think dog parks, dog-friendly patios, etc.).</li>
<li>One downside of spring is allergies, so your audience would appreciate some ideas that help them survive allergy season.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Spring travel</h3>
<p>Cabin fever tends to set in around mid-January, so any content about travel and adventure will be well-received.</p>
<p>These don’t need to be globe-trotting, multi-national excursions. A simple post or email highlighting local greenways would work.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/spring-content-ideas-wordstream-travel-502x1024.webp" alt="Spring content ideas - blog post of local travel ideas." width="502" height="1024" class="aligncenter wp-image-90223 size-large" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/spring-content-ideas-wordstream-travel-502x1024.webp 502w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/spring-content-ideas-wordstream-travel-480x978.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 502px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There are so many directions you can take your spring travel-themed content. Try a few of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help people plan their summer travel. Share helpful websites, talk about new airline routes, or let a family travel expert take over your social media feeds.</li>
<li>Create a list of awesome “staycation” local adventures and help your fans be tourists in their own town.</li>
<li>Curate some <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/spring-promotion-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spring promotions</a> on airfare, camping sites, theme parks, or other adventures.</li>
<li>How about a list of packing tips or a review of new travel gadgets to get people ready for their next trip?</li>
<li>Make a top five list of places for your target audience (like top five budget-friendly trips this spring)</li>
<li>Spring break is a big deal for many families. Jump on the trend with spring break ideas for either at-home or travel destinations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>More spring content ideas</h3>
<p>Like the blooms of the season, spring content options pop up everywhere you look. Take advantage of these budding ideas to liven up your messages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply send a sincere <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/spring-greetings">spring greeting</a> in an email or post one on social media.</li>
<li>Create a spring playlist on Spotify or another music service.</li>
<li>Lighten the mood with some punderful <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/spring-puns">spring-themed puns</a>.</li>
<li>Explore this year’s spring fashion on an Instagram Live event.</li>
<li>Help people save money and “spring clean” their budgets.</li>
<li>Post the perfect picnic with menu, location, and activity ideas.</li>
<li>Give parents a break with rainy-day ideas for their kiddos.</li>
<li>Explain the meanings attached to different spring flowers.</li>
<li>Make a map showing local spring festivals and events.</li>
<li>Use a fun hashtag like #springfling, #waityourturnsummer, or #springadventures.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Spring content ideas for April</h2>
<p>April and its showers bring a lot more than May flowers. Easter (this year, at least) and April Fools’ Day, for starters. But dozens of other <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/april-social-media-holidays/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April holidays</a> and special observances are also worthy of your spring content calendar.</p>
<h3>April Fools&#8217; Day (April 1)</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/april-fools-social-media-posts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April Fools’ Day</a> is a pretty big event on social media. It’s time to bring your best prank or funny video. Or, like in this example, post a bunch of prank ideas people can try at home or in the office. Of course, keep them harmless and friendly so no one gets hurt.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/spring-content-ideas-wordstream-april-fools.webp" alt="Spring content ideas - social media post of April Fools' Day pranks." width="1078" height="1815" class="aligncenter wp-image-90224 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/spring-content-ideas-wordstream-april-fools.webp 1078w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/spring-content-ideas-wordstream-april-fools-980x1650.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/spring-content-ideas-wordstream-april-fools-480x808.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1078px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>How else can you partake in the fun? Try these options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prank your audience by announcing a new and ridiculous product on social media or share an upcoming “sale” that would never actually take place in a rational world.</li>
<li>Get followers to share their most successful April Fools’ Day pranks.</li>
<li>Record videos of your employees playing funny little pranks at work.</li>
<li>Write a pranking <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/april-email-subject-lines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email subject line</a> that fools people for a minute.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dog Appreciation Month</h3>
<p>Do we really need another reason to celebrate our four-legged friends? That’s a rhetorical question. Of course, we do. And Dog Appreciation Month is the perfect reason to do it in April.</p>
<p>Besides being fun, celebrating pets is absolute social media gold. Plus, it’s easy for anyone with a dog and a camera to play along. Here’s how one skating rink clawed in attention for Dog Appreciation Month.</p>
