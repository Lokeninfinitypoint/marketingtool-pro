										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We know video will continue to be a major focus for marketers in 2025. At this point, it’s an essential medium across marketing goals and channels—social media strategy, product marketing, brand storytelling, customer education, content strategy, podcasting, ad placements, influencer marketing, and so much more.</p>
<p>That’s made video a mainstay in many marketing plans for small businesses, solopreneurs, and big corporations. But with last year’s proliferation of AI-enabled tools creating more possibilities and more content than ever before, we wanted to know how video marketing will change in 2025.</p>
<p>To figure that out, we turned to marketers, video producers, social media experts, and content creator professionals for their predictions on the video marketing trends that will dominate in 2025. We heard about AI growth, local content creation, repurposing strategies, and several other trends you&#8217;ll want to follow.</p>

<h2>8 video marketing trends for 2025</h2>
<p>Keep these <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/video-marketing-for-small-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video marketing</a> trends on replay to stay ahead this year.</p>
<div id="more-ai-tools"></div>
<h3>1. Even more AI tools will hit the scene</h3>
<p>If you were on the internet at all last year, you know that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-copywriting-tools">AI tools</a> were a big deal. This is definitely true for video.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-graph.webp" alt="Video marketing trends - Graph from Google Trends." width="885" height="543" class="aligncenter wp-image-88989 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-graph.webp 885w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-graph-480x295.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 885px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Searches for AI video examples, tools, and more grew steadily over the year, and they’ll continue to rise in 2025.</em></p>
<p>Previously, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/03/video-marketing-ideas">video content</a> was often expensive and time-consuming to create, edit, and distribute. Plus, it required proficiency with cameras and editing software. But with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/25/ai-content-generators">AI platforms designed for video production</a>, making videos became way easier. Platforms like <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-use-canva/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canva</a> and Vimeo added AI components to make video editing easier. Tools like Lumen5, Descript, and Synthesia leverage AI to generate scripts, splice clips, and even create digital avatars for marketing videos.</p>
<p>With these capabilities, it’s no wonder that experts expect AI to dominate video marketing trends in 2025. Simon Høiberg, the SaaS founder and YouTube personality, recently shared his confidence in AI videos on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/simonhoiberg_im-bullish-on-ai-videos-it-seems-like-ugcPost-7280567890292928513-dDuN/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-AI-video-linkedin-post.webp" alt="Video marketing trends - LinkedIn post." width="521" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88990 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-AI-video-linkedin-post.webp 521w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-AI-video-linkedin-post-480x553.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 521px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The video he referenced? It’s of a cat cooking.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-cat.webp" alt="Video marketing trends - still from an AI video of a cat cooking." width="408" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88991 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-cat.webp 408w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-cat-204x300.webp 204w" sizes="(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px" /></p>
<p>This won’t be confused with actual video footage, but it will capture attention and stop some scrolling. As AI video tools become even better and even more accessible this year, the possibilities are limitless (see even more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-marketing-trends-2025">AI trends in marketing</a>).</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>AI tools can help you maintain a consistent marketing presence.</strong> Learn more in the guide to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/always-on-marketing?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_alwaysonmarketing_Download&amp;itm_source=localiq&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links">Always-On Marketing: The Not-So-Secret Strategy for Unstoppable Growth</a>.</p>
<div id="video-editors-remain-vital"></div>
<h3>2. Skilled traditional video editors will remain vital</h3>
<p>AI tools will make<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/08/facebook-video-ads"> video marketing</a> more accessible to small businesses, small teams, and even small budgets. But that doesn’t mean that our beloved video creators are going anywhere. Right now, on LinkedIn, for instance, there are 479 video marketing job openings in Cambridge, MA, with 45 posted just this week.</p>
<p>We can expect the same for freelance video marketing support, too, for now. In a recent survey by WyzOwl,<a href="https://www.wyzowl.com/video-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 93%</a> of marketers reported their plans to spend about the same or even more on video marketing in 2025.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-pie-chart.webp" alt="Video marketing trends - Pir chart of video marketing spend." width="709" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88992 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-pie-chart.webp 709w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-pie-chart-480x406.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 709px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>According to WyzOwl, </em><a href="https://www.wyzowl.com/video-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>48%</em></a><em> of marketers intend to spend more on video in 2025.</em></p>
<p>That’s because there are some video marketing areas AI can’t help with. One in particular that will grow in 2025 is<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/04/25/event-marketing"> live events</a> and experiences.<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/74-fortune-1000-marketers-increase-190000092.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 74%</a> of Fortune 1000 marketers report that they’ll be increasing spending on experiential marketing in 2025.</p>
<p>Video marketers will be essential in capturing the experience—whether it’s recording talks, getting on-the-fly testimonials from attendees, or taking plenty of b-roll for highlight and overview reels—for posterity.</p>
<div id="social-media-will-prioritize-video"></div>
<h3>3. Social media will prioritize video even more</h3>
<p>It’s possible not every social media platform will be<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/03/video-marketing-ideas"> video first</a>—it’s still unclear whether <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/bluesky-for-marketing">Bluesky</a> favors video, for instance. But overall, social media platforms favor video content now and will even more as we progress throughout this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/23/tiktok-marketing">TikTok</a> and<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/how-to-get-more-views-on-youtube"> YouTube</a> are strictly video, with consistently growing traffic. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-trends-2025">Facebook</a>, Instagram, Snapchat, and even<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/11/08/linkedin-pulse"> LinkedIn algorithms</a> prioritize engaging video content, particularly with<a href="https://www.fanpagekarma.com/insights/photos-with-faces-more-likes-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> human faces</a>. This is even more important to consider for brand social accounts, which are already often suppressed by algorithms. When you’re investing time into content creation for social, you want it to move your business forward.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-linkedin.webp" alt="Video marketing trends - LinkedIn videos." width="515" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88993 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-linkedin.webp 515w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-linkedin-480x559.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 515px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>LinkedIn continues to prioritize video content.</em></p>
<p>Experts expect to see video-first continue across social media channels in 2025.  A study by Sandvine found that video usage grew<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sandvines-2023-global-internet-phenomena-report-shows-24-jump-in-video-traffic-with-netflix-volume-overtaking-youtube-301723445.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 24%</a> in 2022, accounting for 65% of all internet traffic. And these significant increases were before AI enabled even more video creation.</p>
<p>This video-first trend might seem overwhelming to keep up with, but don’t worry yet. This leads us to our next video marketing trend for 2025.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2b50.png" alt="⭐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free resource!</strong> <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDL25LeadGenIdeas.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_LeadGenIdeas_Download">The Definitive Guide to Lead Generation: 25 Ideas (+Tips &amp; Examples)</a></p>
<div id="repurposing-content-will-be-a-must"></div>
<h3>4. Repurposing content across social platforms will be a must</h3>
<p>With every social media feed prioritizing video content, there will inevitably be some flattening of platform personality. That means more opportunities for light repackaging of the same video assets will exist.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-repurposing.webp" alt="Video marketing trends - screenshot of a video from Atlassian." width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88994 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-repurposing.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-repurposing-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>In 2025, savvy brands will turn one video into dozens of marketing assets.</em></p>
<p>Tami Oladipo, content writer at<a href="https://buffer.com/"> Buffer</a>, predicts that we’ll see an increase in sharing and<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/03/repurposing-content"> repurposing</a> video content across social platforms this year.</p>
<p>“As AI tools become more sophisticated and platforms become mirrors of each other, I think we&#8217;ll see creators who are able to stretch themselves more because they are working more efficiently. One long video into multiple pieces of content will likely become the norm, and creators will choose to crosspost to multiple platforms, even in seemingly unexpected places.”</p>
<p>Look to creators and brands you trust for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-repurposing">great content repurposing examples</a>. The more creative you get, the more benefit you can pull from every asset you create.</p>
<div id="expect-more-casual-local-content"></div>
<h3>5. Expect more casual local content</h3>
<p>The scale enabled by AI and incentivized by <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/tiktok-algorithm">social media algorithms</a> across the board prioritizing video will also lead video marketers and content creators to work harder to stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tylersteinhardt?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAA2BSjMBbvX1tiK2zLP_PhEa9cha8Rf5QI0&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3Bv0UOghVjSi%2B2Ob3eb4Ae2g%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyler Steinhardt</a> is the Chief Strategy Officer of<a href="https://vocal.media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Vocal Media</a>, a platform dedicated to discovering, supporting, and rewarding creators. He expects to see these videos working against AI, with creators and brands getting closer to home.</p>
<p>“In 2025, we&#8217;ll see more locally-produced creator content.” Local content defined by community or physical environments will be harder to replicate with AI tools, and it will appeal to people sharing a common connection, as well as the algorithms favoring human faces and recognizable places.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-local.webp" alt="Video marketing trends - screenshot of a video from Petrella's. " width="870" height="513" class="aligncenter wp-image-88995 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-local.webp 870w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-local-480x283.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 870px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The quick brand clip from Italian sandwich shop </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/petrellas_ford_city/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Patrella’s</em></a><em> is an example of this local, casual trend. Simple overhead shots of preparing food beat over-produced, professional videos for authenticity.</em></p>
<p>According to Tyler, “Users will see more restaurant reviews, sports updates, and vlog updates from our neighbors, as every algorithm&#8217;s for you page tries to cut through the deluge of AI-content slop that will be flooding our feeds.”</p>
<div id="creator-communities-will-fragment"></div>
<h3>6. Creator communities will fragment</h3>
<p>Another shift for video creators in 2025 will be less about content and volume and more about community and personal branding.</p>
<p>“Before the podcast industry&#8217;s recent sluggish turn, everything was very communal,” explained Chris O’Keefe, the editor of the weekly Substack <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/theabtest/p/issue-1-force-philosophy-video-volatility?r=3hc65x&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The A/B List: Art &amp; Business in Audio</a> and the founder of <a href="https://www.ok-creative.com/">OK Creative: The Language Agency</a>, which provides writing and narrative services to businesses.</p>
<p>“Content creators, podcasters, journalists, marketers, video, audio—people were just excited to be making stuff and weren&#8217;t as concerned with which titles they had or scenes they were associated with,” he said. “Now, with middle-class creator money drying up and many producers feeling hoodwinked by big tech companies, I&#8217;m already seeing more clear lines being drawn with how people define themselves. YouTube Creators over here, Audio Podcasters over there. That sort of thing.”</p>
<p>Why does this fragmentation matter for marketers? In addition to impacting <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-promote-your-youtube-channel">brand YouTube channels</a>, podcasts, and more, shifts in creator communities mean changes to partner and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/26/influencer-marketing">influencer marketing</a>, which brings us to the next video marketing trend for 2025.</p>
<div id="video-creators-expand-monetization"></div>
<h3>7. Video creators will expand monetization beyond brand partnerships</h3>
<p>In 2024, creators continued the existing trend of placing more content behind a subscription and/or paywall to generate direct revenue from fans. That’s in addition to, or instead of, relying on brand sponsorships</p>
<p>Last year, more than <a href="https://news.patreon.com/articles/celebrating-another-year-of-connecting-creators-and-their-real-fans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 million fans paid</a> for access to content from more than 300,000 creators on Patreon each month. Substack hit <a href="https://backlinko.com/substack-users#substack-paid-subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">49 million subscribers</a> on the platform in January 2024, and while the content is primarily copy and images, the platform has supported video since early <a href="https://on.substack.com/p/video-on-substack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022</a>. In 2023, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/03/28/substack-community-fundraising-round" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axios</a> reported that there were more than 17,000 Substack newsletter writers, with the top 10 creators earning $25 million annually, a jump from $7 million in 2020.</p>
<p>Instagram even offered accounts with more than 10,000 followers the option to host a one-to-many chat in a free, private <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-broadcast-channels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram broadcast channel</a> beginning in 2023, a tool that grew in 2024. By creating more exclusive content, influencers can cultivate a greater sense of community—and, with paywalls, generate more revenue directly from their fans and followers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-monitization.webp" alt="Video marketing trends - Instagram post from coffee content creatior." width="739" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88996 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-monitization.webp 739w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-monitization-480x390.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 739px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Coffee content creator Lance Hedrick posts sponsored videos on Instagram and creates exclusive</em><a href="https://www.patreon.com/lancehedrick" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <em>Patreon content</em></a><em>, generating about $7,000 monthly.</em></p>
<p>The platforms that support these exclusive communities and revenue generation, like Patreon and Substack, will continue to grow. So, in 2025, we’ll see more exclusivity with video content, including vlogs, product reviews, and more.</p>
<p>This shift behind a paywall has the potential to influence influencer marketing. This could mean more opportunities for better quality engagement in exclusive communities and creators who are less interested in smaller deals or working with new brands because they have diversified their revenue streams.</p>
<p>If you’re still considering <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/03/21/social-media-influencers">which influencers you work with</a> this year, be sure to check out content that appears publicly versus in an exclusive community. If you’re already working with influencers regularly, make sure to keep an eye out for changes.</p>
<div id="creativity-will-flourish-in-marketing-videos"></div>
<h3>8. Creativity will flourish in marketing videos</h3>
<p>This is by far the most exciting trend that experts predict for video marketing in 2025 for both marketers and internet consumers. With the increased accessibility enabled by AI and the resulting increase in competition to stand out, we’ll see an influx of creativity and innovation in video marketing this year.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-creative.webp" alt="Video marketing trends - Screenshot of a cooking video." width="884" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88997 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-creative.webp 884w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-creative-480x326.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 884px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Big and small brands will be incentivized and empowered to produce more creative videos.</em></p>
<p>“One optimistic prediction is that we&#8217;ll see more innovation by creators,” shared Chris O’Keefe. “I don&#8217;t know if we need any more Zoom-style interview shows. With YouTube and Spotify making it easier to create and publish video content, which creators are going to leverage the features to make interesting, immersive, narrative, or cinematic content?”</p>
<p>There will be more pressure to produce compelling,<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/01/05/marketing-videos"> creative video content</a> that stands out due to the shifts in algorithms and the influx of video content enabled by AI. But this pressure is coming from consumer expectations, too. WyzOwl found that<a href="https://www.wyzowl.com/video-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 91%</a> of consumers say video quality impacts their trust in a brand, up from 87% in our 2024 report.</p>
<p>AI can help with these increased standards, too—as long as you rely on these tools correctly. Creators and marketing teams alike will have more capability at their disposal with AI tools, in particular.

<div id="use-promotion-area-in-youtube-studio"></div>
<h3>3. Take advantage of the promotion area in YouTube Studio</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/20/youtube-studio-reports">YouTube Studio</a> offers a dedicated area for promoting your videos. Here’s how you can use it to your advantage:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Promotions tab:</strong> Within YouTube Studio, you’ll find the Promotions tab. This feature allows you to advertise your videos without needing to create a campaign directly in Google Ads.</li>
<li><strong>Easy setup:</strong> The Promotions feature simplifies the process, enabling you to set up ads directly from YouTube Studio. You can select your video, define your audience, set your budget, and launch your campaign in just a few steps.</li>
<li><strong>Targeted reach:</strong> Use the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/29/youtube-display-ads">detailed targeting options</a> to reach your desired audience by country and language. This ensures your videos get seen by the right people, maximizing engagement and growth.</li>
<li><strong>Performance insights:</strong> Track the performance of your promotions directly within YouTube Studio. Monitor <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/03/underrated-youtube-metrics">key metrics</a> like views, watch time, and engagement to assess the effectiveness of your video advertising efforts.</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/youtube-studio-promotion-goal.webp" alt="youtube studio promotion options" width="558" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86913" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/youtube-studio-promotion-goal.webp 558w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/youtube-studio-promotion-goal-480x516.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 558px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As you can see in this example, in the Promotions tab in YouTube Studio, you can now launch a campaign to boost the reach of any of your uploaded clips, via simplified set-up and targeting options.</p>
<p>YouTube Promotions are available for all channels that meet the requirements for Advanced features and have more than 1,000 subscribers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqVAQ2mb-xQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As explained by YouTube</a>: <em>&#8220;Creators have used promotions to grow views and subscribers faster, get more views on content where they showcase a product or service, with a goal of increasing sales, or to reach a specific audience, such as a new country. Promotions are in addition to your channel’s organic reach and discovery on YouTube, and as such, any subscriber or watch time gains from ads won’t count towards your YouTube Partner program eligibility.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Using YouTube Studio&#8217;s promotion area allows you to highlight specific videos, attract more viewers, and boost engagement on your channel.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Looking for more ways to drive people to your site?</strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website</a></p>
<div id="track-youtube-ad-performance"></div>
<h3>4. Track ad performance and audience engagement</h3>
<p>Engaging with your audience is crucial. You&#8217;ve worked hard to cultivate a community, so when someone asks you a question, it&#8217;s not only nice to answer it, but it also shows others that you&#8217;re there to help. When my channel got its first comment, I was excited. Now that my channel has over 16,000 subscribers, I still (try to) answer every question or comment I get. I want to be helpful and let others know I&#8217;m here to help. After all, I did this to educate and inspire, and a little engagement helps with brand awareness and recognition.</p>
<p>Regularly analyzing your channel&#8217;s performance is essential for continuous improvement. Here’s how to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>YouTube Analytics</strong>: Use YouTube Analytics to track key metrics such as watch time, audience retention, and subscriber growth.</li>
<li><strong>Google Ads reports</strong>: If you’re <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/youtube-advertising-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running YouTube ads</a>, utilize Google Ads reports to measure ad performance and ROI.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback loop</strong>: Collect feedback from your audience through comments and surveys to understand their preferences.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, you should analyze where viewers stop watching and understand why. Identify which videos are gaining you subscribers; YouTube Studio&#8217;s Analytics and Advanced Mode can show you this quite clearly. See the image below for an example.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/track-youtube-audience-engagement.webp" alt="youtube analytics example" width="850" height="420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86914" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/track-youtube-audience-engagement.webp 850w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/track-youtube-audience-engagement-480x237.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 850px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Try to create more content similar to what has been working well and use the data from viewing behavior to improve your videos. This approach also serves as a very effective <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/outdated-seo-tactics">SEO strategy</a>, as making videos that answer someone&#8217;s search query can drive more views.</p>
<div id="pay-attention-to-organic-youtube-content"></div>
<h3>5. Optimize your organic video content</h3>
<p>This tip isn’t necessarily going to boost your YouTube ads performance, but <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/youtube-seo">optimizing your organic video content</a> is key to attracting and retaining viewers you get from YouTube ads.</p>
<p>Here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create compelling thumbnails: </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/07/youtube-thumbnail">Create attention-grabbing YouTube thumbnails</a> that reflect the content of your video. I like to use <a href="https://www.fotor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fotor</a>, as it&#8217;s great for those who don&#8217;t have Photoshop skills or those who have Photoshop skills but are not efficient with it and like an easier way (like me). With Fotor, you can easily remove backgrounds from images, make visually appealing text overlays, and even figure out your channel&#8217;s style. Their vast library of thumbnail templates is proven to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/14/improve-google-ads-click-through-rate">increase click-through rates</a> (CTR), making it an invaluable resource for optimizing your content.</li>
<li><strong>Write SEO-friendly descriptions and titles: </strong>Write detailed descriptions with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/07/ppc-keyword-challenges">relevant keywords</a> to improve searchability. For titles, providing an answer to someone&#8217;s question (you anticipate they&#8217;ll ask) is a great idea.</li>
<li><strong>Use engaging introductions:</strong> Start your videos with engaging introductions to hook viewers from the beginning.
<ul>
<li>Something like: &#8220;Hey everyone! Welcome back to our channel. Today, we&#8217;re diving into the top five strategies to skyrocket your YouTube growth. If you&#8217;re ready to boost your channel and reach new heights, you&#8217;re in the right place. Let&#8217;s get started!&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Summarize your video: </strong>Summing up a video is important for reinforcing the main points and providing closure, which can be challenging. Ending a video effectively can keep viewers engaged and more likely to return for future content.</li>
<li><strong>Include clear calls to action:</strong> Include <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">clear calls to action</a>, such as asking viewers to like, comment, and subscribe. This helps increase engagement and grow your audience.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4da.png" alt="📚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide download</strong> &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download">The 42 Best Call to Action Phrases Ever (&amp; Why They Work)</a></p>
<p>Optimizing your video content helps <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-promote-your-youtube-channel">improve your channel’s visibility</a> and encourages viewer interaction.</p>
<p>Additionally, you should check out the inspiration tab in YouTube Studio. Go to Analytics and then to Inspiration. Here, you can see what people are searching for on YouTube who watch your videos. This is a good way to cater to your existing viewers.</p>
<p>When I was early on in my YouTube channel, I didn&#8217;t have many ideas other than creating videos about conversion tracking and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/14/how-to-use-google-tag-manager">Google Tag Manager</a>. I needed more video ideas and had to keep up my goal of putting out at least one video a week. So, I checked out this inspiration area, and it showed me that people were searching for &#8220;how to create a Gmail account.&#8221; I thought, &#8220;easy enough,&#8221; and created a video (a screen share) showing people how to create a Gmail account.</p>
<p>I titled it &#8220;<strong>How to Create a Gmail Account &#8211; Step-by-Step Tutorial for Beginners </strong><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4e5.png" alt="📥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> #gmail #google #digital.</strong>&#8221; This title, along with the appropriate icon and tags, was not just fluff. It actually became my best-performing video for a long period, racking up over 30,000 views organically in a short time. You can see the uptick in views in YouTube Studio when it was indexed by Google.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/youtube-analytics-example.webp" alt="example of youtube boosted performance after indexing on google" width="872" height="504" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86915" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/youtube-analytics-example.webp 872w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/youtube-analytics-example-480x277.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 872px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>Make your YouTube ads view-worthy</h2>
<p>To sum up, growing and optimizing your YouTube channel requires a strategic approach that leverages both content creation and promotional tools. By linking your YouTube account to Google Ads, creating targeted campaigns, utilizing YouTube Studio&#8217;s promotion area, and optimizing your video content, you can significantly enhance your channel&#8217;s visibility and engagement through YouTube ads. Regular analysis and adjustments based on performance metrics and audience feedback ensure continuous improvement and sustained growth.</p>

<h2>How to promote your YouTube channel: 9 ingenious ideas</h2>
<p>You’ve gone through all the trouble of creating killer content, so let&#8217;s get more eyes on it!</p>
<div id="use-the-right-keywords-in-the-right-places"></div>
<h3>1. Use the right keywords in the right places</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/youtube-seo">Optimizing your YouTube channel</a> and videos for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/30/seo-basics">SEO</a> is a non-negotiable tactic if you want viewers to find them. It’s free, completely scalable, and, if you do it effectively, can have massive implications for your visibility and reach.</p>
<p>Just like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-seo-guide">Google SEO</a>, you want to start by conducting some thorough <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide">keyword research</a> to find keywords relevant to your niche, products, and services. Tools like Google Keyword Planner, Ahrefs, Moz, SEMrush, and WordStream’s own <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">Free Keyword Tool</a> are all great tools to help here.</p>
<p>Another tactic to consider here is entering some queries related to your topic into YouTube’s search bar. Autocomplete will give you a good idea of what people are searching for and how to optimize your video for relevant keywords.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-youtube-search.webp" alt="How to promote your YouTube channel - screenshot of YouTube search." width="882" height="529" class="aligncenter wp-image-86079 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-youtube-search.webp 882w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-youtube-search-480x288.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 882px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Create a list of relevant keywords for your business. Then, identify the keywords on the list with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/01/23/keyword-search-volume">high search volume</a>.</p>
<p>From there, you’ll want to work these keywords strategically (and naturally!) into your videos’ <strong>titles, descriptions, and tags</strong> to improve your search rankings.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Want more?</strong> Download <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/big-easy-guide-to-kw-research?cid=Web_Any_Homepage_PPC_BigEasyKeyword_Download">The Big Easy Guide to Keyword Research for Businesses</a></p>
<div id="boost-ctr-with-engaging-titles-and-thumbnails"></div>
<h3>2. Boost CTR with engaging titles and thumbnails</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/click-through-rate">Click-through rate</a> (CTR) will also have a huge impact on your search rankings. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/15/youtube-algorithm">YouTube’s algorithm</a> automatically gives preference to videos that users engage with more frequently. If you want to increase your CTR, you <strong>need </strong>to make sure your titles are engaging, informative, and clickable, and include your primary keyword.</p>
<p>Showing people how to bake a cake? Don’t make your title &#8220;How to Bake a Cake.&#8221; Make it &#8220;Here’s How to Bake the Most Delicious Chocolate Cake You’ve Ever Tasted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, consider the impact that a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/07/youtube-thumbnail">super appealing thumbnail</a> can have on CTR. Thumbnails are typically the first visual impression users have of your video. Don’t make them bland. Use bright colors, readable text, and compelling, high-definition images that accurately represent your content, and you’ll be sure to increase click-through rate and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-rank-for-a-keyword">search rankings</a>.</p>

<h3>3. Develop a consistent content schedule</h3>
<p>Like so many things in life, shooting for perfection when creating YouTube videos is the kiss of death. You never want to pump out mediocre content just for the sake of consistency, but you need to play the volume game.</p>
<p>Focus on quality above all, but once you’ve nailed down a formula for engaging content, you need to develop a consistent posting cadence. This will keep the flywheel of engagement spinning, keep your subscribers engaged, and keep your audience ever-growing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-schedule.webp" alt="How to promote your YouTube channel - YouTube's scheduling dashboard." width="558" height="590" class="aligncenter wp-image-86081 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-schedule.webp 558w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-schedule-480x508.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 558px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Leveraging YouTube’s scheduling feature is a great way to keep the flywheel spinning.</em></p>
<p>Start by determining a realistic schedule you can adhere to (whether it&#8217;s multiple times per week, weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly). Consistency is the name of the game, so choose a schedule that fits your capacity to create quality content without burnout. Communicate this schedule to your audience by mentioning it in your videos, channel description, and across your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">social platforms</a>. This level of transparency sets expectations and builds anticipation.</p>
<div id="post-content-in-advance-and-at-the-right-times"></div>
<h3>4. Post content in advance and at the right times</h3>
<p>Want to streamline? Try batch filming and scheduling your videos in advance to ensure you always have the content in reserve ready to deploy. Tools like YouTube&#8217;s scheduling feature, pictured above, can help you do just that.</p>
<p>Consistency is one thing, but what about timeliness? Like any social platform, the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/08/best-time-to-post-on-youtube"> time of day and week you post to YouTube</a> significantly impacts your video&#8217;s performance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image7.webp" alt="How to promote your YouTube channel - Graphic of the best times to post on YouTube." width="936" height="304" class="aligncenter wp-image-86082 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image7.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image7-480x156.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here are some general insights:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Thursdays and Fridays:</strong> These are prime days to upload videos. Viewer engagement tends to increase towards the end of the workweek as people start looking for content to watch during their downtime.</li>
<li><strong>Saturdays and Sundays:</strong> These days see high viewer activity. Posting in the morning (between 9 and 11 AM) can capture viewers who are relaxing and have more time to watch videos.</li>
<li><strong>Weekday evenings (5 PM to 9 PM):</strong> During the week, viewers are more active during the evening after work or school. Posting during this time can increase the likelihood of your video being seen soon after it&#8217;s published.</li>
</ol>
<p>When in doubt, leverage <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/20/youtube-studio-reports">YouTube’s Analytics and reporting suite</a>, specifically the &#8220;When your viewers are on YouTube&#8221; report, to understand when your specific audience is most active.</p>
<div id="engage-with-your-audience"></div>
<h3>5. Engage with your audience</h3>
<p>Alright, so now you’ve optimized your videos for SEO. You’ve developed a consistent and timely posting schedule. Job done, right?</p>
<p>Not quite. Because while compelling content is great, engaging with your audience is really the cornerstone of building a successful YouTube channel. Nothing creates community, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/brand-loyalty">fosters loyalty</a>, and encourages repeat engagement <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/how-to-get-subscribers-on-youtube">among your subscribers</a> better than showing them that you are actively invested in the culture you are building around your YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Start by responding to comments on your videos. Whether you answer questions, acknowledge feedback, or simply thank viewers for their input, engaging in the comment section shows that you value your audience&#8217;s opinions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-reply.webp" alt="How to promote your YouTube channel - Screenshot of YouTube replies." width="869" height="505" class="aligncenter wp-image-86083 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-reply.webp 869w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-reply-480x279.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 869px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This will inevitably lead to higher engagement rates, as viewers are way more likely to comment when they know they will receive a response.</p>
<div id="leave-viewers-with-a-question-to-encourage-comments"></div>
<h3>6. Leave viewers with a question to encourage comments</h3>
<p>Want more comments? Encourage viewers to leave them by asking questions or prompting discussions at the end of your videos. You can also utilize YouTube’s Community Tab to post updates, polls, behind-the-scenes content, or even shout-outs to loyal subscribers. This is an excellent way to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/30/social-media-engagement">keep your channel active and engaging</a>, even when you&#8217;re not posting new videos.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/27/youtube-live">live streaming</a> is a great tool for real-time interaction. Hosting Q&amp;A sessions, live tutorials, or casual hangouts can significantly enhance your connection with viewers.</p>
<div id="collaborate-with-like-minded-creators"></div>
<h3>7. Collaborate with like-minded creators</h3>
<p>We know how it is. You put so much effort into your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/15/youtube-algorithm"> YouTube videos</a> that you’d like to believe they’ll gain traction on their own merit. You want to believe what you say or offer is unique and compelling enough to post and promote in a vacuum and get all the engagement you’ll ever need.</p>
<p>Listen: self-reliance isn’t a bad thing. But you’re severely handicapping your growth if you think you’ll max out your potential by going it alone.</p>
<p>Collaborating with other creators is a fundamental part of growing any YouTube channel. When you partner with fellow YouTubers in your niche or who serve a similar audience, you immediately gain access to a completely new set of qualified potential subscribers and customers.</p>
<p>Consider this partnership HelloFresh created with YouTube influencer Lee Williams.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-influencer.webp" alt="How to promote your YouTube channel - Influencer video for HelloFresh." width="357" height="586" class="aligncenter wp-image-86084 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-influencer.webp 357w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-influencer-183x300.webp 183w" sizes="(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/_sDClBReMe0?si=lNC5i8-R6gM8S_0l" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>By soliciting Lee to do an unboxing of one of its subscription food deliveries, HelloFresh gained instantaneous access to her 155k+ subscriber base. They also gained credibility by being associated with Lee’s lifestyle, which her audience loves. You don’t necessarily have to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/03/21/social-media-influencers">partner with influencers</a>; you can simply partner with another brand or creator. But creating this kind of partnership can give you a similar level of unprecedented access to audience growth.</p>
<div id="host-new-guests-and-get-featured-on-like-minded"></div>
<h3>8. Host new guests and get featured on like-minded channels</h3>
<p>Want to increase your reach even more? Get featured on other channels! You need to expose yourself to new audiences as much as possible to buoy your growth, and making guest appearances on like-minded creators’ channels is a surefire way to do just that. The same goes for featuring that guest on your channel.</p>
<div id="leverage-email-marketing"></div>
<h3>9. Leverage email marketing</h3>
<p>We know what you’re thinking. What on earth does YouTube have to do with email? Aren’t my other social platforms the best avenue to promote my videos?</p>
<p>While you should absolutely be promoting your YouTube videos on Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), and the like, leveraging <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/01/email-marketing-tips">email marketing</a> is an equally powerful strategy to get engagement. Here&#8217;s a five-step primer on using email marketing to boost your channel&#8217;s visibility:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Build your list: </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/11/how-to-build-an-email-list">Build an email list</a> of your subscribers and viewers who have opted in to receive updates from you. This list is <em>super valuable,</em> as it consists of people who are already interested in your content.</li>
<li><strong>Engage with subscribers</strong>: Send regular updates about your latest videos or series launches. Use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/31/email-subject-lines">enticing subject lines</a> and thumbnails to grab attention and encourage people to click on your content.</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-email.webp" alt="How to promote your YouTube channel - Email promoting YouTube video." width="251" height="552" class="aligncenter wp-image-86085 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-email.webp 251w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-email-136x300.webp 136w" sizes="(max-width: 251px) 100vw, 251px" /></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Personalize the emails: </strong>Personalize your emails to make them more relevant to each subscriber. Address them by their name and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/28/behavioral-segmentation">segment your list based on interests</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Give exclusive benefits: </strong>Use email to promote exclusive content or behind-the-scenes footage that is only accessible through that channel. This creates a sense of exclusivity and encourages subscribers to stay engaged with your updates via email.</li>
<li><strong>Get people sharing:</strong> Include <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/19/social-sharing">social sharing buttons</a> and encourage subscribers to share your videos with friends and networks.</li>
</ol>
<p>Integrate email marketing into your promotional strategy, and you’ll quickly build loyalty, drive traffic, and boost engagement.</p>
<h2>Promote your YouTube channel to accelerate growth</h2>
<p>Getting your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/optimize-youtube-ad-campaigns">YouTube channel</a> online is a huge first step, but serious growth happens when you <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/youtube-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actively promote it</a>.</p>
<p>You don’t need to spend hours doing it every day. Get started with 30 minutes per week using one or two of these YouTube promotion ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the right keywords in the right places</li>
<li>Boost CTR with engaging titles and thumbnails</li>
<li>Develop a consistent content schedule</li>
<li>Post content in advance and at the right times</li>
<li>Engage with your audience</li>
<li>Leave viewers with a question to encourage comments</li>
<li>Collaborate with like-minded creators</li>
<li>Host new guests and get featured on like-minded channels</li>
<li>Leverage email marketing</li>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re looking to grow your brand’s reach with more creative content strategies, you’re probably already considering YouTube. And it’s worth a try. In fact, the Content Marketing Institute found that YouTube is an effective marketing channel for <a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/B2C_2023_Research_Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">86%</a> of B2C brands, and for <a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/articles/b2b-content-marketing-trends-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">22%</a> of B2B brands, YouTube is their top-performing channel.</p>
<p>But when you’re spending the time—and, in some cases, the budget—to create compelling video content, you want to get the most out of it. That’s why establishing your YouTube SEO strategy early and checking in often is helpful.</p>
<p>Here’s how to get started.</p>

<h2>YouTube SEO tips to get your content in front of more viewers</h2>
<p>YouTube is a platform for video content, but it’s important to remember it’s also a search engine. And some might even argue (like in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/03/opinion/youtube-beats-google.html">The New York Times</a>) that it’s a better one than Google. Here are tips for approaching your YouTube content creation and promotion with SEO in mind:</p>
<h3>1. Do keyword research</h3>
<p>Whether it’s the foundation of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/13/content-marketing-strategy">content strategy</a> or a step in your brainstorming, keyword research belongs in your content ideation process. This is true for blog posts and guides that you want to rank on the Google SERP. It’s also true for YouTube. These videos could appear on the Google SERP, and you want them to show up on YouTube’s own search results page. Because, after all, YouTube is a search engine.</p>
<p>So when you’re creating YouTube videos, check for keyword opportunities. You can take a look at trending videos on your own account’s homepage to start. Common <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-seo-tools">SEO tools</a> like Semrush and Ahrefs have the option to focus keyword research on YouTube. This will let you explore many of the same features—keyword term matches, long-tail related keywords, and level of competition to rank.</p>
<p><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?gprop=youtube" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Trends</a> also has a drop-down option to select YouTube Search to explore trending topics. This is another option (especially if you don’t have a subscription to Ahrefs, Semrush, or a similar tool) to look into keyword opportunities. The features aren’t as extensive, but you can check out interest in a certain area and get some ideas for related keywords.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/youtube-seo-do-keyword-research.webp" alt="using google trends for youtube seo" width="886" height="539" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84429" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/youtube-seo-do-keyword-research.webp 886w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/youtube-seo-do-keyword-research-480x292.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 886px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Remember, you can also optimize retroactively. If you have a channel up and running, take a look at the video content on there and follow these steps to see if there’s an opportunity to target your title or description—which brings us to the next tip.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f50e.png" alt="🔎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Need help finding the right keywords?</strong> Try our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">Free Keyword Tool</a>!</p>
<h3>2. Optimize your titles and descriptions</h3>
<p>Once you have your keywords, make sure that your video title and description are optimized for SEO. Here are a few tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use your target keywords.</strong> Include your target keyword in your title, ideally at the beginning. And these should appear in your description, as well.</li>
<li><strong>Keep it short.</strong> The title should land between 50 and 60 characters, and your description between 125 and 200 characters.</li>
<li><strong>Be descriptive and specific. </strong>The titles and descriptions should match the content of the video—keyword intent matters on YouTube, too.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/youtube-seo-optimize-titles.webp" alt="example of youtube results with optimized titles" width="887" height="544" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84430" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/youtube-seo-optimize-titles.webp 887w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/youtube-seo-optimize-titles-480x294.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 887px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The first organic result matches the search term exactly. </em></p>
<h3>3. Add relevant tags</h3>
<p>Tags are keywords that you can add to your video’s metadata. YouTube isn’t clear on how effective tags are for reaching new viewers. The answer on <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/146402">YouTube Help</a> states that “you can add [tags] to your video to help viewers find your content,” and that they ultimately “play a minimal role in your video&#8217;s discovery.”</p>
<p>But when you’re uploading your video to YouTube, it takes just a few moments to add tags. So it’s worth adding these, whether or not the impact is “minimal.” On the details section of the video upload screen, after you’ve added your title and description, scroll down and click on the prompt to show more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/youtube-seo-add-tags.webp" alt="add tags to videos for youtube seo" width="859" height="435" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84431" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/youtube-seo-add-tags.webp 859w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/youtube-seo-add-tags-480x243.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 859px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Once the tags section appears, write in a few words and phrases to describe the content of your video. For example, if you’re uploading a video on baking a cake, you might include: how to bake a cake, baking a birthday cake, pineapple upside down cake.</p>
<p>Pro tip: If it’s a tutorial for how to use your product or your service, make sure to include your brand name as a tag.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4da.png" alt="📚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide download</strong> &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download">The 36 Best Call to Action Phrases Ever (&amp; Why They Work)</a></p>
<h3>4. Select a category</h3>
<p>Below the section to add tags, you’ll have the option to select a category for your YouTube video. It’s unclear whether a category impacts reach—some threads on Reddit say it can improve or tank performance and others question whether it does anything. But like adding tags, selecting a category takes just a moment, so it’s worth adding to your routine. If it does increase your chances to rank, you don’t want to miss the opportunity.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/youtube-seo-choose-video-categories.webp" alt="add category to youtube video for youtube seo" width="860" height="437" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84432" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/youtube-seo-choose-video-categories.webp 860w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/youtube-seo-choose-video-categories-480x244.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 860px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here are the options that you have to select a category on YouTube:</p>
<ul>
<li>Autos &amp; Vehicles</li>
<li>Comedy</li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Entertainment</li>
<li>Film &amp; Animation</li>
<li>Gaming</li>
<li>How to &amp; Style</li>
<li>Music</li>
<li>News &amp; Politics</li>
<li>Nonprofits &amp; Activism</li>
<li>People &amp; Blogs</li>
<li>Pets &amp; Animals</li>
<li>Science &amp; Technology</li>
<li>Sports</li>
<li>Travel &amp; Events</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the impact is unclear, don’t spend too much time debating here. Take the two seconds to choose the best fit for your video, then move on to more important factors in your YouTube SEO.</p>
<h3>5. Customize your thumbnail</h3>
<p>YouTube will automatically select a still frame from your video as a thumbnail when you upload. You do not want to use this. Instead, you want to take the time to create your own. According to YouTube, <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12340300?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90%</a> of the best-performing videos have custom thumbnails. People want to click on a visually appealing video, and a fuzzy still frame isn’t going to cut it.</p>
<p>Customizing your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/07/youtube-thumbnail">YouTube thumbnail</a> can be a project for a designer, or it can be straightforward editing in Canva or even Google Slides with a screengrab and a title overlay. Take a look at the thumbnails for the budgeting videos below. They’re all different, but they’re all fairly low-production in terms of design elements. Most are still images with titles, screenshots, or logos added.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/youtube-seo-customize-thumbnail.webp" alt="example of customized youtube thumbnails" width="680" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84433" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/youtube-seo-customize-thumbnail.webp 680w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/youtube-seo-customize-thumbnail-480x424.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 680px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>When you’re creating your custom thumbnail for YouTube, keep these specs in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimum resolution of 1280&#215;720.</li>
<li>Minimum width of 640 pixels.</li>
<li>File types JPG, GIF, or PNG.</li>
<li>Maximum file size 2MB for videos or 10MB for podcasts.</li>
<li>Required 16:9 aspect ratio.</li>
</ul>
<p>And while you’re customizing, don’t forget to add your logo as a watermark in the thumbnail, too.</p>
<h3>6. Set up playlists</h3>
<p>YouTube allows you to create playlists of multiple videos. Once you have a few related videos on your YouTube channel, it’s setting one up.</p>
<p>By setting up a playlist of related videos, you can keep engaged viewers watching your content for longer. This could be multiple videos on a certain topic, like the garden creation or cake baking we talked about earlier. It could also be videos for a specific audience, like a collection of videos with marketing tips or SMBs or yoga classes designed for teachers.</p>

<h3>7. Double-check your file name</h3>
<p>I am guilty of downloading files and never adjusting the name. This is frustrating at the moment when I have 16 files named &#8220;screenshot&#8221; on my desktop. It’s also more than a missed organizational opportunity.</p>
<p>When it comes to your YouTube videos, take the time to rename the files with your keyword, or even your full title that might include “how to.” This is another opportunity to signal the content of the video to YouTube’s search engine in the video’s metadata.</p>
<h3>8. Review analytics and adjust your strategy</h3>
<p>Your YouTube SEO strategy will include a lot of front-end optimization to give your videos the best chance of reaching your audience. But it’s important to check in on performance.</p>
<p>From the sidebar of your YouTube Studio page, head to the Analytics section.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/youtube-seo-use-analytics.webp" alt="analytics section in youtube studio" width="226" height="542" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84435" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/youtube-seo-use-analytics.webp 226w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/youtube-seo-use-analytics-125x300.webp 125w" sizes="(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px" /></p>
<p>Here, you’ll see overall views, watch time, and channel subscribers. You can also dig into the performance of specific videos and details of your audience, including a breakdown of new and returning viewers. This will help you create new content, or even find ways to optimize existing content with new keywords, based on your audience’s interest. Plus, it’s a good way to see what isn’t working and save your time.</p>
<p>After all, YouTube has <a href="https://www.globalmediainsight.com/blog/youtube-users-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2.7 billion users</a>. And these users spend an average of <a href="https://www.oberlo.com/statistics/average-time-spent-on-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noopener">48 minutes each day</a> interacting with content. Your audience is online, so it’s a matter of creating the content that they’re interested in viewing and getting that content in front of them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/time-spent-on-youtube.webp" alt="chart showing time spent on youtube" width="874" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84436" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/time-spent-on-youtube.webp 874w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/time-spent-on-youtube-480x264.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 874px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>YouTube SEO can help serve your video content to more interested viewers on YouTube and on the Google SERP, so it’s worth taking the extra time. But it isn’t the only way to get found on YouTube, so we have a few more tactics to grow your YouTube channel.</p>

<h2>More ways to get found on YouTube</h2>
<p>SEO is an important lever to improve your and get in front of more people on YouTube. But it isn’t the only way to get your channel and your video content out there. Here are a few more quick tips to try and increase your views.</p>
<h3>9. Create a channel trailer</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite tips because I wish there were more YouTube channel trailers. These brief videos can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce your audience to you and your brand.</li>
<li>Provide an overview of the type of content that you publish.</li>
<li>Preview the style of your YouTube videos.</li>
</ul>
<p>This last one is particularly helpful. If your content <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2024-seo-strategies">strategy</a> leans heavily to posting videos of podcast interviews or how to series or confessional, chatty USG content, this is good to know upfront.</p>
<p>Plus, you don’t have to create much net-new content for this, as featuring highlights from your existing content is key. If you’re looking for more tips on putting this together, check out this guide to creating a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/28/youtube-channel-trailer">YouTube channel trailer</a>.</p>
<h3>10. Share across other channels</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO</a> is an excellent lever for reaching new audiences on YouTube. But if your business has followers on other platforms, there’s a good chance at least some of them are already using YouTube. They need to know about your content, there.</p>
<p>So <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-promote-your-youtube-channel">promote your YouTube content</a> in your other marketing channels. Embed relevant YouTube videos in your blog posts. If you have a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/25/email-newsletter-ideas">newsletter</a>, you can add a section featuring your YouTube channel and include links to new videos in follow-up communications. If you have a following on LinkedIn or Instagram, post about your YouTube videos and include <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">CTAs</a> to subscribe to your channel there.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/promote-youtube-videos-on-social.webp" alt="example of youtube video promoted on social media" width="335" height="575" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84437" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/promote-youtube-videos-on-social.webp 335w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/promote-youtube-videos-on-social-175x300.webp 175w" sizes="(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px" /></p>

<h3>11. Develop a series</h3>
<p>Regular content is an excellent way to keep your regular viewers tuning in and attracting a new audience. Your series could be a long-standing series, like product release round-ups or a video recording of your brand’s podcast.</p>
<p>But you can also experiment with a time box. For instance, try out some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/july-content-ideas">summer-themed content</a> related to your brand, whether it’s a series of lawn care videos throughout June or a weekly rating of new ice cream shops in your area. (Who isn’t searching for the best cookie dough scoop around?)</p>
<p>And be sure to add the series videos to a playlist for your viewers to navigate easily, even after it’s complete.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/youtube-seo-develop-series.webp" alt="example of youtube video series" width="839" height="356" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84438" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/youtube-seo-develop-series.webp 839w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/youtube-seo-develop-series-480x204.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 839px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@yogawithadriene/playlists" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Yoga With Adriene</em></a><em> has been running 30 days of yoga series for years—and now has tons of playlists for new viewers.</em></p>
<h3>12. Get started with YouTube Shorts</h3>
<p>YouTube’s short-form video content, aptly titled <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-make-youtube-shorts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube Shorts</a>, has a huge audience. In the US alone, there were <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1459687/us-youtube-shorts-us-viewers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">152 million monthly users</a> engaging with YouTube Shorts on the platform. And this user base is expected to keep growing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/number-of-youtube-shorts.webp" alt="chart showing growing number of youtube shorts" width="894" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84440" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/number-of-youtube-shorts.webp 894w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/number-of-youtube-shorts-480x322.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 894px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1459687/us-youtube-shorts-us-viewers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-make-youtube-shorts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube Shorts</a> are vertically oriented for better viewing (and swiping through) on a smartphone. These videos range in length, but they’re limited to 60 seconds. Your YouTube shorts will be featured on your channel page, and they’ll also be served in YouTube’s search engine in addition to the main video content.</p>
<p>YouTube Shorts are also quickly becoming a major advertising opportunity. Last year, ad buyers reported that <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/meta-tiktok-youtube-prepare-face-off-2023-newfronts">43% </a>of their clients were advertising on YouTube Shorts, alongside TikTok and Instagram Reels. Something to keep in mind if you’re running ads on YouTube, too, which brings us to our final tip here.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/youtube-shorts-example.webp" alt="example of youtube shorts" width="426" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84439" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/youtube-shorts-example.webp 426w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/youtube-shorts-example-213x300.webp 213w" sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" /></p>
<h3>13. Try paid promotion</h3>
<p>The best way to ensure that your video content gets in front of your desired audience on YouTube is to run ads. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/23/youtube-advertising-tips">YouTube&#8217;s advertising options</a> include brief bumper ads, skippable and non-skippable instream, infeed ads, and more. When it comes to content for your ad, you’ll want a clear CTA and you can even use snippets of existing videos.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/youtube-advertising-cost.webp" alt="graphic showing average youtube advertising cost" width="887" height="581" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84441" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/youtube-advertising-cost.webp 887w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/youtube-advertising-cost-480x314.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 887px, 100vw" /></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By now, we’re all knee-deep in planning for 2024—identifying new campaigns to test, putting together budgets, setting marketing goals, and defining the channels we’ll focus on. Whether you have a robust video marketing strategy or you’re debating on buying your first iPhone tripod, one thing’s clear: <strong>Your business will benefit from more video content this year.</strong></p>
<p>There’s a reason video marketing is so effective for reaching people. When it’s done right, videos are easy to interact with, entertaining to consume, and quick to share. In fact, in a recent video marketing study, <a href="https://wyzowl.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pdfs/Wyzowl-Video-Survey-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">51%</a> of respondents reported that they are more likely to share video content over social posts, blogs, or product pages.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/video-marketing-trends-sharing-content-chart.jpg" alt="video marketing trends - preferred shared content chart" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-79422 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/video-marketing-trends-sharing-content-chart.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/video-marketing-trends-sharing-content-chart-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>That’s great for building your brand and growing your audience. As long as you make the most of it. Cue video marketing trends. Following video marketing trends to inspire your business&#8217;s video strategy will increase your chances of securing views, engagement, and shares.</p>
<p>To start, we wanted to know what to expect in video marketing next year: the types of videos, the distribution methods, and the production tips. So we asked marketing leaders, video producers, and video editors what they think we’ll see more of.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get into it!</p>
<h2><span>The top video marketing trends for 2024</span></h2>
<p>Here are the video marketing trends that the experts expect to see in 2024.</p>
<h3><span>1. </span><span>More use of AI tools and tricks</span></h3>
<p>This couldn’t be a list of trends for marketing next year without featuring AI. The advancements in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-copywriting-tools">artificial intelligence</a> (AI), and generative AI in particular, have been all over the news this year. For example, Open AI launched the trained generative chatbot ChatGPT 3.5 at the end of 2022, and then an updated ChatGPT 4.0. There have been tons of other applications for this technology on the market and in the headlines this year, including resources for <span><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/05/generative-ai-in-digital-marketing">generative AI in digital marketing</a></span>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/video-marketing-trends-ai-google-trends.jpg" alt="video marketing trends - screenshot of ai search in google trends" width="783" height="476" class="aligncenter wp-image-79477 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/video-marketing-trends-ai-google-trends.jpg 783w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/video-marketing-trends-ai-google-trends-480x292.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 783px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Google Trends captures the huge increase in interest in AI over the last two years. </em></p>
<p>Danielle Warren, senior video editor at <span><a href="https://about.google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a></span>, expects this to be a major trend in video marketing in 2024. “AI will of course continue to be a huge topic and trend going forward,” she said. “As more and more AI-powered tools come onto the market, their significance in video marketing strategies will only grow. AI tools will increase productivity and help video teams ‘do more with less.’”</p>
<p>Additionally, AI video creation is a video marketing trend that&#8217;s already providing positive results. <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/ai-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI statistics</a> show that <a href="https://www.wyzowl.com/video-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">75%</a> of businesses are using AI to help them create or edit marketing videos and <a href="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/blog/ai-impacts-video-marketing/#:~:text=Let's%20start%20with%20some%20overall,using%20AI%20tools%20for%20work." target="_blank" rel="noopener">96%</a> of businesses have already seen a positive ROI from AI-powered video marketing.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f5d3.png" alt="🗓" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Get more marketing ideas, tips, and trends for this year in our free <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite2024MarketingCalendar.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2024MarketingCalendar_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2024 marketing calendar</a>!</p>
<h3><span>2. </span><span>Fewer videos in SERP results (sort of)</span></h3>
<p><span>Earlier this year, Google <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-reduces-video-thumbnails-in-serps/484589/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it would significantly reduce the number of video thumbnails that appeared on the SERP. Specifically, Google said that it would stop featuring videos that weren’t the main content of the page.</span></p>
<p><span>This has already resulted in fewer videos on the SERP, and marketers are now planning for this in their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/13/content-marketing-strategy">content strategies</a>. A video that’s not central to the page won’t rank—but the main content will. </span></p>
<p><span>Here’s an example of a real-life query and the very helpful thumbnails that still appear from YouTube. Notice, though, that there weren’t any videos pulled from the comments on Quora’s SERP result.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/video-marketing-trends-example-serp-results.jpg" alt="video marketing trends - screenshot of current google serp" width="767" height="602" class="aligncenter wp-image-79478 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/video-marketing-trends-example-serp-results.jpg 767w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/video-marketing-trends-example-serp-results-480x377.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 767px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>What does this video marketing trend mean? Make sure your main videos are correctly featured and don’t expect to rank for peripheral video content. But still a good idea to prioritize your <span><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/06/02/video-seo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video SEO</a></span> next year.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4f9.png" alt="📹" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Get more insight into your Google display and video campaign performance using our free<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Google Ads Grader</a>!</p>
<h3><span>3. Videos will be included in newsletter </span><span>and email creative</span></h3>
<p>Something that we saw a lot in 2023? Newsletters. According to reletter, there are more than <span><a href="https://reletter.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.6 million newsletters</a></span> on Substack and LinkedIn alone.</p>
<p>This format allows for longer, more narrative communication with your audience. That’s a great opportunity for video content.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m looking forward to incorporating more videos into our email marketing strategy in 2024,” Natalie Cantave shared. Cantave runs marketing and partnerships for <span><a href="https://www.estateably.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Estateably</a></span>, and she co-founded the <span><a href="https://www.mktgwmn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MKTG WMN</a></span> community. “Short videos have helped our customers experience the newest product features which will hopefully drive adoption, keep them satisfied, and result in client retention.”</p>
<h3><span>4. Product videos will become more prevalent</span></h3>
<p>Allen Finn, who runs marketing at <span><a href="https://www.triplewhale.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Triple Whale</a></span>, is prioritizing product videos next year, and he thinks he’s one of many marketing leaders making this plan.</p>
<p>“We’re changing most of our documentation to video (versus traditional written help docs),” he said. “It’s more digestible, less intimidating, and much more efficient to update, which is essential for a product that changes as often as ours.”</p>
<p>This change also means investing in video marketing content for your highest-value audiences: your customers or your most engaged prospects. “We’re replacing illustrations with gifs and product videos across the website to show the product as it is versus as an abstraction to drive interest and conversion from high-intent visitors,” he explained.</p>
<p>Focusing on product videos and gifs next year is a no-brainer for software companies, but featuring your offering in motion is great for any business, especially direct-to-consumer.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>In case anyone thinks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D7YXCCgi-E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gluten-free mac and cheese</a> looks any different.</em></p>
<p>And if you’re featuring a service—-whether it’s your dental office or lawn care—-then you have a great reason to get in front of the camera. This brings us to the next video marketing trend to watch for next year.</p>
<h3><span>5. </span><span>More real people on camera</span></h3>
<p>Rayna van Beuzekom, video editor and producer at <span><a href="https://www.commsor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commsor</a></span>, thinks we’re going to see more people on camera as brands focus on the biggest value of video: connection.</p>
<p>“Video is such a great tool to connect with audiences,” they said. “You can take a seemingly distant product and humanize it through video. We&#8217;re going to see more and more people on camera, whether it&#8217;s sellers, marketers or executives.”</p>
<p>Notice the key similarity among the “who” options Rayna gave? Sellers, marketers, and executives are all members of your team. Real people don’t mean actors or influencers; it means your company’s employees and partners.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cz9NoMYxJQn/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A great example</a> of casual, conversational founder videos from Lo Bosworth, CEO of Lovewellness and Laguna Beach alum.</em></p>
<p>Founder &amp; CEO at <span><a href="https://www.startupbos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Startup Boston</a></span> Stephanie Roulic thinks this trend will be especially prevalent for startups. “During the early stages of marketing your company, video marketing is so incredibly important because, more often than not, you have to rely on utilizing your founders&#8217; personality and story to sell early adapters on why they should take a chance on you.”</p>
<p>Early-stage companies and small businesses are in the same boat here. Next year, Stephanie expects more company founders to appear in social videos. She said this will “highlight not just the value of your product, but the team behind your product to help develop trust between you and early customers.”</p>
<p>By creating connections and building trust, video marketing can have real long-term impacts on brand affinity. We’re expecting to see plenty of real faces to help with that next year.</p>
<h3><span>6. S</span><span>hort-form video for social is here to stay</span></h3>
<p>As of October 2023, there are <span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4.95 billion</a></span> social media users globally, which accounts for 94% of internet users. With that many people logging into social media, it’s a guarantee that your audience is reachable. It’s just a matter of finding them.</p>
<p>One of the most effective ways to grow your brand’s reach across is<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/10/social-media-video-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> short-form video marketing content on social media</a>. That’s why it’s not going anywhere in 2024.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/video-marketing-trends-short-form-video.jpg" alt="video marketing trends - tiktok example" width="793" height="475" class="aligncenter wp-image-79476 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/video-marketing-trends-short-form-video.jpg 793w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/video-marketing-trends-short-form-video-480x288.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 793px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@netflix/video/7307409212160888110" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An example </a>of a short-form TikTok video. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“As a short-form video editor, I may be a little biased, but I&#8217;m genuinely enthusiastic about the ongoing growth of short-form content,” Warren said. “Between Instagram reels, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/youtube-shorts-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube Shorts</a>, TikTok, and everything in between, the appetite for short-form videos is only going to increase after growing exponentially over the next few years. Given the ever-shortening of attention spans, the ability to narrate your brand&#8217;s visual stories in a succinct and engaging manner is essential for success.”</p>
<h3><span>7. L</span><span>ong-form video content returns</span></h3>
<p>Short-form video is here to stay for another year—at least. But video marketing experts are also expecting a renewed focus on other kinds of video in 2024.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m hopeful for more long-form content in 2024,” said van Beuzekom. “There&#8217;s more room for creativity vs. just trying to make something fast, like in short form.”</p>
<p>They point specifically to an increase in<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/03/how-to-advertise-on-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> YouTube video marketing and advertising</a>. And this makes sense. <span><a href="https://wyzowl.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pdfs/Wyzowl-Video-Survey-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">78%</a></span> of marketers identify YouTube as the most successful video <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/26/marketing-channels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing channel</a>.</p>
<p>The platform offers vertical shorts for users to flip through similar to TikTok, but its mainstay is long-form videos. That means YouTube is a great place for your recorded podcasts, your explainer videos, even your event recaps—which leads us to the next trend.</p>
<h3><span>8. More videos will be made without sound</span></h3>
<p><span>Did you know that, in 2017, <a href="https://digiday.com/media/silent-world-facebook-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">85%</a></span> of Facebook videos were watched without sound? This video marketing trend is back, as many users are now consuming even more social video content without sound. In fact, users spend an average of <span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/433871/daily-social-media-usage-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">151 minutes each day</a></span> on social platforms interacting with content, including videos with and without sound.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/22/instagram-reels-ideas-for-businesses" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Instagram Reels</a> watched in the office, in waiting rooms, in bed beside a partner—without sound. If this is how users are consuming content, it should be easy to understand why this video marketing trend is continuing to grow.</p>
<p>Now, there are more tools than ever to help make sure silent videos are effective with complete, accurate captions. Plus, AI tools will make this easier for marketing teams to do, even without video expertise. This leads to our final video marketing trend.</p>
<h3><span>9. Brands will focus on thrifty video marketing</span></h3>
<p>This past year has been a rough one for tech. With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/30/tech-layoffs-2023-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 220k</a> layoffs last year and the reduced <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing budgets</a> impacting the industry’s freelancers, thrift is going to be a video marketing trend in 2024.</p>
<p>Earlier, Finn pointed to efficiency as an additional benefit of switching to product videos instead of written documentation. Warren also specifically referenced doing more with less as “another trend that is expected to continue into 2024, especially as tech and media companies regain momentum following a challenging 2023.”</p>
<p>Luckily, the rise of AI editing and more easy-to-use <span><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/13/video-ad-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video ad tools </a></span>will help marketers create some clips even without a video background. Vimeo, for example, released the AI-powered caption generator as well as a transcript-based editor for easy cuts.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/video-marketing-trends-youtube.jpg" alt="video marketing trends - example ai youtube editing " width="699" height="466" class="aligncenter wp-image-79475 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/video-marketing-trends-youtube.jpg 699w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/video-marketing-trends-youtube-480x320.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 699px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B704fR5y3-U" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>Of course, nothing beats an expert producer and an adequate budget. But in 2024, the most important thing is getting video marketing for your brand out in the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>Social media platforms are focusing more and more on video content. Facebook used to be a place for folks to upload their photos into albums to keep them organized and share what they’d been up to, but with the increase in popularity of TikTok and Instagram Reels, users are now so much more accustomed to scrolling through endless videos designed to make them laugh, cry, or stay informed. With this change in user behavior, it’s now more important than ever to be sure you’re creating engaging content that cuts through the noise and stands out.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ad-example.jpg" alt="facebook video ad example" width="377" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-78403 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ad-example.jpg 377w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ad-example-189x300.jpg 189w" sizes="(max-width: 377px) 100vw, 377px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An example of a Facebook video ad. </em></p>
<p><span>Video ads on the Meta Business platform (which reaches Facebook and Instagram) is a great way to do this. Although the ability to churn out video ads regularly was reserved for brands with big budgets in years past, new tools and AI have helped democratize this and now any brand can advertise using high-quality videos without spending much at all. </span></p>
<p><span>In this post, I want to talk through some best practices for Facebook video ads and show you some tools you can use to execute those strategies.</span></p>

<h2><span>Facebook video ads best practices</span></h2>
<p>Follow these<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/28/facebook-video-marketing"> Facebook video ad tips</a> to squeeze the most out of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/11/28/facebook-ads-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook ad costs</a>.</p>
<h3><span>1. Create videos in all aspect ratios</span></h3>
<p><span>If you’ve used Meta Ads recently, you probably know there are tons of different placements your ads can show up on the network. The good news is that to cover this vast list of placements, you only need to come up with three distinct aspect ratios for your video ads:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ads-ratios.jpg" alt="facebook video ads ratio chart" width="860" height="257" class="aligncenter wp-image-78393 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ads-ratios.jpg 860w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ads-ratios-480x143.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 860px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span>Having videos in each of these aspect ratios ensures you’re eligible to show in all the placements you’d like to. </span></p>
<p><span>We’ll talk later about how you can make these aspect ratios if you don’t have a dedicated creative team, but in the ad creation process, you’re able to select different video files to fit into each aspect ratio. Facebook will then automatically serve the creative with the right sizing for each spot to ensure you have the best-looking ads.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ad-crop-feature.jpg" alt="facebook video ad sizing and resizing screenshot" width="765" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-78387 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ad-crop-feature.jpg 765w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ad-crop-feature-480x376.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 765px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span>Now, while it might not seem like a huge deal to have all three ratios, I think it’s actually one of the easiest things you can do to help make sure your ads look good and stand out. In the image above, you can easily see how different an ad will look in the vertical and horizontal placements if you only have a square image. They’re not bad, necessarily, but they certainly don’t have the high-quality, professional look that most users have become accustomed to in recent years.</span></p>

<h3><span>2. Be prepared for all sound options  </span></h3>
<p><span>If you’re a<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/10/instagram-vs-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Facebook or Instagram</a> user, you’ve likely visited the platforms in all sorts of scenarios. With full sound while sitting on your couch or in your bed. Maybe you have your headphones in while out in public, or maybe you’re even one of those crazy people with their sound up on the subway. But odds are, there have been at least a few instances where you were on those platforms and didn’t have the sound on at all.  </span></p>
<p><span>For each of these instances, you were bound to see ads and the level of volume you were using likely had an impact on how sticky those ads were for you. Designing your ads to be digestible regardless of a user’s sound level is highly important. </span></p>
<p><span>Here are a few questions to ask yourself while crafting Facebook video ads sounds:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span> </span><span>Do you have an engaging/entertaining voiceover? </span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Is there music you can choose to fit the mood of the ad? </span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Do you have subtitles for the voiceover in case someone’s sound is off? </span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Is the voiceover clear and easily understandable even in a loud environment?</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>3. Get your main message across in the first 3 seconds</span></h3>
<p><span>No matter what the original purpose was for someone to visit social media, the main point is that they’re not there to view your ads. I feel very confident in saying that for the majority of people visiting Facebook or Instagram, they’re not there to see what <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product or service you’re selling</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>Similar to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/03/how-to-advertise-on-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ads on YouTube</a>, users are pretty easily able to skip and scroll past the ads on Facebook and Instagram. That is, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4OO9q1oYfU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unless you run non-skippable ads</a>, but those are pretty rare. So, you need to make sure you’re making a big impact in the first few seconds of your ads…before the remainder of it is skipped. If you do a good job of creating a compelling hook in that short time, you can certainly draw their attention for longer, maybe up to 15-30 seconds, some even longer. But odds are, your views will be short so you need to be front-heavy. </span></p>
<p><span>In this time, it’s important to get your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/08/business-name-ideas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business name</a> and core<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/27/brand-messaging" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> brand messaging</a> across so that even if a user does scroll past you, you’ve at least made that much of an impact. They’ll have a higher chance at brand recall later if they’ve heard your name in that brief intro. This can include text, voiceover,<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-logo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> business logos</a>, and more, so be creative, engaging, and entertaining. </span></p>
<h3><span>4. Blend into the platform aesthetic</span></h3>
<p><span>In my experience, the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/best-facebook-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best ads on Facebook</a> or Instagram (I’m typically an Instagram user) are ones that blend into the platform aesthetic. The ads that typically entice me the most are the ones I don’t really know are ads until I look down to see the Sponsored messaging down at the bottom. </span></p>
<p><span>The best way to discover this is to become a user of the platform itself. For Instagram, go to the Explore tab and type in some of your key terms, maybe the same ones you use for search or maybe some terms that mirror the interest or behavior targeting you’re using for your campaigns. </span></p>
<p><span>See what the grid looks like. What shows u</span><span>p? What brands are there? How are they marketing to people? While you may not want to become just part of the noise, blending in allows you to make a greater impact and feel more natural to the audience. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ad-grid.jpg" alt="facebook video ads - example of instagram explore grid" width="296" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-78390 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ad-grid.jpg 296w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ad-grid-148x300.jpg 148w" sizes="(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px" /><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ads-instagram-grid.jpg" alt="facebook video ads - instagram grid example" width="297" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-78391 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ads-instagram-grid.jpg 297w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ads-instagram-grid-149x300.jpg 149w" sizes="(max-width: 297px) 100vw, 297px" /></p>
<p><span>For example, I have a renewed interest in landscape photography and am in the market for a new camera. If I were a camera brand (or someone selling camera-adjacent things), either of the two grids above could help give an idea of what my ads can/should look like to blend into the platform. Then, make sure you follow the other best practices above to get your message across.</span></p>

<h3><span>5. Retarget users who engage with your videos</span></h3>
<p><span>I might be biased, but one of the biggest mistakes I think advertisers make is not<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/retargeting-ad-ideas" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> retargeting people</a> who watch their Facebook videos. Sure, they might find their way to seeing you again through prospecting or they may remember you enough to come back to your site, but why would you target people (who you seemingly thought were valuable) once, then not work to target them again? Especially after they are already aware of you?</span></p>
<p><span>On the Facebook ads platform, you can make audiences of users who have engaged with your videos in many different ways. Just head to the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/13/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Facebook ads audience manager</a> and choose Video as your source for an audience.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ads-audiences.jpg" alt="facebook video ads - video audience source screenshot " width="721" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-78389 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ads-audiences.jpg 721w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ads-audiences-480x399.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 721px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span>From there, you can choose how they have interacted with those videos. Did they watch the whole thing? A certain percentage of it? Think about where your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">value propositions</a> and messaging hits in those videos and be sure to include that in your audience filters.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ads-engagement-audience.jpg" alt="facebook video ads - video engagement audience" width="901" height="505" class="aligncenter wp-image-78392 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ads-engagement-audience.jpg 901w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ads-engagement-audience-480x269.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 901px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span>Next, you can choose the videos you want to retarget people from. Yes, you can select only certain videos if you think they’re more impactful, part of a separate campaign, etc.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ads-people-who-watched.jpg" alt="facebook video ads - audience engagement options" width="900" height="207" class="aligncenter wp-image-78388 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ads-people-who-watched.jpg 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ads-people-who-watched-480x110.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span>Lastly, you can choose how long you want to reengage with someone who watched those videos for that amount of time. One error I see is always setting the time frame to the longest possible setting. Now be honest…if you saw a video ad once 180 days ago, do you think you’re still a hot prospect for that brand? Probably not. Make sure you keep that in mind when making these audiences. Higher engagers can likely stick around longer, but lower engagers probably should be let free from your retargeting grasp a bit sooner. </span></p>

<div id="facebook-video-ad-tools"></div>
<h2><span>Helpful Facebook video ad tools</span></h2>
<p><span>Now that we have some best practices out of the way, I want to talk about how to make the Facebook video ad creatives. Not every Facebook video ad has to be done by a hugely expensive creative shop. Some can be done just as well with your own means, and sometimes for free! Here are some of the top <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/24/design-facebook-ads-free" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook video ad creative resources</a> your business can take advantage of:</span></p>
<h3><span>Yes, phone cameras are acceptable</span></h3>
<p><span>A big expensive camera only makes world-changing videos when there’s an amazing photographer or videographer behind the lens. For most people, a camera phone will do just fine. In many cases, they’ll do better than if you tried to use an expensive camera due to all the ways the tech companies are making them easier to use.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ads-iphone-specifications.jpg" alt="facebook video ads - apple ios facebook video compatibility " width="718" height="373" class="aligncenter wp-image-78383 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ads-iphone-specifications.jpg 718w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ads-iphone-specifications-480x249.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 718px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span>Next time you need to put together a video, take a shot with your phone first. Many times, those videos will turn out great, and will help fit you into the platform aesthetic naturally as much of the content on Facebook and Instagram is also shot on a phone.  </span></p>
<h3><span>Facebook’s cropping tool</span></h3>
<p><span>Once you have a video, there are options in Facebook ads to adjust your creatives for different sizes.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ad-aspect-ratio.jpg" alt="facebook video ad - cropping in facebook video ads using facebook's cropping tool" width="713" height="562" class="aligncenter wp-image-78385 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ad-aspect-ratio.jpg 713w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ad-aspect-ratio-480x378.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 713px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span>In the image above, you can see we have a square video that needs cropped to vertical. Granted, this would be a terrible user experience, but if your video does lend itself to this easy cropping, there is an option directly within Facebook to do that for you. </span></p>
<h3><span>Facebook video builder</span></h3>
<p><span>If you don’t already have any creatives and you need to build something almost from scratch, Facebook also has a video creation tool you can use to put together videos. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ad-builder.jpg" alt="facebook video ads - facebook video ad builder" width="783" height="528" class="aligncenter wp-image-78396 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ad-builder.jpg 783w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ad-builder-480x324.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 783px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span>You can use existing images combined with Facebook’s video ad templates to make a video for your account. There are tons of templates that allow you to control for colors, text, timing, and more. Just lead on the user-friendly builder and you’ll end up with a platform-ready Facebook video ad in no time!</span></p>
<h3><span>Canva</span></h3>
<p><span>While there are some paid in-platform upgrades, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-use-canva/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canva</a> is a great tool to get just about any type of creative made (video or otherwise).</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ads-canva.jpg" alt="facebook video ads - canva video ad templates" width="823" height="435" class="aligncenter wp-image-78384 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ads-canva.jpg 823w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebook-video-ads-canva-480x254.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 823px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span>There are countless free templates you can customize to help promote your brand. Canva also includes easy options to convert one theme into a new aspect ratio, helping you to cover all the video sizes as I mentioned above. In short, if you’re a novice to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/video-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video marketing</a> but need to get something done, you should check Canva out. </span></p>

<p>In this article, I&#8217;ll share everything you need to know about YouTube thumbnails, including tools to create them, tips to keep in mind, and other lessons I&#8217;ve learned from running my own YouTube channel.</p>

<h2>What is a YouTube thumbnail?</h2>
<p>A YouTube thumbnail serves as a visual snapshot of what a video contains. It appears as a small image next to the title of the video on YouTube&#8217;s search results page, related videos section, or the recommended videos section.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/youtube-thumbnail-examples.webp" alt="youtube thumbnail examples on youtube results page" width="848" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-78366" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/youtube-thumbnail-examples.webp 848w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/youtube-thumbnail-examples-480x339.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 848px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This image plays a crucial role in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-promote-your-youtube-channel">attracting potential viewers</a> and encouraging them to click on the video. The design and content of this thumbnail often influence the decision of a viewer to watch the video or not.

<p>The best YouTube thumbnail size is 1280&#215;720 pixels. This is an aspect ratio of 16:9. The minimum width you should shoot for is 640 pixels.</p>
<p>You should also shoot for a relatively small file size—under 2MB. YouTube thumbnails can be saved as JPGs, GIFs, or PNGs.</p>
<div id="youtube-thumbnail-tips"></div>
<h2>YouTube thumbnail tips</h2>
<p>Your YouTube journey begins with a single image—the thumbnail. This seemingly small, but critically important element is the initial gateway for your viewers.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;If people don&#8217;t click, they don&#8217;t watch. So, you want to give them something to click,&#8221; </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vxwUT9Ujkg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> YouTube star MrBeast.</p>
<p>Here are some tips to create <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/youtube-thumbnail-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">effective YouTube thumbnails</a>.</p>
<h3>Make them engaging</h3>
<p>Think of your thumbnails as digital hooks to capture your audience&#8217;s attention. Make them visually striking, vibrant, and engaging.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f495.png" alt="💕" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Want more tips and ideas? We&#8217;ve got 130+ for you!

<h3>Be consistent</h3>
<p>Building a recognizable brand on YouTube starts with consistency in your thumbnail design. A uniform style helps viewers easily identify your content. In addition to consistency in your thumbnail design, keeping a close eye on others in your field who share your audience is a smart strategy.</p>
<p>Checking out <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/21/competitive-analysis-templates">what your competitors are up to</a> can give you helpful clues about how many people click on their stuff. This helps you see how your channel&#8217;s look, content, titles, and colors stack up, so you can ensure you&#8217;re putting your best foot forward.</p>
<p>As you can see below, MrBeast&#8217;s thumbnails are visually striking and attention-grabbing, featuring bold colors, expressive facial expressions, and compelling imagery. He maintains a consistent style in his thumbnails, making them instantly recognizable to his viewers and helping build a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/17/increase-online-presence">strong brand presence</a> on YouTube.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/youtube-thumbnail-mrbest-examples.webp" alt="youtube thumbnail examples from mrbeast youtube channel " width="446" height="596" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-78367" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/youtube-thumbnail-mrbest-examples.webp 446w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/youtube-thumbnail-mrbest-examples-224x300.webp 224w" sizes="(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px" /></p>
<h3>Represent your video accurately</h3>
<p>Your thumbnail should provide an honest representation of your video. Misleading thumbnails can lead to viewer frustration and backlash.</p>
<h3>Create an emotional impact</h3>
<p>It’s well known that emotions are contagious. This means that watching someone else have an emotional reaction to something can cause you to have the same reaction.</p>
<p>Humans react to other human faces, and it&#8217;s an easy trick to get more people to click on your YouTube videos. Humans will naturally assess the emotional state of the face. When their mouth is open, it&#8217;s usually to show that they are surprised. When someone sees this surprised reaction, they are enticed to see what is so surprising.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Speaking of emotion&#8230;get our free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite120WordsforMarketingWithEmotion.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_120WordsPhrases_Download">135 of the Best Words &amp; Phrases for Marketing with Emotion</a></p>
<h3>Learn and adapt</h3>
<p>Continuously analyze your analytics to adapt your content and strategy based on audience feedback and changing trends.</p>
<p>The thumbnail below was my first to go well (in relation to my other videos). The simple title in the thumbnail, the upward arrow, society&#8217;s current fascination with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/06/how-to-use-chatgpt-for-small-business-marketing">ChatGPT</a>, the length of the video, me in it—smiling and wearing something that matched the color scheme of the thumbnail. These are things I took note of as potential drivers of success for future videos and thumbnails.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/The-2023-State-of-Social-Media.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">96%</a> of business leaders agree that companies that want to be successful must continue to invest in social media. So the question here isn’t really <em>if</em> you should have a strong social game but <em>which</em> platforms give you the most bang for your buck?</p>
<p>And that’s where the whole TikTok vs. YouTube debate stems from—both platforms can help businesses connect with audiences, drive purchases, and build a sense of community through video.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-vs-youtube.webp" alt="tiktok vs youtube logos" width="936" height="553" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77151" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-vs-youtube.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-vs-youtube-480x284.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But what’s unique about both platforms is they’re also used as search engines by users. In fact, <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo/meet-search-engines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube is the second-largest search engine</a>. And for Gen Z, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/16/technology/gen-z-tiktok-search-engine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok is Google</a>.</p>
<p>Whether you create tailored content for these platforms to grow organically, partner with influencers, or run ads to drive sales, both YouTube and TikTok have a lot to offer.</p>

<h2>TikTok vs. YouTube: Background</h2>
<p>YouTube and TikTok are titans in the realm of video-sharing platforms.</p>
<p>Originating in 2005, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/03/how-to-advertise-on-youtube">YouTube</a>, now under Google&#8217;s umbrella since its 2006 acquisition, has firmly established itself as a platform for diverse content, from vlogs to tutorials, and allows users to upload, comment on, and share videos.</p>

<p>On the flip side, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/20/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok">TikTok</a>, a relatively newer sensation, has taken the world by storm with its short, engaging clips and virality potential.

<div id="pros-of-youtube"></div>
<h2>Pros of YouTube</h2>
<p>YouTube stands as a digital titan in the realm of video content, paving ways for content businesses to diversify, engage, and monetize their work. But in this grand platform arena, how does YouTube compare with the rising star, TikTok?</p>
<h3>A wide range of content types</h3>
<p>Both YouTube and TikTok offer an expansive array of content types, catering to different audience preferences.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://databox.com/popular-youtube-video-types" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey from Databox</a> shows the 15 most popular video types include education videos, explainer videos, product demos, and product reviews.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-channel-content-types.webp" alt="types of content shared on youtube" width="936" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77138" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-channel-content-types.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-channel-content-types-480x241.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://databox.com/popular-youtube-video-types" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>On TikTok, dance videos and quick tutorials reign supreme, capturing the essence of fleeting moments and trends. Meanwhile, YouTube offers a broader spectrum, from casual vlogs to professional business workshops.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/youtube-seo">breadth of content on YouTube</a> is staggering—whether it&#8217;s an intricate cooking tutorial, a comedic skit, or an in-depth tech review, the platform has it all. This diversity speaks to the versatility it provides to businesses, ensuring that there&#8217;s something for every viewer.</p>
<h3>Long-form content possibilities</h3>
<p>YouTube has long been the sanctuary for brands looking to dive deep. Its platform effortlessly accommodates 30-minute intense workouts, 2-hour in-depth podcasts, and everything in between.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpV63fceRgY&amp;ab_channel=YouTubeAdvertisers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cassey Ho</a>, through her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIJwWYOfsCfz6PjxbONYXSg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blogilates</a> channel, exemplifies this perfectly. For Cassey, her videos provide not just a 20- to 30-minute exercise session but also a chance to forge deeper connections.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-blogilates-channel.webp" alt="youtube pros - blogilates channel youtube thumbnail example" width="936" height="550" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77139" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-blogilates-channel.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-blogilates-channel-480x282.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIJwWYOfsCfz6PjxbONYXSg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>But recognizing the emerging trend of bite-sized content, YouTube also introduced <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-make-youtube-shorts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube Shorts</a>, a feature allowing users to craft 15-60 second videos like TikTok.</p>
<h3>Established and popular platform</h3>
<p>As veterans in the digital space, both YouTube and TikTok have cemented their places as popular platforms. YouTube boasts over <a href="https://www.demandsage.com/youtube-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2.7 billion</a> active monthly users, an impressive figure that underscores its dominance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-monthly-active-users.webp" alt="monthly active users on youtube" width="936" height="516" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77140" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-monthly-active-users.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-monthly-active-users-480x265.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.demandsage.com/youtube-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>TikTok, though newer, has quickly amassed more than <a href="https://www.demandsage.com/tiktok-user-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.1 billion</a> monthly active users, driven by its captivating, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/28/user-generated-content">user-generated content</a>. Features like an easy user interface, a wide variety of content, and personalized recommendations have contributed to the monumental success of both platforms.</p>
<h3>Target audience options</h3>
<p>Understanding and catering to the right audience is crucial for content success. YouTube, with its vast expanse, appeals to a broad audience, from curious kids and trend-following teens to information-seeking adults and seniors.</p>
<p>The introduction of YouTube Shorts further solidifies its appeal to the younger crowd. In contrast, TikTok predominantly resonates with the younger generation, offering businesses a concentrated demographic to target.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1287137/youtube-global-users-age-gender-distribution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Statista</a>, the 18-24 (15%) and 25-34 (20.7%) age ranges account for most of YouTube’s demographic.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-user-demographics.webp" alt="youtube user demographics" width="889" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77141" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-user-demographics.webp 889w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-user-demographics-480x323.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 889px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1287137/youtube-global-users-age-gender-distribution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<h3>High user engagement rates</h3>
<p>Engagement is the currency of the digital realm.</p>
<p>Both TikTok and YouTube have cultivated ecosystems where user engagement rates soar. Engaging content not only retains viewers but positively influences algorithm rankings and content recommendations. (Check out these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/10/youtube-seo-tips">Simple YouTube SEO Tips to Rank Your Videos Higher in Search</a>)</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/tiktok-algorithm">TikTok&#8217;s algorithm</a> thrives on virality, ensuring users are constantly engaged with trending videos, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/15/youtube-algorithm">YouTube&#8217;s algorithm</a> focuses on user behavior, pushing content that aligns with individual preferences.</p>
<h3>Ability to monetize content</h3>
<p>YouTube offers a well-defined path to monetization, with options ranging from ad revenue to affiliate marketing and brand promotions. And a <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-154/marketing-strategies/video/youtube-challenges-tv-advertising-roi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study from Google</a> showed that YouTube beat TV in ad ROI in 77% of studies.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-pros-higher-roi-than-tv.webp" alt="youtube benefits - higher roi than tv" width="936" height="490" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77142" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-pros-higher-roi-than-tv.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-pros-higher-roi-than-tv-480x251.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>TikTok, while not offering direct monetization options akin to YouTube&#8217;s AdSense, still presents opportunities. Popular brands on TikTok can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/22/tiktok-ads">drive sales through ads</a>, brand partnerships, and influencer marketing endeavors.</p>
<div id="pros-of-tiktok"></div>
<h2>Pros of TikTok</h2>
<p>TikTok predominantly captivates the younger demographic with its snappy content and virality-driven features. From offering a buffet of bite-sized videos to being the epicenter of trending challenges, TikTok has reshaped how content is created and consumed.</p>
<p>Here’s a dive into what makes TikTok a standout platform.</p>
<h3>Bite-sized content possibilities</h3>
<p>TikTok and YouTube both offer avenues for bite-sized content, with TikTok specifically sculpted around short-form videos. This bite-sized format is what helped <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en/inspiration/prism-plus-sg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PRISM+</a>, a Singaporean electronics brand, leverage TikTok to engage Gen Z tech enthusiasts. Their TikTok strategy resulted in over 16.5K followers and a 58.6% sales boost during their 12.12 Sale in 2022.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-vs-youtube-youtube-examples.webp" alt="tiktok vs youtube - example of tiktok posts from business" width="936" height="545" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77143" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-vs-youtube-youtube-examples.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-vs-youtube-youtube-examples-480x279.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.warriorforum.com/social-media/1471828-study-tiktok-dominating-short-form-content.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>Their TikTok Shop venture and interactive live streams also contributed to significant growth and a plan to expand to markets like Malaysia.</p>
<h3>Ideal platform for viral trends</h3>
<p>TikTok stands as a colossal hub for viral trends and challenges. Its algorithm, coupled with fierce user engagement, fosters an environment where content can achieve virality overnight.</p>
<p>From trending dances to quirky challenges, TikTok has become synonymous with internet trends that have transcended to other platforms like YouTube and Instagram.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-pros-shopping-options.webp" alt="tiktok trend report homepage" width="936" height="364" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77144" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-pros-shopping-options.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-pros-shopping-options-480x187.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>

<p><a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/trends/hub/pc/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok’s Creative Center</a> explains new trends and publishes trends reports for businesses who want to better navigate the platform.</p>
<h3>TikTok shopping options</h3>
<p>TikTok Shop offers a personalized commerce platform where sellers can authentically engage with communities and creators to drive meaningful shopping experiences. Brands can seamlessly blend entertainment and commerce, gain trust via TikTok creators showcasing their products, and benefit from in-app touchpoints like LIVE shopping and shoppable videos.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-pros-shopping-ads-options.webp" alt="tiktok vs youtube - tiktok pros - shopping ads examples" width="936" height="524" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77145" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-pros-shopping-ads-options.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-pros-shopping-ads-options-480x269.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://shop.tiktok.com/business/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>The platform offers frictionless checkout, scalable support tools, and partnership opportunities, leading to tangible sales results as evidenced by case studies of multiple sellers experiencing significant growth. Importantly, according to TikTok, <a href="https://shop.tiktok.com/business/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70%</a> of TikTok users discover new brands on the platform, and 3 in 4 users are inclined to make a purchase.</p>
<h3>Highly engaged user base</h3>
<p>Both TikTok and YouTube boast a deeply engaged user base, each with unique demographic leanings.</p>
<p>But while YouTube recently introduced &#8220;YouTube Shorts&#8221; to cater to short-form content preference, it cannot compete with TikTok. Compared to YouTube Shorts, which has an average engagement rate of about 3.80%, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/16/tiktok-vs-instagram-reels-ads">Reels</a>, with an average engagement of <a href="https://www.socialinsider.io/blog/tiktok-vs-reels-vs-shorts/#1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4.36%</a>, TikTok boasts a notably higher engagement level.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-vs-reels.webp" alt="tiktok vs instagram reels engagement rate" width="484" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77146" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-vs-reels.webp 484w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-vs-reels-480x594.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 484px, 100vw" /></p>

<div id="how-to-choose-between-tiktok-vs-youtube"></div>
<h2>How to choose between TikTok vs. YouTube</h2>
<p>YouTube, with its vast expanse of diverse audiences, offers brands unparalleled reach. Meanwhile, TikTok&#8217;s virality potential can catapult a brand into overnight fame. Advertising on these platforms is not just an option; it&#8217;s a strategic imperative.</p>
<p>The best option isn’t TikTok vs. YouTube but rather TikTok and YouTube. You can create content on YouTube that can be repurposed for both TikTok and YouTube Shorts. And you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/tiktok-ads-bidding">run ads</a> on both platforms to reach the widest audience for your business.</p>
<p>It’s a win-win!</p>

<h2>What is the YouTube algorithm?</h2>
<p>The YouTube algorithm is a recommendation system that decides which videos to suggest to a particular viewer. The algorithm’s job is to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/09/google-ranking-factors">rank content</a> based on the likelihood that a viewer will watch it using signals like relevance, quality, and user behavior.</p>
<h3>It’s the gatekeeper to video views</h3>
<p>Want more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/how-to-get-more-views-on-youtube">video views</a>? The recommendation algorithm holds the key. A recent experiment showed the algorithm directly drives <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/09/20/1059709/youtube-algorithm-recommendations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70%</a> of the views on YouTube.</p>
<p>In fact, YouTube’s computer code seems to override even user controls. Meaning, if you hit the <em>Dislike</em> or <em>Not interested</em> button on a video, the algorithm may still suggest similar content. That’s why it’s so important to understand how it works.</p>

<h3>The algorithm is constantly evolving</h3>
<p>The YouTube algorithm is an ever-moving target. Just when you’ve got it figured out, there’s an <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/technology/youtube-changed-the-algorithm-for-kids-content-drawing-questions-1.893644" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update that completely reorders</a> recommendations and search results.</p>
<p>It might seem like chaos, but there’s a method to the media magnate’s madness. It gets a bit clearer when you see the three eras of the algorithm’s evolution.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/youtube-algorithm-evolution.webp" alt="YouTube algorithm - Timeline of the algorithms evolution" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76007" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/youtube-algorithm-evolution.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/youtube-algorithm-evolution-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2005 to 2011,</strong> <strong>cheap clicks do the trick:</strong> The algorithm recommends whichever videos get the most clicks. Creators game the system with clickbait titles and misleading thumbnails.</li>
<li><strong>2012, it’s all about timing:</strong> To surface videos people actually watch instead of the old click-and-run, <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-now-why-we-focus-on-watch-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube retooled the algorithm</a> to prioritize watchtime and percent-of-video completion. The shift encouraged some to create long-form video content and others to put out short snippets, but it did not solve the quality problem.</li>
<li><strong>2015, getting personal:</strong> In 2015, YouTube<a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/pubs/archive/45530.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> published a very sciency looking paper</a> that describes a new way of suggesting content. Instead of using overall popularity, the algorithm takes personal preferences (based on direct feedback and previous behavior) into account when it recommends videos.</li>
<li><strong>2016, protecting the platform:</strong> Content moderation takes center stage as YouTube moves to moderate harmful misinformation. Creators now have to be aware of <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9288567?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">community guidelines</a> or risk being relegated to the no-show list.</li>
</ul>
<p>The history of YouTube’s algorithm is a forward march toward hosting quality content that keeps people on the platform. Let&#8217;s look at how YouTube’s algorithm does that today.</p>
<div id="how"></div>
<h2>How does the YouTube algorithm work in 2025?</h2>
<p>If you only take one thing away from this article, it should be that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67TkpHKv9tE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube wants</a> you to <strong>focus on your audience, not the algorithm</strong>.</p>
<p>“Our algorithm doesn&#8217;t pay attention to videos, it pays attention to viewers. So, rather than trying to make videos that&#8217;ll make an algorithm happy, focus on making videos that make your viewers happy,” says <a href="https://www.youtube.com/intl/en_ca/creators/how-things-work/content-creation-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube’s own explanation</a> of how to reach your audience.</p>
<p>It’s an important distinction if you read our little history lesson. The algorithm isn’t simply recommending based on popularity. It’s more about the likelihood that an<em> individual user</em> will watch the next video, and the next.</p>
<p>That’s why two viewers can end up with different results when conducting the same search.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-cricket.jpg" alt="YouTube algorithm - two results for the word Cricket in Youtube" width="591" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-75975 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-cricket.jpg 591w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-cricket-480x487.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 591px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/intl/ALL_ca/howyoutubeworks/product-features/search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>There are three factors that affect how the algorithm matches viewers to the videos they can’t resist watching:</p>
<ol>
<li>Content characteristics</li>
<li>The recommendation location</li>
<li>External factors</li>
</ol>
<p>Get these figured out and you’ll know how to play the algorithm like a well-tuned instrument.</p>
<h3>Content characteristics</h3>
<p>First off, forget the notion that YouTube watches videos and picks its favorites. The algorithm can’t do that. Instead, it looks for signals that tell it the content is a match for the viewer.</p>
<h4>Relevance signals</h4>
<p>Say you search for a tutorial on <em>how to bake a coconut cake</em>. YouTube quickly finds content that matches your query.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-search-coconutcake.jpg" alt="YouTube algorithm - screenshot of Youtube results" width="774" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-75976 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-search-coconutcake.jpg 774w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-search-coconutcake-480x372.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 774px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If the algorithm isn’t grabbing a bowl of virtual popcorn and watching millions of videos, how does it know what to show? It relies on metadata in the titles, tags, and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/youtube-channel-description-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">descriptions</a>.</p>
<h4>Performance signals</h4>
<p>The algorithm isn’t a critic, but it does get clues on what good content is from video metrics. The metrics YouTube uses to assess good content include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How long do people watch?</strong> How long is the average video view and what percent of the video does the average viewer watch?</li>
<li><strong>How often is a video watched?</strong> How many times is a video viewed when it’s recommended?</li>
<li><strong>Did people like the video?</strong> What’s the engagement rate, number of likes vs. dislikes, and average survey rating of a video?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Personal preference signals</h4>
<p>Since YouTube’s algorithm is geared to show each viewer their ideal mix of content, it partly relies on each user’s behavior to surface videos.</p>
<p>To curate your mix, YouTube considers which videos you’ve watched and liked (or disliked) and which topics or channels you keep coming back to.</p>
<p>It also links videos people tend to watch together. If people click on “how to make macaroons” after viewing coconut cake content, you’ll probably see that in your recommendation list.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-recommended-1.jpg" alt="YouTube algorithm - screenshot of a youtube video with recommendations" width="936" height="479" class="aligncenter wp-image-76009 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-recommended-1.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-recommended-1-480x246.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Creator signals</h4>
<p>YouTube’s algorithm wants to make sure it’s not recommending dangerous or untrustworthy content. One way it does that is by reviewing the channel it came from. If the channel shows signs of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/12/domain-authority">topical authority</a> and trustworthiness, then YouTube is more likely to recommend its content.</p>
<h3>Recommendation location</h3>
<p>We usually refer to the YouTube algorithm, singular. In reality, there are three places recommendations happen, and each has a slightly different set of criteria for surfacing content.</p>
<h4>The homepage</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/01/homepage-design">homepage</a> is what you see when you first get to the YouTube website or app. Here, the algorithm is trying to get you to start watching something without knowing your current mood.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-home.jpg" alt="YouTube algorithm - the youtube homepage" width="936" height="498" class="aligncenter wp-image-75978 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-home.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-home-480x255.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The recommendations on the home screen are based on performance factors along with your previous watch and search history.</p>
<h4>Suggested videos</h4>
<p>Suggested videos show up next to the video you’re watching.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-tiktok-2.jpg" alt="YouTube algorithm - video of a golfer" width="927" height="517" class="aligncenter wp-image-75979 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-tiktok-2.jpg 927w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-tiktok-2-480x268.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 927px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Now the algorithm has a little more context for what you’re in the mood for. It’ll use the topic of the current video along with your watch history to make its suggestions. It’ll also reference videos that were commonly watched after this one.</p>
<h4>YouTube search results</h4>
<p>It seems straightforward that in a search, you’re telling YouTube what you want to watch. But as we’ve seen, everyone’s results are a little different.</p>
<p>Search for “bat” and see what happens.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-bat.jpg" alt="YouTube algorithm - YouTube search results for word bats" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-75980 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-bat.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-bat-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You might get baseball videos. Don’t like sports? Expect some flying mammal content.</p>
<p>In this case, YouTube’s algorithm is balancing your behavior with relevancy signals in the titles and descriptions of the videos.</p>
<h3>External factors</h3>
<p>While you have a lot of control over how YouTube ranks your content (and we’ll show you how), there are some factors you just can’t control.</p>
<p>For example, YouTube suffers from seasonal dips in engagement like every social media platform. If your views drop in December, don’t take it personally. Or maybe consider creating some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/28/christmas-holiday-greetings-wishes">seasonally specific content</a>.</p>
<p>You also can’t control the competition. Your best pasta recipe content will struggle to compete if Gordon Ramsay, Jamie Oliver, and Laura Vitale all dedicate a series to pasta.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-pesto.jpg" alt="YouTube algorithm - YouTube results for word pesto" width="704" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-75981 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-pesto.jpg 704w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-pesto-480x409.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 704px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>One last factor you can’t control is <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/04/unique-blog-ideas">topic</a> interest. Viewers are fickle, and some topics drop out of favor in a flash (sorry, NFT content creators). Spoiler alert: you can spot the trends and ride their wave if you know where to look. Stay tuned to learn how.</p>
<h3>Not factors</h3>
<p>There are two things that don’t affect your content’s discoverability, even though they’re often suspected of doing so.</p>
<p>First, the algorithm doesn’t know how or if you’re <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72857?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monetizing your videos</a>. You won’t get a boost or a penalty if you’re getting <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/youtube-advertising-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ad revenue</a> or are a part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3NlQiF_yOY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shopping affiliate program</a>.</p>
<p>Second, your publication frequency doesn’t directly affect your individual video views. <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/11914225?visit_id=638303149772262248-1900141170&amp;p=video_discovery_tips&amp;rd=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube states</a> that in their tests, there’s no correlation between the time between uploads and an increase in views.</p>

<h2>14 ways to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">hack</span> work with the YouTube algorithm</h2>
<p>We would never recommend trying to game the YouTube algorithm (please don’t <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-a-shadow-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shadow ban</a> us). After all, Google is really good at sniffing out cheat codes and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/black-hat-seo">blackhat tactics</a>.</p>
<p>That said, there are ways you can make it easier for the algorithm to surface your content and share it with more people (and use them for other <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-algorithm">social media algorithms</a>). Think of it as a partnership instead of a competition.</p>
<h3>1. Use SEO keywords</h3>
<p>In some ways, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/10/youtube-seo-tips">YouTube SEO</a> operates like its cousin, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/19/google-search-generative-experience">Google Search</a> (YouTube is owned by Google, ya know). People type words into the search bar and the algorithm looks for content related to those words.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-chair.jpg" alt="YouTube algorithm - Youtube results for word chair" width="796" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-75982 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-chair.jpg 796w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-chair-480x362.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 796px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>To grab the top spot on results pages, do your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/14/youtube-keyword-research">YouTube keyword research</a>. Then place keywords in the filename, title, description, and subtitle script.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f50e.png" alt="🔎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Want more help finding the right keywords?</strong> Try our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">free keyword research tool</a>!</p>
<h3>2. Add subtitles and closed captions to your video</h3>
<p>Subtitles and closed captions help people understand your videos when they can’t, or choose not to, hear the audio.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-outdoor.jpg" alt="YouTube algorithm - screenshot of video with subtitles" width="936" height="537" class="aligncenter wp-image-75983 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-outdoor.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-outdoor-480x275.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The files that contain your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/12/video-scripts">video scripts</a> also help search engines understand your content. That’s because the text in those files looks sort of like a blog post to search engines, so it tells them what a video is about.</p>
<h3>3. Use Google Trends to find popular topics</h3>
<p>Remember when we said you can’t control what topics are popular? It’s true. But you can know what’s popular and plan content around it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-trends">Google Trends</a> is an easy and free way to learn what people look for and when they look for it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-metrics-1.jpg" alt="YouTube algorithm - Graph of popularity of search term mulch" width="936" height="531" class="aligncenter wp-image-75984 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-metrics-1.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-metrics-1-480x272.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>With a little work on Google Trends, you’ll know that April is the best time to post and promote mulch videos to your audience of lawn care enthusiasts.</p>
<h3>4. Make irresistible thumbnails</h3>
<p>You need video clicks to impress the YouTube algorithm. But there’s over <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/27/youtube-statistics">500 hours</a> of content uploaded to YouTube every day! That’s a crowded space to stand out in.</p>
<p>Your best tool in the fight for attention on YouTube is the thumbnail. Check out YouTube superstar Mr. Beast’s thumbnail collection.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-mrbeast-1.jpg" alt="YouTube algorithm - Mr Beast's home page on youtube" width="936" height="511" class="aligncenter wp-image-75985 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-mrbeast-1.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-mrbeast-1-480x262.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>5. Hook viewers with great intros</h3>
<p>If people immediately click away from your videos, YouTube will take it as a signal that your content isn’t worth sharing. To keep viewers around, make sure you have an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/09/08/how-to-write-an-introduction">introduction</a> that hooks people immediately.</p>
<p>That doesn’t necessarily mean making your intro big and flashy. What’s really important is that the first few seconds tell the viewer that the video will live up to the title and thumbnail.</p>
<p>Crash Course is an educational video channel that does this well.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-bat-2.jpg" alt="YouTube algorithm - screenshot of science video" width="909" height="599" class="aligncenter wp-image-75986 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-bat-2.jpg 909w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-bat-2-480x316.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 909px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Click on one of their videos, and you’ll know right away that the content is high-quality and that they’ll answer the question posed in the title.</p>
<p>You can use the same tactics in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/28/youtube-channel-trailer">YouTube channel trailer</a>.</p>
<h3>6. Add cards and end screens</h3>
<p>To keep people binging your content, and upping your cred with the algorithm, include both a card and a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/13/call-to-action-examples">CTA</a> in each video.</p>
<p>A card is a clickable image that leads to other videos in your library.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-cards.jpg" alt="YouTube algorithm - screenshot showing card on video" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-75987 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-cards.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-cards-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Think of them like internal links on a webpage. Place a card whenever you mention something that’s related to another video you’ve posted.</p>
<p>An end screen, AKA end card or outro, is usually a static image shown for the final seconds of a video.</p>

<p>End screens are a great place to add a call to action (CTA) and video links.</p>

<h3>7. Add subscription watermarks</h3>
<p>We know the algorithm likes to suggest content from trustworthy channels. One way to show that your channel fits the bill is to get more subscribers.</p>
<p>The best time to ask someone to become a subscriber is to ask them while they’re enjoying your content. Do it by adding a subscription watermark to your videos.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-ford-e1694798382329.jpg" alt="YouTube algorithm - screenshot of a video with a subscriber button" width="927" height="519" class="aligncenter wp-image-75989 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-ford-e1694798382329.jpg 927w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-ford-e1694798382329-480x270.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 927px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>These little clickable buttons are easy to miss, so point them out during the video and let people know what they get as a subscriber.</p>
<h3>8. Create series and playlists</h3>
<p>We all have a need to know what comes next. Tap into it by publishing several videos on the same topic. Then organize them into playlists.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-playlist.jpg" alt="YouTube algorithm - playlist of videos" width="572" height="599" class="aligncenter wp-image-75990 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-playlist.jpg 572w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-playlist-480x503.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 572px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The entire playlist of videos shows up on the side screen, pushing out other suggestions from the algorithm (nice!). Plus, playlist videos play one after the other without a pause, so the viewer doesn’t have to lift a finger to keep watching.</p>
<h3>9. Cross-promote your content</h3>
<p>You don’t have to wait for the algorithm’s suggestion to get new viewers. You can find people outside of YouTube who would love your content by <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/22/cross-channel-marketing">cross-promoting</a> it on other platforms.</p>
<p>For example, try posting a preview of your long-form video on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/23/tiktok-marketing">TikTok</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-tiktok.jpg" alt="YouTube algorithm - TikTok video screenshot" width="324" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-75991 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-tiktok.jpg 324w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-tiktok-162x300.jpg 162w" sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/23/tiktok-ads-targeting">TikTok’s becoming a marketer’s dream</a> channel. And since it’s all about video, it’s a natural place to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-promote-your-youtube-channel">promote your YouTube content</a>.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to also share it on Instagram and embed it in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/13/content-creation">blog posts</a>.</p>
<h3>10. Creep on your competitors</h3>
<p>You can learn loads about the algorithm by watching what works for other creators in your space.</p>
<p>The simplest way to conduct <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/01/competitor-keyword-analysis">competitor research</a> is by typing your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/youtube-seo">SEO keywords</a> into the search bar. Then snoop on their:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thumbnails</li>
<li>Keywords</li>
<li>Subtopics</li>
<li>Video length</li>
<li>Titles and descriptions</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you see the trends, you can adjust your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/20/youtube-marketing">YouTube strategy</a>.</p>
<h3>11. Add timestamps</h3>
<p>Timestamps help people navigate your videos. They let viewers skip ahead or return to the content that’s most important to them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-timestamps-1.jpg" alt="YouTube algorithm - screenshot of a video with timestamps" width="774" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-75992 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-timestamps-1.jpg 774w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-timestamps-1-480x372.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 774px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Since user experience is the driving motivator for YouTube’s algorithm, helping people get the most out of your videos with time stamps should be a priority.</p>
<h3>12. Nix the clickbait</h3>
<p>Tricking people into clicking on your YouTube content is so 2005. If you try it, you’ll not only annoy potential subscribers, but your videos will have a harder chance of ranking. Plus, being fake can put you at risk of losing your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-get-verified-on-youtube/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube verification</a>.</p>
<p>It can be a little confusing. You want to get people to click. What’s the difference between content that stands out and underhanded tactics?</p>
<p>The line between attention-grabbing and click-baiting is defined by honesty. Be honest in your titles and thumbnails so that when people click, they get what they expected.</p>
<h3>13. Post at the best time</h3>
<p>We know the algorithm doesn’t care if you hit publish at 9 a.m. on Tuesday or 2 p.m. on Saturday. But if you post when your audience is online, you could get a little early boost in engagement. If the algorithm sees it, it could expand the reach of your video.</p>
<p>So when’s the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/08/best-time-to-post-on-youtube">best time to post on YouTube</a>? It’s complicated.</p>
<p>First, there is some research that says weekday afternoons and weekend mornings are best.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-time-e1694798495824.png" alt="YouTube algorithm - chart showing best times to post on youtube" width="936" height="290" class="aligncenter wp-image-75993 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-time-e1694798495824.png 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-time-e1694798495824-480x270.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But it really comes down to your audience and goals. You’ll need to test and track different times and see which works best for you.</p>
<h3>14. Get analytical</h3>
<p>YouTube wants you to win. So much so that they give you a bunch of data to help you be a better <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/08/content-creator">content creator</a>—conveniently located in your creator’s dashboard.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-graph.jpg" alt="YouTube algorithm - YouTube analytics graph" width="936" height="359" class="aligncenter wp-image-75994 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-graph.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/YouTube-algorithm-example-graph-480x184.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There’s a lot of data to parse through. Here are a few of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/03/underrated-youtube-metrics">YouTube metrics</a> that’ll help you get noticed and shared by the YouTube algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Videos growing your audience:</strong> Tells you which of your videos are attracting the most new viewers.</li>
<li><strong>Channels your audience watches:</strong> Tells you which channels, besides your own, people that watch your videos also watch.</li>
<li><strong>Key moments for audience attention:</strong> Tells you which parts of your videos had the lowest drop-off rate and which were rewatched.</li>
</ul>
<div id="FAQs"></div>
<h2>YouTube algorithm FAQs</h2>
<p>We’ve covered a lot, but there are still a few questions to answer about the YouTube algorithm.</p>
<h3>Is the YouTube Shorts algorithm different?</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-make-youtube-shorts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube Shorts</a> are YouTube’s short-form video answer to TikTik and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/22/instagram-reels-ideas-for-businesses">Instagram Reels</a>. The suggestion algorithm for YouTube Shorts works exactly the same way as it does for other YouTube content. So make sure those 15-second vertical videos are relevant and high-quality.</p>
<h3>How does YouTube count views in 2025?</h3>
<p>YouTube keeps its video count formula under wraps. But the two conditions that likely constitute a video view are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A video play is initiated by a viewer from a verified IP address</li>
<li>The video is played for 30 seconds or more</li>
</ul>
<h3>How often should you post on YouTube?</h3>
<p>YouTube says that video recommendations aren’t affected by the time between your uploads. But posting new content consistently will keep viewers coming back for more and give you extra swings at sharing a viral video. Ideally, you should post at least once per week. Balance that with your interests; if you get burnt out, your content will suffer and the algorithm won’t suggest it anyway.</p>
<h2>Know the YouTube algorithm for more video views</h2>
<p>Does trying to keep up with the YouTube algorithm take the joy out of content creation? Try to remember that it wants the same thing you do, more people watching more videos. Then the algorithm becomes a partner, not a barrier, to your success.</p>
<p>With that in mind, remember these 14 ways to get your videos recommended more often on YouTube:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use SEO keywords</li>
<li>Add subtitles and closed captions</li>
<li>Use Google trends</li>
<li>Make irresistible thumbnails</li>
<li>Hook viewers with great intros</li>
<li>Add cards and end screens</li>
<li>Add subscription watermarks</li>
<li>Create series and playlists</li>
<li>Cross-promote your content</li>
<li>Creep on your competitors</li>
<li>Add timestamps</li>
<li>Nix the clickbait</li>
<li>Post at the best time</li>
<li>Get analytical</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I hate to break it to anyone with a satellite dish hanging off their roof right now, but gone are the days of cable TV.</p>
<p>Now, don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love relaxing on the couch to binge-watch my favorite shows and movies as much as the next person. Luckily, that enriching activity won&#8217;t be out of the picture anytime soon. However, <em>how</em> we do that is what&#8217;s changing. <a href="https://home.admanager.hulu.com/insights/how-small-businesses-can-create-impactful-streaming-tv-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6 out of 10</a> adults in the US now stream content through major streaming service subscription platforms like Hulu, Netflix, Peacock, Max by HBO, Showtime, Disney+, and more. In fact, people are watching twice as many hours of content each day via a streaming service as they do via live television. So, while old-school television might become a blast from the past, streaming is here to stay.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/streaming-tv-stat.jpg" alt="stat that states people watch twice as much content via streaming than they do via tv" width="936" height="357" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75829" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/streaming-tv-stat.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/streaming-tv-stat-480x183.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Of course, this transition to on-demand content opens tons of new opportunities for you to advertise your business. With Hulu being the<a href="https://tinuiti.com/blog/ott-over-the-top-ads/hulu-advertising-ott/#:~:text=OTT%20advertising%20is%20advertising%20delivered,streaming%20services%20today%20is%20Hulu." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> top</a> ad-supported streaming platform in the US, it&#8217;s a natural fit for anyone looking to start out in streamed advertising. However, unlike more established online advertising platforms such as Google Ads or Meta Ads, Hulu launched its advertising platform only a few years back in 2020 and it&#8217;s still in beta. So, if you have questions about how to get started with Hulu advertising, that&#8217;s more than understandable—which is why we&#8217;re breaking down everything you need to know to set your Hulu ads up for success!</p>

<div id="what"></div>
<h2>What is Hulu advertising?</h2>
<p>Before you get to know Hulu advertising, you’ll want to first be familiar with Hulu as a platform. Hulu is a streaming app that allows its subscribers to watch movies and TV shows on demand. You can stream Hulu on virtually any device, such as mobile phones, gaming consoles, tablets, or smart or connected TVs (CTV).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/marketing-channels-ott-advertising-infographic.jpg" alt="hulu advertising - ott advertising chart" width="829" height="533" class="aligncenter wp-image-73296 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/marketing-channels-ott-advertising-infographic.jpg 829w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/marketing-channels-ott-advertising-infographic-480x309.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 829px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Hulu ads are a type of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/09/what-ott-advertising" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over-the-top (OTT) advertising</a> that includes non-skippable video ads that are shown before, during, and after streamed content on Hulu.</p>
<div id="works"></div>
<h2>How does Hulu advertising work?</h2>
<p>All Hulu ads are purchased via the Hulu Ad Manager—which, again, is still in beta. However, it can be helpful to know that Hulu is owned by Disney, so you may have heard of businesses buying Hulu ads through Disney Ad Manager. Disney Ad Manager and Hulu Ad Manager are one and the same. You can sign up for the <a href="https://home.admanager.hulu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hulu Ad Manager</a> beta and either choose to pay for ads that solely show on Hulu, or also show ads on other Disney-owned streaming platforms, like Disney+, as well.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hulu-advertising-disney-ad-manager.jpg" alt="hulu advertising - disney ad manager definition" width="758" height="336" class="aligncenter wp-image-75772 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hulu-advertising-disney-ad-manager.jpg 758w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hulu-advertising-disney-ad-manager-480x213.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 758px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll walk through how to get started with Hulu advertising in a bit.</p>
<h3>Who can advertise on Hulu?</h3>
<p>Since Hulu is only currently available in the US, any US-based business can advertise on Hulu.</p>
<h3>How much does Hulu advertising cost?</h3>
<p>Hulu requires a minimum spend of $500 per campaign. Of course, how much you put behind your total Hulu advertising costs is dependent on what’s feasible for your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing budget</a> and objectives. That said, it’s been found that your typical Hulu video ad costs anywhere from <a href="https://saaspartners.io/how-much-does-it-cost-to-advertise-on-hulu/#:~:text=The%20cost%20of%20advertising%20on,Hulu%20is%20a%20great%20option.">$10 to $30</a> per one thousand impressions.</p>
<div id="types"></div>
<h2>Types of Hulu ads</h2>
<p>All Hulu ads are video-based and between 15 to 30 seconds long. However, there are a few different types of Hulu ad placements advertisers can choose from that serve different purposes. Some, like the branded slate and cover story brand placement ads, are more suited for enterprises or entertainment corporations that partner with Hulu and Disney.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hulu-advertising-enterprise-ads.jpg" alt="hulu advertising - enterprise level ads from hulu" width="900" height="433" class="aligncenter wp-image-75780 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hulu-advertising-enterprise-ads.jpg 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hulu-advertising-enterprise-ads-480x231.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Others can be a fit for small businesses starting out with Hulu advertising, like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ad selector ads:</strong> With ad selector ads, you provide two to three ads, and this gives your viewers the option to choose which ad from your business they’d prefer to view.</li>
<li><strong>Binge ads: </strong>Binge ads are similar to typical Hulu video ads, but instead of showing before or after a streaming selection, they’re shown throughout a binge session of three or more episodes streamed in a row.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hulu-advertising-ad-selector-binge-ads.jpg" alt="hulu advertising - ad selector and binge ad examples" width="900" height="637" class="aligncenter wp-image-75785 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hulu-advertising-ad-selector-binge-ads.jpg 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hulu-advertising-ad-selector-binge-ads-480x340.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interactive ads:</strong> These Hulu ads could be a video or more of a still-frame image, but the differentiator here is that they prompt users to click off to <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLiQContentDLHowToMakeGreatLandingPages.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_LandingPages_HowToMakeGreatLandingPagesGuide_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your business’s landing page</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pause ads: </strong>Pause ads overlay the pause screen of a show or movie (pro tip: pause ads can be a great way to implement<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/qr-code-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> QR code marketing</a>).</li>

<li>With <a href="https://home.admanager.hulu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">112 million</a> monthly US viewers, Hulu is the <a href="https://tinuiti.com/blog/ott-over-the-top-ads/hulu-advertising-ott/#:~:text=OTT%20advertising%20is%20advertising%20delivered,streaming%20services%20today%20is%20Hulu." target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading</a> ad-supported TV streaming service.</li>
<li>Hulu’s ad selector feature has proven to be <a href="https://designloud.com/7-tips-advertising-hulu-streaming-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">150%</a> more effective than regular TV ads at developing recall and 24% better at creating viewer <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/01/26/intent-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">purchasing intent</a>.</li>
<li>Hulu ads are nearly <a href="https://designloud.com/7-tips-advertising-hulu-streaming-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">200%</a> more effective in creating top-of-mind awareness when compared to other ad formats.</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of this, it’s important to reiterate that Hulu’s unique ad selector feature allows your audience to <em>choose to view your ad</em>—resulting in a viewership that&#8217;s eager to learn more about your business. Plus, its ability to allow advertisers to target via a combination of program genre, audience interest, and zip code is something other emerging platforms, like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/23/tiktok-ads-targeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok Ads</a>, don’t necessarily have yet.</p>

<h2>3 quick Hulu advertising tips</h2>
<p>Now that you’re ready to take advantage of all that this<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/26/marketing-channels" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> marketing channel</a> has to offer, here are some Hulu advertising tips to keep in mind.</p>
<h3>1. Follow video creative best practices</h3>
<p>To increase your chances of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/23/google-ads-disapprovals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting your ads approved</a>, you’ll of course want to abide by all the technical requirements and specifications Hulu outlines for its ads.</p>
<p>For example, all Hulu ads should be between 15 and 30 seconds long and come in the form of a .mov or .mp4 file. Additionally, your ad file size can’t exceed 10 GB.</p>
<p>You can find a complete outline of <a href="https://home.admanager.hulu.com/tech-specs-for-video-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">technical specs from Hulu here</a>, but aside from what’s required, there are some recommended creative best practices for your Hulu ads as well:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get your point across quickly. </strong>Since you won’t have a lot of time to convey your message to your audience, you’ll want to ensure that the main points of your ads shine through in both the imagery and the script.</li>
<li><strong>Keep your branding consistent.</strong> You’ll want your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-make-your-business-stand-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business to stand out</a> as your audience is watching your Hulu advertising. For example, including your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-logo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small business logo</a> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/12/color-psychology-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand colors </a>across all your video frames can help reinforce your brand. In fact, Hulu found that the top-performing 15-second ads were also <a href="https://home.admanager.hulu.com/insights/how-small-businesses-can-create-impactful-streaming-tv-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 times</a> more likely to include branding throughout the ad.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Regularly measure your Hulu ad performance</h3>
<p>With at least $500 on the line, you don’t want to just set and forget your Hulu ads. Luckily, Hulu makes it easy to track performance right from within the Hulu Ad Manager. Simply log in and, on the ad manager homepage, you’ll get a breakdown of all your campaigns.</p>
<p>To help keep track of your success, be sure to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/15/marketing-objectives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set measurable goals </a>to track your campaigns against. You’ll likely want to benchmark your progress along the way. You could even refer to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/15/google-ads-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">industry benchmarks</a> of other top ad platforms to see how your Hulu ads compare to channels like Google Ads.</p>

					<div class='et-box-content'>Use our<a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteGoogleAdsBenchmarks2023.html?cid=Web_WS_incontent_guide_2023benchmarks_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> latest Google Ads benchmarks report</a> to see how your Hulu ad costs compare to average PPC costs in your industry.</div></div>
<h3>3. Frequently upload fresh ads</h3>
<p>We can all probably recall a commercial we’ve sadly seen far too many times. Hulu subscribers tend to stream on the platform in large chunks—which means it&#8217;s more likely that your audience could see your ad multiple times. The last thing you want to do is overtire your audience with a repetitive ad!</p>
<p>Avoid this by refreshing and reuploading your ads regularly. However, it&#8217;s a best practice to let any sort of marketing campaign run for at least a month before you judge its efficacy. So, instead of stressing to refresh your ads weekly, try revisiting them monthly or quarterly. That way, you can make data-backed decisions on how you might want to tweak them.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re short on ideas to keep your ads fresh, try leaning into seasonal themes. For example, you could use a <a href="https://localiq.com/resources/2023-marketing-calendar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing calendar</a> (like the one below from our friends at LocaliQ) to pre-plan your Hulu ad video content. That way, you&#8217;re always prepared to change up your ad as needed.</p>
