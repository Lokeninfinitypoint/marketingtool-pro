										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you thinking of expanding your Google Ads strategy beyond search? One of the most common campaign types to explore next would be an image-based campaign: Google Discovery or Display.</p>
<p>I’ve noticed a lot of confusion among business owners and practitioners alike around what’s the same and what’s different between Display and Discovery ads, and when it makes sense to use them. They are definitely not interchangeable!</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/google-ads-display-vs-discovery-campaigns.png" alt="google ads display vs discovery campaigns" width="720" height="390" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70535" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/google-ads-display-vs-discovery-campaigns.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/google-ads-display-vs-discovery-campaigns-480x260.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In this ultimate guide to Google Discovery ads vs. Display, we’ll compare these two Google Ads campaign types with regard to:</p>

</ul>
<p>Read on to get everything you need to know before adding these ad types to your paid media strategy.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Google announced Discovery Ads will be upgraded to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/22/demand-gen-campaigns">Demand Gen campaigns</a> in early 2024. We cover what you need to know <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/22/demand-gen-campaigns">here</a>.</em></p>
<div id="appearance"></div>
<h2>Google Discovery ads vs. Display: Appearance</h2>
<p>Google Ads Display and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/17/discovery-ads">Discovery campaigns</a> are both image-based formats. To create a Responsive Display ad, a Discovery ad, or a Discovery carousel ad, you provide headlines, descriptions, and images, which Google then adapts to various ad placements—much like a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/05/responsive-search-ad-copy">Responsive Search Ad</a>.</p>
<p>Here are five subtle ways that Discovery ads differ from Display ads in their appearance:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Text specs:</strong> Discovery ad headlines can have up to 40 characters whereas Display ad headlines can have up to 30 characters (like search ads). Why? Who knows! But Google’s own Discovery ad best practices suggest “medium length headlines” work best, so don’t feel like you have to use up all those extra characters.</li>
<li><strong>Image specs:</strong> While Display and Discovery ads both accept square (1:1) and landscape (1.91:1) images, Discovery campaigns also accept portrait (4:5) images. This is because Discovery campaigns were designed to accommodate <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/21/how-to-compete-in-facebook-ads">Meta Ads</a> assets. A common way for Google Ads advertisers to get started with Discovery campaigns is to take your existing ad creative from your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/13/facebook-advertising-tips">top-performing Facebook and Instagram ads</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Video specs:</strong> You have the option to add<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/13/video-ad-tools"> video assets</a> to your Display ads, and Google announced all the way back at <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/24/google-marketing-live">Google Marketing Live 2022</a> that this feature is coming to Discovery, too—but as of this writing, video assets are not yet compatible with Discovery ads.</li>
<li><strong>Shopping feed:</strong> One of the most common uses of Display campaigns is running <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/17/dynamic-remarketing-for-retail">dynamic remarketing</a>; that is, connecting your Google Merchant Center feed to your Display campaign, and allowing the system to customize the ad creative based on previous user behavior on your website. Discovery campaigns recently launched a beta program that allows advertisers to connect a feed as well, though the campaign will work towards both <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/26/prospecting-strategies-ppc-agencies">prospecting</a> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/17/retargeting-campaign-tips">remarketing</a> using the feed data, not just dynamic remarketing.
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/dynamic-remarketing.png" alt="dynamic remarketing" width="720" height="259" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70532" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/dynamic-remarketing.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/dynamic-remarketing-480x173.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /><a href="https://faq.businesstech.fr/en/faq/225-whats-the-difference-between-classic-remarketing-and-dynamic-remarketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
</li>
<li><strong>Ad format:</strong> In another nod to Meta, Discovery campaigns give you the option of creating a Discovery carousel ad, featuring multiple images, headlines, and links within the same ad unit. Display campaigns do not offer Carousel ads.</li>
</ol>

<div id="placement"></div>
<h2>Display vs. Discovery ads: Placements</h2>
<p>A key difference between <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/23/google-display-ads">Google Ads Display campaigns</a> and Discovery campaigns is that Display campaigns show ads across the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/16/google-display-network-mistakes">Google Display Network</a>, whereas Discovery campaigns show ads on Google-owned properties.</p>
<p>The Google Display Network is a collection of millions of websites and apps that monetize using Google AdSense. This is analogous to the Microsoft Audience Network, LinkedIn Audience Network, or Facebook Audience Network. Some examples of where your Display ads can show are websites like ebay.com, forbes.com, or tmz.com; apps like MyFitnessPal, TextNow, or Wordle; and YouTube. Yes, YouTube is part of the Google Display Network!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/how-to-use-google-ads-search-vs-display-network.png" alt="how to use google ads - search network vs display network" width="617" height="449" class="aligncenter wp-image-62316" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/how-to-use-google-ads-search-vs-display-network-980x713.png 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/how-to-use-google-ads-search-vs-display-network-480x349.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In contrast, Discovery campaigns can only show up in three places: YouTube, Gmail, and the Discover feed. Since these three places are all Google-owned and serve mostly signed-in users, I find <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/21/google-ads-audience-targeting-cheat-sheet">audience targeting</a> to be more accurate in Discovery campaigns vs. Display and traffic quality to be higher.</p>
<p>Note that there is no placement report in a Discovery campaign, so you won’t know exactly where your ads showed, whereas Display campaigns do provide a detailed “Where ads showed” report.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/display-placement-report.jpg" alt="google display ads report showing where ads showed" width="760" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72588" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/display-placement-report.jpg 760w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/display-placement-report-480x379.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 760px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="targeting"></div>
<h2>Google Discovery ads vs. Display: Targeting</h2>
<p>Google Display campaigns offer the full range of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/21/google-ads-audience-targeting-cheat-sheet">Google’s audience and content targeting solutions</a>. You can go as broad or as narrow as you like!</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Google recently announced a change to how content targeting works; if you add Placements, Topics, and/or Keywords to your Display campaign content targeting, Google Ads will treat those as “OR” options rather than “AND.” For example, if you add five Topics and five Keywords to your ad group, your Display ad can now serve on any of those five topics OR any of those five keywords.</p>
<p>Note that audience targeting has always had an “OR” relationship. If you add multiple audiences to your ad group targeting, Google Ads will show your ads to <em>any</em> of those audiences. To create an “AND” relationship between audiences, you must create a Combined segment.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/google-ads-audience-targeting-cheat-sheet.png" alt="google ads audience targeting cheat sheet" width="720" height="538" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-64681" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/google-ads-audience-targeting-cheat-sheet.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/google-ads-audience-targeting-cheat-sheet-480x359.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Google Discovery campaigns do not accept content targeting; only audience targeting. Your options are still quite vast: Demographics, affinity, in-market, life events, your data segments, custom segments, and combined segments.</p>
<p>And of course, you will be opted into <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/22/google-ads-optimized-targeting">optimized targeting</a> by default for both campaign types, which you can turn off in your audience settings if you’d like.</p>
<div id="performance"></div>
<h2>Display vs. Discovery ads: Performance</h2>
<p>For those who are used to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/19/ppc-metrics">PPC metrics</a> for search and Shopping campaigns, navigating the performance of image-based formats can be a little tricky.</p>
<p>You’re familiar with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/14/improve-google-ads-click-through-rate">click-through rate</a> (CTR) and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/cpc">cost per click</a> (CPC) as key performance metrics, but are you familiar with interaction rate or cost per engagement?</p>
<h4>Interactions</h4>
<p>In Google Ads, a “click” is a paid click <em>to your website</em>. When someone clicks on a search ad or a Display ad, they land on your website and you pay Google for that click.</p>
<p>An “interaction,” however, is <em>any paid click</em> in Google Ads, even if that click does <em>not</em> bring the user to your website. For example, if someone clicks on a Gmail ad, that “opens” the email— it does NOT bring the user to your website. The user would have to read the email and then, if they choose, click the call-to-action button to get to your website.</p>
<p>Because of this, a Gmail open is an “interaction,” but not a “click.” Gmail is one of the three Discovery placements, so you’ll want to check your interactions, interaction rate, and cost per interaction as well as your clicks, click-through rate, and cost-per-click.</p>
<h4>Engagements</h4>
<p>And then there are “engagements” when the user completes a <em>valuable action</em> that is neither a click nor an interaction. For example, watching 10 seconds of your video counts as an engagement, but remember, you don’t pay until someone watches at least 30 seconds of your video, or to the end of the video, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>Similarly, if someone forwards your Gmail ad to a friend, that’s an engagement. If they “like” your Discovery ad, that’s an engagement. While I don’t generally look at the engagement, engagement rate, and cost per engagement columns, they can be helpful to check for troubleshooting purposes.</p>
<h3>How can I improve the performance of my Display and Discovery campaign?</h3>
<p>While Display campaigns and Discovery campaigns both have the usual performance levers—<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/17/google-ads-bid-management">bid strategy</a>, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/14/google-ads-budgeting-strategies">budget</a>, targeting, campaign settings, etc.—the most important indicator of success is your <em>ad creative</em>.</p>
<p>This is a sentiment that will be very familiar to those who run <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/07/facebook-vs-tiktok-ads">Meta ads or TikTok ads</a>, for example, but can be trickier for Google Ads practitioners—we’re used to text-based formats!</p>
<p>Google conducted its own quantitative research on exactly what kind of text and image assets perform best in a Discovery campaign. Since Discovery is included as part of Performance Max, these best practices are also applicable to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/23/optimize-performance-max-campaigns">your Performance Max campaigns</a>.</p>
<p>Five highlights of this research are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Images should focus on a single object, centrally framed.</li>
<li>Images show real humans in real-life contexts using your products/services.</li>
<li>No overlaid text on images, or keep overlaid text minimal.</li>
<li>Headlines and descriptions should be “medium length,” be specific and include a call to action.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/03/ad-copy-examples">Ad copy</a> that highlights special offers works well, time pressure/FOMO does not.</li>
</ol>

<div id="choose"></div>
<h2>Display vs. Discovery ads: When to use which</h2>
<p>Unsure when it would be best to use Discovery ads vs. Display ads? Let&#8217;s explore.</p>
<h4>When should I use Discovery campaigns?</h4>
<p>Google Ads Discovery campaigns can only be used with conversion-based Smart Bidding strategies: Maximize Conversions (with optional target CPA) or Maximize Conversion Value (with optional<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/02/target-roas"> target ROAS</a>).</p>
<p>Due to their “bottom of funnel” optimization capabilities, high-quality traffic, and high-quality audience matching, I usually recommend testing Discovery campaigns before Display campaigns. Anecdotally, I’ve noticed that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/07/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead-google-ads">cost per click tends to be higher</a> in Discovery vs. Display, but I’ve also observed <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/03/improve-conversion-rates">higher conversion rates</a> and higher lead quality, so it’s worth it.</p>
<p>If you’d like to use Discovery campaigns on an awareness objective, you can “cheat the system” by creating a conversion action based on page views. This will essentially turn your Maximize Conversions bid strategy into a Maximize Clicks bid strategy.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/automated-bidding-strategies-goals.png" alt="best automated bidding strategies for different goals" width="542" height="478" class="aligncenter wp-image-69299" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/automated-bidding-strategies-goals.png 542w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/automated-bidding-strategies-goals-480x423.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 542px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>When should I use Display ads?</h4>
<p>Google Ads Display campaigns have more broad applications, as they can be used with impression-, click- or conversion-based bid strategies. Because of this, Display campaigns can fit any campaign objective:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Top of funnel:</strong> Viewable CPM</li>
<li><strong>Middle of funnel:</strong> Manual CPC (with optional enhanced CPC), Maximize Clicks</li>
<li><strong>Bottom of funnel:</strong> Maximize Conversions (with optional target CPA) or Maximize Conversion Value (with optional target ROAS)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people prefer to go with Display campaigns because they offer a unique feature: Pay per conversion bidding. While there are <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7528254?hl=en#:~:text=You%20can%20choose%20to%20pay,accounts%20that%20meet%20our%20requirements." target="_blank" rel="noopener">plenty of limitations and rules</a> around if and how you can use pay-per-conversion bidding, this is something that performance advertisers may want to experiment with if you’re skeptical about whether Display campaigns are the right fit for your conversion objectives.</p>
<h2>Google Discovery ads vs. Display ads: Which will you start with?</h2>
<p>So, there you have it! We&#8217;ve taken an in-depth look at the similarities, differences, and options for Discovery vs. Display campaigns. Hopefully, this shines some light on which campaign type is best for you&#8211;and when to use it.</p>

<h2>What are display ads?</h2>
<p>Display ads are visual-based ads you see while reading an article on your favorite blog, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/29/youtube-display-ads">watching a video on YouTube</a>, or using a mobile app.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/google-display-advertising-example.jpg" alt="google display advertising example - mailchimp display ad" width="720" height="135" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63264" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/google-display-advertising-example.jpg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/google-display-advertising-example-480x90.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /><br />
<a id="what"></a></p>
<h2>What is a <em>Google</em> display ad?</h2>
<p>Appropriately, Google display ads are served on websites and apps that belong to the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/18/google-display-network-tips">Google Display Network</a> (GDN)—but there are other display ad networks out there.</p>
<p>The Google Display Network consists of over two million websites and apps that reach somewhere in the ballpark of 90% of internet users. Such an immense potential for reach is the definition of a double-edged sword: True, you have the power to introduce your brand to tons of relevant consumers. But you’re also liable to introduce your brand to tons of irrelevant consumers.</p>
<p>In other words, display ads can cost you money and even your reputation if you’re not careful. We’ll talk about the steps you can take to avoid waste later in this post.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/how-to-use-google-ads-search-vs-display-network.png" alt="how to use google ads - search network vs display network" width="730" height="531" class="aligncenter wp-image-62316" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/how-to-use-google-ads-search-vs-display-network-980x713.png 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/how-to-use-google-ads-search-vs-display-network-480x349.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, 100vw" /><br />
<a id="benefits"></a></p>
<h2>The importance of display advertising</h2>
<p>At first glance, it can be hard to understand why a business would want to <a href="https://localiq.com/products/display-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run display ads</a>. Its performance pales in comparison to search ads.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/search-vs-display-ad-ctr-cvr.png" alt="search vs display ad ctr and cvr" width="554" height="394" class="aligncenter wp-image-63265" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/search-vs-display-ad-ctr-cvr.png 554w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/search-vs-display-ad-ctr-cvr-480x341.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 554px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>People are served display ads while they’re consuming content—not while they’re actively looking for solutions as with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/paid-search">search advertising</a>. So why bother with display ads?</p>
<h3>Differentiate your brand</h3>
<p>Because you and your competitors are going after the same prospects, you have to find ways to separate your business from the pack. Thanks to the power of visual imagery, display ads give you the opportunity to establish (and distinguish) <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/08/brand-story">your brand</a> in your prospects’ minds.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-display-ad-example-branding.png" alt="google display ad example for a trek bike" width="720" height="388" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63273" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-display-ad-example-branding.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-display-ad-example-branding-480x259.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Build brand awareness</h3>
<p>Granting you such widespread exposure, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/06/12/biggest-benefit-google-display-ads">greatest benefit of display advertising</a> is brand awareness. As Larry Kim put it, “The single biggest predictor of whether people will purchase is whether they’ve heard of you before.” It&#8217;s no wonder that <a href="https://surveysparrow.com/blog/monitor-brand-awareness-using-surveys/">84%</a> of B2B marketers say brand awareness is their most important goal, followed by sales and lead generation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-display-ads-brand-awareness-stats.png" alt="google display ads - stat showing brand awareness is a top priority for b2b" width="600" height="462" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63279" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-display-ads-brand-awareness-stats.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-display-ads-brand-awareness-stats-480x370.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Improve the performance of your other ads</h3>
<p>And why might you want to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">improve your brand awareness</a>? Well, to the point above, the more familiar people are with your brand, the more likely they are to click on and engage with all of your other marketing campaigns—search and social ads included. As mentioned in the intro, studies have shown that 27% of consumers conduct a search for a business after seeing their display ad, and there’s a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/benefits-of-display-advertising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">59%</a> lift in conversion when users conducted a search related to a display ad.<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/22/how-display-impacts-search"></a></p>
<p>In fact, there&#8217;s a metric dedicated to conversions assisted by display ads:<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/14/view-through-conversions"> view-through conversions</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/view-through-conversion-vs-direct-conversion.png" alt="view-through conversion vs direct conversion" width="714" height="332" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50278" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/view-through-conversion-vs-direct-conversion.png 714w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/view-through-conversion-vs-direct-conversion-480x223.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 714px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There are other <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/22/how-display-impacts-search">ways to measure the impact of your display ads</a> as well.</p>
<h3>Skyrocket results with retargeting</h3>
<p>Most prospects don&#8217;t become customers right away. Even if they click on your ad, they’ll most likely leave your website without taking any action. With retargeting display ads, you target people based on how they&#8217;ve interacted with your website.</p>
<p>For example, you could target a user who viewed a product but didn&#8217;t purchase it with a display ad on that very product. Creepy? A little. Effective? Very. Take a look at these <a href="https://blog.wishpond.com/post/97225536354/infographic-7-incredible-retargeting-ad-stats">remarketing stats</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In one study, retargeting display ads increased a business’s brand-related search queries by 1,046%. and site traffic by 726%.</li>
<li>The average click-through rate for retargeting display ads is 0.7%, which is 10 times higher than that of regular display ads .07%).</li>
<li>A website visitor who’s been retargeted with a display ad is 70% more likely to convert.</li>
</ul>
<p><a id="types"></a></p>
<h2>Google display ad sizes &amp; formats</h2>
<p>There are two types of Google display ads: uploaded and responsive.</p>
<h3>Uploaded display ads</h3>
<p>If you have the design resources to create your own display ads from scratch, then by all means—take the uploaded route. Google Display ads support JPG, PNG, and GIF. But keep in mind that even if you qualify for a particular placement, your ad won’t be shown if it doesn’t meet the size specifications for that placement. So it&#8217;s up to you to optimize your exposure by uploading different sized versions of each ad.<a href="https://fluidads.com/article/best-banner-ad-sizes-in-2020/"></a></p>
<h3>Responsive display ads</h3>
<p>Because that’s not the most fun activity, Google introduced responsive display ads and then eventually made it the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/24/responsive-vs-legacy-display">default ad type for display campaigns</a>. Simply provide your visual assets (images, logo, videos) and some basic <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/03/14/ppc-ad-copywriting">ad copy</a>. From there, Google will test different combinations to determine which versions perform well. Best of all, responsive display ads automatically adjust in size to meet the requirements of specific web pages.</p>
<h2>Google display ad sizes</h2>
<p>If you’re planning on running only responsive display ads, you can go ahead and skip to the next section. But if you’d like to maintain control over your ads and you plan on taking the uploaded route, these are the 12 common <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7031480?hl=en">display ad sizes</a> you’ll need to accommodate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile: 300×200, 300×50, 300×100</li>
<li>Desktop: 300×250, 336×280, 728×90, 300×600, 160×600, 970×90, 468×60</li>
<li>Both: 250×250, 200×200</li>
</ul>

<a id="costs"></a></p>
<h2>Google display ad costs</h2>
<p>Like the Google search network, the Google display network runs on a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/articles/what-is-google-adwords">live auction system</a>. When you’re eligible for a given ad unit—according to your targeting parameters—you’re entered into an instantaneous auction with the other eligible advertisers. Google determines your ad position and cost per click based on your Ad Rank, which it calculates using your maximum CPC bid and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/quality-score">Quality Score</a>.</p>
<p>Often, your actual cost per click is lower than your maximum CPC bid. When all is said and done, you pay the minimum amount of money required to outrank the advertiser in the position directly below yours.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/29/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks">WordStream data</a>, the average CPC on the Google display network is $0.63. For comparison, the average CPC on the search network is $2.69—more than four times greater. That’s because search network clicks are generally more valuable, as we discussed earlier.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-ads-display-vs-search-cpc.png" alt="google ads display vs search ad cost per click" width="720" height="513" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63283" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-ads-display-vs-search-cpc.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-ads-display-vs-search-cpc-480x342.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /><br />
<a id="targeting"></a></p>
<h2>Google display ad targeting</h2>
<p>The key to efficiently spending your display ad budget is layering your targeting parameters to yield the most relevant impressions and clicks possible. There are five main groups of targeting, and they fall into two categories: people targeting and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/29/contextual-display-advertising">contextual</a> (topic/content) targeting.</p>
<h3>Contextual targeting</h3>
<p>With contextual display ad targeting, you have three options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Topic:</strong> Serve your ads on sites that fall under particular topics. For example, if you’re advertising an upcoming music festival, you can target topics like “music” and “live entertainment.”</li>
<li><strong>Keyword:</strong> Serve your ads on sites related to particular keywords.</li>
<li><strong>Placement:</strong> Target specific webpages, videos, or apps. You can learn more about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/07/google-display-network-placements">display ad placements here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>People targeting</h3>
<p>With people targeting, you have two options, but audience targeting opens up a whole other can of worms, which we&#8217;ll get into next.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographic:</strong> Serve your ads according to age, gender, and parental status.</li>
<li><strong>Audience:</strong> Serve your ads based on interests and behaviors.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-display-ad-targeting-options.png" alt="google display ad targeting options" width="720" height="244" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63293" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-display-ad-targeting-options.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-display-ad-targeting-options-480x163.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Google display ad audience targeting</h4>
<p>Here are the many options available to you for audience targeting with Google display ads.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Affinity audiences: </strong>people who share a common interest, such as sports, travel, or food.</li>
<li>I<strong>n-market audiences: </strong>people who are actively looking to buy a particular product or service.</li>
<li><strong>Remarketing audiences: </strong>people who have interacted with your business in some way, such as by visiting your website—a great way to reengage prospects.</li>
<li><strong>Custom audiences:</strong> mix and match to create your own <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/19/google-custom-audiences">custom audiences</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-display-ads-custom-audiences.jpg" alt="google display ads custom audiences" width="700" height="531" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63288" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-display-ads-custom-audiences.jpg 700w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-display-ads-custom-audiences-480x364.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Excluded audiences: </strong>Google Ads allows you to exclude specific topics as well so you can your brand away from irrelevant or inappropriate content. If you were advertising super deluxe ice cream or dessert products, for example, you might exclude websites involving weight loss or healthy eating (at best, you’d be seen as irrelevant; at worst, just cruel).</li>
</ul>
<p><a id="setup"></a></p>
<h2>How to set up a Google display ad campaign</h2>
<p>To create a Google display campaign, navigate to your Google Ads account and click “New campaign.” When asked for your campaign objective, choose “Create a campaign without a goal’s guidance” and then choose “Display.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/how-to-create-google-display-ad.png" alt="how to create google display ad - display ad option" width="720" height="513" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63284" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/how-to-create-google-display-ad.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/how-to-create-google-display-ad-480x342.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>

<h2>5 Google display ad best practices</h2>
<p>Alrighty then! Now that we’ve covered all the technical details of display advertising, let’s talk about some of the best practices you can implement to maximize your returns.</p>
<h3>1. Tap into your top-performing search keywords</h3>
<p>If you want to try keyword targeting, start with your top-performing search keywords. The definition of “top-performing” is up to you, of course, but if there’s a handful of keywords that tend to drive low-cost clicks or conversions on the search network, why not give them a shot on the display network?</p>
<p>True—consumer intent on these two <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/09/google-ads-networks">Google Ads networks</a> is completely different. But insofar as clicks and conversions indicate that your search ads are resonating, you can feel confident that the keywords behind them are winners.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-display-ads-keyword-targeting.png" alt="google display ads keyword targeting" width="720" height="702" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63290" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-display-ads-keyword-targeting.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-display-ads-keyword-targeting-480x468.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>2. Use bid adjustments</h3>
<p>After running your display campaigns for a while, you’ll have enough data to make informed performance judgments—which keywords are doing well, which affinity audiences are doing poorly, and so on. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/adwords-bid-management">Bid adjustments</a>—which you can set at either the ad group or campaign level—allow you to turn those performance judgments into strategy.</p>
<p>When you set a positive bid adjustment on a given ad group, you tell Google Ads to increase your maximum CPC bid whenever one of the ads in that ad group is eligible to show. When you set a negative bid adjustment, you tell Google Ads to decrease your maximum CPC bids for that ad group.</p>
<p>Plain and simple, using bid adjustments is a terrific way to boost your gains from top performers and cut your losses from poor performers.</p>
<h3>3. Look at your referral traffic</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/05/15/google-analytics-tips">Google Analytics</a> is full of useful information. For display advertisers, the referral traffic report (which lives under Acquisition &gt; All Traffic) is incredibly valuable. Basically, the referral traffic report tells you which websites are linking to yours the most. Put differently, it tells you which websites cater to people that could benefit from your product or service.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-display-ads-analytics-referral-report.png" alt="google-display-ads-analytics-left-navigation-menu" width="216" height="412" /></p>
<p>These websites make for the perfect places to serve your display ads. Because you know you’re advertising to relevant audiences, you can feel confident that you’re driving returns on those impressions and clicks.</p>
<h3>4. Emphasize your value proposition</h3>
<p>Consumers are beyond accustomed to display ads at this point, so your prospects can easily scroll past your ads without even noticing them. To avoid wasting opportunities—as well as money if you’re bidding on a cost per thousand impressions (CPM) basis—it’s crucial that your display ads grab your prospects’ attention.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-display-ads-value-proposition-example.png" alt="google display ads - example of an ad with a solid value proposition" width="720" height="356" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63291" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-display-ads-value-proposition-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-display-ads-value-proposition-example-480x237.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Royal Canin offers a good example of a strong value proposition with &#8220;Support their health at every stage.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Obviously, the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/30/design-principles">visual aesthetics of your display ads</a>—color scheme, typography, etc.—play a huge part in this. What’s less obvious is the part your value proposition plays. Your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">value proposition </a>is the benefit someone will enjoy upon becoming your customer. If you’re advertising a pair of men’s boots, for example, your value proposition might be the enhanced confidence one feels when he looks good.</p>
<p>No matter what your value proposition is, make it jump off the page.</p>
<h3>5. Focus on headlines when writing responsive display ads</h3>
<p>When <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/23/responsive-display-ads">creating a responsive display ad</a>, you’ll be prompted to write four pieces of copy:</p>
<ul>
<li>A short headline (25 characters)</li>
<li>A long headline (90 characters)</li>
<li>A description (90 characters)</li>
<li>Your business name (25 characters)</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding headlines, there are two key things you need to know: (1) Google Ads will never run both at the same time; (2) Google Ads will sometimes exclude your description. Regardless of which headline is selected for a particular iteration of your RDA, there’s no guarantee it’ll be accompanied by your description.</p>
<p>The takeaway: Make sure your headlines are enough on their own. Both should communicate the unique value of your business or the offer you’re making.</p>

<h3>Use video</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bannerflow.com/blog/display-advertising-trends-2021-key-stats-and-insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bannerflow</a>, display ads with video achieve an 89% higher click-through rate. And creating a video display ad is easier than you think. It doesn&#8217;t have to even be a recorded video. Some basic text animation and movement, or even just a GIF will suffice.<br />

<h2>5 awesome Google display ad examples</h2>
<p>No cheat sheet is complete without a little inspiration! Let’s wrap up this guide with five examples of awesome Google display ads. We’ll make sure to break down what makes them tick so you can walk away with immediately actionable tips.</p>
<h3>1. CheapCaribbean.com uses stellar imagery</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-display-ads-cheap-caribbean-banner-example-final_0.png" alt="google-display-ads-good-imagery" width="785" height="204" /></div>
<p>Our first example is courtesy of CheapCaribbean.com. Not only did it nail its targeting (came across this ad on a travel blog), but the images are beyond gorgeous. And no need for persuasive ad copy here. The affordable prices speak for themselves. When they say cheap, they mean it.</p>
<h3>2. ClickCease taps into the power of fear</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-display-ads-example-2-final.png" alt="google-display-ads-click-cease" width="786" height="171" /></div>
<p>ClickCease—a software company that helps advertisers mitigate click fraud—served me this display ad while I was reading a Search Engine Journal article. What makes it so effective is the use of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/21/emotional-ad-copy-examples">emotional ad copy</a> to both grab my attention <em>and</em> communicate the value of the product they’re selling. Fear is an arresting, persuasive emotion. Because no PPC marketer wants to fall victim to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/03/display-network-click-fraud">click fraud</a>, this is an ad that’s certain to leave an impression.</p>
<p>One small critique: This ad needs a brand name. Although it’s effective, it’s not as trustworthy as it needs to be to meet its full potential.</p>
<h3>3. Wikibuy makes an undeniable value proposition</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-display-ads-wiki-buy-example.png" alt="google-display-ads-wiki-buy-value-proposition" width="366" height="245" /></div>
<p>Let’s get <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/26/competitive-ads">competitive</a>! The key to this Wikibuy ad? <strong>Simplicity.</strong> That right there is a dead-simple ad with a dead-simple value proposition: <em>Stuff is cheaper when you buy it from us.</em> The copy is minimal, yet it jumps off the screen. The brand name is there, but it takes a back seat to the value prop. Those of you in highly competitive markets should take notes!</p>
<h3>4. Alteryx nails the headline (and offer)</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-display-ads-alteryx-example.png" alt="google-display-ads-alteryx-headline" width="346" height="292" /></div>
<p>This display ad comes from Alteryx—a software solution for data science and analytics. First of all, that’s a hell of a headline. Injecting a little aspirational sentiment into your ad copy never hurt anybody. Secondly, the subhead puts forth a great value proposition: <em>We make analyzing data easy. </em>And finally, rather than trying to take my money right away, they’re making excellent use of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/01/content-marketing-funnel">content marketing funnel</a> by offering an ebook.</p>
<h3>5. LinkedIn makes it personal</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-display-ads-linkedin-example.png" alt="google-display-ads-linkedin-personalization" width="741" height="104" /></div>
<p>As a B2B marketer myself, this ad grabbed my attention while I was on EZgif.com (an essential tool for my day to day). There&#8217;s a super fancy <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/01/psychology-copywriting-tips-examples">psychology copywriting tactic</a> going on here. It&#8217;s called FOMO. No marketer wants to be a late adopter, this is a super clickable ad.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I never shy away from expressing my love for YouTube Ads. I strongly believe they are one of the most cost-effective ways to build brand awareness or stay in front of a target audience.</p>
<p>But as much as I love video campaigns in Google Ads, I also admit they are not perfect. There are certain things new YouTube advertisers should be aware of before launching a campaign. This post will cover three mistakes that are all too easy to make if you don&#8217;t pay attention to the fine print with your campaign settings.</p>
<h2>4 fine-print details that impact your budget in Google Ads video campaigns</h2>
<p>The many features that give us flexibility with Google ads can also lead to mistakes when <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/21/how-to-run-google-ads">setting up a Google Ads campaign</a>. Here are three to be aware of when running video campaigns.</p>
<h3>1. Your video ads will default to showing outside of YouTube</h3>
<p>When going through the video campaign setup process, you&#8217;ll come across a section called “Networks.” If you expand this section, you&#8217;ll see<strong> your video campaign is automatically included in the three Networks for YouTube Ads</strong>: YouTube search results, YouTube videos, and Video partners on the Display Network. That&#8217;s right. Your videos will serve on websites outside of youtube.com.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-advertising-network-options.png" alt="youtube advertising network options" width="720" height="215" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59450" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-advertising-network-options.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-advertising-network-options-480x143.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This is not necessarily a bad thing if you&#8217;re looking to expand your reach. But if you want more control over the experience, leaving the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/18/google-display-network-tips">Display Network</a> on may not be the best idea. Let me explain.</p>
<p>People go to YouTube to watch videos. So we see better watch times, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/06/youtube-earned-metrics">earned actions</a>, and overall engagement from YouTube networks. When people are on another website, they visit the site to view specific content; not your video ads’ content. <strong>So if your budget is limited, remove the Display Network from your targeting. You can always turn this setting back on if you feel you&#8217;re limited in your reach.</strong></p>
<h3>2. Video ad extensions don&#8217;t show up on TV devices</h3>
<p>I love using Video Action campaigns for my clients who want to get as much traffic and conversions as possible from their YouTube ads. We can add call-to-action extensions, sitelink extensions, and more to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">encourage users to visit your website</a>. A big problem with these extensions is that they don’t show up on most TV devices. According to <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/150471#zippy=%2Ccall-to-action-button" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a>, &#8220;The call-to-action button on TVs is only available for Video campaigns that use the &#8220;Brand awareness and reach&#8221; and &#8220;Product and brand consideration&#8221; goals.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-advertising-sitelink-extensions.png" alt="youtube advertising sitelink extensions" width="600" height="471" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59454" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-advertising-sitelink-extensions.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-advertising-sitelink-extensions-480x377.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/youtube-trueview-ads-demystified-what-marketers-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<p>So if you’re running a Video Action campaign, you’re most likely assuming you’re getting the most changes for a conversion or traffic visit, but you’re not. Call-to-action buttons won’t show on TV devices. Sitelink extensions won’t show on TV devices. Lead form extensions won’t show on TV devices. So to make sure I’m using my Action budget for action, I turn off TV devices.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-advertising-device-placements.png" alt="youtube advertising device placements" width="720" height="240" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59449" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-advertising-device-placements.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-advertising-device-placements-480x160.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>That being said, <strong>I am not saying TV devices are worthless</strong>. So many people watch TV with their phones in their hands. After seeing your ad they could easily look up what your brand or product is. If you still want to capitalize on TV devices, split it out into its own campaign. You’ll have better control of the budget and get better insight on how your Action campaigns perform both on and off TV devices.</p>
<h3>3. Google can ignore your managed placements</h3>
<p>When selecting your targeting, advertisers can handpick to have their ads shown on specific YouTube channels, YouTube videos, video lineups, Display websites, apps, and app categories. Just like the exact match type in Search Ads is not as exact as we’d like, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/17/youtube-ad-placement-targeting">YouTube ad managed placements</a> can be just as shaky. You may think your ad is only going to appear on the placements you chose, but that is definitely not the case. Look at the fine print Google Ads places next to the Placements settings.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-advertising-placment-targeting.png" alt="youtube advertising placement options - the fine print" width="720" height="375" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59451" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-advertising-placment-targeting.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-advertising-placment-targeting-480x250.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8220;Your ad can appear on any YouTube or Display Network placements that <strong>match</strong> your other targeting.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>This means Google Ads has the right to ignore your managed placement targets</strong> and use other targeting options you have layered into the ad group, like Topics, Audiences, etc. We have seen a lot of wasted spend in new client accounts because their ads were being shown on many other placements they didn’t expect.</p>
<h3>4. Not every Display network website plays video ads</h3>
<p>Finally, if you are researching Display websites for managed placements, you also have to be careful. <strong>Google will show you every website result that is part of the Display Network; not just the websites with video ad placements</strong>. So you need to closely monitor any Display website placement you add to your ad group targeting to make sure your video ads are actually playing on the chosen website. It’ll help you avoid a lot of wasted ad spend.</p>

<h2>Bonus tip: Test more than just the video</h2>
<p>So far, I&#8217;ve provided some mistakes to avoid with YouTube video campaigns, so I want to finish off on a positive note with a proactive tip.</p>
<p>Ad testing is an important part of any <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/10/paid-media-strategy">paid media strategy</a> and YouTube ads are no exception. Your video creative should be the component you test the most in your video campaigns. But if you only have one video to use, there are other components of the video ad you could test.</p>
<p>In your In-stream ads, you could look at testing out a few different extension messages to see which one encourages more clicks:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-ad-variant-testing.png" alt="youtube ad variant testing" width="720" height="411" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59452" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-ad-variant-testing.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-ad-variant-testing-480x274.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>With your In-feed video ads, you could look at testing different thumbnails, headlines, or descriptions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-in-feed-video-ad-thumbnail-testing.png" alt="youtube in-feed video ad thumbnail options" width="720" height="453" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59453" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-in-feed-video-ad-thumbnail-testing.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-in-feed-video-ad-thumbnail-testing-480x302.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Then depending on your campaign’s goals, you can see which variants are improving view rates, improving watch times, increasing engagements, or possibly increasing traffic and conversions. I understand it can be difficult for many companies to get a lot of video creative (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/13/video-ad-tools">I have three tips on that here</a>). But even if you fall within that scenario, you still can (and should) test a few different ad variants to see how you can improve performance.</p>
<h2>Bottom line: Always read the fine print (and test!)</h2>
<p>There are many more mistakes to avoid I could go over, and hopefully we can get to those in a future post. The ones I included were the mistakes I run into the most when auditing a new account. Always read the fine print in the support sections to see how campaign targeting or campaign settings actually work for your video campaigns in Google Ads. So many times there are little nuances that make them work much differently than expected. Having the full grasp on how video campaigns work will not only save you money, but also improve your performance from the start.</p>

<li>Your video ads will default to showing outside of YouTube</li>
<li>Video ad extensions don&#8217;t show up on TV devices</li>
<li>Google can ignore your managed placements</li>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p>Because display ads tend to have low conversion rates, many advertisers (or their clients) are quick to question their effectiveness and profitability.</p>
<p>The truth is, display ads can have a strong positive impact on your conversion rates—but oftentimes indirectly, making it hard to track or measure.</p>
<p>One metric designed to help us out with that is view-through conversions. Even still, many question the validity of this metric. Can we trust it? In this post, we’re going to cover</p>
<ul>
<li>What view-through conversions are.</li>
<li>An interesting experiment conducted to test their validity.</li>
<li>Tips on how to track and use this metric.</li>
</ul>
<h1>What is a view-through conversion?</h1>
<p>To understand this <a href="https://blog.teamedia.co/a-z-to-ppc-marketing-metrics-for-b2b-saas-tech-companies/">PPC metric</a>, it’s best to first define a direct conversion (or click-through conversion). If a user sees your ad, clicks on it, and follows through with obtaining the offer, this is called a direct conversion.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/view-through-conversion">view-through conversion</a>, on the other hand, happens when a user sees your ad, does NOT click on it, but then later returns to your site (whether by organic search or direct) and completes any sort of conversion action then.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/view-through-conversion-vs-direct-conversion-1.png" width="714" height="332" alt="view-through conversion vs direct conversion" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>The <a href="/blog/ws/2010/03/25/view-through-conversion-tracking">view-through conversion</a> is only counted if it occurs within a certain number of days after a user sees your ad. This is called the conversion window, lookback window, or attribution window, and you can set it to be anywhere from one to 30 days.</p>
<p>However, the more time that elapses between an impression and a conversion, the less certain it becomes that it was that one ad’s impression that influenced the conversion. After all, a person will encounter a lot of material in the 30 days after seeing an ad that could also play a role in whether they return to your site and convert.</p>
<p>As a result, shorter lookback windows are best for the most realistic and accurate data.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/view-through-conversions-conversion-window.png" width="600" height="358" alt="view-through conversion window setting in google ads" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>View-through conversions are important in understanding the true value of your display ads.</p>
<h2>But can we trust view-through conversions? (experiment)</h2>
<p>This question is by no means a new one, but when it came up for the folks over at PPC agency <a href="https://aimers.io/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aimers</a> (formerly Teamedia), they took a unique approach in answering it.</p>
<p>When one of their clients saw that the Display remarketing campaign wasn’t generating many conversions, they requested to stop it and reallocate resources to more profitable ad types.</p>
<p>However, the client was only looking at direct conversions, and almost 50% of the campaign’s total conversions were view-throughs.</p>
<p>Even still, the client didn’t think that view-throughs should be counted while calculating the total campaign’s CPA; and without counting view-throughs, the campaign wasn’t meeting the target KPI.</p>
<h3>The question</h3>
<p>View-through conversions are a measure of how often seeing an ad influences a person to later return to your site and convert. <strong>But how do you know that a user is actually seeing the ad?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, Google Ads tells us that an impression is considered a “view” when at least <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6270625" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50%</a> of the ad is onscreen for at least one second. But that doesn’t necessarily mean a user has seen the ad.</p>
<p>How can we trust that these aren’t just fake or made-up numbers Google uses so we’ll keep running our Display ads?</p>
<h3>The experiment</h3>
<p>So, the folks at Aimers set up an experiment to see whether view-through conversions were accurately measuring the influence of their client’s Display campaign on future website conversions.</p>
<p>After letting the original campaign run for 30 days, they paused it and then launched a clone of it, but this time with a completely blank banner ad. That’s right, blank white space, no headline, no description, no nothing.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/view-through-conversions-blank-ad.png" width="720" height="295" alt="blank display ad setup for view-through conversion experiment" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>And surprisingly enough, Google approved and served it!</p>
<p>So this way, if Google recorded any view-through conversions from this ad, Aimers would know that this metric is not trustworthy.</p>
<p>In other words, since view-throughs say that seeing your ad influenced a user to go to your site later—any view-throughs from this invisible ad would be bogus since there was nothing to see.</p>
<h3>The results</h3>
<p>The original Display campaign (with the regular banner ad) generated 2,418,973 impressions and nine view-through conversions.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/view-through-conversion-experiment-original.png" width="720" height="333" alt="view-through conversion experiment original campaign results" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>The test campaign (with the invisible ad) generated 315,677 impressions and zero view-through conversions.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/view-through-conversions-experiment-test-campaign-results.png" width="720" height="333" alt="view-through conversion experiment test campaign results" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>Aimers also checked the time lag report in Google Ads to verify that for the past 90 days, all view-through conversions happened within one day after seeing the ad (which was the setting they chose).</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/view-through-conversions-time-lag-report.png" width="720" height="252" alt="view-through conversion experiment time lag report" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regular ad: </strong>2,418,973 impressions, nine view-through conversions.</li>
<li><strong>Invisible ad: </strong>315,677 impressions, zero view-through conversions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>A few caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>This was, of course, a small experiment done for one campaign on one account.</li>
<li>View-through conversions will never be as certain a metric as click-through conversions, since there is no way to concretely measure a view (let alone any resulting subconscious behaviors) versus a click.</li>
<li>It’s possible that the absence of view-through conversions in the test campaign was simply due to the lower volume of impressions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless, we like Aimers&#8217; creativity of thinking here! And for the sake of this campaign, they could use these results to suggest to their client that view-through conversions can be trusted as an accurate indicator that the display remarketing ad in question was indeed influencing website conversions.</p>
<p>In other words, their client was thinking that the remarketing audiences they were targeting would return to their site and convert anyway, without the display ads. Aimers used view-through conversions to show them otherwise, and then ran the blank banner ad test to show them that view-throughs could be trusted.</p>
<h1>How to get more value from your view-through conversion data</h1>
<p>So if this experiment boosts your confidence in view-throughs (or even introduces you to them!), we have some tips on how to use your view-through conversion data.</p>
<h3>Gauge brand awareness</h3>
<p>There are many different ways to measure <a href="/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">brand awareness</a>, such as through branded search volume, social media mentions, and more. But if you see your view-through conversion rate increasing without having made any changes to the copy and creative of your Display ads, this could be a sign that your brand awareness is getting stronger.</p>
<h3>Measure memorability</h3>
<p><a href="https://retargeter.com/blog/how-view-through-conversions-got-a-bad-rap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This post</a> provides some insightful tips on using view-through conversions. The first is that eye-catching ads may produce direct conversions, but memorable ads can lead to those indirect view-through conversions. So you can use this metric to <a href="/blog/ws/2012/09/25/a-b-testing">run A/B tests </a>and identify which ads are more “sticky” than others.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/view-through-conversions-rhyming.png" width="720" height="93" alt="example of rhyming in a display ad" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Rhyming is a <a href="/blog/ws/2021/09/01/psychology-copywriting-tips-examples">psychological copywriting tactic</a> that can make your ads more memorable. </em><a href="https://lineardesign.com/blog/display-ad-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>(Image source)</em></a></p>
<h3>Get a feel for your audience’s shopping habits</h3>
<p>The second insight from the article cited above is that view-through conversions can help you understand your audience’s shopping habits. You can get a feel for which of your products or services your audience buys spur of the moment (click-through conversions), versus which ones take more time for a decision (view-through conversions).</p>
<h3>Optimize placements</h3>
<p>View-through conversions help us to identify if some<a href="/blog/ws/2019/01/07/google-display-network-placements"> display or video placements </a>are more powerful than others. For example, let’s say you have the same display ad running on two different pages, each one with the same click-through conversion rate. They’re performing equally, right? Not necessarily. If one placement is showing more view-through conversions than the other, you’ve just identified  placement optimization opportunities.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/view-through-conversions-display-ad-placements.png" width="720" height="280" alt="google display ad placement options" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2019/07/30/ways-to-target-ads-without-keywords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<h2>How do you track view-through conversions?</h2>
<p>So all we have left is, how exactly do you track view-through conversions so you can make the above optimizations?</p>
<p>As long as you have conversion tracking set up, you can see view-through conversion data in two different ways.</p>
<p><strong>Google Ads analytics</strong></p>
<p>On Google Ads, you can modify your columns so that it appears in the “Campaigns” view.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/view-through-conversions-modify-columns.png" width="650" height="472" alt="modifying columns to see view-through conversions" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>This is the tool Aimers used to measure view-throughs in their experiment.</p>
<p><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>
<p>In Google Analytics, view-through conversion data is available through the GDN impression reporting feature.</p>
<p>Go to Conversions &gt; Multi-Channel Funnels</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/view-through-conversions-mcf.png" width="720" height="118" alt="view-through conversions in google analytics through MCF" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>If you want detailed reports and deep analyses on view-through conversions, you would need additional conversion tracking software. However, either of the two methods above should suffice in being able to optimize your campaigns according to this metric.</p>
<h2>A creative approach to view-through validity</h2>
<p>For many <a href="/blog/ws/2011/09/20/ppc-metrics-ultimate-guide">PPC metrics</a>, different advertisers have different viewpoints on them, depending on their experiences as well as the industry, account setup, and overall marketing strategy of the business being advertised.</p>
<p>And by their nature, view through-conversions have always been on the more fuzzy side of things.</p>
<p>But Aimers&#8217; approach—using view-throughs to demonstrate the value of a Display campaign, and then running a blank campaign to demonstrate the value of view-throughs—was a great one in determining the validity of this metric to their campaign.</p>

<div class="column">
<div>
<div class="tag">
<p>Over the years, we see many different features in Google Ads. Some things come, then they leave, and other times we get adjusted versions of what they used to be.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="column">
<p>One such feature that has changed relatively recently is the types of targeting options on the Display Network.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="a0263f6b-72b6-4232-b22e-07621b1f98db" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>In particular, Custom Intent Audiences and Custom Affinity Audiences have been combined into Custom Audiences.</p>
<p>Rather than choosing from a preset list of options from Google, we’re able to create our own audiences based on their interests and, in some instances, their search history. I&#8217;ve really come to enjoy using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-distribution">Custom Audiences</a>, so I want to take the time and walk you through all of the options available for you to leverage for better ad performance. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interest &amp; behavior</li>
<li>Types of websites browsed</li>
<li>Types of apps downloaded</li>
<li>Category of physical location visited</li>
</ul>
<h2>What are the Custom Audience options in Google Ads?</h2>
<p>Custom Audiences are used for display and YouTube ads. Let&#8217;s go through what each targeting type means and how it can be used. I&#8217;ll also provide strategies for getting the most out of them and show you how to set up Custom Audiences in your account for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-audience-targeting">better audience targeting</a>.</p>
<h3>1. Interest and behavior targeting</h3>
<p>The first box we’re presented with is to target users based on their interests or <a href="/blog/ws/2017/08/28/behavioral-segmentation">behaviors</a>. When you hover over the support box, here’s the description Google gives:</p>
<p><em>“Enter interests, in the form of keywords or phrases, that represent your ideal customer. Your ads will reach people likely to be interested in or with purchase intent for your keywords based on their behavior and activities, such as apps they use or the type of content they search for online.”</em></p>
<p>What we’re trying to do here is almost use targeting similar to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide">keywords</a> to find users who have either been conducting research around specific topics or have shown interest in a product, solution, service while on Google.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e8dd9852-f062-4e4d-8823-a0b69e9532d0" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/making-most-custom-audiences-interest-1.png" alt="google custom audiences—target by interest tab" width="800" height="412" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>For example, if you’re trying to target users who are looking to buy a used car, you might type in something like “best used cars”, then Google will show you some other phrases you could target based on what they’ve seen users search for.  As you <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/24/microsoft-advertising-intelligence-tools">add more keywords</a>, you’ll see the Audience Insights chart on the right adjust based on the audience you’ve selected to include.</p>
<p><strong>Google properties vs the Google Display Network</strong></p>
<p>One of the best features of these Custom Audiences is when you plan to use this list on Google-owned properties.</p>
<p>The two buttons at the top of this builder provide a little insight and to build the audience you’ll have to choose one or the other:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="91904fd7-0a2d-4e88-aeb2-39350a166db4" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/making-most-custom-audiences-any-of-these-interests-1.png" alt="making-most-custom-audiences-interests" width="800" height="96" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>The first option here means that you’ll be <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/15/audience-targeting">targeting</a> users just as mentioned before: based on their interests and purchase intentions.</p>
<p>But the second option is where things get more interesting: People who searched for any of these terms on Google.</p>
<p>This means you’re effectively doing<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/17/remarketing-audiences"> search retargeting</a> for any of the terms you add (and any terms “similar” to them) as long as your ad is going to run on a Google-owned property.</p>
<p>Google-owned properties include:</p>
<ul>
<li>YouTube</li>
<li>Google Discover</li>
<li>Gmail</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/14/google-display-network-targeting-facts">Google Display Network</a> is not one of those owned properties. Each website is owned by individual users or companies and has opted into Google AdSense to monetize their site.</p>
<p>In the end, we’re able to retarget people based on what they searched for on Google, then put our relevant ads in front of them when they are <a href="/blog/ws/2020/05/14/how-to-get-more-views-on-youtube">watching videos on YouTube</a>, checking their email, or discovering new topics on mobile. Pretty powerful stuff!</p>
<h3>2. People who browse types of websites</h3>
<p>Below the keyword section, there is a new header that says “Expand audience by also including” which is then followed by a list of three additional types of targeting.</p>
<p>The first is People who browse types of websites.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="cdf01882-8fac-470e-b4e8-9056e8a1e504" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/making-most-custom-audiences-websites-1.png" alt="google custom audiences—target by type of website browsed" width="800" height="159" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>For this section, Google is asking you to provide the types of websites, in URL form, that your target audience would visit. As it mentions, this is not a way to target those specific website placements, but rather to capitalize on the audience insights from those sites to find new users.</p>
<p>If you know the places where your customers hang out online, this can be a very <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/01/28/facebook-ad-targeting">powerful type of targeting</a>.</p>
<p>For websites, stay away from broader sites and instead focus on industry-specific and closely related sites. For the used car example above, it’s a better idea for you to include websites to local used car dealers or larger national used car websites than simply targeting the Ford, Chevrolet, or Volkswagen websites. Sure, users on those sites might be interested in buying a car, but people could have lots of other reasons for visiting those sites than simply buying a used car.</p>
<h3>3. People who use types of apps</h3>
<p>The next targeting option is very similar to the website targeting options, but includes apps instead.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="3eaa7234-e146-43d3-9580-720329a28e97" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/making-most-custom-audiences-apps-1.png" alt="google custom audiences—target by apps used" width="800" height="174" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Think of the types of apps your potential customers would use. This could be either a permanently installed app or something more temporary. For my used car example, these apps are likely going to be more temporary as you no longer need them after you’ve made the purchase.</p>
<p>To get started, I type in a few companies I know that are important to many users when trying to find a used car:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="bf2dff8c-0621-4ad8-b165-eeaa0bdb9fe2" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/making-most-custom-audiences-kelley-blue-book-1.png" alt="google custom audiences—example of app targeting, apps similar to kelley blue book" width="600" height="441" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>As I type in the names, Google automatically populates a list and suggests apps I should add based on the themes I’m working with.</p>
<p>I can keep using apps that are similar to Kelley Blue Book, which helps you determine the value of a used car. Or I could take a different tack and include apps like Credit Karma which might also find users who are trying to ensure their credit is good enough to purchase a car.</p>
<p>Think of the different types of apps users might use to either help them make a purchase or show interest in your <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">product or service</a> and how you can leverage those for Custom Audience building.</p>
<h3>4. People who visited certain places</h3>
<p>The last type of targeting option is focused on the types of places your customers have visited recently.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="5533eca0-a338-469f-b155-975db3e2f7a0" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/making-most-custom-audiences-places-1.png" alt="google custom audiences—targeting places visited" width="800" height="168" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>These are going to be categories of physical locations rather than the individual places themselves, but these can be immensely useful depending on who you’re trying to reach.</p>
<p>For my used car example, I conducted two quick searches:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="af4173b5-7744-41e0-9dc8-f2b8bfcf79dc" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/making-most-custom-audiences-used-car-1.png" alt="google custom audiences—targeting places a person searching for a used car would visit" width="800" height="454" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Each of these opened up physical locations that could be quite valuable. Used Car Dealers is highly relevant for my purposes off of the “used car” search, but even on the more general “car dealership” search, there are some interesting options around specific brands. If my hypothetical used car dealership only dealt with one brand, or if I’m the manager of the used car business at a specific brand’s dealership, these could also be great options to target.</p>
<h2>How do I set up a Custom Audience?</h2>
<p>The name <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/12/11/facebook-custom-audience-strategy">Custom Audiences</a> might suggest that you would build these in your audience manager, but that’s actually not the case.</p>
<p>To build Custom Audiences, you’ll need to start by either creating a new <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/23/google-display-ads">display</a> or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/13/youtube-ad-placements">video campaign</a> or navigating to an existing ad group where you can leverage audiences.</p>
<p>Once you’re in the Audiences tab, click the blue plus button.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0eee4ff6-889c-4bdc-98df-7b947cfe0c55" data-langcode="en">
<article>

</article>
</div>
<p>Toward the bottom of the list, you’ll see Custom Audiences as an option.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="724bc1e3-b1b5-40d7-84ba-10ea281def65" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/making-most-custom-audiences-targeting-1.png" alt="google custom audiences—custom audience option in google ads" width="564" height="734" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>If you have Custom Audiences created, you’ll be able to choose them from the list at the top. If you don’t, then you can create a new one by choosing “+ Custom Audience” at the bottom of the list.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="b3192548-f870-4c0a-96e0-732ca7c52f9f" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/making-most-custom-audiences-add-audience-1.png" alt="google custom audiences add custom audience option in google ads" width="464" height="690" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Then you’ll be provided with this audience builder.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="edec3d74-5613-40ec-bfab-39ff999bff1a" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/making-most-custom-audiences-new-custom-audience-1.png" alt="google custom audiences—new custom audience tab in google ads" width="800" height="465" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<h2>Go beyond the keyword with Custom Audiences</h2>
<p>Although Google targeting options continue to change with some frequency, I think we’re in a great spot to leverage Custom Audiences right now. There are many different targeting options that go beyond broad interests. We effectively have Search Retargeting across the Google-owned network, but we can also target people based on specific websites, apps, and physical locations they’ve visited. Talk about going beyond the keyword. Next time you’re looking to spruce up your targeting on Google, don’t miss out on testing Custom Audiences to see how they can work for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Display ads are quite the worthwhile investment for a business. They yield widespread and targeted exposure across the web; they help consumers get familiar with and more easily recognize your brand, and retargeting with display ads have a high ROI.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-lexus20example_0.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-lexus example" width="791" height="204" /></div>
<p>But, display ad click-through rates (CTRs) are, on average, a <em>fraction</em> of search ad CTRs—the reason being that while you can target for general interests and behaviors, you can’t directly target exact phrases prospective customers are typing into the search box when seeking out a product, service, or solution—as is the case with paid search ads.</p>
<p>What this means is, to compel someone to click on your display ads, you need outstanding visual creative and compellng copywriting. But it’s not easy to think up a great display ad from scratch. That&#8217;s why we’ve compiled some of the best display ads we&#8217;ve seen so far in 2020 to inspire your next campaign. We will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide images of real display ads that are successful.</li>
<li>Break down exactly how and why they work.</li>
<li>Help you identfy which strategies are best for your business.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The best display ad examples for inspiration</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, display ad CTRs are a fraction of search ads of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/06/google-ads-benchmarks-during-covid-19">0.46 percent</a>, which about 1/10th of the click-through rate (CTR) of the average search ad. This makes them a challenging marketing strategy to execute, but when done right, the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/benefits-of-display-advertising/">benefits of display advertising</a> are pervasive and long-lasting. These examples will equp you with some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/12/02/creative-display-ad-ideas">great display ads ideas</a> and strategies so you can experience these benefits without having to start from scrach.</p>
<h3>1. Apple TV uses simplicity to grab your attention</h3>
<p>You may not need a lot of text or <a href="/blog/ws/2017/01/12/how-to-write-great-advertising-copy">compelling ad copy</a> to grab someone’s attention with a display ad. In fact, it&#8217;s often much better to keep things simple, like with this Apple display ad example below.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-20rewind20rewatch20example.png" alt="best display ads of 2020- Apple rewind rewatch example.png" width="800" height="219" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>An example of an effective Apple display ad</em></p>
<p>Just look at this leaderboard ad for the Apple TV gift card. They highlight the colorful cards themselves and use four words of copy in total.That might sound like it’s not enough, but because of word selection, the <a href="/blog/ws/2013/08/15/ad-copywriting-tips">ad copy</a> works well.</p>
<p>It also capitalizes on the current situation and trend of staying at home and watching movies, rather than going out to the theater.&#8221;Learn more&#8221; isn’t the <a href="/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">strongest call to action</a>, but the high-contrast blue is strong and, otherwise, it’s a great ad.</p>
<p>The same campaign also includes two square display ads with an interesting use of emojis to replace letters in the copy.</p>

<p class="text-align-center"><em>These Apple display ads use emojis to replace letters.</em></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-apple20gift20card20example202_0.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-apple gift card example 2" width="356" height="297" /></div>
<p>Both ads focus on the versatility of the gift card, and how you can use it for music, movies, or other entertainment on multiple devices.Plus, using<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/27/emojis-in-ad-text"> emojis in ad text has been shown to boost CTR</a> for social media ads, so why not implement it with display? If you want to stand out on the Google Display Network, you need to do something differently. The emoji headlines grab the eye without being noisy, annoying, or out of place on publisher sites.</p>
<p>Apple is good at marketing&#8230;who knew?</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Get the guide &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLiQContentDLHowToMakeGreatLandingPages.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_LandingPages_HowToMakeGreatLandingPagesGuide_Download">How to Make Great Landing Pages (with Crazy High Conversions)</a></p>
<h3>2. Geico uses color and contrast to highlight a new offering</h3>
<p>If you’re <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">promoting a new offer</a>, you could learn from Geico’s skyscraper display ad.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-geico20example_0.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-geico example" width="400" height="773" /></div>
<p>Everybody knows Geico for car insurance, but many don’t know about their home insurance. This display ad uses Geico’s <a href="/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">brand awareness</a> as a car insurance company to push a better, cheaper policy for both car and home.</p>
<p>The icons and color contrast also communicate the concept of mixing two different worlds. And it’s not the only format of <a href="/blog/ws/2020/03/02/banner-ads-examples">banner ad</a> they created for the campaign. Below is the square banner ad version that also uses the same concept and actually uses the phrase, “More than just car insurance:”</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-geico20example20square20banner20ad.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-geico example square banner ad" width="520" height="436" /></div>
<p>They also match the <a href="/blog/ws/2017/05/10/ad-creative-inspiration">ad creative</a> to the ad size, rather than just sizing down the house and car from the skyscraper.</p>
<p>As Geico has demonstrated, with the right banner ad, display can be a great medium for spreading the word about your new product or service.</p>
<h3>3. Instapage gets straight to the point</h3>
<p>In advertising, simplicity is a virtue. A potential customer can’t be interested in your product if you don’t efficiently <a href="/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">communicate the value</a> of your offer. Instapage’s ad simply states, “the most powerful landing page builder:”</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-instapage20example_0.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-instapage example" width="467" height="380" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Instapage uses a bold tagline in their display ad to succinctly communicate their value.</em></p>
<p>While this display ad feature-focused, rather than benefit-focused (not normally a <a href="/blog/ws/2019/10/02/display-ads-best-practices">display ad best practice</a>), the “see why” CTA hints at the value proposition for making the switch.</p>
<p>Plus, their target audience is quite technical, made up of marketing geeks (like us) who often<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/21/features-vs-benefits"> view features as benefits</a>. For example, there’s no need to translate that a <a href="/blog/ws/2013/07/11/landing-page-conversion-rate-guide">higher conversion rate</a> means more money in the bank.</p>
<h3>4. PlayerUnknown&#8217;s Battlegrounds breaks the rules successfully</h3>
<p>Sometimes it’s okay to break the rules. With a game as wild and chaotic as Pubg, a simple visual and some text might not get the message across. Instead, they’ve <a href="/blog/ws/2015/02/03/repurposing-content">repurposed</a> the explosion from the cover, highlighting the action in the fast-paced game.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-battlegrounds20example_0.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-battlegrounds example" width="787" height="99" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Repurposing existing creative for display ads can facilitate increased brand awareness.</em></p>
<p>It’s not the cleanest most original or<a href="/blog/ws/2016/12/20/creative-advertising-ideas"> creative ad</a>, but it uses their brand awareness well and aligns with their actual product. Of course, the formats and norms depend on the <a href="/blog/ws/2014/11/18/google-display-network-tips">ad network</a>, but that shouldn’t stop you.</p>
<p>If you’ve got a good idea that breaks the rules, <a href="/blog/ws/2015/06/16/ab-testing-tips">test it</a> against a rule-following control. That’s the great thing about digital marketing. You can test all your hypotheses <a href="/blog/ws/2016/08/18/ppc-money-saving-checklist">without having to spend a lot of time or money</a>.</p>

<h3>5. The New York Times addresses recent trends with their newest ad</h3>
<p>The news is under fire. The allegations of “fake news” exploding over the past few years is one of the most important and concerning <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/31/2020-ecommerce-marketing-trends">trends on the internet</a>. The New York Times addresses these changes with a simple display ad that frames them as the hero:</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-new20york20times20example_0.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-new york times example" width="450" height="369" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>The New York Times is leveraging current trends to convey a strategic message through their display ad. </em></p>
<p>Regardless of how you feel about NYT as a news provider, it’s a smart move. In an age where news stories sourced from Twitter are common, you need a reliable source of information. Just looking at Facebook or Twitter is likely to lead you down all sorts of rabbit holes. “We’re the answer” Is the statement this <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/12/02/creative-display-ad-ideas">effective banner ad</a> makes. And the call to action, “see my options,” is personal and effective. It’s a great ad.</p>
<h3>6. This clickable ad from Lex uses eyes to attract yours</h3>
<p>A human face can be a good way to grab someone’s attention, as long as you use it in the right way.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-lexus20example.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-lexus example" width="800" height="217" /></div>
<p>Of course, it might seem strange for a car brand to use such a roundabout way to market a new model. But really, they aren’t marketing their car directly with this ad. Instead, they are marketing their latest innovation—the new speaker system in their Lexus ES.</p>
<p>This becomes clear from the <a href="/blog/ws/2014/02/12/great-landing-pages">landing page</a> with a dedicated video all about the human sense of hearing and sound design.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-lexus20landing20page20example.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-lexus landing page example" width="800" height="313" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://www.lexus.com/curiosity/ES-Mark-Levinson-PurePlay">Image Source</a></em></p>
<p>If the ad led directly to a static landing page full of car and engine specs, it wouldn’t work. But that’s not what it does. Instead, the ad and <a href="/blog/ws/2020/03/05/video-ad-ideas">video</a> together are meant to help cement an image of Lexus as an innovator. And it works.</p>
<h3>7. A clear message from Mount Sinai in troubling times</h3>
<p>Advertising is all about context. You can’t create an ad that resonates with someone if you <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/18/post-covid-19-customers">don’t know anything about them </a>or how they think. Mount Sinai knows what New Yorkers are going through, and knows how it’s affecting annual check-ups at their hospitals. They have taken steps to address the situation, and their display ad conveys that message well.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-mount20sinai20example.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-mount sinai example" width="400" height="338" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>An effective display ad demonstrates how well you know your audience.</em></p>
<p>If we wanted to improve the banner ad even further, there are a few things to nitpick.</p>
<p>The <a href="/blog/ws/2015/02/02/ppc-ad-headlines">headline</a> and CTA are great, but the main copy is a bit long and it&#8217;s hard to read due to the small font size. They could probably reduce the length by almost half, and still convey what they want.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4da.png" alt="📚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide download</strong> &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download">The 42 Best Call to Action Phrases Ever (&amp; Why They Work)</a></p>
<h3>8. The perfect brand awareness display ad from Polo Ralph Lauren</h3>
<p>What signifies class and style more than models wearing a fashion collection? The perfect setting.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-polo20example.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-polo example" width="400" height="333" /></div>
<p>Somehow these models are dressed and fancified to the teeth, wandering along the ocean’s edge at a beach. A throwback to when people went to the beach, sure, but not to sunbathe or swim, but to socialize.</p>
<p>It’s perfect for the more outdoorsy brand Polo is trying to establish (their fall collection is called Road Trip). It’s a great example of <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/14/use-branding-to-improve-advertising">branding with display ads</a>.</p>
<h3>9. Merrell makes you want to visit the great outdoors</h3>
<p>Instead of featuring their shoes on a blank white or black background like many shoe companies do, Merrell chose a forest setting.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-merrell20example_0.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-merrell example" width="300" height="597" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>This display ad advertises an experience, not a product.</em></p>
<p>The trees, green grass, and leaves, combined with the font choice for Ontario, come together and create a longing to visit the great outdoors. This ad promises the experience of hiking, not the product itself. And of course, if you want to go hiking, you’re going to need hiking boots.</p>
<h3>10. Integral Ad Science delivers a short and punchy message</h3>
<p>This display ad from IAS uses an eye-catching color scheme to drive home a short and punchy message.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-IAS20example_0.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-IAS example" width="396" height="315" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>For this display ad example, the copy <strong>is</strong> the creative</em>.</p>
<p>It’s incredibly simple, 9 words in total, with no real images, icons, or graphics. But it works because of the balance between creative and copy. The mad ad scientists know what they’re doing.</p>
<h3>11. Square proves that the KISS rule still works</h3>
<p>An ad doesn’t need to be revolutionary to be effective. Keeping things simple is often a recipe for success.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-square20example_0.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-square example" width="300" height="600" /></div>
<p>If you break down the Square ad above, these are the moving pieces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logo</li>
<li>Brand name</li>
<li>Benefit</li>
<li>Product image</li>
<li>Call to action (not even a button)</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as you have a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/26/product-photography">good product image</a> and a clear value proposition, you don’t need creative genius.</p>
<h3>12. SEMrush stands out with creative images, color, and animations</h3>
<p>You don’t need to put on an expensive photoshoot with professional models to create an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/19/outreach-marketing-techniques">attention-grabbing</a> ad. When used creatively, icons, or even <a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/22/best-practices-stock-photos">stock photos</a> can help you stand out from the crowd. This square image ad from SEMrush is the perfect cure to <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/banner-blindness-old-and-new-findings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banner blindness</a>.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-SEMrush20example.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-semrush example" width="400" height="340" /></div>
<p>Instead of a stereotypical pedestal to indicate competition, SEMrush uses a chess piece inside of an hourglass. The hourglass symbolizes the speed at which you can gleam the competitor insights promised in the headline.</p>
<p>The photos have been edited to create a contrasting color scheme that grabs your attention. Of course, with the advent of HTML5, a display ad no longer has to be a static image ad. You have all kinds of animation options.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-semrush20gif.gif" alt="best display ads of 2020-semrush gif" /></p>
<p>In this banner ad, SEMrush uses a smart graphic of climbing the SERPs with a link chain. The animations help serve more copy in a readable format, as well as grab the user’s attention with the movement.</p>
<h3>13. The perfect B2B display ad from SAP</h3>
<p>This animated banner from SAP is an example of <a href="/blog/ws/2019/10/17/b2b-lead-generation">great B2B marketing</a>.The first headline is short and concise, highlighting a common pain point for many companies: a disengaged workforce.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-sap20banner20ad.gif" alt="best display ads of 2020-SAP animation example" /></p>
<p>The copy in the next frame then introduces a solution that will help you nurture a successful workplace. It focuses on the underlying problem and high-level benefits, rather than getting bogged down in specific features.</p>
<p>If more B2B ads were as human and concise as this, ad blindness might be a smaller problem.</p>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f914.png" alt="🤔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Are you taking advantage of all that Google Ads has to offer? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f914.png" alt="🤔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<h3>14. Workplace highlights the benefits of using their software</h3>
<p>This animated ad from Workplace really showcases the potential of animation in <a href="https://localiq.com/products/display-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">display ads</a>. With just a few simple transitions and text, it highlights its three most important benefits to managers and business owners.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of20202020workplace20example20gif.gif" alt="best display ads of 2020 workplace example gif" /></p>
<p>There’s no way you could do that with a static banner of the same size (without making the text illegibly small). When used right, animation is a tool that can help you convey more information to potential customers. Key takeaway here: It’s not just about grabbing attention.</p>
<h3>15. PNC Bank uses dogs and humor to promote their wallet app</h3>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2013/10/08/funny-ads">Humor</a> is a great, and often underutilized tool in the advertiser’s toolbox. This short, animated ad from PNC Bank is a great example of a display ad.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020_pnc20bank.gif" alt="best display ads of 2020_pnc bank" /></p>
<p>It contrasts the ease of taking pictures and using social media, with the typical difficulty of mobile banking. And it’s not just ads, like we’ve previously covered, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/09/10/comedy-in-content-marketing">humor works in content marketing</a> too. That saidd, you may want to add some stand-up to your Netflix routine.</p>
<h3>16. Constant Contact uses animation to demonstrate tech saavy</h3>
<p>This ad from Constant Contact uses simple animation to make their ad seem smarter and more modern.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-constantcontact.gif" alt="best display ads of 2020-constantcontact" /></p>
<p>Since the ad is about smart email marketing automation, the added movement feels like a necessary addition. The rich media works almost like a promise in itself, that the ad is as smart as the service.</p>
<h3>17. Bulldog Skincare proves interstitial ads don’t have to be torture</h3>
<p>Interstitials are the most controversial display ad format by far. Although you get unprecedented size to advertise your message, it comes at a price.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-bulldog20example.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-bulldog example" width="500" height="306" /></div>
<p>The user is forced to see the ad and often clicks (which you pay for) accidentally while trying to close the ad. But with the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/30/design-principles">right banner ad design </a>and targeting, they can still be an effective medium.</p>
<p>Bulldog Skincare uses a humorous image and headline to take the edge off the interruption.</p>

<li>Test unique ideas against a conventional version.</li>
<li>Personalize your CTA to resonate more with your audience.</li>
<li>Try compelling and uniquely displayed copy as your ad creative.</li>
<li>With strategically placed copy and creative, your CTA may not even have to be a button.</li>
<li>Advertise an experience, not a product.</li>
<li>Animate your ads to convey more information.</li>
<li>Find unique ways to spruce up icons and stock photos.</li>

<h2>Test and optimize to find the best display ad for your business</h2>
<p>When you don’t know what you’re doing, display advertising is an easy way to waste your ad spend. But if you’re inspired by greatness (like the ads in this post) and follow tried and tested principles, you have a shot at success. But remember that your first idea is rarely the winner. Come up with a few different ideas, mix and match, and test the final ads against each other for the best results. Ongoing testing and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/24/google-ads-optimization">optimization of your Google Ads</a> is a reliable recipe for success.</p>

<p><span lang="EN">The setup of dynamic remarketing in Google Ads is pretty easy, but this feature is available only for the Display Network and not available for every advertiser. Eligibility will differ depending on if you want to use dynamic ads for remarketing and what industry your account is in. To help you get started with this helpful feature of Google Ads, I’m going to walk you through the basics for campaign setup. We&#8217;ll cover:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Eligibility requirements for dynamic display ads on Google.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">How to set up your dynamic display campaign in Google Ads.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">How to create the dynamic feed required for these types of ads.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">I’ll also cover the limitations, templates, and common issues that occur with feeds so you can have a clear path to dynamic display ad success. Let&#8217;s begin.</span></p>
<h1>Can my Google Ads account use dynamic display ads?</h1>
<p><span lang="EN">This is a good question we need to answer right away. Certain website and app categories are not allowed to use dynamic display. If your website or app falls under any of these categories, you will not be able to use <a href="/blog/ws/2013/04/01/dynamic-remarketing">dynamic remarketing audiences</a>. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Personal hardship: </span></strong><span lang="EN">Google is trying to avoid reminding users of any difficult times they may be going through. </span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Identity and belief: </span></strong><span lang="EN">Anything possibly related to potential stigmas, discrimination, prejudices, or other classifications along those lines. </span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Sexual interests: </span></strong><span lang="EN">Because these experiences are extremely private, all sexually explicit ads are prohibited.</span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Access to opportunities: </span></strong><span lang="EN">Starting Oct. 19, 2020, any ads appearing to target specific audiences impacted by societal bias may be rejected. </span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Alcohol: </span></strong><span lang="EN">Any ads that show or even just resemble alcoholic beverages. </span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Gambling: </span></strong><span lang="EN">Whether it’s online or physical casinos, any ads promoting gambling are not allowed to use dynamic remarketing.</span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Clinical trial recruitment: </span></strong><span lang="EN">Ad copy in this category must be highly precise.</span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Restricted drug terms: </span></strong><span lang="EN">If the drugs are only for animal use, then they may be accepted.</span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Users under the age of 13: </span></strong><span lang="EN">As you might expect, there too much room for error in this category.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">If you don’t fall into any of the categories just listed, your account is most likely okay to move on and start using dynamic remarketing. Now let us go through the campaign setup in Google Ads. </span></p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20set20up20dynamic20display20ads20how20dynamic20remarketing20works.png" alt="how to set up dynamic display ads how dynamic remarketing works" width="800" height="237" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://www.adwordsrobot.com/en/dynamic-remarketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<h1>How to set up a dynamic display ad campaign</h1>
<p>When creating a new campaign, choose the “Sales” campaign goal objective. As mentioned in the intro of this post, dynamic advertising is only available on the <a href="/blog/ws/2014/11/18/google-display-network-tips">Display Network</a> so choose “Display” as your campaign type. Then for a subtype, the only option allowing dynamic remarketing is “Standard display campaign.”</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20set20up20dynamic20display20ads20setting20for20google20dynamic20remarketing20campaign.png" alt="how to set up dynamic display ads—the campaign creation options tab" width="798" height="883" /></div>
<p>As for the rest of the process, set your account up as you would <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/23/google-display-ads">set up any other Display Network campaign</a>, but there will be an additional area in Settings you&#8217;ll want to find. First, find the “Dynamic ads” section. Next, click on the checkbox asking if you want to “Use dynamic ads feed for personalized ads.” You will then get a selection box with the following options:</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google20dynamic20display20ads20setting20up20your20google20remarketing20campaign.png" alt="google dynamic display ads — the &quot;use dynamic ads feed for personalized ad&quot; box is checked" width="800" height="343" /></div>
<p>Pick whichever business type aligns with your account. If you do not see an option that fits with your account, you can easily choose the “Other” option. Last, if you are already running Shopping campaigns, you will also see the option to sync a feed that you already have linked from the Google Merchant Center. Finish the rest of your ad group set up, then it will be time to work on setting up your feed.</p>
<h1>How to create a feed for your dynamic display ads</h1>
<p>Feeds are an absolute necessity if you want to run any dynamic remarketing in Google Ads. If you do not have a feed, then you will not be able to create a dynamic ad. Pretty straightforward there. Again, retail accounts running <a href="/blog/ws/2014/04/14/google-shopping-ads">Shopping campaigns</a> will already be a step ahead because most likely you have your product feed(s) created in <a href="/blog/ws/2019/09/18/google-merchant-center">Merchant Center</a>. For any of the other industries seen in the last image, you will need to use one of the feed templates for your business type. Before I share the business feed templates, there are some limitations we need to be aware of.</p>
<h2>Feed limitations</h2>
<p>Per Google Ads’ policies, there are limitations to how many and how large your feeds can be. Here are the three feed limit rules currently in place at the time this post was written:</p>
<ol>
<li>There can only be 5 million rows or feed items per account. Keep in mind this isn’t just for dynamic remarketing. The feed item total also includes extension and <a href="/blog/ws/2015/08/18/ad-customizers">ad customizer</a> feeds.</li>
<li>There can only be 100 user-generated or business data feeds per ad account.</li>
<li>Each attribute within your feeds needs to be 3,000 bytes or less. (Google says this is roughly 750-3,000 characters depending on which characters you are using)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Feed templates</h2>
<p>Depending on which industry you chose in the campaign set up, you will need to use the proper business type feed template. Each business type feed has different attributes, so yes, the template does matter. Last, if you chose “Other” as your business type, you can create a custom feed to use in your ads. Below you will find the direct download links for each of the Google Ads business types.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gstatic.com/adextensions/education-feed-template.csv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Education</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gstatic.com/adextensions/flights-feed-template.csv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flights</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gstatic.com/adextensions/hotels-and-rentals-feed-template.csv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hotels and rentals</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gstatic.com/adextensions/jobs-feed-template.csv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jobs</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gstatic.com/adextensions/local-deals-feed-template.csv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Local deals</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gstatic.com/adextensions/real-estate-feed-template.csv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Real estate</a></li>
<li>Retail &#8211; Link your product feeds via the Google Merchant Center</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gstatic.com/adextensions/travel-feed-template.csv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Travel</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gstatic.com/adextensions/custom-feed-template.csv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Custom template</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Rather than go in-depth into every business type feed, I will choose one industry just so we can see an <a href="/blog/ws/2020/03/02/banner-ads-examples">ad example</a> later on. I chose the Education template using my <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/26/marketing-strategies-college-students">alma mater</a> just for fun. They are not a client.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20set20up20dynamic20display20ads20feed20example.png" alt="how to set up dynamic display ads—feed template example" width="800" height="70" /></div>
<p>There will be a default example for every template you download as well as extra rows to guide you on the set up. Once your feed is filled out and is ready to be submitted, it is time to head back into Google Ads. We are now ready to move onto business feed uploading.</p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Uploading your data feeds</span></h3>
<p>Once you are in Google Ads, click on “Tools &amp; Settings.” Then click on the “Business data” link under the Setup column.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20set20up20dynamic20display20ads20business20data20location.png" alt="how to set up dynamic display ads—business data option in setup tab in google ads" width="800" height="231" /></div>
<p>Click on the blue, plus (+) button to begin the upload process. You will then need to choose “Dynamic ad feed.” Then select the business type category of the feed you just finished creating.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20set20up20dynamic20display20campaign20feed20choose20business20type20before20upload.png" alt="how to set up dynamic display campaign feed—choose business type before upload" width="500" height="373" /></div>
<p>Choose the .csv file for the feed. Then name your feed. Then you are ready to upload. You will then be taken back to the main Data feeds page. With a simple refresh, you should be able to see your feed in the list. Now let me show you how this feed may look in an ad.</p>

<h2><span lang="EN">Why is my dynamic display data feed not working?</span></h2>
<p>There are a few reasons why your feed could be disapproved. Here are some common reasons for you to check if you are getting flagged for feed errors.</p>
<ol>
<li>If your feed is not formatted properly or you are going over the byte limits mentioned earlier in this post.</li>
<li>If you did not add information into the fields under required attribute columns, that will definitely flag an error with your feed.</li>
<li>You also need to make sure your fields are formatted properly. The example in each feed template will give you information on format (price, airport codes, and many more).</li>
<li>A URL may be invalid. Whether it’s a Final URL or an image URL, make sure every one entered into a feed is working.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a few other reasons why your feed comes back with errors, but these are some common ones I have run into. Your feed could come back with errors a few hours after submitting. You can edit the feed directly in Google Ads or update your original feed and reupload into the channel.</p>
<h2><span lang="EN">Using data feeds in dynamic ads</span></h2>
<p>You are probably expecting this massive, long section on how these <a href="/online-ads">ad formats</a> are going to be completely different than anything you have ever created. Well I hate to disappoint you because that is not the case. The main structure of a dynamic ad is really a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/22/maximize-ROI-with-responsive-search-ads">responsive</a> display ad. Your data feed is just an additional feature added to the ad.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20set20up20google20dynamic20display20ads20feed20attached20to20ad.png" alt="how to set up google dynamic display ads feed attached to ad" width="383" height="76" /></div>
<p>Since your data feed was applied to the ad group, there is nothing you need to do to the ad itself. Create your responsive display ad like you normally would. You will need your <a href="/press/shutterstock-integration">marketing images</a> and logo images. You will need to add short (up to 5) and <a href="/blog/ws/2015/02/02/ppc-ad-headlines">long headlines</a> as well as <a href="/blog/ws/2019/06/26/product-descriptions">descriptions</a> (also up to 5). You can possibly add videos from YouTube to make the ad more engaging if it makes sense. You can check out this post on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/23/responsive-display-ads">responsive display ads best practices</a> to get more information.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20set20up20dynamic20display20ads20examples20of20dynamic20remarketing20ads.png" alt="how to set up dynamic display ads examples of dynamic remarketing ads" width="800" height="664" /></div>
<h2><span lang="EN">Set your dynamic display ads up for success</span></h2>
<p>Advertisers in a variety of industries can use dynamic ads to customize the message they want to put in front of users. Using dynamic feeds for products or services can be a great way to reconnect with users and showcase items or pages that are familiar to your previous visitors. Even if your account’s industry does not fall under one of the main business types mentioned in this post, take some time to review custom feed formats. You can always create a feed that best fits your account (even if you fall under one of the default business types). Layering on an ad message that can speak to your <a href="/blog/ws/2019/07/16/engagement-ads">target audience</a> with a familiar feed of products or services can help improve the performance from your Display campaigns from both an engagement and conversion success metric.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN">No matter what industry you are in, or how large of a budget you have, there are some standard rules I like to stick by when running campaigns on the Google Ads Display Network. Yes, no two accounts will perform the same, and the way we approach our strategies should be unique to each goal. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">But as long as I have been running awareness campaigns on the Display Network, I’ve been seeing the same mistakes pop up again and again. The worst <a>part?</a> These common mistakes are easy to avoid. Here are the six top Google Display Network mistakes that you need to avoid, plus how to do that:</span></p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li><span lang="EN">Combining your display and search campaigns</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Including remarketing audiences in your awareness campaigns</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Not using the proper exclusions</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Skimming your placement reports</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Getting complacent with targeting options</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Leaving your columns in Google Ads alone</span></li>
</ol>
<h2><span lang="EN">1. Combining your display and search campaigns</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">If you believe in marketing to the top of funnel and want to immediately run display campaigns in your Google Ads account, you are already a friend of mine. But make sure you are keeping your display campaigns completely separate from your search campaigns. You may be thinking, “Why would these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/05/20/google-adwords-search-versus-display">two different networks</a> be combined in the first place?” That is a good question. When creating a brand new campaign in Google Ads, Google will automatically opt your search campaigns into the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/18/google-display-network-tips">Display Network </a>to help expand reach.</span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">I honestly consider this option as either a convenience to smaller businesses who <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/10/time-management-tips">do not have time</a> to manage a lot of campaigns or as an afterthought for marketers who really do not know what they are doing. That second opinion may sound harsh, but hear me out. Think about the user intent.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">People going to Google.com and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/12/10/three-types-of-search-queries">searching specific queries</a> show a much deeper intent than someone seeing an ad on a random website. Odds are you will see noticeably different CTRs, CPCs, conversions, conversion rates, and CPAs on these two networks. If that is the case, separate them out every time. Yes, someone on both networks may be unfamiliar with your brand. But remember, it goes back to their intent. Capitalizing on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2010/03/30/google-search-funnels">deeper funnel users</a> will need different strategies than expanding your reach to a new audience and let’s keep it this way. </span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">2. Including remarketing audiences in your awareness campaigns</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">The message you put in front of someone who has already interacted with your brand should be different than the message a brand new user should see. With <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/12/19/google-adwords-remarketing-cheatsheet">remarketing</a>, you most likely want to be a little bit more aggressive with your sales message to encourage the user to perform a specific action. With a top-of-funnel display campaign, you might have to pump the brakes a bit and not be a used car salesman for a change. This is exactly why I like to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/28/behavioral-segmentation">segment out my audiences</a> in separate campaigns.</span></p>

</div>
<p><span lang="EN">I typically see an audience of new users and an audience of users already familiar with my clients’ brand perform completely different. And since budgets are controlled at the campaign level, I can control performance a little bit more when I use separate campaigns. To try and keep these users as segmented as possible, I also like to implement as many <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/17/remarketing-audiences">remarketing audiences</a> as I can as exclusions in my pure awareness campaigns. If I’m creating ad groups in my remarketing campaigns targeting user actions, YouTube engagements, page visits, etc., I want to exclude these users from my new user campaigns. On top of remarketing audiences, I’m also going to try and add customer lists and audiences from certain <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/08/13/adwords-conversion-tracking-guide">conversion actions</a> to try and keep these campaigns as segmented as possible. This allows me to better control my creative, landing pages, and budgets in a way that better helps my clients’ meet their business goals.</span></p>

<h2><span lang="EN">3. Not using the proper exclusions</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">We just talked about excluding remarketing audiences from your top of funnel awareness campaigns, but now I want to dive into exclusions a little deeper. When creating your display campaign (or if you are updating your current campaign’s settings), you can set content exclusions. These are default content category options that will help advertisers keep their display ads on content best suited for the brand and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/17/online-audiences">desired target audience</a>. </span></p>

</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Brands can try and exclude their ads on websites, YouTube videos, or apps related to specific types of content. If you look at the middle column in the image above, you can see the sensitive content options are selected but grayed out. This is because sensitive content options can be excluded at the account level if you prefer. You can find this setting by clicking “All Campaigns” then “Settings.” Then choose “Account Settings.” Look at the options you have, and feel free to proactively exclude them from your display campaigns before going live. You may <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/18/ppc-money-saving-checklist">save yourself a lot of money</a>—and possibly even a PR mess down the road.</span></p>

<h2><span lang="EN">4. Skimming your placement reports</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Yes, we just talked about being proactive with your category exclusions at the campaign level. And this tactic will help your ads appear on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/07/google-display-network-placements">placements better suited for your business goals</a>. This does not mean, however, that you are free from constantly checking your placement reports. Set up a consistent schedule to review where your ads are being shown if you are not using managed placement targeting.</span></p>

</div>
<p><span lang="EN">When in the Placements Report, advertisers can choose to review “Where Ads Showed.” If you have not proactively implemented higher level category exclusions, you may see broader (and potentially underperforming) placements showing up frequently in your reports. You will then have the option to either exclude placements individually, or you may find themes of placements underperforming to justify adding category exclusions at the higher levels we already mentioned. And since you are a diligent PPC marketer who is always <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/16/ad-targeting">testing new targeting options</a> (stay tuned), you may have to go back to the Placement reports more frequently to see how placement performance has changed since your last optimizations.</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">5. Getting complacent with targeting options</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Another rut I see companies get in with their display campaigns is using the same targeting options for long periods of time without ever testing anything different. Even if you find basic targeting options within Google Ads that consistently work for your goals, you still can put in the effort to try and do better. Display Planner may be gone, but creating Custom Audiences in the Audience Manager tool can help you come up with many <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/13/adwords-ad-variations">different ideas to test</a>.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Custom intent audiences have been a favorite targeting option of mine for both <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/05/video-ad-ideas">video</a> and display awareness campaigns. Custom intent audiences for the Display Network also come with an added bonus. Google gives advertisers creating these audiences for display a list of recommended keywords we can choose to add to our audiences. This feature does not show up when creating <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/29/custom-intent-audiences-youtube">custom intent audiences for YouTube</a>.</span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">If you feel like you have run out of new <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/23/custom-affinity-audiences">custom intent audience</a> ideas to test, or you might not know where to even begin, Google might have even more options for you. When researching audiences to add to your ad groups, Google may have already compiled a list of auto-created custom intent audiences for you to test. These audiences can be built off of your remarketing lists, Search Network campaigns, website content, user behavior, and more. Auto-created audiences have worked very well for me in several accounts when I have run out of new ideas to test, so give them a shot if you are running out of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/20/landing-page-ideas">new ideas</a>.</span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Testing out new options from broader targeting categories like Topics, Affinity Audiences, etc. may still work. I always like to try and start as specific as possible with my audiences before expanding my reach. If you find certain targeting options that work, that is great! But do not get complacent. Keep testing new audiences to reach your target customer, and custom audiences are an easy way to keep testing going for display.</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">6. Leaving your columns in Google Ads alone</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">I already talked about the differences in user intent between the Search and Display Networks. If you agree with that statement, then hopefully you are not reviewing performance between the two networks exactly the same. Yes, we can get plenty of direct conversions from our display campaigns if you find the right mix of targeting and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/12/02/creative-display-ad-ideas">engaging creative</a>. But many industries may not see direct conversions from their display campaigns. This happens for several reasons but some examples include very long sales cycles or high-priced items. Just because users are not converting after seeing your display ads one time, it does not mean your display ads are not working.</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="80075608-b44d-4cef-934a-fd10693ef96f" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Switch up your columns in Google Ads to see if users are eventually converting. Two columns that easily come to mind are the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2010/03/25/view-through-conversion-tracking">View-through conversions</a> and Cross-device conversions columns. View-through conversions occur if an impression on your display ad occurs, the user does not interact with the ad, but they convert later on down the road. Cross-device conversions occur when a user interacts with an ad on one device, but they convert later on through a different device or on a different browser. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Your display ads could be having a much bigger impact instead than you realize. So if your metrics for success rely solely on direct conversions, you most likely are missing the entire story. Most people are not going to see an ad one time, click on it, and convert. If you believe in using display to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/04/nurture-marketing">nurture users</a> to eventual conversion, then you have to rethink the way you evaluate their performance. </span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">Don’t make these Google Display Network mistakes!</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">I completely understand that no two accounts are alike. I also have no problem admitting not all of these recommendations may be applicable to every account. But I do endorse using these recommendations to give your Google Display Network campaigns a good foundation to use when setting up your campaigns. You can then use the data you see to make the optimizations you feel work best to hit the account goals you are looking to achieve.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes we all need some creative inspiration. That's why we've gathered 24 stellar banner ads examples and broken down exactly why they work so well to help you get your own ideas off the ground.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/02/banner-ads-examples">24 Clickable Banner Ads Examples (And Why They Work!)</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all need some creative inspiration now and then—and it’s nothing to be ashamed of. When Julian Casablancas, legendary frontman of the Strokes, was asked about the similarities between the band’s hit single “Last Nite” and Tom Petty’s “American Girl,” he issued a terse response: “Yeah, we ripped it off. Where have you been?”</p>
<p>Although this laissez-faire attitude towards plagiarism is baked into the foundation of rock ‘n’ roll, we’ve gotta play by the rules here in the digital marketing world. So, as you peruse this collection of outstanding banner ad examples, please refrain from taking the Casablancas approach. Finding inspiration is one thing; stealing is another.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-intro.jpg" alt="banner ad example" width="487" height="301" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Yikes. Even if plagiarism </em>were<em> acceptable, this isn’t a banner ad you’d want to mimic.</em></p>
<p>Accompanying each banner ad example is a quick breakdown of what (in my opinion) makes it work. You’ll notice some themes: the versatility and effectiveness of side-by-side comparisons, the emotional power of visual imagery, the need to undermine skepticism, and so on.</p>
<p>Let’s get to it!</p>
<h2>24 banner ads examples that we can all learn from</h2>
<h3>1. Bridgewater State University</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-intro-bridgewater-state.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Bridgewater State" width="624" height="168" /></div>
<p>Let’s be honest: This ad’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/click-through-rate">click-through rate</a> is probably very low. Nobody stops reading a blog post to enroll in college classes. But that’s okay—the marketers at BSU aren’t going for clicks. Instead, they’re going for (meaningful, lasting) impressions.</p>
<p>This is a great example of <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/banner-ad-examples/">banner ad</a> copy that gets prospects thinking. Maybe it’s just me, but when I look at this ad, I can’t help but think: <em>What would it look like for me to go beyond? </em>All of a sudden, I’m picturing myself in a classroom. Although I wouldn’t click on this ad, there’s no denying its memorability. Sometimes, that’s all that matters.</p>
<h3>2. Liberty University</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-intro-liberty-university.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Liberty University" width="624" height="90" /></div>
<p>Here we have another example from a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/08/04/higher-education-marketing">higher education advertiser</a>—one that’s effective for completely different reasons. First, I love the image on the left side of the ad; I think it evokes a feeling of community, of being part of something bigger than yourself. Never underestimate the power of a simple visual.</p>
<p>Secondly, the copy addresses a common complaint about online college: that it fails to deliver the benefits of a traditional university. By reassuring prospective students they’ll enjoy the flexibility of online classes and the advantages of a physical campus, the marketers at Liberty effectively erase some of the skepticism surrounding their offer.</p>
<h3>3. AutoZone</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-intro-auto-zone.jpg" alt="banner ad example from AutoZone" width="383" height="321" /></div>
<p>Shifting gears (zing) to an entirely different industry, here we have a banner ad example from AutoZone. Referring to a specific <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/28/pain-points">pain point</a> that your product or service alleviates is a fantastic copywriting tactic; in this case, it’s the all-too-relatable scenario of seeing your check engine light rear its ugly head. Mimicking this approach is a great way to grab your prospects’ attention.</p>
<p>Bonus points to AutoZone for their geotargeting efforts. By providing the address and business hours of a nearby store, they make the likelihood of conversion considerably higher.</p>
<h3>4. Capital One</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-intro-capital-one.jpg" alt="Capital One" width="397" height="328" /></div>
<p>You don’t need a degree in graphic design to see why this Capital One ad works so well: It’s designed to make <strong>5X </strong>leap off the screen. Like the team at Bridgewater State, the folks who put this winner together understand that clicks aren’t everything. Even if you don’t click that “Learn More” button—credit to them for using a low-pressure <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/20/call-to-action-examples">CTA</a>, as opposed to something aggressive like “Sign Up Today”—you’ll remember that Capital One offers a savings rate 5X higher than the national average.</p>
<p>Bonus points to Capital One for associating their copy and imagery with basketball season.</p>
<h3>5. Big Brothers Big Sisters</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-big-brothers-big-sisters.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Big Brothers Big Sisters" width="238" height="466" /></div>
<p>This banner ad example from Big Brothers Big Sisters demonstrates perfectly how the use of images can greatly enhance the emotional impact of your marketing materials. It sounds obvious, but this ad works largely because the images allow prospects to envision themselves working as big brothers and big sisters.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I think their choice of CTA—“Start Something”—is brilliant. It gives the prospect a real sense of autonomy, no? With just two words, the advertiser sends a wonderful message: You have the power to effect change in this world.</p>
<h3>6. nCino</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-ncino.jpg" alt="banner ad example from nCino" width="563" height="155" /></div>
<p>Those of you who operate in competitive spaces understand the importance of establishing your authority as a brand. That’s exactly what the nCino marketing team does here with the headline copy: “The worldwide leader in cloud banking software.” That’s a bold statement—one that makes the nCino brand name stick around in your mind.</p>
<p>Additionally, I think the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/20/call-to-action-buttons'">CTA button</a> is perfectly placed; it attracts the eye as soon as you’re done scanning the headline copy. Plus, the marketers at nCino understand that they’re working with a long sales cycle—hence the use of a low-pressure CTA. They probably could have created a <em>bit </em>more contrast between the button color and the background color, but we’ll give ’em a pass.</p>
<h3>7. Disney+</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-disney2B.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Disney+" width="624" height="170" /></div>
<p>The effectiveness of this Disney+ banner ad can be summed up with a single word: <strong>exclusivity</strong>. More than anything, this ad serves as a reminder that <em>Disney+ has content you can’t (legally) get anywhere else.</em> No matter what you’re advertising, exclusivity is a heck of a sales pitch. If you have something that none of your competitors can replicate, make it known to the world.</p>
<p>Bonus points to Disney+ for nailing it with their CTA. Even if you don’t click that blue button, you’ll remember that Disney+ is offering a free trial. Next time you’re itching for an <em>Iron Man </em>marathon, you’ll know where to go.</p>
<h3>8. Amazon Web Services (AWS)</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-aws.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Amazon Web Services" width="593" height="163" /></div>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with using a statement to establish your brand authority. If, for example, the AWS marketing team simply wrote, “AWS is more reliable than the next major cloud provider,” I wouldn’t take issue with it. That being said, taking the <strong>cold, hard stats approach</strong> is infinitely more effective. Rather than asking us to simply take their word for it, the AWS team anchors their industry-leading status to a specific number—i.e., that they boasted 7X fewer downtime hours in 2018 than their closest competitor.</p>
<p>That, my friends, is good <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/03/14/ppc-ad-copywriting">copywriting</a>.</p>
<h3>9. DocuSign</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-docusign.jpg" alt="banner ad example from DocuSign" width="624" height="172" /></div>
<p>Here, thanks to DocuSign, we have our first banner ad example that illustrates the power of creating a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/10/curiosity-gap">curiosity gap</a>—that is, using your copy to inspire intrigue in your prospects’ minds. Once you’ve read that headline, you can’t help but wonder: What are the six overlooked strategies that deliver rapid growth? The only way to find out, of course, is to read the ebook.</p>
<p>The marketers at DocuSign clearly have a strong understanding of how display advertising fits into the marketing funnel. Since it’s unlikely that you’ll get someone to buy your product or service with a simple banner ad, it’s wise to offer something small (e.g., a free ebook).</p>
<h3>10. Ridge</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-ridge.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Ridge" width="624" height="171" /></div>
<p>Some things truly never go out of style. Exhibit A: the side-by-side comparison tactic. There’s a reason marketers have been employing it for decades: It’s a simple, direct, and <em>painfully clear </em>way to communicate the value of your product or service. It takes a fraction of a fraction of a second to understand what our friends at Ridge are trying to tell us. Awkward, clunky wallets are a thing of the past; if you want to keep up with the times, you have no choice but to upgrade to a slimmer, sleeker model.</p>
<p>Ask yourself: Could I substitute this copy for a side-by-side comparison image? If the answer is yes, the latter is often the right decision.</p>
<h3>11. USA Today</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-usa-today.jpg" alt="banner ad example from USA Today" width="624" height="44" /></div>
<p>The one and only <em>native </em>banner ad example included in this collection comes to us courtesy of the good people at USA Today. The best part of this ad, of course, is the way it inspires <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/05/how-to-increase-urgency">urgency</a>. It’s never a bad idea to let your prospects know that they only have X hours left to take advantage of whatever promotion you’re running at the moment.</p>
<p>As the icing on the cake, “Go Ad-Free” is a fantastic CTA. Why? Because it tells USA Today’s readers <em>what they’ll actually get </em>if they opt into this limited-time deal. Would the ad be worthless if the CTA were “Sign Me Up” rather than “Go Ad-Free”? No way. But if you want to write banner ad copy that’s truly effective, focusing on outcomes is a great approach.</p>
<h3>12. Allbirds</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-allbirds.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Allbirds" width="317" height="271" /></div>
<p>Say it with me, folks: You don’t have to choose between writing copy that’s catchy and writing copy that’s effective. In other words, it’s possible to write copy that both sticks in your prospects’ minds <em>and </em>communicates the value of your product or service.</p>
<p>Take this Allbirds ad, for instance. While there’s no denying that “Slip ‘em on, move along” is a catchy, memorable tagline, this copy is much cleverer than it initially seems. Why? Because it tells you (in a rather subtle way, admittedly) what it is, exactly, that makes Allbirds shoes such a wise decision: They’re easy and comfortable to wear. Whereas some footwear is a hassle to deal with, Allbirds’ selection is all about convenience.</p>
<h3>13. Staples</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-staples.jpg" alt="banner ad example Staples" width="345" height="290" /></div>
<p>Sometimes, it’s best to take the dead-simple route. Although newer businesses may want to adopt the Allbirds approach and shoot for memorability, established brands shouldn’t be afraid to be direct. Is this example from Staples the sexiest <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/09/ad-design">banner ad</a> I’ve ever seen? Nope—not by a long shot. But then again, who cares?</p>
<p>This ad was created for one reason and one reason only: to remind shoppers that Staples is the best place to go when you’re trying to save money. I’d argue that it’s accomplished that goal with flying colors. Plus, the design of the ad is flawless. Notice how your eyes are naturally drawn to the “Shop Now” CTA button? Most certainly <em>not </em>an accident.</p>
<h3>14. Apple</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-apple.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Apple" width="624" height="88" /></div>
<p>Much like our friends at Ridge, Apple goes with the trusty side-by-side approach and communicates a clear, powerful message: Our credit card comes with no fees. Every other credit card comes with a lot of fees. This is a particularly strong ad because, as we saw with the Liberty University example, it makes a point to address a common pain point for those in the market for a credit card (i.e., having to deal with inexplicable fees).</p>
<p>Elsewhere, “Apply in minutes” is an excellent CTA. Not only does it call prospects to action, but it also communicates a secondary <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">value proposition</a>: <em>Applying for our credit card is quick and easy. </em>Don’t be afraid to kill two birds with one CTA.</p>
<h3>15. Microsoft</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-microsoft.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Microsoft" width="624" height="93" /></div>
<p>There’s a lesson to be learned from this Microsoft banner ad: You can write copy with the intention of making your prospects feel as if they’re in the driver’s seat. Allow me to explain.</p>
<p>Nobody would bat an eye if the copy for this ad said, “Build and develop apps with Azure. Start your free trial today.” Bad copy? Not necessarily. <em>Generic </em>copy? Emphatically so. And if your banner ad copy fails to engage prospects in a meaningful way, then what’s the point?</p>
<p>This ad is brilliant because it reworks the “Start your free trial today” cliché in a way that makes prospects feel autonomous. Typically, a free trial is restricted to a set amount of time determined by the advertiser. Here, Microsoft flips that expectation on its head; all of a sudden, the <em>consumer </em>gets to decide when the free trial stops and the pay period begins.</p>
<p>It’s a simple switch, but it makes a massive impact.</p>
<h3>16. Amazon</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-amazon.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Amazon" width="624" height="91" /></div>
<p>People don’t make purchase decisions based <em>solely </em>on price; often, a consumer will opt for a particular product or service because it somehow aligns with their personal values.</p>
<p>Clearly, the marketers at Amazon have an appreciation for this tendency. In a country where half the working population is employed by a small business, it’s no surprise that so many people are passionate about supporting the little guy. Here in the US, it’s not uncommon to hear someone say that they went with Product X or Service Y specifically because it was sold by a small business.</p>
<p>Advertising the fact that small businesses <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/23/selling-on-amazon">sell on Amazon</a> is a savvy move—one that everyone can learn from. If you can align your brand with a principle or movement that prospects hold dear, you’ll drive some serious results.</p>
<h3>17. Wikibuy</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-wikibuy.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Wikibuy" width="624" height="89" /></div>
<p>And speaking of Amazon, our next banner ad example comes from a company that helps make online shopping more affordable: Wikibuy. As you tell from this side-by-side banner, Wikibuy offers a price comparison browser extension that scans stores in search of the best deals.</p>
<p>To me, what’s unique about <em>this </em>side-by-side comparison is that it communicates Wikibuy’s value proposition through a specific, tangible product—an Xbox controller. If Wikibuy ran a banner ad that simply said, “We make online shopping cheaper,” it wouldn’t resonate nearly as much. By anchoring their value prop to something concrete that many consumers will recognize, Wikibuy significantly enhances the impact of their ad.</p>
<h3>18. UMass Dartmouth</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-umass-dartmouth.jpg" alt="banner ad example from UMass Dartmouth" width="327" height="276" /></div>
<p>Wikibuy uses a specific product to make their banner ad resonate more deeply with their prospects; UMass Dartmouth, in a similar vein, uses a specific <em>person</em>. This, in my opinion, is a textbook example of how you can take the satisfaction of your <em>current </em>customers (or students) and use it to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/07/12/get-more-customers">win </a><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/07/12/get-more-customers"><em>new </em></a><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/07/12/get-more-customers">customers</a> (or students).</p>
<p>Here’s why the inclusion of Jill makes this banner ad so effective: She invites UMass Dartmouth’s prospects to envision themselves as MBA students. Remember when I said Bridgewater State’s ad made me think about what it would mean for me to “go beyond”? This is practically the same idea. If you can get your prospects to think about what it would be like to be your customer, you’re making strides.</p>
<h3>19. Hulu</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-hulu.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Hulu" width="327" height="276" /></div>
<p>Nothing too philosophical to discuss here, my friends; the Hulu marketing team is trying to inspire that sense of urgency I’ve mentioned a few times. Though they’re far from reinventing the wheel, I want to give credit where credit is due. I like what they’ve done with the heading and the subhead; emphasizing “Limited-Time Offer” and driving it home with the crossed-out price tactic is a strong approach.</p>
<p>Bonus points to Hulu for perfect placement of the CTA button. No matter what you’re advertising, design your banner ads in such a way that prospects’ eyes are naturally drawn to your CTA buttons. Here, Hulu uses the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/31/f-z-patterns-landing-page-design">F-pattern design</a>. It’s fool-proof!</p>
<h3>20. Invisalign</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-invisalign.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Invisalign" width="370" height="314" /></div>
<p>Here, thanks to Invisalign, we have another example of the curiosity gap. I have no idea what a smile assessment entails, but you better believe I want to find out. As Buzzfeed has proven time and again over the years, people go <em>bananas </em>for free online quizzes. If you can think of a way to create a free online quiz that pertains to your product or service, go for it!</p>
<p>Here’s why a banner ad is the perfect way to advertise such a quiz: The people you’re reaching with banner ads are typically at the top of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/07/marketing-funnel">marketing funnel</a>. As such, very few of them are ready to take any kind of action that involves payment. Because a free online quiz is, uh, free, it’s a fantastic way to move new prospects further down your funnel.</p>
<h3>21. Dyson</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-dyson.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Dyson" width="352" height="295" /></div>
<p>If the AWS ad and the UMass Dartmouth ad got together and started a family, this example from Dyson would be their glorious child. Why say “We make 5-star products” or “Our products will exceed your expectations” when you can use a customer testimonial to say <em>both </em>of those things in a much more organic and believable way?</p>
<p>If you want to go one step further—and why wouldn’t you?—I’d encourage you to combine the power of a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/05/customer-testimonials">testimonial</a> with the power of visual imagery (i.e., a picture of your product <strong>in action</strong>). As much as I like this Dyson ad, it would be slightly better if we saw a customer actually using the product being promoted.</p>
<h3>22. AAA</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-aaa.jpg" alt="banner ad example from AAA" width="358" height="305" /></div>
<p>This is hands-down the <strong>best </strong>use of visual imagery out of the whole bunch. When I look at this picture of the woman inspecting under the hood, I immediately flash back to all the times I’ve found myself stranded on the side of the road. With those flashbacks, of course, come all the associated emotions: frustration, anger, anxiety, and so on. Emotions like these are incredibly good motivators—which is why AAA is tapping them to get people to sign up.</p>
<p>Think about the emotions you want to stir inside your prospects. Then, think about how you can use simple, direct imagery to get the job done. If you’re truly thoughtful, you’ll put together some winning banner ads.</p>
<h3>23. One A Day</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-one-a-day.jpg" alt="banner ad example from One A Day" width="624" height="88" /></div>
<p>Here’s another great example of a banner ad that directly addresses a common myth. In this case, One A Day is undermining the idea that being health conscious is complicated and time-consuming. As this ad does a stellar job of communicating, all it takes to improve your nutrition is a single daily supplement.</p>
<p>I love the design of this banner, too; I think the use of bright colors is an effective way to cast a positive light on top of the messaging. Plus, making the CTA “Save Now” rather than “Buy Now” is a tremendous way to sneak an additional value proposition into the ad.</p>
<h3>24. Liberty Mutual</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-liberty-mutual.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Liberty Mutual" width="361" height="300" /></div>
<p>Finally, we’ve got this winner from insurance provider Liberty Mutual. Unsurprisingly, it’s the copy (and value prop) that I’m most fond of: <em>We’ll do the work while you save money</em>.</p>
<p>What makes this banner ad <em>great </em>rather than <em>good </em>is the use of a specific number ($782). Again, it’s all about making your message <strong>resonate</strong>. If Liberty Mutual simply said, “You could save money,” that wouldn’t make much of an impact on their prospects.</p>
<p>When someone sees $782, their mind goes straight to all the things they could do with those savings: pay rent, make a car payment, put a dent in their debt, etc. In other words, the inclusion of a specific number makes this ad emotional—and, therefore, far more memorable.</p>
<p>If the main value prop behind your banner ad is savings, consider using a specific number.</p>
<h2>Let these banner ads examples inspire your next campaign!</h2>
<p>Like I said earlier, we all need creative inspiration every now and then. So take a look at these great examples, get your ideas rolling, and then get started on your next campaign—complete with your own clickable banner ads!</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">If you’re a Google advertiser, you probably received an email from the search giant in your inbox yesterday afternoon. The message? <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/23/responsive-display-ads">Responsive display ads</a> are replacing legacy display ads in your Google Display Network (GDN) campaigns.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What does this change mean for display advertisers? Let’s dig in.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What are responsive display ads?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/07/27/responsive-display-ads">Debuted in 2016</a>, responsive display ads were originally introduced as an alternative to text ads on the display network. They’ve since (as of summer of 2018, to be exact) become the default ad type for display advertisers on the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/18/google-display-network-tips">GDN</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Responsive display ads are Google’s answer to text ads that just didn’t show enough and to banner ads that just didn’t say enough: These ads contain both visual and textual creative assets. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="d8429653-1722-4448-82fe-b945432cb951" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/responsive-ads-hotels_0_1.png" alt="Responsive Display Ads" width="650" height="400" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center" dir="ltr"><em>A collection of responsive display ads. </em></p>
<p dir="ltr">In terms of ad copy, responsive display ads require:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">A short headline (25 characters)</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">A long headline (90 characters)</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">A description (90 characters)</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Your business name (25 characters)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Google Ads will never run both your headlines at the same time, and depending on the location in which your ad ends up, it may not show your description.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Speaking of location: It’s a pivotal part of the ad type. Google uses machine learning to test thousands of different combinations of your visual and textual assets. The idea here is to:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Find tailored messaging that most highly resonates with your customers.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Fill as much inventory as possible on the Google Display Network.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">“Inventory” includes Native, Text, and Banner ad spaces. In real time, Google truncates text, scales images, and chooses different textual combinations to deliver customized ads across the GDN.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Because responsive display ads are eligible for a higher percentage of inventory, advertisers have been running them in conjunction with traditional display ad types often see higher delivery and spend numbers coming via their responsive display ads. They also often see higher click-through rates (CTR), as Google generally does a pretty good job of generating ads that yield clicks.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What are legacy display ads?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Speaking of traditional display ads: What exactly do we mean here? Are these the same as “legacy display ads?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Not quite. Traditional display ads—the banner ads that most advertisers use, know, and love—aren’t going anywhere. These come in a variety of sizes, and making image creative that caters to Google’s specifications is quite a challenge for advertisers.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="4dd4d8b5-d835-4e7c-85e3-cd9a0e290b7b" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-display-banner-ad-sizes_0.png" alt="Google Display Banner Ad Sizes" width="650" height="363" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">Banner ads are a staple of Display for many advertisers; fortunately, they’re not going anywhere.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When we say “legacy” display ads, we’re talking about two ad types specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Smart display ads</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Legacy dynamic responsive template (Template ID: 491)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">If you’re using either of these ad formats in your campaigns, be on the lookout—this is where you’re accounts going to look a little different in the coming days.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What exactly is changing?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Per Google, advertisers that are using smart display ads or the legacy dynamic responsive template are going to see the following changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“Starting November 2019, responsive display ads will replace legacy display ads in Google ads &#8230; With this change, any campaigns running legacy display ads may stop serving unless there is an alternate display ad available in the campaign.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Simple enough, right? If you’re running any campaigns that solely utilize <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/25/smart-ads-for-google-display">smart display ads</a> or the legacy dynamic responsive template, or that mostly consist of these ad types, those campaigns are going to start underdelivering or pausing delivery altogether in November.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Naturally, this is going to affect your spending. Luckily, Google has taken some measures to help advertisers make the switch from the old ad format to the new one.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you’re using either of the above-mentioned ad types, come November you’re going to see brand new responsive display ads in your account that use the same creative assets you were using in your legacy display ads. Google has done the work of creating these for you. They’ve also made sure to indefinitely pause them—so your new ads won’t run in place of the old ones unless you tell them to.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What should I do?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">In a nutshell: You should press play on the new responsive display ads Google has created for you. You should then monitor your campaigns to track for discrepancies in performance. Advertisers that have not yet made the switch to responsive to display ads, in all likelihood, have not done so because they either haven’t gotten around to it, or they’re stuck in an old way of doing things.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Responsive display ads are a great innovation. Those who malign Google’s increased propensity to push automated ad formats and processes as ways of making money off advertisers can rest easy on this one. Yes, responsive display ads spend more, because they allow advertisers to access more inventory across the GDN; but that’s also their magic.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Advertisers who have yet to make the switch to this new ad format will most likely see marked increases in reach and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/29/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks">click-through rate</a> as result of using more click-worthy ads that can access a broader range of placements.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">How do I optimize my new responsive display ads?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Luckily, there’s not too much you have to do to ensure your new responsive display ads outperform your old legacy display ads. That said, Google recommends taking the following measures to ensure your r<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/22/maximize-ROI-with-responsive-search-ads">esponsive ads will maximize your ROI</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Review your new responsive display ads and update any creative assets that you’d like to change.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Add multiple creative assets such as your headlines, descriptions, images, and logos.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Resume your new ads so they start running.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">In a nutshell, you don’t have to, but you should really take this opportunity to make sure your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/09/ad-design">visual</a> and textual assets, including your images and your business name, are up-to-date, as well as adding additional images, headlines, descriptions and logos. It will help Google test more combinations of your ad across the GDN to see what resonates with your audience and what doesn’t.</p>
