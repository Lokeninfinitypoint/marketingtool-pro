<h2>How to write a newsletter</h2>
<p>Crafting the perfect newsletter involves many details and moving parts, so to focus on the essence, we’ll distill it down to the key elements of a good-performing newsletter: subject line, preview text, introduction, email copy, graphics, and layout, calls to action, and footer elements. You may opt to use AI to help you write your newsletter&#8211;or you might want to create it on your own! You can move forward either way with these steps&#8211;just make sure to edit any AI-generated copy for accuracy and tone.</p>
<div id="determine-the-topic-for-your-newsletter"></div>
<h3>1. Determine the topic(s) for your newsletter</h3>
<p>Your newsletter is your chance to build a strong, meaningful connection with your customers. For small businesses, it is a unique opportunity to stay in front of customers without navigating social media and search engine algorithms, where they have to compete against some of the biggest brands. <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/email-marketing-trends-2025/">Email marketing</a> puts you on a level playing field, and it’s only up to your creativity whether you’ll get noticed.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: It’s not about selling every second. You need to offer value to your customers. Whether it’s useful tips, behind-the-scenes peeks, or solving a problem they didn’t even know they had, your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/monthly-email-newsletter-ideas/">newsletter ideas</a> should speak directly to your audience&#8217;s needs and interests, not just your latest product launch. Keep it fresh and relevant so people actually look forward to reading your emails.</p>

<div id="draft-a-hook-worthy-introduction"></div>
<h3>2. Draft a hook-worthy introduction</h3>
<p>Once subscribers open your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/email-marketing-checklist/">email marketing newsletter</a>, the introduction or hook is your chance to grab their attention from the get-go. Whether you use a bold statement, a surprising fact, or an intriguing question, make it something that piques readers’ curiosity and makes them think, “I need to know more.” You can also use humor as a way to show your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/brand-personality-messaging">brand personality</a> and make your newsletter more relatable.</p>
<p>But remember: the introduction is setting the tone for what’s next. If your intro promises something exciting, your content better deliver.</p>
<div id="close-out-with-a-strong-call-to-action"></div>
<h3>3. Close out with a strong call to action</h3>
<p>You’ve created the perfect hook with the introduction and your newsletter content is exciting and engaging—great job! The question the reader has is: “What’s next?” If you don’t provide a clear <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">call to action</a>, you leave readers hanging.</p>
<p>To capitalize on the momentum, make sure you use a strong call to action. Whether checking out a product, reading a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/06/irresistible-blog-post-titles">blog post</a>, or signing up for an event, make it clear and easy to follow.</p>
<p>When announcing their new collection, Cotopaxi used a straightforward call to action for subscribers to sign up and get early access. If you have a goal in mind you want to achieve, don’t overwhelm customers with different calls to action.</p>

<div id="add-in-graphics-and-the-right-layout"></div>
<h3>4. Add in graphics and the right layout</h3>
<p>We live in a visual world, and people are visual creatures. <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2014/in-the-blink-of-an-eye-0116" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIT research</a> shows that the human brain processes images in 13 to 33 milliseconds, 60,000 times faster than text. Graphics and layout add a visual punch to your newsletter’s content. They’re what make it scroll-worthy and not just another wall of text.</p>
<p>Graphics can help you break things up, highlight key points, or add personality. The right mix of text and visuals can guide your reader’s eyes, keep them engaged, and help your message hit home without overwhelming them. Focus on simple, smart design, and expect more clicks and a bigger impact.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/user-generated-content">User-generated content</a> or authentic-looking visuals can be a great way to make your brand feel real. People can tell when something’s been overly staged or looks too “perfect.” Authentic visuals make your brand feel more relatable and down-to-earth, which is exactly the vibe you want if you’re building trust.</p>
<p>Take BANGS shoes, for example. They use natural-looking visuals that give the person-next-door vibe. Their messaging is aligned with their visuals—focusing on the small things, staying true to yourself, and being unique.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/newsletter-example-graphics.webp" alt="newsletter example with graphics" width="346" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93045" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/newsletter-example-graphics.webp 346w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/newsletter-example-graphics-115x300.webp 115w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px" /></p>
<div id="choose-a-compelling-subject-line"></div>
<h3>5. Choose a compelling subject line</h3>
<p>The subject line serves as your virtual doormat. It’s the first thing people see when they receive your email. If you don’t get the subject line right, everything else becomes a waste of time because your newsletter will end up in the trash or stuck in the pile of emails left unread.</p>
<p>But what makes a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/31/email-subject-lines">subject line</a> click-worthy? A solid email subject line should sum up the key message, the value, or the point of the email in a way that makes people want to click. Easier said than done, though, right? Here are some best practices to help you write attention-grabbing subject lines for your newsletter.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep it short.</strong> Data shows that <a href="https://audiencepoint.com/what-percentage-of-emails-are-opened-on-mobile-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50-60%</a> of email opens come from mobile devices. So, if you want to convey the right message, no matter the device the readers are using, keep your subject lines short.</li>
<li><strong>Use emojis (carefully).</strong> When done right, using emojis in your subject lines can grab attention and add personality. Today, emojis are an integral part of people’s communication, which makes them relatable. The best part? They are great at triggering emotions. But remember, you should use them strategically and not overdo them. For some brands, such as Drunk Elephant, emojis are part of the brand personality, which makes them instantly pop up in the inbox.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/newsletter-subject-line-emojis.webp" alt="newsletter subject line with emojis" width="900" height="556" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93043" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/newsletter-subject-line-emojis.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/newsletter-subject-line-emojis-480x297.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spark curiosity.</strong> Curiosity may have killed the cat, but it’s what gets your newsletter opened. Tease just enough to make people wonder what’s inside, but don’t give it all away. But be careful—you have to find the right balance. Readers will think they’re getting clickbait if you make it too cryptic. Keep it intriguing, not frustrating.</li>
<li><strong>Use A/B testing.</strong> There’s no shortcut or secret formula for a good-performing subject line. To find what works for your newsletter subscribers, test different variations, wording, length, or emojis, and see which gets the best response. The jewelry brand Maison Miru frequently uses <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/11/copywriting-ab-tests">A/B testing</a> for different subject lines.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ab-test-newsletter-copy.webp" alt="newsletter a/b test example" width="730" height="694" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93044" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ab-test-newsletter-copy.webp 730w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ab-test-newsletter-copy-480x456.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 730px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="add-intriguing-preview-text"></div>
<h3>6. Add intriguing preview text</h3>
<p>The preview text is one of the most underrated elements of a newsletter, and it’s often either left out or filled in with random text. And let’s not forget the frequently used “view this email in your browser.” Preview text is like the backstage pass to your email–it’s the little teaser that gives people a sneak peek at what&#8217;s inside. If your subject line got them curious, the preview text is your chance to seal the deal. Be clever, compelling, and make it count.</p>
<p>The Sill, a house plant delivery brand, uses newsletter preview text to create a sense of urgency and give readers a glimpse of what to expect. You can spot them using preview text such as “just days left to save” or “limited stock available” to urge plant lovers to seize the opportunity.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/newsletter-copy-example-the-sill.webp" alt="newsletter preview text example from the sill" width="900" height="350" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93048" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/newsletter-copy-example-the-sill.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/newsletter-copy-example-the-sill-480x187.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="close-out-with-your-footer-elements"></div>
<h3>7. Close out with your footer elements</h3>
<p>The footer of your newsletter is the last thing people see, but it’s also your last chance to engage. Unfortunately, many small businesses treat the footer as an afterthought rather than a prime real estate for reinforcing your brand and giving readers other ways to connect with you.</p>
<p>Here are some of the essential elements of a newsletter footer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contact details:</strong> Include an email, physical address, or both, so people know how they can reach out.</li>
<li><strong>Email preferences/Unsubscribe link:</strong> You are legally obliged to include the unsubscribe link. So, if people want to opt out, make it easy for them to do so.</li>
<li><strong>Legal disclaimers:</strong> If you have any legal disclaimers, especially for your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/promotion-ideas">promotional newsletters</a>, include them in the footer to ensure compliance.</li>
<li><strong>Social media links:</strong> Give readers another way to connect with you and stay in the loop on your updates.</li>
</ul>
<p>The footer of your newsletter doesn’t need to be boring. Take Smalls, the fresh human-grade cat food delivery brand, for example. They use the footer to add all the necessary elements while being playful and engaging. Even more important, they make it easy to reach out to them, whether through text or email.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/newsletter-footer-example.webp" alt="newsletter footer example" width="489" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93049" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/newsletter-footer-example.webp 489w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/newsletter-footer-example-480x589.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 489px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="best-practices-for-stand-out-newsletters"></div>
<h2>Bonus: 6 tips and best practices for newsletters that stand out</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve covered all the key elements, it’s time to share tips and best practices to help you create an outstanding newsletter.</p>
<div id="send-personalized-newsletters"></div>
<h3>1. Send personalized newsletters</h3>
<p>According to Ascend2, email comes out on top when it comes to the digital channels seeing the most impact from personalization, with about <a href="https://www.marketingcharts.com/customer-centric/personalization-customer-centric-224553" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6 in 10 (62%)</a> of marketers saying so. Personalization is more than just using someone’s name at the top. It’s about making customers feel like you get them.</p>
<p>From recommending products based on past purchases to sending content aligned with their interests, personalization makes your readers feel seen. The skincare and beauty brand Tatcha collects birthday information when subscribers sign up for its newsletter. They use the information to offer customers a birthday discount on their next purchase.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/birthday-newsletter-example-tatcha.webp" alt="birthday newsletter example from tatcha" width="519" height="700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93050" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/birthday-newsletter-example-tatcha.webp 519w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/birthday-newsletter-example-tatcha-480x647.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 519px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f9e0.png" alt="🧠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Get copywriting psychology insights in our free guide &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite26BrilliantWaysToUsePsychology.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_TextLink_guide_26waysPsychGuide_Download">25+ Brilliant Ways to Use Psychology in Your Copywriting</a></p>
<div id="take-customers-behind-the-scenes"></div>
<h3>2. Take customers behind the scenes</h3>
<p>Behind-the-scenes content is your golden ticket to turning your product from a faceless item into something people can connect with. Show them how the magic happens–whether it’s the design process, the craftsmanship, or the people behind it all. People love knowing the story behind what they’re buying, and letting them in on the process makes them feel like they’re part of the journey.</p>
<p>The furniture and accessories brand Swoon Editions did this by showing the step-by-step process of making one of their most iconic designs, the Ziggy cabinet.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/newsletter-behind-the-scenes-example.webp" alt="newsletter behind the scenes example" width="496" height="700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93051" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/newsletter-behind-the-scenes-example.webp 496w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/newsletter-behind-the-scenes-example-480x677.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 496px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="use-quizzes-to-engage-subscribers"></div>
<h3>3. Use quizzes to engage subscribers</h3>
<p>“I don’t like quizzes!”—said no one ever. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/interactive-content">Quizzes</a> are not just fun, they are a great way to engage your audience. A well-designed quiz can give people a reason to open your email, click around, and learn more about your products or services in a way that feels interactive.</p>
<p>The best part: you get valuable insights into your readers&#8217; preferences and behaviors, which gives you a goldmine of information to personalize your next newsletter. The skincare and beauty products brand Bliss uses a quiz to help subscribers find the perfect product for their routine. The bonus part is the exclusive offer they get with the results.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/newsletter-quiz-example.webp" alt="newsletter quiz example" width="380" height="700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93052" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/newsletter-quiz-example.webp 380w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/newsletter-quiz-example-163x300.webp 163w" sizes="(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px" /></p>
<div id="create-a-freebie"></div>
<h3>4. Create a freebie</h3>
<p>Who doesn’t love free stuff? Offering a freebie, whether it’s a downloadable guide, an exclusive discount, or a sneak peek of something new, is a great way to add value and keep your readers coming back for more. Moreover, this will boost engagement and get people excited about what you’re offering.</p>
<p>Gainful, a personalized and curated sports nutrition supplements brand, has created a cookbook with recipes for healthy meals and snacks that include its products. Subscribers get free recipes, and Gainful gets more engagement—a win-win.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/newsletter-freebie-example.webp" alt="newsletter freebie example" width="291" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93053" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/newsletter-freebie-example.webp 291w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/newsletter-freebie-example-109x300.webp 109w" sizes="(max-width: 291px) 100vw, 291px" /></p>
<div id="use-storytelling"></div>
<h3>5. Use storytelling</h3>
<p>If you want people to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/marketing-newsletters">subscribe to and engage with your newsletter</a>, don’t share just promotions and limited-time deals. People want a story they can connect with. Small business owners have the best stories. So why not share them with your readers? Whether it&#8217;s how your company started, a customer success story, or the journey behind a product, a good story humanizes your brand and makes readers care.</p>
<p>The superfoods brand, NoonBrew shared a personal story from its creative director about her struggles with insomnia. A well-told story creates an emotional hook that keeps people reading and makes them more connected to the brand.</p>

<h3>6. Involve subscribers and offer an incentive</h3>
<p>Don’t make your newsletter a one-way street. Use it to build relationships with your customers. People love feeling like their voice matters, and when you invite them to share their thoughts, it shows you care about what they think, and you&#8217;re genuinely interested in improving and serving them better.</p>
<p>Aura Bora used this approach to ask customers to vote for their favorite flavors that should be part of the summer pack. In return, customers received 15% off their next order. Involving your audience makes them feel like they’re part of the process, and that’s the kind of loyalty money can’t buy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One characteristic all successful marketers seem to share is curiosity. You’re always on the hunt for the next big idea or tactic to try.</p>
<p>Marketing newsletters are a great source of info to feed that curiosity. So, I asked a bunch of marketers which ones they loved most.</p>
<p>I filtered out newsletters from big-name marketing gurus (sorry, Seth Godin). That way, you’d only get options that share ground-level, relatable strategies to use in your everyday work.</p>
<p>I also reached out to several of the newsletter authors to get a little behind-the-scenes scoop about what they write and who it’s for. That’ll help you decide which are most worthy of your valuable time.</p>

<h2>8 of the best marketing newsletters out there</h2>
<p>The list of recommended <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/25/email-newsletter-ideas">marketing newsletters</a> ended up being nicely well-rounded. There are options for marketing niches like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/08/content-creator">content creators</a> as well as big-picture publications for all you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/28/growth-strategy">growth gurus</a>.</p>
<div id="contentious"></div>
<h3>1. Contentious: Best for learning how to make your mark as a content marketer</h3>
<p><a href="https://linktr.ee/asklaurenlang" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contentious</a>, besides having a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/01/05/creative-newsletter-names">cool name</a>, is a quickly digestible <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-write-a-newsletter">monthly newsletter</a> by content marketer and coach <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/asklaurenlang/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauren Lang</a>. It focuses on helping content marketers show the value of their work, both to their teams and personally.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-contentious-png.webp" alt="Marketing newsletters - Contentious screenshot." width="776" height="759" class="aligncenter wp-image-89864 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-contentious-png.webp 776w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-contentious-480x469.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 776px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>You have to love a writer who can build a hook around hot dog water.</em></p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/18/content-marketing-examples">Content marketing</a> is in a really precarious position at most companies. It can be misunderstood. Not just by senior leadership, but by your own marketing peers,” Lauren said. “We are more cross-functional and less transactional than a lot of marketing functions, and sometimes even marketing leaders don&#8217;t know what to do with us.”</p>
<p>This topic can get a bit existential at times. But Lauren breaks it down into bite-sized bits and presents them so readers have an actionable takeaway. “Each issue includes three sections on a topic like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/customer-data">using data</a> or working with SMEs: an actionable tip, an anti-pattern like a major misconception or common mistake, and a big idea that tackles a more philosophical angle,” she explained.</p>
<p>Personally, I love how vulnerable and transparent Lauren is in her writing. Many content marketers struggle with connecting the dots between a blog or social media post and a line item on the revenue report. Lauren shares her own journey, making the tips feel more personal and rooted in experience.</p>
<h4>The past issue you need to read</h4>
<p>The C-suite aren’t the only people who may miss the value of content marketing. Sometimes, it’s your own customers. In <a href="https://asklaurenlang.substack.com/p/3-i-can-see-for-miles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this issue of Contentious</a>, Lauren hilariously shows how her tough <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a>—engineering leaders—often spurns any attempts at connection. Then, she shares how she’s working to get them on board.</p>

<h3>2. Tom’s Marketing Ideas: Best for quick-win marketing tactics with a short time-to-value</h3>
<p>Each week, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomorbach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Orbach</a> sends a new marketing tip to the subscribers of <a href="https://www.marketingideas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom’s Marketing Ideas</a>. What you’ll quickly notice when you read an issue of his newsletter is that every idea is something you can<em> sit down and actually do</em> right away.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-toms-marketing-ideas-png.webp" alt="Marketing newsletters - screenshot from Tom's Marketing Ideas." width="779" height="853" class="aligncenter wp-image-89865 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-toms-marketing-ideas-png.webp 779w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-toms-marketing-ideas-480x526.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 779px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Tom gets right down to business in each issue of Tom’s Marketing Ideas.</em></p>
<p>“I started Marketing Ideas with a simple rule: if something can&#8217;t be implemented within a week, it doesn&#8217;t make the cut,” he told me.</p>
<p>Tom covers a wide swath of marketing territory in Marketing Ideas. Scroll through past posts, and you’ll see dumb (but useful) career hacks, a three-second hook trick, and tips on picking the perfect color for your next promotion.</p>
<p>I really like that the tactics Tom shares aren’t just amorphous thoughts from the top of his head. “Every Friday, I share one powerful marketing tactic that&#8217;s been battle-tested by real companies, broken down into an actionable playbook,” he said.</p>
<h4>The past issue you need to read</h4>
<p>If you want to get a feel for just how tactical Tom’s newsletter is, read <a href="https://www.marketingideas.com/p/the-billion-dollar-support-ticket" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this issue</a> about leveraging your customer support inbox for million-dollar marketing ideas. It packs several real-world examples and a multi-step playbook into a 90-second read.</p>

<h3>3. Growth Unhinged: Best for getting real-life growth tactics from the smartest startups</h3>
<p>If you’re looking for a deep dive into the go-to-market (GTM) strategies of the fastest-growing startups, <a href="https://www.growthunhinged.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Growth Unhinged</a> by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-poyar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyle Poyar</a> should be in your inbox.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-growth-unhinged-1024x833.webp" alt="Marketing newsletters - screenshot from Growth Unhinged." width="1024" height="833" class="aligncenter wp-image-89866 size-large" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-growth-unhinged-1024x833.webp 1024w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-growth-unhinged-300x244.webp 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-growth-unhinged-768x625.webp 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-growth-unhinged-1080x879.webp 1080w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-growth-unhinged-980x797.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-growth-unhinged-480x391.webp 480w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-growth-unhinged-png.webp 1138w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Each issue of Growth Unhinged features a massive missive written by a different marketing or growth leader. They cover topics like GTM automation, product-led growth failures, and winning over a skeptical company board.</p>
<p>Having a different guest writer for each issue means readers get new perspectives and hard-won knowledge from real-world experience. Kyle says he’s along for the same ride. “Writing Growth Unhinged is my own professional development, letting me learn from the sharpest software founders and leaders on the planet.”</p>
<p>I’ve read several issues of Growth Unhinged, and it’s incredible how informative each one is. I’m amazed that Kyle gets these very busy thought leaders to provide so much of their playbook in such detail.</p>
<h4>The past issue you need to read</h4>
<p>In the midst of our current <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-in-marketing">AI</a> euphoria, it feels like the right move is to prominently promote your newest product as “AI-powered” or “AI-enabled.” In <a href="https://www.growthunhinged.com/p/ai-messaging-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this issue of Growth Unhinged</a>, the co-founder and CEO of Irrational Labs says that decision might turn your audience off—and she has new data to prove it.</p>

<h3>4. Tinkering with Ideas: Best for learning how to automate and improve your workflow</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/annabyang/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anna Burgess Yang</a> is a content marketer who’s becoming known for her expertise in creating and automating marketing workflows. If that sounds a little techy, Anna’s<a href="https://tinkeringwithideas.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Tinkering with Ideas</a> newsletter will bring it back down to earth.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-tinkering-1024x813.webp" alt="Marketing newsletters - screenshot from Tinkering with Ideas." width="1024" height="813" class="aligncenter wp-image-89867 size-large" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-tinkering-1024x813.webp 1024w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-tinkering-300x238.webp 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-tinkering-768x610.webp 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-tinkering-1080x858.webp 1080w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-tinkering-980x778.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-tinkering-480x381.webp 480w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-tinkering-png.webp 1199w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Tinkering with Ideas is full of easy automation how-to guides.</em></p>
<p>“I share a lot of ‘tips and tricks’ online, like apps I use, things I’ve read, or something that makes me smile,” Anna said. “I thought other people might like a short newsletter of quick and easy ways to make their days better.”</p>
<p>Even Anna&#8217;s method for curating new ideas is a lesson in operational efficiency. &#8220;<span>I save ideas all the time,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Maybe it’s something in my everyday life that I find useful or an app I recently checked out. I store all of my ideas in Trello. My newsletters often have a theme, so I’ll find three ideas that are related to each other (even loosely), and those become a future issue.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Past issues detail several ways to cut out busy work from your processes. For example, Anna wrote how to automatically send published articles to Buffer, how to organize research in Google Docs, and automation tips for audio and video files.</p>
<h4>The past issue you need to read</h4>
<p>As her <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/01/05/creative-newsletter-names">newsletter title</a> suggests, Anna tinkers with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-copywriting-tools">tech tools</a> so you don’t have to. This <a href="https://tinkeringwithideas.io/automatically-add-substack-subscribers-to-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issue of Tinkering with Ideas</a> is a great example. In it, she explains how she created a way to automatically add Substack subscribers to her <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/01/email-marketing-tips">email marketing</a> platform Kit (formerly Convertkit).</p>

<h3>5. The Lunch Break: Best for building your personal brand on LinkedIn</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-marchewka/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maria Marchewka</a> has a niche marketing focus. She ghostwrites <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/generating-leads-on-linkedin">LinkedIn content</a> for CEOs. In her newsletter, <a href="https://thelunchbreak.beehiiv.com/subscribe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Lunch Break</a>, Maria leverages that experience to help her readers shine on LinkedIn and beyond.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-lunch-break-png.webp" alt="Marketing newsletters - screenshot from Lunchbreak." width="677" height="726" class="aligncenter wp-image-89868 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-lunch-break-png.webp 677w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-lunch-break-480x515.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 677px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Maria tackles all manner of brand-building topics in The Lunch Break newsletter.</em></p>
<p>“My goal with The Lunch Break<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f374.png" alt="🍴" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />is to make building your personal brand less stressful,” she said.</p>
<p>In each issue, Maria said to expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>LinkedIn tips, advice, and post prompts.</li>
<li>Easy-to-understand lessons to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/07/improve-writing-skills">improve your writing</a>.</li>
<li>Tips on how to start, build, and enjoy the email newsletter writing process.</li>
</ul>
<p>I like that she avoids the standard fare of brand-building tropes. “Every time you scroll, you’re bombarded with a new best practice or a ‘hack’ that guarantees results,” she commiserated. “It’s overwhelming and frustrating. Instead of saying, ‘Post consistently on LinkedIn,’ I’ll give you actual LinkedIn post prompts and examples to help you write your own content.”</p>
<h4>The past issue you need to read</h4>
<p>Writer’s block sucks! For some reason, it seems to hit the hardest with <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/engaging-posts-on-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media content</a>. Maria gives a very cool trick to bust up writer&#8217;s block <a href="https://thelunchbreak.beehiiv.com/p/you-should-try-this-on-linkedin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in this issue of The Lunch Break</a>.</p>
<div id="creative-strategy-newsletter"></div>
<h3>6. Creative Strategy Newsletter: Best for building better paid ad creative</h3>
<p>Creating <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/03/ad-copy-examples">ads that convert</a> is a multi-disciplinary pursuit. You need to know the visual, psychological, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/03/copywriting-examples">copywriting principles</a> that motivate buyer action. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlotte-sargeant-%F0%9F%8E%A8%F0%9F%A4%93-abbb4143/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charlotte Sargeant</a> explores all of these nuances in the <a href="https://thecreativestrategylab.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creative Strategy Newsletter</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-creative-strategy-png.webp" alt="Marketing newsletters - screenshot from Creative Strategy." width="605" height="397" class="aligncenter wp-image-89869 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-creative-strategy-png.webp 605w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-creative-strategy-480x315.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 605px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Charlotte Sargeant gives her subscribers access to additional free resources like copywriting templates.</em></p>
<p>The newsletter was born of Charlotte’s search for repeatable processes. “When I shifted from paid social media buying into creative strategy, I expected to find systems and playbooks to lean on,” she said. “Instead, I found chaos! So, I built my own systems and processes and turned all my findings into a newsletter giving advertisers proven processes, performance-backed ad concepts, and the psychology behind what makes people buy.”</p>
<p>Charlotte said she works behind the scenes with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/02/strategies-to-grow-your-digital-marketing-agency">agencies</a>, brands, freelancers, and ad accounts every week, which fuels new ideas for the newsletter. “I see what&#8217;s working in ad accounts and what&#8217;s hindering businesses in creative production. I turn those insights into systems and processes readers can plug straight into their own work.”</p>
<p>I love Charlotte’s philosophy on creativity. “Creativity is a skill, not a gift,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Once media buyers have the right systems, their creativity takes off!”</p>
<h4>The past issue you need to read</h4>
<p>Charlotte recently sent out a brief guide to writing hooks for ads for gift guides. The newsletter itself had helpful tips in it, but what really stood out was that her subscribers also got another valuable freebie: a link to a list of 10 attention-grabbing hook templates and examples.</p>
<div id="by-popular-demand"></div>
<h3>7. By Popular Demand: Best for adding a little marketing sparkle to your inbox</h3>
<p>I was careful to include only newsletters on this list that had practical advice a marketer in the trenches could use. <a href="https://briannefleming.com/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">By Popular Demand</a> from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/briannefleming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brianne Fleming</a> fits that requirement and does it with a rare flare her readers love.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-by-popular-demand-png.webp" alt="Marketing newsletters - screenshot from By Popular Demand." width="670" height="665" class="aligncenter wp-image-89870 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-by-popular-demand-png.webp 670w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-newsletters-wordstream-by-popular-demand-480x476.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 670px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>By Popular Demand makes learning about marketing fun.</em></p>
<p>As Brianne described it to me, “By Popular Demand is like if Tiger Beat and your favorite business magazine had a baby. It delivers marketing lessons wrapped in Y2K nostalgia, plus the latest in entertainment and pop culture.”</p>
<p>After leafing through a recent issue, I 100% agree. It’s packed with throwback references, hot cultural topics, and reading recs, all tethered to marketing insights. It’s educational, but it doesn’t feel like learning.</p>

<p>Brianne devoted an issue of By Popular Demand to make the case that entertaining your audience still matters even in the age of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/15/multi-touch-attribution">attribution</a>. She shared examples of content that didn’t feel like marketing but that most certainly were (like Oprah’s classic “You get a car!” moment), funny Tweets, and a book recommendation about making fun a habit.</p>

<h3>8. Tether Signal: Best for understanding consumer psychology</h3>
<p>I’m a sucker for learning how our brains work, so I was instantly intrigued by the inspiration behind <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahlevinger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Levinger’s</a> newsletter, <a href="https://www.sarahlevinger.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tether Signal</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Sarah Levinger blends marketing best practices with consumer psychology in her newsletter. </em></p>
<p>“Most of my inspiration comes from the work I do with brands—analyzing customer psychology, running identity-based research panels, and uncovering what actually moves the needle,” Sarah said. “I also pull insights from behavioral science studies, psychology research, and real-world experiments in DTC marketing.”</p>
<p>The content Sarah shares makes good on the promise. Each issue digs into a real-world example of how a brand successfully—and sometimes surprisingly—used psychology to establish a foothold in its customers’ consciousness.</p>
<p>“My goal is to bridge that gap by sharing real, research-backed insights that help brands cut costs, boost sales, and build deeper connections with their audiences,” she added.</p>
<h4>The past issue you need to read</h4>
<p>The newsletter issue and subsequent<a href="https://www.tetherinsights.io/blog/how-ikea-grew-11-4-yoy-using-coffee-cup-emojis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> blog post</a> about IKEA’s little price tag trick were fascinating. Basically, IKEA replaced the numerical price of a plant pot with three banana emojis. It sounds weird, but it sure did work—and it’s a perfect illustration of what Sarah’s newsletter is all about.</p>
<div id="4-more-marketing-newsletters-worthy-of-your-inbox"></div>
<h2>More marketing newsletters worthy of your inbox</h2>
<p>I got so many great recommendations that I didn’t have time or space to do a deep dive into them all. But these four marketing newsletters definitely deserve a look.</p>
<div id="mkt1"></div>
<h3>9. MKT1</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilykramer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emily Kramer</a> is the mastermind behind both the <a href="https://newsletter.mkt1.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MKT1 newsletter</a> and the Dear Marketers podcast. The newsletter is a monthly discussion of a broad spectrum of B2B marketing topics like AI workflows, choosing the right marketing channels, and account-driven GTM strategies. There’s also a job board and a library of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/18/free-marketing-templates">marketing templates</a> on the MKT1 website.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://newsletter.mkt1.co/p/marketing-strategy-exercises" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post on marketing strategy</a> is a good example of the long-form, step-by-step type of content you’ll get from Emily and the MKT1 newsletter.</p>
<div id="mkt1"></div>
<div id="why-we-buy"></div>
<h3>10. Why We Buy</h3>
<p><a href="https://learnwhywebuy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why We Buy</a> is another fantastic newsletter for us <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/23/influence-buyers-marketing-psychology">marketing psychology</a> nerds. In it, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katebour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katelyn Bourgoin</a> addresses the psychological phenomenon that guides our buying decisions. She builds her case either through the lens of a real-world brand example or starting from the definition of a particular psychological principle.</p>
<p>Katelyn’s <a href="https://learnwhywebuy.com/effort-justification/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explanation of effort justification</a> is a good place to start. Not only is it representative of her typical structure (What this is, How to apply it), but it’s also a good example of her staccato writing style. If you like quick, skimmable paragraphs, you’ll enjoy reading Why We Buy.</p>
<div id="command-create"></div>
<h3>11. Command + Create</h3>
<p><a href="https://command-create.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Command + Create</a> was one of the first newsletters recommended to me when I started asking. After perusing the content that writer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hsingtseng/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hsing Tseng</a> publishes, I see why. It’s a cozy, comfortable place to learn about the soft and hard skills required to be a great freelance content marketer.</p>
<p>I like <a href="https://command-create.com/your-audience-doesnt-care-about-your-brand-and-thats-okay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hsing’s take</a> that some businesses consider their brand more precious than it should be and how that could scare away customers.</p>
<div id="contentment"></div>
<h3>12. Contentment</h3>
<p>Full disclosure: I’ve been a happy…ahem, content…<a href="https://workweek.com/brand/contentment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contentment</a> subscriber for a while now. I’ve always enjoyed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/traceyrwallace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tracey Wallace’s</a> pragmatic notions about how marketing really works. So I was glad when another marketer suggested Contentment for this list. You’ll be glad you subscribed to this newsletter if you want smart, no-nonsense ruminations from a truly expert content marketer.</p>
<p>Now, just because her newsletter isn’t dripping with memes and hand-crafted visuals doesn’t mean it’s bland or boring. Case in point, in <a href="https://workweek.com/2025/01/08/9-timeless-content-marketing-lessons-from-benjamin-franklin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this issue</a> Tracy breaks down Benjamin Franklin’s Poor Richard’s Almanack to construct a framework for modern-day content marketing.</p>
<h2>Which is the best marketing newsletter?</h2>
<p>Trick question. The best marketing newsletter is the one you actually read.</p>
<p>I get a lot of newsletters in my inbox (a hazard of being a content marketer). But I only read a few regularly. I tend to gravitate towards those with quick lessons and quipy writing. You might prefer long-form takedowns with tons of data and charts. That’s great, too.</p>
<p>The point is, there are so many great <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/popular-marketing-resources-2025">learning options</a> out there, so don’t stress yourself out trying to stay on top of every one. We all learn differently. Lean into your style and have fun (If listening is your thing, check out this <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-marketing-podcasts">list of podcasts</a>).</p>
<p>Oh, and don’t be afraid to connect with the authors on LinkedIn. I find them to be genuinely great people who want to help other marketers succeed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve spent weeks crafting the perfect email campaign. It has a catchy subject line, compelling copy, and a valuable offer. You hit send, anxious for high open and click-through rates, only to find that most of your subscribers never even saw the email.</p>
<p>Why so many failed email sends? Most of your emails either ended up in spam folders or worse, never reached your audience.</p>
<p>The most likely culprit for this communication calamity is a poor sender reputation.</p>
<p>Your email sender reputation is the unseen gatekeeper determining whether your emails land in inboxes or vanish into digital oblivion. Understanding and managing email sender reputation is essential to maximize deliverability and engagement.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll explore everything you need to know about email sender reputation and equip you with actionable strategies to improve yours.</p>

<h2>What is an email sender reputation?</h2>
<p>Email sender <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reputation-management">reputation</a> is a metric that determines how trustworthy an email—and the account that sent it—is. It reflects how internet service providers (ISPs) view your emails and whether they think your recipients want to see them.</p>
<p>An email sender reputation is like a credit score but for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/01/email-marketing-tips">email marketing</a>. ISPs and email providers are like the credit providers. They review your reputation (or score) to decide whether you’re a risk or not. Then, instead of approving a loan, ISPs decide if your email gets blocked, gets labeled as spam, or makes it to the receiver’s inbox. Just like a credit score, the higher your reputation, the more likely you are to have success.</p>
<div id="how-are-email-sender-reputations-scored"></div>
<h2>How email sender reputations are scored</h2>
<p>The scale used to express an email sender reputation depends on the scoring system used by monitoring tools. Here are some common examples:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://gmail.com/postmaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Postmaster Tools</a> use a non-numerical range:
<ul>
<li><strong>Bad</strong>: Likely to have deliverability issues.</li>
<li><strong>Low</strong>: At risk but not critical.</li>
<li><strong>Medium</strong>: Average reputation.</li>
<li><strong>High</strong>: Strong reputation with minimal deliverability concerns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/snds/addnetwork.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft SNDS</a> (Smart Network Data Services) works similarly to Google Postmaster Tools, with qualitative insights rather than exact numbers.</li>
<li><a href="https://talosintelligence.com/reputation_center/email_rep" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Talos Intelligence</a> (Cisco) uses a numerical range of -10 (very poor) to +10 (excellent), with neutral at 0.</li>
</ol>

<div id="why-does-email-sender-reputation-matter"></div>
<h2>Why does email sender reputation matter?</h2>
<p>Email sender reputation directly influences whether your emails reach their intended audience or are sidelined as spam. A strong reputation ensures better deliverability and engagement. Your sender reputation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Determines inbox placement: </strong>A high reputation means more emails get to their intended inboxes. Low reputation means emails going to spam folders and never being seen.</li>
<li><strong>Impacts engagement metrics: </strong>A good reputation leads to higher inbox placement, which drives more opens, clicks, and conversions.</li>
<li><strong>Protects brand credibility</strong>: A poor reputation, signaled by spammy emails or frequent complaints, damages trust and risks alienating your audience.</li>
<li><strong>Drives ROI for email campaigns: </strong>A strong sender reputation gets you higher deliverability rates, and every percentage point in deliverability translates to better campaign performance and profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Avoids an email embargo: </strong>If your reputation falls too low, you risk being embargoed by ISPs or spam-monitoring organizations. A higher reputation keeps you out of this nefarious club.</li>
</ul>
<p>Email sender reputation impacts deliverability, engagement, brand trust, ROI, and your ability to avoid serious consequences like blacklisting. By prioritizing reputation management, you can make sure your emails consistently reach and resonate with your audience.</p>
<div id="8-factors" that-influence-sender-reputation="&quot;"></div>
<h2>8 factors that influence email sender reputation and how to control them</h2>
<p>Eight key factors shape your email sender reputation. Collectively, they signal to ISPs whether your emails are trustworthy and relevant. The good news is these factors are within your control, and you can manage them to improve your sender reputation.</p>
<h3>1. Bounce rates</h3>
<p>Bounce rates are the percentage of emails that fail to deliver, typically due to invalid, inactive, or non-existent addresses. A high bounce rate signals poor list hygiene.</p>
<p>ISPs interpret frequent bounces as a sign you’re not maintaining a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/11/how-to-build-an-email-list">quality email list</a>, which can lower your reputation. If you have a high bounce rate, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regularly clean your email list to remove invalid or inactive addresses</strong>: Use email validation tools like <a href="https://www.neverbounce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeverBounce</a> or <a href="https://www.zerobounce.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZeroBounce</a> to identify and remove addresses that are no longer valid or active.</li>
<li><strong>Implement double opt-in for new subscribers</strong>: Ensure that only valid and interested people are added to your list by requiring subscribers to confirm their email addresses before they are fully added.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor and update email collection methods</strong>: Evaluate how you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/11/email-list-building">collect email addresses</a> to ensure accuracy, such as using registration form validation to prevent typos and capturing only verified, high-quality leads.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/email-sender-reputation-wordstream-benefits-list-cleanup-e1738093404683.webp" alt="Email sender reputation - graphic of the benefits of cleaning an email list." width="935" height="555" class="aligncenter wp-image-88772 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/email-sender-reputation-wordstream-benefits-list-cleanup-e1738093404683-935x551.webp 935w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/email-sender-reputation-wordstream-benefits-list-cleanup-e1738093404683-480x270.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 935px) 935px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>2. Spam complaints</h3>
<ol start="2"></ol>
<p>Spam complaints are the number of times recipients mark your emails as spam. When recipients mark your emails as spam, it’s a red flag for ISPs that your content is unwelcome. High complaint rates quickly erode your sender reputation and lead to lower deliverability.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set clear expectations during signup</strong>: Clearly <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/11/call-to-action-examples-for-email-newsletter-signups">communicate what type of content</a> subscribers will receive, how often you&#8217;ll email them, and any additional benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor and suppress unengaged recipients</strong>: Regularly review engagement metrics and remove or suppress subscribers who haven’t interacted with your emails for a long time.</li>
<li><strong>Use clear opt-in methods</strong>: Ensure that everyone on your email list has explicitly agreed to receive your emails.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Recipient engagement</h3>
<ol start="3"></ol>
<p>Recipient engagement is a measure of how recipients interact with your emails, including actions like opening, clicking, and reading. Engagement metrics like open rates, click-through rates, and time spent on emails reflect how interested recipients are in your content.</p>
<p>Low engagement suggests to ISPs that your emails lack value, which leads to inbox placement issues. To address this issue:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personalize your emails</strong>: Tailor your content by using recipient data such as names, past interactions, or preferences.<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing"> Personalized emails</a> make recipients feel valued and increase the likelihood of engagement, which signals ISPs that your emails are relevant.</li>
<li><strong>Segment your audience</strong>: Group your email list into smaller, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/13/targeted-email-marketing-strategies">targeted segments</a> based on factors like demographics, purchase history, or behavior. Sending specific content to the right audience increases relevance and improves metrics like open and click-through rates.</li>
<li><strong>Optimize your email timing</strong>: Analyze when your audience is most likely to engage with emails and schedule sends accordingly. Tools like email marketing platforms can provide insights into <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/best-time-to-send-email-campaign">optimal send times</a> based on past performance.</li>
<li><strong>Create mobile-friendly emails</strong>: Many recipients open emails on mobile devices, so ensure your emails are optimized for smaller screens with responsive designs, clear fonts, and concise messaging. A poor mobile experience can lead to disengagement.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/email-sender-reputation-wordstream-peek.webp" alt="Email sender reputation - segmented email example." width="550" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88773 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/email-sender-reputation-wordstream-peek.webp 550w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/email-sender-reputation-wordstream-peek-480x524.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 550px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>4. Sending practices</h3>
<p>Sending practices refer to the consistency and quality of your email-sending behavior, such as maintaining a steady volume and avoiding unverified lists, which impacts ISP trust.</p>
<p>ISPs monitor the consistency and legitimacy of your email-sending patterns. Sudden spikes in email volume or sending to purchased lists can raise red flags, harming your reputation.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to refine your email-sending practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maintain a consistent sending volume</strong>: Sudden spikes or drops in email volume can make ISPs suspicious of your activity. For example, sending thousands of emails after weeks of inactivity might trigger filters. Plan your campaigns to send emails at a steady and predictable pace to build trust over time.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid purchased or scraped lists</strong>: Using lists that haven’t been <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/15/lead-magnet-ideas">organically collected</a> leads to higher bounce rates, spam complaints, and potential spam trap hits. Instead, grow your list through opt-ins, where recipients voluntarily subscribe to receive your emails.</li>
<li><strong>Warm up new IPs gradually</strong>: If you’re starting with a new IP address, don’t send large volumes of emails immediately. Begin with smaller sends to highly engaged recipients, gradually increasing the volume to establish a positive reputation with ISPs.</li>
<li><strong>Respect frequency preferences</strong>: Give recipients control over how often they receive emails from you. Sending too many emails can annoy subscribers and increase complaints, while too few might result in disengagement.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Authentication protocols</h3>
<ol start="5"></ol>
<p>Authentication protocols are verification methods like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC that confirm your identity as a legitimate sender, reducing the risk of being flagged as spam. Here’s what each of these acronyms mean:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SPF (Sender Policy Framework)</strong>: An email authentication protocol that verifies whether a sender&#8217;s IP address is authorized to send emails on behalf of a domain.</li>
<li><strong>DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)</strong>: An email authentication method that uses cryptographic signatures to ensure the email&#8217;s content has not been altered during transit.</li>
<li><strong>DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance)</strong>: A policy framework that builds on SPF and DKIM to help email senders and receivers prevent spoofing and phishing while providing visibility through reports.</li>
</ul>
<p>Missing or misconfigured protocols make your emails appear suspicious and increase the likelihood of being flagged as spam.</p>
<p>Setting up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC improves email deliverability by ensuring your emails are authenticated and trusted by ISPs. These protocols protect your domain from spoofing and phishing attacks, enhance sender reputation by demonstrating compliance with authentication standards, and reduce the likelihood of being flagged as spam.</p>
<p>Additionally, DMARC provides valuable insights into email activity through detailed reports, helping you monitor and fine-tune your email strategy for better performance.</p>
<p>Here’s how to set up each protocol.</p>
<h4>Sender Policy Framework (SPF)</h4>
<p>Log in to your domain registrar or hosting provider to manage DNS records. Then, add a TXT record to your domain&#8217;s DNS with the following format:</p>
<p><strong>makefilev=spf1</strong></p>
<p><strong>include:example.com ~all</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Replace example.com with the email service providers you use (e.g., Gmail, SendGrid).</li>
<li>Use ~all for soft fail (recommended for testing) or -all for hard fail (stricter enforcement).</li>
</ul>
<p>After that<strong>, </strong>save changes to your DNS. Propagation may take a few hours. As a final step, use tools like <a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MXToolbox</a> or <a href="https://easydmarc.com/tools/spf-lookup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SPF Record Checker</a> to verify the setup.</p>
<h4>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)</h4>
<p>Most email providers (e.g., Gmail, SendGrid) offer a DKIM key in their account settings. Go to account settings and generate a DKIM key. After that, add a TXT record with the selector and public key provided by your email provider.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of how that looks:</p>
<p><strong>vbnet</strong></p>
<p><strong>Name: selector._domainkey.example.com</strong></p>
<p><strong>Value: v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=&lt;public key&gt;</strong></p>
<p>Once the TXT record is added in your email provider&#8217;s settings, enable DKIM signing for outgoing emails. Use email testing tools or your email provider’s verification tool to confirm the DKIM signature is applied correctly. Besides <a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MX Toolbox</a>, <a href="https://www.mail-tester.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mail Tester</a> is also a good tool to test this.</p>
<h4>Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)</h4>
<p>Decide on your policy (monitoring, quarantine, or reject). For example:</p>
<p><strong>css</strong></p>
<p><strong>v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@example.com</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>p=none: Monitor and gather data.</li>
<li>p=quarantine: Mark unauthorized emails as spam.</li>
<li>p=reject: Block unauthorized emails outright.</li>
</ul>
<p>After that, add a TXT record to your DNS with the DMARC policy, like this example:</p>
<p><strong>css</strong></p>
<p><strong>Name: _dmarc.example.com</strong></p>
<p><strong>Value: v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@example.com</strong></p>
<p>Start with p=none to monitor activity, then move to stricter policies (quarantine or reject) as your setup stabilizes. Use a DMARC reporting tool like <a href="https://dmarcian.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DMARCian</a> or <a href="https://emailsecurity.fortra.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Agari</a> to analyze authentication reports and fine-tune your policy.</p>
<h3>6. Spam trap hits</h3>
<p>Spam traps are email addresses intentionally created by ISPs and anti-spam organizations to identify senders who are using poor list management practices. Real people do not use these addresses and never sign up for email lists, so if your email lands in a spam trap, it signals that you may be sending to unverified or outdated addresses. Spam trap hits can severely damage your sender reputation.</p>
<p>If you use double opt-ins for email signups and regularly clean your email list, your chances of landing in a spam trap are already low. In addition to that, make sure you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid purchased or scraped lists</strong>: Purchased or scraped email lists often contain spam traps. Always build your email lists organically through legitimate signup processes.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor engagement metrics</strong>: Keep an eye on recipient engagement (opens, clicks, etc.). If certain segments show no activity, suppress or remove them from your list to reduce the risk of hitting a trap.</li>
<li><strong>Conduct regular audits</strong>: Periodically review your list management practices and audit your email database to ensure compliance with industry standards. Besides the tools we have already recommended, <a href="https://kickbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kickbox</a> and <a href="https://debounce.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Debounce</a> can also help you with your audits.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Content quality</h3>
<ol start="7"></ol>
<p>Content quality refers to the relevance, clarity, and value of the emails you send to your audience. ISPs and spam filters analyze your content to determine whether it meets recipients&#8217; expectations or if it resembles spam.</p>
<p>Poor-quality content, such as misleading <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/31/email-subject-lines">subject lines</a>, excessive promotional language, or irrelevant messaging, harms your email sender reputation and reduces deliverability.</p>
<p>To ensure high-quality email content, follow these best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Craft clear and honest subject lines</strong>: Avoid clickbait or deceptive language in your subject lines. Use wording that accurately reflects the content of the email.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid spammy keywords and phrases</strong>: Words like &#8220;free,&#8221; &#8220;guaranteed,&#8221; and &#8220;act now&#8221; can trigger spam filters if overused. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/21/promotional-email-examples">Promotional emails</a> are okay; just keep your language professional and relevant to your audience.</li>
<li><strong>Provide value in every email</strong>: Deliver content that aligns with your recipients&#8217; interests and needs, such as helpful tips, exclusive offers, or personalized recommendations.</li>
<li><strong>Test and optimize your emails</strong>: Use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/02/26/ab-testing-best-practices">A/B testing</a> to experiment with different subject lines, layouts, and content formats. Analyze the results to refine your approach and consistently improve the quality of your emails.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/email-sender-reputation-wordstream-spa.webp" alt="Email sender reputation - Example email from a spa." width="867" height="469" class="aligncenter wp-image-88774 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/email-sender-reputation-wordstream-spa.webp 867w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/email-sender-reputation-wordstream-spa-480x260.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 867px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Timely, </em><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-email-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>targeted emails</em></a><em> with clear subject lines and valuable content will leave you with a strong email sender reputation.</em></p>
<h3>8. Domain and IP reputation</h3>
<p>Domain and IP reputation reflect the trustworthiness of your sending domain and the IP address used to send emails. ISPs evaluate these reputations to decide whether your emails are delivered, flagged as spam, or blocked entirely. Poor practices or shared IP issues degrade your reputation.</p>
<p>To build and protect a strong domain and IP reputation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start slow and build up</strong>: When starting with a new IP, send emails in small batches to your most engaged recipients. Gradually increase the volume over time to establish a positive sending history and avoid ISP suspicion.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid sending from shared IPs (if possible)</strong>: On shared IPs, other senders&#8217; poor practices can affect your reputation. Use a dedicated IP if your email volume is high enough to justify it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Take charge of your email sender reputation</h2>
<p>Email sender reputation isn’t static; it evolves with every email you send. By addressing the eight factors that influence reputation, you&#8217;re not just fixing immediate problems but building a long-term strategy for trust and consistency.</p>
<p>Controlling these eight factors can serve as your blueprint for effective <a href="https://localiq.com/products/targeted-email-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email marketing</a>. Every step, from avoiding spam traps to warming up new IPs, contributes to a cohesive system that ensures your emails reach their audience.</p>
<p>Review your current practices, run audits, and start small by implementing one improvement today. By prioritizing these practices, you’ll create a system that amplifies your impact and makes sure your messages reach and resonate with your audience.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a recap of the eight factors that influence your email sender reputation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bounce rates</li>
<li>Spam complaints</li>
<li>Recipient engagement</li>
<li>Sending practices</li>
<li>Authentication protocals</li>
<li>Spam trap hits</li>
<li>Content quality</li>
<li>Domain and IP reputation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Holiday customer email tips</h2>
<p>In such a short piece of content as your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/holiday-email-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holiday emails</a>, small details have big effects. Here&#8217;s how to get it right.</p>
<ul>
<li>Express gratitude! Customer appreciation is the goal here.</li>
<li>Keep it short and use a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/05/conversational-tone">conversational tone</a>. This is an e-toast, not a live journal.</li>
<li>Be <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/16/inclusive-holiday-marketing-ideas">inclusive</a> of all holidays, and be warm and positive, but not overly hyped—the holidays can be difficult for many people.</li>
<li>Make it visual with creative graphics or a team photo.</li>
<li>Share your growth and achievements to give customers a reason to stay confident in your business. BUT make it about them—the growth you achieved with <em>their</em> support. What you achieved <em>together</em>.</li>
<li>Connect it back to your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/02/how-to-write-a-business-mission-statement">mission</a> (NOT your value prop).</li>
<li>Focus on the future. Speak to an ongoing relationship, but not through a CTA or sales promotion. Save that for your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/12/08/year-in-review-email-examples">year-in-review email.</a></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine walking into a store and being greeted by a salesperson who immediately tries to sell you on a product—without even asking about your needs. Off-putting, right? Yet, many businesses do this with email marketing—blasting new subscribers with their next promo before building a relationship.</p>
<p>Savvy marketers take a different approach. Instead of bombarding new leads with promotional emails, they use lead nurturing emails to usher them throughout the buying journey with relevant content that builds trust and gently guides potential customers to buy a product or service.</p>
<p>Ready to level up your email marketing? Dive into essential strategies and best practices for creating lead nurturing emails that convert. These insights will elevate your email nurture campaigns, whether you&#8217;re just starting or fine-tuning your existing approach.</p>

<h2>What is a lead nurturing email?</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/email-nurture-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lead nurturing email</a> is a targeted, personalized message designed to guide potential customers through the sales funnel and to your brand&#8217;s desired action—like a purchase or appointment booking. They do this by providing valuable information, building trust, and encouraging engagement with your brand.</p>
<p>Unlike general marketing emails focusing on promotions or announcements, lead nurturing emails are strategically crafted to address your leads&#8217; specific needs, interests, and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-pain-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pain points</a> at various stages of the buyer journey. They&#8217;re also usually triggered to send based on actions taken by your prospect.</p>

<div id="how-email-nurture-campaigns-work"></div>
<h2>How email nurture campaigns work</h2>
<p>Lead nurturing emails are also often sent in a sequence.</p>
<p>A lead nurture sequence is a series of interconnected emails designed to build a relationship with a lead over time. This sequence typically consists of multiple emails sent at strategic intervals, each with a specific <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/purpose-driven-marketing">purpose</a> in guiding the lead toward your desired action.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/11/03/lead-nurturing">lead nurture campaign</a> sequence typically works:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Trigger</strong>: Your prospective customer takes a specific action, such as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/11/call-to-action-examples-for-email-newsletter-signups">signing up for your email newsletter</a> or leaving your website without purchasing.</li>
<li><strong>Segmentation</strong>: Email subscribers are categorized based on their characteristics, behaviors, or interests. These segments can then be used to deliver relevant content.</li>
<li><strong>Automated delivery</strong>: Emails are sent automatically at predetermined intervals or in response to specific actions taken by the lead.</li>
<li><strong>Progressive engagement</strong>: Each email in the sequence builds upon the previous one, providing relevant information to move the lead closer to conversion if the last email didn&#8217;t result in conversion.</li>
<li><strong>Conversion opportunities</strong>: Every email includes a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/call-to-action-phrases">call to action (CTA)</a> to take the desired action, whether making a purchase, downloading an app, starting a trial, or booking an appointment.</li>
<li><strong>Ongoing nurturing</strong>: Even after a conversion, you can continue nurturing customers to encourage them to return for another purchase.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Benefits of lead nurturing emails</h2>
<p>Lead nurturing emails replace the &#8220;spray and pray&#8221; approach with personalized, relevant content that resonates with subscribers based on their interests and stage in the buying process. This approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Positions your brand as a helpful resource, building trust and credibility.</li>
<li>Qualifies leads so you can focus your efforts on your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a>.</li>
<li>Shortens the sales cycle by addressing hesitations and providing timely information.</li>

<h2>Best practices for crafting high-performing lead nurturing emails</h2>
<p>Creating effective lead-nurturing emails is both an art and a science. Implement these best practices to develop lead nurture emails that build meaningful relationships with your prospects, ultimately leading to more conversions.</p>
<h3>Segment your audience</h3>
<p>One of the most powerful ways to improve the effectiveness of your lead-nurturing emails is through <a href="https://www.attentive.com/blog/email-marketing-segmentation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">audience segmentation</a>. By dividing your email list up based on specific criteria, your emails can be more relevant and personalized content for each subscriber.</p>
<p>Here are a few ways you can try segmenting your audience:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Demographics</strong>: Group subscribers based on characteristics like age, gender, location, or job title. These will be most effective if relevant to how different demographics interact with your business. For example, a gym could segment its mailing list by various age groups to promote tailored fitness programs—like high-intensity workouts for younger adults and low-impact classes for seniors.</li>
<li><strong>Behavior</strong>: Segment based on actions taken on your website, such as pages viewed, services and products browsed, or abandoned carts. This allows you to target leads based on the interests or intentions they&#8217;ve demonstrated through their interaction with your business. For instance, a bookstore could segment subscribers based on events they&#8217;ve booked attendance for and then send emails with relevant books to buy.</li>
<li><strong>Purchase history</strong>: Categorize customers based on specific products or services they&#8217;ve bought or buying frequency. Then you can offer similar products and services in the future. For example, a hair salon could send <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-email-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeted emails</a> to clients who regularly book coloring services about new hair color trends to inspire their next visit. Or they can send clients a reminder to schedule their next appointment around when they usually book one.</li>
<li><strong>Interests or preferences</strong>: Use data from surveys, quizzes, or <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-build-an-email-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signup forms</a> to group subscribers based on their interests or needs. Then, you can send targeted content based on what they care about most. For example, a nutritionist can ask new email subscribers about their dietary goals (e.g., weight management, food allergies, sports nutrition, etc.). Then, they can send relevant content—like how to discover food allergies—that might ultimately lead potential customers to book a nutrition session.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Automate emails based on audience behavior</h3>
<p>According to Klaviyo, automated email flows generate up to <a href="https://www.klaviyo.com/marketing-resources/email-benchmarks-by-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30X</a> more revenue per recipient than one-time email marketing campaigns.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/01/automated-email-marketing">Automating your lead nurturing strategy</a> allows you to send timely, relevant emails based on your subscribers&#8217; specific actions. This approach ensures your leads receive the right message at the right time, increasing the chances of engagement and conversion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/lead-nurture-automation-template-examples.webp" alt="automated email nurturing email triggers" width="800" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87331" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/lead-nurture-automation-template-examples.webp 800w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/lead-nurture-automation-template-examples-480x360.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/ai-for-email-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>For example, sending a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/18/welcome-email">welcome email</a> after a lead subscribes can help encourage their first purchase. Cart abandonment emails can remind online shoppers what they are interested in. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/09/follow-up-email">Follow-up emails</a> after a customer&#8217;s purchase can help familiarize them with their new product so they fall in love with it and are more likely to become loyal customers who come back for more.</p>
<p>For example, a bakery could set up an automated email series for customers who sign up for their cake decorating class. Before the class, the bakery can send a confirmation email and a reminder a few days before the class with what to expect to ramp up excitement. After the class, they can send a follow-up email with at-home decorating tips based on what they learned and information about another relevant class to sign up for.</p>
<h3>Craft compelling emails</h3>
<p>Creating compelling lead-nurturing emails is crucial for engaging your audience and moving them toward conversion.</p>
<p>Consider these key elements when creating your emails:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Design and layout</strong>: Create visually appealing emails that are easy to read and navigate. Use a clean, mobile-responsive design with a clear hierarchy of information.</li>
<li><strong>Email copy</strong>: <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/30/business-email-templates">Write concise, engaging copy</a> that speaks directly to your audience&#8217;s needs and interests. Use a conversational tone that feels appropriate for your brand and focus on the benefits to the reader.</li>
<li><strong>Clickable subject lines</strong>: Craft attention-grabbing <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/email-subject-lines-for-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subject lines</a> that make recipients want to open your emails. Keep them short, clear, and relevant to the email content. Avoid clickbait—not meeting a lead&#8217;s expectations could annoy them and harm your relationship.</li>
<li><strong>Personalization</strong>: Go beyond using the recipient&#8217;s name. Personalize content based on their preferences, behavior, or purchase history to make your emails more relevant.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/personalized-marketing-example-sephora.webp" alt="personalize email lead nurture sequence" width="823" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87332" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/personalized-marketing-example-sephora.webp 823w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/personalized-marketing-example-sephora-480x350.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 823px, 100vw" /></li>
<li><strong>CTA</strong>: Include a single, clear CTA in each email to guide recipients toward the desired action. Giving them too many choices could result in no action at all.</li>
<li><strong>Provide value, don&#8217;t just promote</strong>: Focus on delivering valuable content that helps your audience solve problems or learn something new. This builds trust and positions your brand as a valuable resource, not just a seller. Just keep it relevant to your business.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you remember one thing, it&#8217;s this: Create emails your subscribers would look forward to receiving, not just more promotional messages in their inbox.</p>
<h3>Measure and optimize every element of your email nurture campaigns</h3>
<p>To maximize the performance of your lead nurturing emails, you&#8217;ll want to continuously measure their performance and optimize based on the data you collect.</p>
<p>Start by tracking key <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/email-marketing-kpis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email marketing metrics</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Engagement metrics</strong>: Monitor <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/01/19/subject-line-mistakes">open rates</a>, click-through rates, and unsubscribe rates to gauge how well your emails resonate with your audience.</li>
<li><strong>Conversion metrics</strong>: Track actions taken after a subscriber clicks on your link, such as purchases made or appointments booked, to determine how effective your emails are at reaching your goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Look for patterns in what <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/types-of-marketing-emails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">types of emails</a>, subject lines, or content perform best. In your email sequences, identify any drop-off points where engagement decreases to determine if you need to update a specific email to make it more engaging or shorten the overall sequence.</p>
<p>Remember that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/19/conversion-rate-benchmarks">conversion rate</a> is arguably the most important metric to optimize for. A high open rate doesn&#8217;t mean much if it doesn&#8217;t translate into purchases.</p>
<p>Hypothesize what might improve performance in your emails, then run <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/11/copywriting-ab-tests">A/B tests</a> to experiment with each element one at a time to see what works best.</p>
<p>Test elements like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy variations</li>
<li>Imagery</li>
<li>Email layout</li>
<li>Subject line alternatives</li>
<li>Different offers or incentives</li>
<li>CTA placement or wording</li>
<li>Sending times</li>
<li>Number of emails in a sequence</li>
</ul>
<p>Optimization will be an ongoing process. What works today may not work as well tomorrow, so keep testing and refining to stay ahead of changing customer preferences and behaviors.</p>

<h2>5 types of lead nurturing emails (with templates and examples)</h2>
<p>To understand what&#8217;s possible, explore these five lead-nurturing emails to use in your marketing. Each type uniquely guides potential leads through your funnel, builds stronger relationships, and drives more conversions (get even more <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/sales-email-templates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email templates here</a>).</p>
<h3>1. Welcome emails</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/resources/skills/how-to-nurture-email-subscribers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Welcome emails</a> are often the first way a lead will interact with your brand after subscribing. They set the tone for your relationship with new leads and can significantly impact future engagement.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a basic template for a welcome series you can try (and check out these <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/welcome-email-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">welcome email examples</a>).</p>
<h4>Thank you email with incentive</h4>
<p>Express gratitude for subscribing and give them their incentive (like a discount code) if you offered one when you got their email address.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://worththejourney.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worth the Journey</a> is a small business digital marketing agency that offers a &#8220;business growth guide&#8221; as an incentive when a lead signs up for their email list.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/thank-you-email-example.webp" alt="example of thank you email with incentive" width="604" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87309" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/thank-you-email-example.webp 604w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/thank-you-email-example-480x475.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 604px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>So the first email a subscriber receives includes the guide—but also a CTA to schedule a business coaching strategy session:</p>
<p>This fulfills the promise made during signup and seamlessly guides subscribers to further engagement with the agency.</p>
<h4>Brand story email</h4>
<p>Introduce new leads to your company&#8217;s history, values, or mission to help them connect with your brand on a deeper level.</p>
<p>Retreat center <a href="https://kripalu.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kripalu</a> describes their approach to yoga and illustrates their values of compassion, belonging, and hope:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/brand-story-email-example.webp" alt="lead nurture brand story email example" width="452" height="586" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87310" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/brand-story-email-example.webp 452w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/brand-story-email-example-231x300.webp 231w" sizes="(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px" /></p>
<h4>Education on product or industry</h4>
<p>Provide valuable information related to your products and services or niche. This builds trust and shows off your expertise.</p>
<p><a href="https://justaddbuoy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buoy</a> is a clean electrolyte drink enhancer. In their welcome email series, they share what sets their product apart:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/product-education-email.webp" alt="product education lead nurturing email example" width="360" height="573" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87311" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/product-education-email.webp 360w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/product-education-email-188x300.webp 188w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></p>
<p>And at the end of the email, they remind subscribers about their signup incentive:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/product-education-email-incentive.webp" alt="lead nurturing email example - product incenrive" width="893" height="353" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87312" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/product-education-email-incentive.webp 893w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/product-education-email-incentive-480x190.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 893px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Social proof</h4>
<p>Share customer testimonials or reviews to build trust and credibility.</p>
<p>Skincare brand <a href="https://www.dearbrightly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dear Brightly</a> includes several positive reviews in one email in their welcome series:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/social-proof-nuture-email.webp" alt="social proof nurture example" width="477" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87313" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/social-proof-nuture-email.webp 477w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/social-proof-nuture-email-239x300.webp 239w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" /></p>
<p>The added images showcase the effectiveness of their products.</p>
<h4>Incentive reminders</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s easy for leads to get distracted and forget about the incentive they have. So, gently remind subscribers about any time-sensitive offers or discounts they received when signing up.</p>
<p>Dental care brand <a href="https://bitetoothpastebits.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bite</a> reminds subscribers that their discount is about to expire:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/incentive-reminder-nurture-email.webp" alt="incentive reminder nurture email" width="517" height="597" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87314" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/incentive-reminder-nurture-email.webp 517w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/incentive-reminder-nurture-email-480x554.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 517px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The brand also includes a handy button to shop that emphasizes the incentive.</p>
<p>These are just a few ways to use welcome emails to build connections with leads while providing value. Experiment with different tactics to find what works for your business.</p>
<h3>2. Abandonment email flows</h3>
<p>Abandonment emails are triggered when potential buyers show interest in your products or services but don&#8217;t complete a desired action. These emails aim to re-engage leads and encourage them to return to your site.</p>
<p>There are two main types of abandonment emails:</p>
<h4>Browse abandonment emails</h4>
<p>Browse abandonment emails are sent when visitors view specific pages on your website but leave without adding anything to their cart, booking an appointment, etc. Browse abandonment emails remind leads about their interest and can provide additional information or incentives to encourage a conversion.</p>
<p>For example, if a client viewed the services page at an auto repair shop without booking an appointment, the shop could email more information about that service and a CTA to schedule.</p>
<p>Activewear brand <a href="https://girlfriend.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Girlfriend Collective</a> sends a quick email with the product a shopper showed interest in and a button to shop:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/browse-abandonment-nurture-email.webp" alt="browse abandonment nurture email example" width="883" height="570" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87325" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/browse-abandonment-nurture-email.webp 883w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/browse-abandonment-nurture-email-480x310.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 883px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Cart abandonment emails</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/03/17/shopping-cart-abandonment">Abandoned cart emails</a> are triggered when customers add items to their cart but don&#8217;t end up completing the checkout process. These emails typically remind customers about what they left behind and sometimes include an incentive to buy or additional helpful information.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.republicoftea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Republic of Tea</a> includes shipping information in their cart abandonment email:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cart-abandonment-emails.webp" alt="cart abandonment nurture email" width="736" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87315" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cart-abandonment-emails.webp 736w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cart-abandonment-emails-480x390.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 736px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Effective abandonment emails have a few things in common. They:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/best-time-to-send-email-campaign">Optimize email timing</a> so that the customer is still excited to buy, usually within a few hours—use your A/B tests to figure out the timing that gets you the most conversions!</li>
<li>Use personalized content to surface the products and services your lead clicked on.</li>
<li>Offer helpful information to address possible reasons why the lead didn&#8217;t purchase right away, like product reviews, FAQs, or shipping information.</li>
<li>Always include a clear call to action to return to where the subscriber left off.</li>
</ul>
<p>By implementing abandonment email flows, you can recover potentially lost sales and provide a helpful reminder to customers who may have become distracted.</p>
<h3>3. Replenishment reminder emails</h3>
<p>Remember: Your existing customers are also leads. You need to continue building those relationships to bring first-time buyers back.</p>
<p>Replenishment reminder emails are great for products that shoppers buy frequently, like coffee or hair products. These emails remind customers when it&#8217;s time to reorder their favorite products.</p>
<p>The key to effective replenishment reminders is timing. You want to send the email when the customer is likely running low on the product but before they&#8217;ve had to go without or seek alternatives. You can use purchase history to estimate when customers typically need to repurchase a product.</p>
<p>This replenishment reminder from skincare brand <a href="https://www.stratiaskin.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopO3_kQKldtxxUKBPvQXqBFox3znml3FNOVqSeIj35tAwxvurc_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stratia</a> makes it easy for customers to head right to checkout with the last item they purchased:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/replinishment-nurture-email.webp" alt="example of replinishment nurture email" width="538" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87316" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/replinishment-nurture-email.webp 538w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/replinishment-nurture-email-480x534.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 538px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>4. Appointment reminder emails</h3>
<p>Appointment reminder emails are similar to replenishment reminders but for service brands.</p>
<p>Businesses like dental offices or auto shops, where customers constantly come back for another appointment, greatly benefit from these emails.</p>
<p>Remind them when it&#8217;s time for their next appointment instead of waiting for them to book, which could result in less frequent appointments.</p>
<p><a href="https://missionvalleypetclinic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mission Valley Pet Clinic</a> reminds pet owners when it&#8217;s time for a follow-up appointment:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/appointment-reminder-nurture-email.webp" alt="appointment reminder nurture email from vet" width="512" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87321" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/appointment-reminder-nurture-email.webp 512w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/appointment-reminder-nurture-email-480x563.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 512px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The email summarizes the last services and has a bold CTA button to book an appointment.</p>
<h3>5. Post-purchase emails</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/post-purchase-emails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Post-purchase emails</a> are essential for nurturing customer relationships, encouraging repeat business, and reducing buyer&#8217;s remorse (and returns). These emails can take various forms, each serving a specific purpose in the customer journey:</p>
<h4>Order confirmation</h4>
<p>Immediately after purchase or appointment booking, send an email thanking the customer and confirming the details.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.augustchiropractic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August Chiropractic</a> includes appointment details, cancellation policy, and clinic location:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/order-confirmation-nurture-email.webp" alt="order confirmation nurture email" width="590" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87322" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/order-confirmation-nurture-email.webp 590w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/order-confirmation-nurture-email-480x488.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 590px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Shipping and delivery confirmation</h4>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Expanding your skillset, entering into a new field, getting a great job, growing your business—these are all great things. But they all will involve, at some point or another, introducing yourself to new people. After all, you can’t grow if you don’t step out past your current circles.</p>
<p>Enter the introduction email. The building block of every great career, network, and business. So how do you write an introduction email that gets a response? That makes a good first impression?</p>
<p>In this post, I’m going to share some easy tips to write a great introduction email and then provide examples and templates for six different scenarios.</p>

<h2>How to write an introduction email</h2>
<p>There are lots of different scenarios where you’ll need to introduce yourself or others, but there are a few key fundamentals when it comes to writing an introduction email that apply across the board.</p>
<h3>Keep it brief</h3>
<p>Unless you’re pouring out your soul to a dear friend, NO emails should be long. Not <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/01/email-marketing-tips">marketing emails</a>. Not sales emails. Not introduction emails. Period! Think of your introduction email as the ad and the subsequent meeting or phone call as the product. It needs to have enough detail to capture interest while being brief enough to inspire a response.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/introduction-email-tip-keep-brief.webp" alt="introduction email tip example of brief email" width="936" height="479" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79802" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/introduction-email-tip-keep-brief.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/introduction-email-tip-keep-brief-480x246.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.leadloft.com/blog/emails-in-spam" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>Be clear with your purpose</h3>
<p>This is an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/03/email-marketing-best-practices">email best practice</a> for any scenario. No matter what the introduction is, you are reaching out because they have something that you want. And that’s okay. Be clear that you are reaching out because you are in X position/scenario looking for Y, and that they have Y. Giving this context directly will help keep the email short and make it easy for the recipient to digest—and respond to—quickly.</p>

<h3>Make a specific ask</h3>
<p>“I’d love to pick your brain” is not specific enough. Neither is “Would you be open to a conversation?” Be specific with the time frame, mode of communication, and even the purpose, and frame it as a yes or no. For example, “I have some questions about [topic] and would love to hear your insights. Would you be available for a phone or Zoom call next week?”</p>
<h3>Include a detail about them</h3>
<p>At the heart of every introduction email is a request for that person’s time. Time to read the email, time to meet with you, and so on. You can (and should) ask about ways to return the favor for them once you’ve met, but you can pay it forward a bit just by taking the time to learn about them beforehand and including it in your email.</p>
<p>This is NOT flattery. Simply saying “I noticed X” implies on its own that you were impressed without making it sound like “I am flattering you so that you’ll meet with me.”</p>
<h2>Introduction email templates and examples</h2>
<p>Here are some introduction examples and templates for a range of purposes that incorporate the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/25/email-copywriting-tips">email copywriting tips</a> I’ve shared.</p>

<h3>Introduction email example #3: Introducing two people</h3>

<h4>Template</h4>

<p>Hi [name],</p>

<p>[Opportunity seeker’s name], [name] is the [role] at [company]. [Call out relevant details/highlights about this person], and [he/she] is the best person to talk to to see if you might be a fit.</p>

<h3>Introduction email example #4: Sales email after content download</h3>
<h4>Template</h4>
<p>Subject line: [Goal] made easy</p>
<p>Hi [name],</p>
<p>I noticed you recently downloaded our [guide name]. The people who find this guide helpful are typically those who are trying to [achieve goal].</p>
<p>If this resonates with you, [business name] may be a great fit for you. [One sentence about how your business solves that problem and why it’s better than the rest].</p>
<p>Are you free this week to talk about your [area of specialty] goals?</p>
<p>Best,<br />
[name]</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Subject line: Ad budget optimization made easy</p>
<p>Hi Brianna,</p>
<p>I noticed you recently downloaded our PPC Pro Tips Guide. The people who find this guide helpful are typically those who are trying to reduce wasted spend, stretch their budget further, or both.</p>
<p>If this resonates with you, AdPro may be a great fit for you. It’s a platform we built specifically for small ad agencies like yours that automates budget optimization using a wider range of data than what’s available in Google Ads alone.</p>
<p>Are you free this week to talk about your PPC goals?</p>
<p>Best,<br />

<h3>Introduction email example #5: Sales prospecting</h3>
<h4>Template</h4>
<p>Subject line: A better way to [achieve goal]</p>
<p>Hi [name],</p>
<p>I noticed on your website that you’re using [tool] for [purpose]. While [tool] is great for [persona] looking to [achieve this small goal], it is not suited for [reader’s persona] [that does this larger function/with this larger goal].</p>
<p>[Your product/business] is built for [the larger function], [acheiving this bigger benefit/goal]. Do you have time this week for a [X-minute demo/call]?</p>
<p>Let me know,<br />
[name]</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Subject line: A better way to text</p>
<p>Hi Naomi,</p>
<p>I noticed on your website that you’re using Chatter for business texting. While Chatter is great for small businesses looking to get feedback and reviews, it is not suited for larger businesses that text with customers throughout their journey.</p>
<p>Bizchat is built for multi-channel communication with customers at every stage of the journey, improving funnel retention and ultimately increasing the bottom line. Do you have time this week for a 20-minute demo?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re reading this post, allow me to be the first to congratulate you: you’ve taken the very necessary first step into the wonderful, high-return world of email marketing. There are a multitude of channels marketers and business owners can use to grow a business–organic search, paid search, affiliates, influencer marketing, the list goes on. But email is the <em>only </em>channel that gives you the ability to send direct, no-cost messaging to a high-intent list of prospects or customers at the drop of a hat.</p>
<p>That’s the power of email marketing. The average email marketing conversion rate is <a href="https://www.mailmodo.com/guides/email-marketing-conversion-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around 15%</a>. Compare that to, say, paid search, where average conversion rates are around <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/15/google-ads-benchmarks">7%</a>. You read that right. When done correctly, you can generate email conversions at nearly twice the rate that you generate clicks on your paid search ads.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/average-conversion-rate-email-marketing-vs-search-ads.webp" alt="average conversion rates for search ads vs email marketing" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75148" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/average-conversion-rate-email-marketing-vs-search-ads.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/average-conversion-rate-email-marketing-vs-search-ads-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Getting 15 out of every 100 people to fill out your interest form or buy your product is great.  But imagine extrapolating that 15% conversion rate out over hundreds and thousands of email subscribers. The revenue numbers start looking pretty juicy.</p>
<p>It’s an enticing proposition, but one that also introduces a challenge. It’s easy enough to convert customers when they’re on your subscriber list. But how do you actually grow a list that’s big enough to contribute meaningfully to your bottom line?</p>
<p>That’s exactly the challenge we’re going to tackle today. In this post, we’re going to walk through seven <em>proven</em> ways to build a high-converting email list for your small business. By the end of it, you’ll be armed with the strategies you need to double, triple, or even 10x your email subscriber list.</p>
<p>Let’s jump in.</p>
<h2>What makes a good email list?</h2>
<p>Before you begin building (or growing) your email list, it&#8217;s important to understand what makes a <em>good</em> email list. Sure, it&#8217;s great to collect as many emails as possible. But if you&#8217;re not collecting the right information along with those emails, then you&#8217;re going to miss opportunities down the line with your email marketing.</p>
<p>Consider these attributes of an effective email list.</p>
<h3>Easy to segment</h3>
<p>You want to be able to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/04/customer-segmentation-models">segment users</a> in your email list based on demographics, interests, previous buying behavior, and more. This means you need to collect this information as you&#8217;re building your email list.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/customer-segmentation-models.webp" alt="nine customer segmentation models" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74999" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/customer-segmentation-models.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/customer-segmentation-models-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Easy to personalize</h3>
<p>The basic level of personalization is to include the recipient&#8217;s name in the subject line or body copy of the email. So you need that info. But you can also collect more data that will allow you to further <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing">personalize your email campaigns</a> to specific subscribers down the line.</p>
<h3>Subscribers are engaged</h3>
<p>If your email list is filled with people who aren&#8217;t opening your emails or are reporting your messages as spam, it can harm your <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/9-things-that-are-killing-your-email-deliverability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deliverability rates</a>. This is a sign you may need to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/30/tips-to-declutter-your-email-list">declutter your email list</a> to make room for engaged subscribers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/email-list-clean-up-benefits.webp" alt="benefits of cleaning an email list" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75142" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/email-list-clean-up-benefits.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/email-list-clean-up-benefits-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Subscribers have opted in</h3>
<p>Your email list needs to include people have given permission for you to email them. This is typically done through a little checkbox when someone submits their email address. But you might even take it a step further with a <a href="https://mailchimp.com/help/single-opt-in-vs-double-opt-in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">double opt-in</a>.</p>
<p>Think about what other data or information you need from subscribers before building your email list. This will impact your form and opt-in process.</p>
<h2>How to build an email list for free (or minimal cost)</h2>
<p>Try these seven free or low-cost and extremely effective ways to build your email list.</p>
<h3>1. Create a newsletter</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/25/email-newsletter-ideas">newsletter</a> is one of the best ways to build an email list for your business. It gives subscribers a reason to provide their information, it&#8217;s easy to produce, and&#8211;best of all&#8211;it&#8217;s free!</p>
<p>Your newsletter can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helpful content you produce on your website or blog</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/19/customer-testimonial-examples">Testimonials</a> or reviews</li>
<li>FAQs</li>
<li>Upcoming events your business is hosting</li>
<li>Specials, promotions, or deals</li>
<li>New product announcements</li>
<li>Referral or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/09/customer-retention-strategies">loyalty program</a> information</li>
<li>And much more!</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/build-email-list-newsletter-example.webp" alt="build email list - newsletter example" width="621" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75163" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/build-email-list-newsletter-example.webp 621w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/build-email-list-newsletter-example-480x463.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 621px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The flexibility of a newsletter provides ample opportunities to connect with your audience and keep your email list engaged.</p>
<p>You can encourage <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/11/call-to-action-examples-for-email-newsletter-signups">newsletter sign-ups</a> through a form on your website, by including an opt-in button any time someone submits one of your other forms (like a content download, online order, or contact request), or by using some of the ideas below.</p>

<h3>2. Offer a discount to new subscribers</h3>
<p>Nothing exactly novel here, but this is perhaps the most time-honored way to generate new subscribers. And while you may not count this as a &#8220;free&#8221; way to build an email list, it&#8217;s not going to cut into your costs. Offering new subscribers a 10%, 15%, or even 20% discount in exchange for joining your mailing list is a surefire way to generate new emails quickly.</p>
<p>We see the most classic form of this is in the world of ecommerce:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/email-list-new-subscriber-discount.webp" alt="how to build an email list - new subscriber discount pop up example " width="806" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75131" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/email-list-new-subscriber-discount.webp 806w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/email-list-new-subscriber-discount-480x356.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 806px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But the premise remains the same for B2B businesses as well. Depending on the price point of your product or service, offering a discount is a low-risk way to get potential customers into the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/01/content-marketing-funnel">funnel</a>. It’s an equally low-risk way for your potential customer to familiarize themselves with your brand and its offerings before committing to purchase.</p>
<p>Just make sure to back up your welcome pop-up with a quality <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/18/welcome-email">welcome email</a>, a personalized nurture campaign, a newsletter, or any steady flow of compelling content that will demonstrate to your new subscriber that your brand is worthy of a purchase.</p>
<h3>3. Gate your best content</h3>
<p>It’s true what they say: the best things in life are free. <em>Except </em>when it comes to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/13/content-marketing-strategy">great content</a>. Keeping your great content out in the open–on your YouTube channel, your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/02/how-to-get-verified-on-instagram">Instagram</a>, your blog–is great for top-of-funnel engagement, but it’s not going to drive growth through the middle of the funnel.</p>
<p>Having great organic engagement with a minimal email list is a good problem to have. It just means you have to start <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/18/gated-content"><em>gating </em>(or putting forms in front of) your best content</a>.</p>
<p>That case study that you slaved over for hours? Don’t just stick it on your website. Put it behind a form (like Salesforce does here).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/email-list-gated-content.webp" alt="how to build an email list - gated content example from salesforce" width="655" height="597" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75132" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/email-list-gated-content.webp 655w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/email-list-gated-content-480x437.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 655px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>That in-depth how-to video you put on your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube channel</a>? Offer it exclusively to email subscribers, and promote it on some of your other videos that took you less time and energy to create.</p>
<p>There are myriad ways to do this, but the point remains the same: really amazing content is hard to come by. If you’ve put in the time and resources to create it, make sure you leverage it to grow your email list. We detail more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/15/lead-magnet-ideas">lead magnet ideas</a> here!</p>
<h3>4. Run a contest or giveaway</h3>
<p>If you’ve made it this far into this post, you’re probably starting to notice a theme: unless you have a show-stopping newsletter or super sticky brand that people want to keep a pulse on (and maybe you do!), you need to offer people something of value if you want them to join your email list. While this may not be totally free depending on the prize, it&#8217;s one of the best ways to grow your email list.</p>
<p>Think of a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/instagram-giveaways">giveaway</a> that would really excite a potential customer in your space. Maybe it is a gift package that includes some of your premium products. Or maybe it’s a free audit or consultation that you can segue, in the future, into a service offering.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/email-list-contest-giveaway.webp" alt="how to build an email list - giveaway or contest pop up example" width="936" height="532" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75134" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/email-list-contest-giveaway.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/email-list-contest-giveaway-480x273.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Entrance into a sweepstakes, like the example above, is a fast and fun way to build your email list. </em></p>
<p>Here’s my favorite method for generating emails through a giveaway:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define the rules of your contest or giveaway, and define your prize package.</li>
<li>Promote the giveaway across your social channels, your website, and any other marketing media you typically use.</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/24/facebook-lead-ads">lead ads</a>, put some budget into a paid campaign on Facebook and Instagram. Use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/13/facebook-interest-targeting">interest targeting</a> and lookalikes to target broad audiences that generate a low cost-per-lead.</li>
<li>Use compelling copy and imagery to drive home the value of your prize package.</li>
<li>Bonus points if you can find an influencer or a like-minded brand or business to partner with to help you maximize exposure and drive up engagement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, there’s no wrong way to run a contest, but I’ve found that by using the above tactics, you can generate new emails at a super efficient clip.</p>
<h3>5. Leverage exit intent pop-ups</h3>
<p>We’ve talked about pop-ups thus far in the form of the welcome pop-up. And honestly, <em>any </em>pop-up, so long as it is useful, not intrusive, and offers a relevant piece of content or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/05/best-call-to-action-phrases">CTA</a>, is going to help you build your email list.</p>
<p>The key phrase here is <em>not intrusive. </em>Even the most relevant and useful piece of content can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/03/29/ux-conversion-rates">cause friction in your user experience</a> if it is offered at the incorrect time–say, right when your user is educating themselves about your brand, or on the verge of taking another meaningful action.</p>
<p>Exit intent pop-ups solve this problem by only triggering when a user is <strong>about to abandon the page</strong>. On mobile, this can take the form of clicking out of the browser or scrolling back up to the top of the page (a sign that the user is about to hit the “last” button on their mobile device). On desktop, it simply means that whenever your users’ cursor leaves the browser window, you can hit them with a perfectly-timed message.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/email-list-exit-popups.webp" alt="how to build an email list - example of exit pop up on website" width="808" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75135" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/email-list-exit-popups.webp 808w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/email-list-exit-popups-480x356.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 808px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>I’ve used exit intent pop-ups on a variety of sites to great effect. They are super low risk and low friction, especially when you target exclusively new users and non-subscribers (repeat users and existing subscribers are more likely to be leaving your site temporarily).</p>
<h3>6. Build great landing pages</h3>
<p>If you really want users to take the action you want (in this case, join your mailing list), you need to hold their hand a bit. Just driving traffic to your homepage or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/20/product-positioning">product page</a> and hoping you get their contact information isn’t going to cut it. In order to maximize your conversion rates, you need to constantly be creating (and split testing) relevant, <em>sticky</em> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">landing pages</a>.</p>
<p>What do I mean by sticky? Sticky doesn’t quite mean that there’s <em>nowhere </em>else for a user to go once they hit your landing page; it just means that filling out your form is going to be their most enticing/logical option.</p>
<p>Just getting a user to a more granular landing page is a great start. But you want to then make it as difficult as possible for that person to leave the page without taking the desired action.</p>
<p>Check out this landing page from Uber:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/email-list-landing-page.webp" alt="email list - example landing page from uber" width="781" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75136" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/email-list-landing-page.webp 781w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/email-list-landing-page-480x368.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 781px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>What I love about this lander is its simplicity. All we have here are the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>A headline</li>
<li>A subheadline</li>
<li>A form with a CTA</li>
<li>Two links for other prospects types (renters and riders)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re a driver, and not a renter or a rider, you really only have two choices to make here. You can leave the page, or you can fill out the form. Uber has even removed the top-level site navigation from this page, which is another trick that I love to use to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/03/improve-conversion-rates">maximize conversion rate</a>.</p>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Get the guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLiQContentDLHowToMakeGreatLandingPages.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_LandingPages_HowToMakeGreatLandingPagesGuide_Download">How to Make Landing Pages (with Crazy-High Conversions!)</a></div></div>
<h3>7. Test and optimize your landing pages</h3>
<p>There are a ton of cool landing page testing tools out there. Tools like Unbounce and CrazyEgg will allow you to create, host, and split-test standalone landing pages and measure the results. HubSpot has some nice design functionality but, in my experience, limited testing features.</p>
<p>If you want to really invest in split testing, VWO is another pretty robust option that also gives you the benefit of personalization (dynamically catering the landing page experience to users based on what you know about them).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/email-list-test-optimize-landing-pages.webp" alt="email list - unbounce landing page optimization tool " width="648" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75137" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/email-list-test-optimize-landing-pages.webp 648w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/email-list-test-optimize-landing-pages-480x444.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 648px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Unbounce’s testing UI, which includes the ability to create new variants and measure results.</em></p>
<p>Whatever <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/07/landing-page-test-ideas">landing page testing tool</a> you go with, make sure you’re testing the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your headline</strong>. Arguably the most important piece of copy on the page, your headline grabs the attention of users, and encourages them to stay on the page and take action.</li>
<li><strong>Call-to-action (CTA)</strong>. The critical piece of text that compels users to take action. Try playing around with different colors, sizes, text, and placement of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/20/call-to-action-buttons">CTA buttons</a> to identify the most effective combinations.</li>
<li><strong>Form fields.</strong> Generally speaking, fewer fields equates to reduced friction, which equates to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/19/conversion-rate-benchmarks">higher conversion rates</a>. Keep your forms lean, and make sure people know what information you expect from them and why you need it.</li>
<li><strong>Visuals.</strong> Make sure they are fully compressed, and/or in WebP format for speed. Use videos to illustrate important concepts. Try multiple variations to see what resonates.</li>
<li><strong>Social proof.</strong> There’s nothing like a well-placed G2 badge, award, review, or testimonial to show potential customers that they’re not alone in filling out your form–many more have done so before them, and many will after.</li>
</ul>

<p>You paid to be in it. You paid to get your copy. And now it&#8217;s yours. But do you start at page one? No no. The order is as follows: Your own picture. The senior superlatives. The teams or clubs you belong to. The rest.</p>
<p>My point is, we don&#8217;t just love to reminisce. We love to read about ourselves. See the fruits of our investments. Feel a part of something bigger. And it is with this point in mind that I&#8217;m sharing with you today how to write a year-in-review email for your customers that they will actually read! Read on to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why write a year-in-review email</li>
<li>How to keep it customer-centric</li>
<li>Lots of ideas and examples to inspire you</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why write a year-in-review email?</h2>
<p><span><span><span><span>In addition to being something people are generally interested in, sharing a recap also has business benefits. It can:</span></span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strengthen confidence in your business: </strong>Celebrating your growth and achievements from the year reinforces your dedication and competency within your industry and affirms your <a href="/blog/ws/2021/04/23/influence-buyers-marketing-psychology">customers&#8217; decision </a>to choose your business over competitors.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain loyalty: </strong>Customers appreciate when you share what you&#8217;re proud of with them. It tells them they are a part of your community and you value their opinion. It also reminds them of how hard you work and gives them reason to continue supporting you. And on the flip side, when you express appreciation for their support, you strengthen the bond that keeps them coming back to you.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce churn: </strong>When your email tells your customers what <em>they</em> have accomplished, it reminds them how much your product or service helped them achieve success and inspires them to accomplish even more next year—keeping them engaged with your product.</li>
</ul>
<p><span><span><span>Take a look at the example below by emagazine platform Texture, which shares a reader&#8217;s minutes reading compared to all users and even money and trees saved.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/year-in-review-email-examples-texture.png" alt="year-in-review-email-examples-texture" width="376" height="704" class="aligncenter wp-image-52519 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/year-in-review-email-examples-texture.png 376w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/year-in-review-email-examples-texture-160x300.png 160w" sizes="(max-width: 376px) 100vw, 376px" /></p>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em><span><span><span>If I were a Texture customer, I&#8217;d be motivated to beat everyone&#8217;s average,<br />
save more money, and spare more trees next year. (<a href="https://movableink.com/blog/3-ways-top-brands-create-engaging-year-in-review-emails" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Image source</span></a>)</span></span></span></em></p>
<h2>End-of-year/year-in-review email ideas</h2>
<p>There are a few different ways to write a year-in-review email. Depending on your industry, audience, and resources, you might choose one or any combination of the following:</p>
<h3>1. Growth stats</h3>
<p><span><span><span>Share stats and facts that show how you&#8217;ve <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/12/growth-marketing">grown</a>, such as: reached x customers, welcomed x new team members, opened a new location, moved to a bigger office, launched a new partnership.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN"><span><span><span>Avoid vanity metrics or offputting stats like number of social media followers or upgrades.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<h3>2. Milestones &amp; achievements</h3>
<p><span><span><span>Look back on some of the intangibles, like awards or nominations, successful events, new or improved products, features, or services,  anniversaries, or big projects like a rebrand, new site launch, or acquisition.</span></span></span></p>
<h3>3. Account-specific reports</h3>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>People love when someone <em>else</em> talks about them or celebrates their achievements. </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>Spotify&#8217;s Wrapped is a quintessential example of this type of year-end recap, but it&#8217;s great for any device, app, or account with individual stats,</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>This is also popular for SaaS platforms with analytics.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/year-in-review-email-examples-iterable-numbers.png" alt="year-in-review-email-examples-iterable-numbers" width="500" height="643" class="aligncenter wp-image-52520 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/year-in-review-email-examples-iterable-numbers.png 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/year-in-review-email-examples-iterable-numbers-480x617.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/your-2018-year-in-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<h3>4. Superlatives</h3>
<p><span><span><span>Sharing stats and data for every account can be resource-heavy and sometimes runs the risk of syncing issues or data not loading. Instead, you might take a look at your behavioral data and identify trends from your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/17/customer-insights"> customer insights</a>, like the top-selling products, most popular blog posts, most shared social media posts, most popular product of <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/april-newsletter-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">each month</a>, and more.  </span></span></span></p>
<h3>5. Industry stories</h3>
<p><span><span><span>Some businesses will have access to more interesting information than others for the above ideas. If you can&#8217;t quite come up with something compelling, consider recapping some top stories or interesting stats of the year in your industry and for each one, share a brief reflection, action you took, or relevant tip. </span></span></span></p>

<h2>Year-in-review email tips</h2>
<p>In addition to regular <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/01/email-marketing-tips">email marketing best practices</a>, follow these tips to make your year-end email the best it can be:</p>
<h3><span><span><span>1. Keep it separate from your holiday greeting or promotional emails</span></span></span></h3>
<p><span>A year-in-review email should be different from your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/29/holiday-customer-appreciation-letter"> customer holiday greeting email</a> and promotional emails. Your greeting email should be 100% customer-centric, focused on appreciation and gratitude. Your promotional emails will of course be conversion-focused. Your YIR email falls in the middle of those two, showing appreciation but in a way that encourages the reader to continue using your business. </span></p>
<h3>2. Use numbers</h3>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>You&#8217;ll notice in just about all of these examples there are numbers. The people love the numbers and the tangibles.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<h3>3. Visualize it&#8230;</h3>
<p><span><span><span>Don&#8217;t just give your readers a bunch of text. Create a timeline or a journey path, include pictures or graphics, or even create a video.&#8217;</span></span></span></p>
<h3>4. &#8230;but keep it mobile-friendly</h3>
<p>This is a great visual by Big Cartel, and even though it appears as though it has a link to a page with the graphic and perhaps more details, the image in the email requires zooming and shifting, not a natural scroll.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/year-in-review-email-example-cartel.png" alt="year-in-review-email-example-cartel" width="500" height="790" class="aligncenter wp-image-52521 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/year-in-review-email-example-cartel.png 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/year-in-review-email-example-cartel-480x758.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.wholewhale.com/tips/year-review-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<h3>5. Make it customer-centric</h3>
<p><span><span><span>Always make it about them! This is easy if you have customer data or achievements to share, but not necessary. The example above reads:</span></span></span></p>
<blockquote><p><em>2015 was a huge year for Big Cartel &#8211;  not only for our team, but for the army of talented artists who build their businesses with us. Thank you for making our favorite moments from this year possible, and for being a part of this incredible community.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The example by Wix below does this as well, saying, &#8220;Before we jump into 2018, let&#8217;s look back at the most memorable moments of last year and see what we achieved together.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/year-in-review-email-examples-wix.png" alt="year-in-review-email-examples-wix" width="500" height="652" class="aligncenter wp-image-52522 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/year-in-review-email-examples-wix.png 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/year-in-review-email-examples-wix-480x626.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em><span><span><span><a href="https://chamaileon.io/resources/7-surprising-practical-new-year-email-ideas-email-subject-lines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Image source</span></a></span></span></span></em></p>
<p><span><span><span>So frame your accomplishments as achieved because of your customers—through their support, their use of your product, their reviews, feedback, votes, social shares, and more. </span></span></span></p>
<h3>5. Thank your readers</h3>
<p>Do NOT forget this part. The Wix email above nails the &#8220;togetherness&#8221; but fails to thank its customers. I&#8217;m sure the post it links to includes this, but it&#8217;s still important to include it in the email itself.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Thank you for choosing Texture for all your reading needs!</em></p>
<p><em><span><span><span>It’s all possible because of our incredible community of customers and contributors! THANK YOU!</span></span></span></em></p>
<p><em><span><span><span>Great work this year and thank you for being such an integral part of our growth in 2021.</span></span></span></em></p></blockquote>
<h3>6. Don&#8217;t create a landing page disguised as a thank you</h3>
<p>Remember, frame this email as a celebration of growth, achieved with or made possible by your customers. The email below has an attractive, clean, and readable design, but although it reads &#8220;A year in review,&#8221; and &#8220;Thanks for being a part of our creative community,&#8221; the <a href="/blog/ws/2021/05/25/email-copywriting-tips">email copy</a> does not support that.</p>
<p>Moreover, it closes with &#8220;Haven&#8217;t taken a class yet? Start today and join our growing number of students!&#8221; with a CTA to enroll.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/year-in-review-email-example-bc_classes.png" alt="year-in-review-email-example-bc_classes" width="720" height="447" class="aligncenter wp-image-52524 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/year-in-review-email-example-bc_classes.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/year-in-review-email-example-bc_classes-480x298.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>Great design, not a year-in-review. (</em><span><span><span><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin-builder/?is_video=false&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Femaildesign.beefree.io%2Fbest-year-in-review-emails-2017%2F&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Femaildesign.beefree.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F12%2Fbc-review.png&amp;description=The%207%20Best%20Year%20in%20Review%20Emails%20of%202017&amp;method=bookmarklet"><span>Image source</span></a>)</span></span></span></p>
<p>The numbers could still work in a year-in-review email, but the language is not framed as accomplishments made together. It feels like a sneaky disguised landing page—a good way to lose customers.</p>
<h3>7. Make it actionable</h3>
<p>There are a number of ways to make your year-in-review email actionable:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span>Provide recommendations based on the information you include.</span></span></span></li>
<li>Share only a snippet and include a link for them to view the full review in a blog post—a good way to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">drive traffic to your site</a>.</li>
<li><span><span><span>For B2C, give them the option to share their numbers on social.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>For B2B, make it easy for them to share the report with the rest of their team. </span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN"><span><span><span>Year-in-review emails are great for generating leads and conversions, engaging your audience, and retaining customers. T</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>his is not your holiday thank you greeting to your customers, so it&#8217;s also okay—and encouraged—to include a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/05/best-call-to-action-phrases">call to action phrase</a>, such as to</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign up for your newsletter</li>
<li>Follow your social channels</li>
<li>Shop your store</li>
<li>Learn about an upgrade</li>
<li>Continue using your platform or app</li>

<blockquote><p><em>That&#8217;s a wrap for 2017. But we can&#8217;t wait to share what next year has in store for creators, brands, and video lovers like Y-O-U. Until then, upload away and keep our screens glowing bright.</em></p></blockquote>
<h3><span><span><span><span><span>8. Get customers excited for the new year</span></span></span></span></span></h3>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Having a CTA at the end adds in the element of a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/21/build-client-relationships">continued relationship with your customer</a> into the next year, but you can turn things up a notch with a little teaser.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<blockquote><p><em>In a weird way, 2018 was all about 2019. We can&#8217;t tell you everything that&#8217;s coming this year, but take our word for it—there&#8217;s never been a better time to upload and do more with your videos.</em></p></blockquote>

<h2>Year-in-review email examples</h2>
<p><span><span><span><span>Let&#8217;s take a look at a few more year-in-review email examples that you can steal ideas from. </span></span></span></span></p>
<h3>1. SiteGround—coverage turned into a contest</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.siteground.com/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SiteGround&#8217;s year in review</a> also doubles as a raffle for a pair of custom Bose headphones. It takes you through a journey of updates, announcements, and milestones, collecting points for you along the way. The further you scroll down the page, the more points you collect and then those points go into your raffle. This is a great way to highlight your accomplishments and brag a bit about your business while keeping it customer-centric.</p>

<h3>2. Vimeo—engaging, but <em>one thing</em> missing</h3>
<p><span><span><span>Vimeo&#8217;s Top 18 Hits of ‘18 email shows some impressive design work:</span></span></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/year-in-review-email-example-vimeo.png" alt="year-in-review-email-example-vimeo" width="450" height="632" class="aligncenter wp-image-52547 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/year-in-review-email-example-vimeo.png 450w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/year-in-review-email-example-vimeo-214x300.png 214w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em><span><span><span><a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/top-18-of-18-2"><span><span><span><span>View the full email here</span></span></span></span></a>.</span></span></span></em></p>
<p><span><span><span>It&#8217;s clean, colorful, and readable, and shares a mix of information types. But while this year-in-review email is engaging, it&#8217;s all about Vimeo. There is no customer appreciation!</span></span></span></p>
<blockquote><p><em>We couldn’t be more excited for 2019. But before we get ahead of ourselves, lets remember that a lot happened in 2018. Like, a lot. Let’s wrap an amazing, video-opacked year with our greatest Vimeo Hits.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span><span><span>I&#8217;d be willing to bet that Vimeo had a separate end-of-year customer appreciation email, but it&#8217;s still important to incorporate it here as well. </span></span></span></p>
<h3>3. Campaign Monitor—superb customer centricity</h3>
<p><span><span><span>This is actually a blog post, but Campaign Monitor does such a fantastic job of sharing its growth and achievements of the year in a customer-centric and creative way, I had to share it. </span></span></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/year-in-review-examples-campaign-monitor.png" alt="year-in-review-examples-campaign-monitor" width="720" height="352" class="aligncenter wp-image-52549 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/year-in-review-examples-campaign-monitor.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/year-in-review-examples-campaign-monitor-480x235.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><span><span><span><a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2020-year-in-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><span><span><span><span>View the full recap here</span></span></span></span></em></a></span></span></span></p>
<p>Some key callouts:</p>
<ul>
<li>When sharing platform usage stats, Campaign Monitor makes its customers feel proud by calling them <strong>&#8220;curious subscriber scientists,&#8221; &#8220;customer experience architects,&#8221; &#8220;email artisans,&#8221;</strong> and more. In fact, we could add these to our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/22/power-words">power words list</a>!</li>
<li>Instead of boasting that its platform was used by 416,422 marketers to send 30.7 billion emails in 192 countries—the simple heading of<strong> &#8220;Your subscribers turned to the inbox more than ever,&#8221;</strong> shifts the tone to celebrating its customers&#8217; importance.</li>
<li><span><span><span>Before sharing the new features it released each month, the heading turns it into a collaborative achievement with <strong>&#8220;You asked, we answered&#8221;</strong> and what its customers &#8220;tapped into.&#8221;</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Campaign monitor shows genuine appreciation for its customers with phrases like: </span></span></span>&#8220;<span><span><span>When times got tough, Campaign Monitor customers got smarter,&#8221; and &#8220;</span></span></span><span><span><span>You rose to the occasion with tenacity and ingenuity, &#8221; and</span></span></span>​​​​ &#8220;<span><span><span>We were honored to be with you every step of the way.&#8221;</span></span></span></li>
<li><strong>&#8220;It’s all possible because of our incredible community of customers and contributors! THANK YOU!&#8221;</strong></li>
<li><span><span><span>Finally, you get something to look forward to:</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><em>Look forward to a long list of new tools, resources, and inspiration coming in 2021, starting with our much-awaited annual Email Marketing Global Benchmarks Report. Keep an eye out for it early January!&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<h3>4. Wix—short &amp; (mostly) sweet</h3>
<p>Wix&#8217;s approach makes this a short and sweet email that grabs your attention at the start and sends you to its website to view more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/year-in-review-email-concise-wix.png" alt="year-in-review-email-concise-wix" width="600" height="697" class="aligncenter wp-image-52551 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/year-in-review-email-concise-wix.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/year-in-review-email-concise-wix-480x558.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>

<p>Again, the full post most likely ends with an expression of gratitude, but there&#8217;s enough information here for a reader to leave it at that, so something like &#8220;Check out the sweetest moments of 2016, made possible by you!&#8221;</p>
<h3>5. Strava—comical, relatable, watchable</h3>
<p><span><span><span><span>As a cycler myself, I appreciated this email example. Plus, not only did Strava make the email more engaging with a recap video and super <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/05/conversational-tone">conversational tone</a>, but it also included some numbers right in the email to make it satisfying on its own.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>This email is the perfect example of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/08/write-emails-like-a-human">how to write emails like a human being.</a> Just the right number of emojis, parentheses, puns, and exclamation points to give the copy and the CTAs a friendly, personable feel.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Stephanie!<br />
Another crazy year (almost) in the books. We’re just feeling so lucky we get to do what we do. Some highlights of our year:</p>
<ol>
<li>We launched our now-signature Nap Earrings <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f634.png" alt="😴" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (Poke free and designed for 24/7 wear!)</li>
<li>Our team grew! We hired 2 new awesome Customer Care Associates: Bobbi and Sophie.</li>
<li>We launched 100 Days of Ear Parties, an amazing campaign where we get to spotlight our creative community of dreamers, thinkers, and makers.</li>
</ol>
<p>We don’t want to make any promises we can’t deliver on for Christmas shipping (pun intended) &#8211; but it’s never too late for a gift card! No shipping required, no stress involved.</p>
<p>It’s also never too late to get yourself a little something for being such a great and thoughtful gift-giver this year. There’s no deadline to treat yourself and you totally deserve it.<br />
With <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2764.png" alt="❤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  from NYC,<br />

<h3>9. Todoist—a personalized &amp; practical churn buster</h3>
<p><span>Todoist nails it with its &#8220;Your Year in Productivity&#8221; email, leaving you practically begging to renew your subscription for next year.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/todoist-year-in-review-productivity-email.png" alt="todoist-year-in-review-productivity-email" width="600" height="832" class="aligncenter wp-image-52530 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/todoist-year-in-review-productivity-email.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/todoist-year-in-review-productivity-email-480x666.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>

<p><span>There are three <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/13/call-to-action-examples">CTAs</a> in this email, but they all work nicely together. The first is to view your report. The report itself is packed with stats, superlatives, and comparison information that will inspire you to use the platform even more in the coming year, and the preceding copy encourages this:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;How did your productivity fare this trip around the sun? Did you rank in the top stratosphere of Todoist users, or did you fall off the shuttle? See how you did in 2017 and prepare to embark on a new mission in 2018.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span>It then has a CTA to enroll in a free class to improve your productivity in the coming year, and to claim a discount for certain industries.</span></p>
<p><span>The only thing it&#8217;s missing is a thank you! A little <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-appreciation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer appreciation</a> goes a long way!</span></p>
<h3>10. LocaliQ</h3>
<p>Our year-in-review email provides clients with a full overview of their search marketing achievements for the year, including impressions, clicks, click-through rate, leads, and calls—plus a special promo for 20% off an additional advertising solution. Good stuff if we don&#8217;t say so ourselves!</p>
<blockquote><p>With the power of LocaliQ behind you, 2022 was an exciting year of growth. Here are some of your top search marketing achievements that helped you take control of your business goals and prosper. Plus, a special offer to help you continue to seize your potential in 2023.</p></blockquote>

<h2><span>How to use these holiday email templates</span></h2>
<p>This post contains both the copy and creative you can use for your holiday customer appreciation emails.

<p><span>In such a short piece of content as this, small details have big effects. Here&#8217;s how to get it right.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span> </span><span>Keep it short and use a conversational tone. This is an e-toast, not a live journal.</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Be warm and positive, but not overly hyped. The holidays can be difficult for many people. </span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Make it visual with some graphics or a team photo.</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Share your growth and achievements to give customers a reason to stay confident in your business.</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Make it about them. The growth you achieved with their support. Express gratitude!</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Connect it back to your mission. Not your value prop.</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Focus on the future. Speak to an ongoing relationship, but not through a CTA or sales promotion. You can (and should!), however, incorporate CTAs into a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/12/08/year-in-review-email-examples">year-in-review email.</a></span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You put a lot of effort into <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/05/increase-email-signups">growing your email list</a>, so it&#8217;s easy to fall into the trap of over-valuing your subscriber numbers. But what good does a high subscriber count do if your other numbers aren&#8217;t increasing?</p>
<p>Numbers like open rate&#8230; click-to-open ratio&#8230;ROI.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/email-list-cleanup-benefits.png" alt="benefits of email list cleanup" width="720" height="491" class="size-full wp-image-68166 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/email-list-cleanup-benefits.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/email-list-cleanup-benefits-480x327.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, email marketing is a great way to stay connected with your prospects and customers, but only if you&#8217;re reaching engaged, quality contacts who value your emails.</p>
<p>So in this post, we&#8217;re going to share 10 tips to help you declutter your email marketing list so you can get the results you want.</p>
<p>But first, let&#8217;s dive into why it&#8217;s so essential.</p>
<h2>Why do I need to clean my email marketing list?</h2>
<p>Running monthly email list cleanup is an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/03/email-marketing-best-practices">email marketing best practice</a> that helps you to drive better metrics, insights, and ROI. Here’s how:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>More meaningful communication.</strong> A clean <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/11/how-to-build-an-email-list">email list</a> is segmented according to your subscribers’ preferences, occupations, interests, etc, allowing you to deliver personalized communication with targeted messaging.</li>
<li><strong>Higher engagement.  </strong>With more personalized communication, of course, comes higher open rates and click-to-open rates.</li>
<li><strong>Further optimization.</strong> The more engagement with your emails, the more granular insights you can gather about your subscribers from campaigns and A/B tests, like which content topics they prefer and which <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/05/best-call-to-action-phrases">call to action phrases</a> resonate best. This enables you to optimize the experience further and retain their long-term interest and loyalty.</li>
<li><strong>Stay out of spam filters.</strong> High bounce rates, spam complaints, and unsubscribes all indicate to email servers and filters that your business cannot be trusted. This means your emails will be flagged as spam, which is detrimental to your reputation and deliverability.</li>
</ul>

<h2>10 tips to declutter your email marketing list</h2>
<p>According to Litmus, email drives an average ROI of <a href="https://www.litmus.com/resources/email-marketing-roi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$36</a> for every $1 spent. That’s higher than any other channel—but it’s not a guarantee. To achieve this goal and beyond, you need a clean, high-value email list. Here are nine email cleaning tips to help you secure a higher ROI.</p>
<h3>1. Remove your hard-bounce emails</h3>
<p>A hard bounce is an email that fails to reach the sender due to a permanent issue. This could be that the recipient’s email address is invalid or the domain has blocked email delivery.</p>
<p>Unlike a soft bounce (which is when the email is temporarily undeliverable) there’s no way of resolving hard bounce emails.</p>
<p>If spam filters and email servers think your hard bounce rates are too high, they’ll flag you as potential spam and block your IP address, harming your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/email-sender-reputation">sender reputation</a> and email deliverability. Always check your list for hard-bounce emails and delete them ASAP.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/hard-bounce-and-soft-bounce-email.png" alt="hard vs soft bounce email" width="720" height="405" class="size-full wp-image-68100 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/hard-bounce-and-soft-bounce-email.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/hard-bounce-and-soft-bounce-email-480x270.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.limeleads.com/blog/hard-bounce-vs-soft-bounce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<h3>2. Delete duplicate emails</h3>
<p>You may find—particularly if you import contacts—that some users are subscribed to your list multiple times. This is a big no-no, as these recipients will receive multiple copies of the same email.</p>
<p>Aside from sabotaging the accuracy of your campaign’s performance metrics, duplicate emails are often thrown straight into the spam folder. Their obtrusiveness can even lead users to unsubscribe completely.</p>
<h3>3. Determine your inactive subscribers</h3>
<p>Your email provider should be able to show you metrics for individual subscribers, such as their email open, click-through, and conversion rates. You can use this information to determine your inactive subscribers and target them with re-engagement campaigns (more on that in a minute).</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, it might be worth deleting inactive subscribers immediately. If a user has never engaged with your brand beyond their initial subscription—especially if it’s been a significant period of time —then it’s probably easier to just delete the address and move on.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/risk-value-spectrum-of-inactive-email-subscribers.png" alt="risk value spectrum of inactive email subscribers" width="551" height="493" class="wp-image-68111 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/risk-value-spectrum-of-inactive-email-subscribers.png 551w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/risk-value-spectrum-of-inactive-email-subscribers-480x429.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 551px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.litmus.com/blog/how-to-manage-the-3-kinds-of-inactive-email-subscribers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<h3>4. Visualize your ideal subscriber</h3>
<p>Your ideal subscriber is the one who opens and engages with every single email. But who exactly are they?</p>
<p>By creating subscriber/<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/23/buyer-personas">customer personas</a>, you can paint a clearer picture of your ideal subscriber and create hyper-targeted, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing">personalized content</a>. A subscriber persona is a semi-fictional characterization of your ideal subscriber, based on market research and data.</p>
<p>Subscriber personas also help you source higher-quality leads, which in turn results in a higher-quality email list. This means you can spend less time on rigorous monthly email cleaning and more time perfecting your email style guide and creating results-generating campaigns.</p>
<h3>5. Use a proper list management software</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/01/automated-email-marketing">Email automation software</a> helps you manage your email lists more efficiently. Some of the popular tools include <a href="https://www.activecampaign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ActiveCampaign</a>, <a href="https://moosend.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moosend</a>, <a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mailchimp</a>, and <a href="https://www.sendinblue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SendinBlue</a>. Alongside your market research, they provide the information and tools you need to segment your email lists based on your subscribers’ interests, behavior, engagement, etc.</p>
<p>With list segmentation, you can create personalized and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-email-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeted email marketing campaigns</a> that drive engagement and higher ROI.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/email-marketing-list-segmentation.png" alt="email marketing list segmentation" width="651" height="434" class="size-full wp-image-68112 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/email-marketing-list-segmentation.png 651w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/email-marketing-list-segmentation-480x320.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 651px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcustomerexperience/tip/9-strategies-for-email-marketing-segmentation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<p>Other helpful features of email list management software include contact categorization and two-way data syncing between apps, both of which keep your lists orderly and updated.</p>
<p>It should also integrate with your other communication tools, such as your call center software and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/09/crm-for-small-business">CRM</a>. For example, you might create triggered emails that send immediately after someone interacts with your <a href="https://www.dialpad.com/features/virtual-receptionist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">virtual receptionist service</a> or chatbot.</p>
<h3>6. Make it easy to unsubscribe</h3>
<p>A difficult or long-winded unsubscription process can harm your business’ reputation. According to Qualtrics research, <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/xm-institute/how-consumers-give-feedback-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">33%</a> of consumers will privately tell their friends about a bad experience. Approximately 15% will share their negative experiences on social media. Not good for your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/06/online-reputation-management">reputation</a>.</p>
<p>Whether it’s because their interests have changed or they accidentally subscribed while making a purchase, sometimes users will want to unsubscribe. By providing them with an easy way to opt out, you can organically maintain good email hygiene while <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/why-good-online-reputation-is-important/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preserving your positive reputation</a>.</p>
<p>A simple link in your email’s footer and a playful confirmation message usually does the job!</p>

<h3>7. Run a re-engagement campaign for inactive customers</h3>
<p>After you’ve identified all of your inactive users, you have three main options. The first, as we discussed earlier, is to simply delete the addresses from your list. The second is to target them with a re-engagement campaign.</p>
<p>Re-engagement campaigns specifically target inactive users with hyper-personalized, incentivizing offers. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/13/sales-promotion-examples">Discounts and vouchers</a> are a popular go-to, but asking questions and showcasing new features are all ways that you can draw inactive subscribers back in.</p>

<h3>8. Locate inactive users and give them the option to opt-out</h3>
<p>If you’re afraid of prematurely removing your inactive users, you could try reaching out to them with an opt-out email beforehand.</p>
<p>Opt-out emails will usually trigger one of three actions. Either the user will gracefully opt out of your emails (which results in less manual email cleaning for you); they won’t respond (which is a sure sign that their address should be deleted); or they&#8217;ll re-engage, especially if you throw in some humor and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">emotion</a>.</p>

<h3>9. Try an opt-down option</h3>
<p>You could also present your users with an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/12/27/email-marketing-ios15">email marketing strategy</a> called the ‘opt-down’ option. Opting down simply means that users can customize both the type and frequency of the emails they receive. This customer-centric approach ensures that users only receive what they’re interested in.</p>

<p>It could also be the case that they’d prefer a different method of communication instead, such as phone or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/09/sms-marketing">SMS</a>. For telephone communications, make sure you <a href="https://www.dialpad.com/blog/how-to-get-800-number-for-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get an 800 business number</a> to establish your credibility.</p>
<h3>10. Practice the art of letting go</h3>
<p>This is more of a psychological <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/01/email-marketing-tips">email marketing tip</a>. Letting go of inactive subscribers is hard, even when you understand why it’s so important. Practicing the art of letting go will help you become more assertive in how you manage your email list, prioritizing quality and value over subscriber count. 100 engaged readers are better than 1000 disengaged readers.</p>
