										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Picture this: You&#8217;re scrolling through Facebook and see two ads for local plumbing services.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first shows flashy graphics promising &#8220;LOWEST PRICES GUARANTEED!&#8221;</li>
<li>The second features a photo of the owner in uniform, mentions his 15 years of experience, displays his Better Business Bureau rating, and includes a testimonial from a satisfied customer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which one would you trust with your home&#8217;s plumbing emergency?</p>
<p>If you chose the second ad, you&#8217;ve just witnessed the power of ethos in digital advertising. Data shows that while <a href="https://www.edelman.com/news-awards/only-one-third-of-consumers-trust-most-of-the-brands-they-buy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">81%</a> of consumers need to trust a brand before considering a purchase, only 39% of consumers actually trust advertising overall. This trust gap represents both a <em>massive</em> challenge and an incredible opportunity for small business owners who understand how to build credibility through their digital marketing.</p>
<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll explore how ethos—one of the three classical modes of persuasion—can transform your digital advertising from ignored interruptions into trusted recommendations.</p>

<div id="what-is-ethos"></div>
<h2>What is ethos?</h2>
<p><em>Ethos</em>, first described by Aristotle over 2,000 years ago, focuses on the credibility and character of the messenger. While <em>pathos</em> appeals to emotions and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/small-business-logo"><em>logos</em></a> relies on logical arguments, <em>ethos</em> answers the fundamental question every potential customer asks: &#8220;Why should I trust you?&#8221;</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ethos-pathos-logos-definitions.webp" alt="ethos pathos logos definitions" width="900" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93741" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ethos-pathos-logos-definitions.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ethos-pathos-logos-definitions-480x427.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In the context of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/24/digital-advertising">digital advertising</a>, ethos means demonstrating that your business knows what it&#8217;s talking about and can be trusted to deliver on its promises. This credibility is built through three essential pillars:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Character</strong> involves showing integrity, honesty, and moral standards in your messaging. This might mean admitting when you&#8217;re not the right fit for a customer or being transparent about your pricing and processes.</li>
<li><strong>Competence</strong> demonstrates your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/14/google-e-e-a-t">expertise</a>, knowledge, and skill in your field. This could include showcasing certifications, years of experience, specialized training, or industry recognition.</li>
<li><strong>Care</strong> reveals genuine concern for customers&#8217; needs and well-being, showing that you prioritize their success over your own profit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Traditional &#8220;salesy&#8221; advertising often falls short because it focuses exclusively on what the business wants—more sales, more customers, more revenue. Ethos-driven advertising flips this script by first establishing why the business deserves the customer&#8217;s trust and attention.</p>
<p>The digital environment creates unique challenges for establishing credibility. Online, potential customers can&#8217;t visit your physical storefront, meet you face-to-face, or rely on traditional trust signals like location and appearance. Without these conventional credibility markers, your digital advertising must work harder to establish trust, making ethos not just helpful but essential for small businesses competing in digital spaces.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f9e0.png" alt="🧠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Marketing psychology can help you capture more customers.</strong> Use it to your advantage with our free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite26BrilliantWaysToUsePsychology.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_TextLink_guide_26waysPsychGuide_Download">26 Brilliant Ways to Use Psychology in Your Copywriting (with Examples)</a></p>
<div id="why-does-ethos-work-in-advertising-data-stats"></div>
<h2>The science behind why ethos works: Data and statistics</h2>
<p>The numbers tell a compelling story about the importance of trust in consumer decision-making.</p>
<p>Personal recommendations from friends and family remain the most trusted advertising channel, which explains why <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/word-of-mouth-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">word-of-mouth marketing</a> continues to be so powerful. In fact, McKinsey &amp; Co. reported that word-of-mouth is the primary factor behind <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/a-new-way-to-measure-word-of-mouth-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20-50%</a> of all purchasing decisions.</p>
<p>However, digital channels often score significantly lower. This trust deficit in digital advertising creates both a problem and an opportunity. Businesses that can successfully establish credibility in their digital ads gain a significant competitive advantage over those relying on traditional promotional messaging.</p>
<p>From a conversion perspective, credible advertising leads to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization-marketing">higher conversion rates</a> and lower customer acquisition costs. When potential customers trust your message, they require less convincing and move through the sales funnel more quickly. This reduced friction translates directly into improved return on advertising spend.</p>
<p>Trust also creates a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/neuromarketing">neurological advantage</a>. When audiences perceive credibility, their brains process information more favorably and retain positive impressions longer. This means ethos-based advertising doesn&#8217;t just drive immediate action—it builds lasting <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/brand-perception">brand recognition</a> and preference.</p>
<p>For small businesses, investing in credibility-based marketing yields better long-term returns. While a flashy discount ad might generate immediate sales, credibility-building content creates brand equity and increases customer lifetime value. This makes ethos particularly valuable for small businesses that rely on repeat customers and referrals for sustainable growth.</p>

<div id="real-life-ethos-examples-in-ads"></div>
<h2>Real life ethos examples in ads</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s examine how actual small businesses are using ethos to build trust and drive results through their digital advertising.</p>
<div id="community-engagement"></div>
<h3>1. Community engagement</h3>
<p>Demonstrating <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/19/brand-community">community engagement</a> ethos means sharing some element of your background with your audience: your expertise, your passion, your reason for doing what you do. In this case, a personal interview is a great way to highlight the brains behind the local brand.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ethos-example-engagement.webp" alt="ethos example - community engagement" width="348" height="406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93744" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ethos-example-engagement.webp 348w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ethos-example-engagement-257x300.webp 257w" sizes="(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px" /></p>
<p>L.D. Smith demonstrates “ethos” with a three-minute interview about how Smith got into plumbing. Viewers also hear about his most common service calls—clogged kitchen sinks, no hot water—making it easy to picture themselves as customers in need.</p>
<p>There’s some additional <em>care </em>ethos coming through here, too: L.D. Smith’s passion for using his business to find homes that can shelter pets is a demonstration of moral priorities and community engagement.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4da.png" alt="📚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide download &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite120WordsforMarketingWithEmotion.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_120WordsPhrases_Download">135 of the Best Words &amp; Phrases for Marketing with Emotion</a></p>
<div id="testimonials"></div>
<h3>2. Testimonials</h3>
<p>Testimonials are a form of social proof ethos you can include in digital ads that let others do the talking for you. It’s one thing to tell everyone how great your store is, but it’s another to let your customers sing your praises. By leveraging <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/03/how-to-write-a-case-study">testimonials</a>, you let the voices of your happy customers do the selling.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ethos-example-testimonial.webp" alt="ethos example - testimonial for bookstore" width="800" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93745" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ethos-example-testimonial.webp 800w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ethos-example-testimonial-480x480.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>P&amp;P Bookstore celebrated its 40th year in business with a series of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/03/testimonial-advertising">digital ads featuring testimonials</a> from loyal, long-term customers. Each image featured a different quote that shared what the shopper loves and remembers about the store. This is a smart ethos play, as it helps customers see themselves enjoying the store and its offerings, too.</p>
<div id="company-founder-highlights"></div>
<h3>3. Company founder highlights</h3>
<p>Character ethos isn’t just about moral character but also about demonstrating your commitment to the work. Competence highlights how well this commitment to work manifests in the quality of your work: Are you enjoying yourself while out and about? Something as simple as a smile can communicate that. Finally, care reveals your genuine empathy for what your customers need.</p>
<p>For Jessica Jones, a travel agent and motorcoach operator, a simple picture accomplishes a little of all three. As the face of her travel agency, Jones shares a clear, friendly photograph in business attire. This demonstrates character and competence, establishing trust with her audience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ethos-example-founder.webp" alt="ethos example - founder facebook ad" width="455" height="683" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93746" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ethos-example-founder.webp 455w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ethos-example-founder-200x300.webp 200w" sizes="(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px" /></p>
<p>But there’s also that second element: community engagement. Jones is demonstrating that she works as a motorcoach operator in addition to having a passion for her travel agency. She cares about getting people from A to B. It can be challenging to demonstrate what a travel agent does, but this wink to her second job provides a showcase for her passion for travel. Without a single word, her entire ethos comes through.</p>
<div id="celebrity-endorsement"></div>
<h3>4. Celebrity endorsement</h3>
<p>A celebrity endorsement goes a long way in establishing credibility, as we tend to trust celebrities (see also: influencers) for quality recommendations. After all, if they’re lending their name and face to a brand, they must believe in it, right? It’s social proof at its best.</p>
<p>Restaurant Raising Cane&#8217;s partnered with artist Post Malone for a special collaboration, which helped spread the word about their new location in Dallas, TX.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ethos-example-celebrity-endorsement-post-malone-raising-canes.webp" alt="ethos example of a celebrity endorsement by post malone for raising cane's" width="717" height="700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93672" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ethos-example-celebrity-endorsement-post-malone-raising-canes.webp 717w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ethos-example-celebrity-endorsement-post-malone-raising-canes-480x469.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 717px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>While not every smaller business may be able to hire a well-known celeb to endorse their product or services, even partnering with local celebrities, influencers, and known figures in your area can help achieve this goal and boost your brand’s credibility and ethos within your digital marketing efforts.</p>
<div id="social-proof-awards"></div>
<h3>5. Social proof/awards</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-social-proof/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social proof</a> and awards validate your business’s ethos via accreditation, celebration, and a stamp of approval from a trusted source. These are powerful tools to weave into digital ads, as they help would-be customers understand the caliber of your business and its products.</p>
<p>Mattress company Casper, for example, used its #1 American-rated mattress award in an ad to show buyers that it’s a beloved product within its vertical.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ethos-example-casper-mattress.webp" alt="ethos example - social proof and awards - casper mattresses" width="600" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93747" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ethos-example-casper-mattress.webp 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ethos-example-casper-mattress-480x480.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Putting this award front and center means they can spotlight this ethos, and it helps provide some certainty around its product, which is not traditionally purchased online. It’s a smart way to overcome the ecommerce hurdle in instances where buyers want to try before they buy.</p>
<h2>Building long-term success through ethos in your ads</h2>
<p>In an increasingly skeptical digital landscape, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reputation-management">credibility</a> becomes a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/competitive-analysis">competitive advantage</a> that compounds over time. While ethos-based advertising might not generate the immediate clicks that flashy discount ads produce, it builds the foundation for sustainable business growth by creating trust, loyalty, and word-of-mouth referrals.</p>
<p>Start implementing these principles in your next advertising campaign. Choose one credibility element to highlight, whether it&#8217;s a certification, customer testimonial, or behind-the-scenes glimpse of your work. As you build comfort with ethos-based advertising, layer in additional credibility signals to create a comprehensive trust profile that sets your small business apart in the crowded digital marketplace.</p>

<div id="social-and-cultural-advertising-techniques"></div>
<h3>Social and cultural influence advertising techniques</h3>
<p>This is one of the best ways to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/06/how-to-write-copy-that-sells">write copy that sells</a>. Here are some advertising techniques that leverage social dynamics and cultural context to have a persuasive impact:</p>
<ul>

<p>All the information someone can find about your business builds up to your brand perception. As you can imagine, how you’re perceived online makes a big difference in the success of your marketing efforts.</p>

<h2>What is brand perception?</h2>
<p>Brand perception goes beyond just a logo and a tagline. It encompasses everything from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/04/customer-experience-strategy">customer experience</a> and product quality to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/09/company-core-values">brand values</a> and social responsibility.</p>
<p>Here are just a few inputs that make up the perception people have about your brand:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Website:</strong> This includes the appearance, content, and user experience for all of your web pages.</li>
<li><strong>Branding:</strong> Your logo, mission statement, brand colors, and tag lines are part of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/23/how-brand-your-business">branding</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Social media presence:</strong> What you post, where you post, and how you engage with followers fall into the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/17/increase-online-presence">social media presence</a> bucket.</li>
<li><strong>Customer experience:</strong> This includes how customers feel about your products and service and how they share their experience online and in person.</li>
</ul>

<div id="why-should-you-measure-brand-perception"></div>
<h2>Why should you measure brand perception?</h2>
<p>Think of brand perception as your reputation in the schoolyard. If you&#8217;re known for being reliable, trustworthy, and cool, classmates are more likely to befriend you.</p>
<p>In the business world, a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/06/online-reputation-management">good reputation</a> results in more people becoming your loyal customers. But if rumors paint a different picture, you might struggle to gain trust. That&#8217;s why it is important to understand and measure brand perception.</p>
<p>A strong brand perception builds trust and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/brand-loyalty">loyalty</a>, ultimately driving sales. It&#8217;s the invisible force shaping customer decisions and propelling business success.</p>
<p>When you track and quantify your brand’s perception, you can take action to shape it. Say you learn that people feel like your services are overpriced. Are they actually higher than your competitors? If not, you can launch some messaging to address that misperception.</p>

<div id="how-to-measure-brand-perception"></div>
<h2>How to measure brand perception</h2>
<p>So, how do you gauge your brand perception? The good news is there&#8217;s a toolbox full of tactics at your disposal.</p>
<h3>1. Surveys and questionnaires</h3>
<p>The best way to find out what your customers think about your brand is to <em>ask them! </em>Here are three different ways you can gather customer feedback directly:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer satisfaction surveys</strong>: Use tools like <a href="https://www.google.com/forms/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Forms</a> and <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SurveyMonkey</a> to create custom surveys to assess customer satisfaction with your products, services, and overall brand experience.</li>
<li><strong>Brand awareness surveys</strong>: Design surveys that measure how well your target audience <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">recognizes your brand</a> name and logo.</li>
<li><strong>Brand attribute research</strong>: Ask customers to rate your brand on key dimensions like quality, reliability, and customer service.</li>
</ul>
<ul></ul>
<p>Here’s a great example. <a href="https://www.alishaarnold.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alisha Arnold</a> helps Airbnb hosts improve their rankings and get more bookings. Her goal for this year is to return to one-on-one coaching sessions. So, she set up a survey her followers can participate in to weigh in–and win prizes:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/brand-perception-wordstream-giveaway.webp" alt="Brand perception - enter to win ad." width="497" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-87145 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/brand-perception-wordstream-giveaway.webp 497w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/brand-perception-wordstream-giveaway-480x579.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 497px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C2ffzAop6gx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>2. Social media listening</h3>
<p>Another way of determining how your brand is received in the market is by <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/20/social-listening">listening</a> to those talking about it on social media.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can do that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sentiment analysis</strong>: Tools like<a href="https://brand24.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Brand24</a> and<a href="https://mention.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Mention</a> offer sentiment analysis features. These tools scan social media posts and comments for mentions of your brand and then categorize them as positive, negative, or neutral.</li>
<li><strong>Hashtag monitoring</strong>: Both Brand24 and Mention also allow you to track <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags">hashtags</a> related to your brand and industry. This helps you understand how people talk about you and identify emerging trends.</li>
<li><strong>Engagement metrics</strong>: <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">51%</a> of the most memorable brands are those that engage with their customers on social media. Analyze native social media analytics to gauge engagement around your brand. Look at metrics like likes, shares, comments, and replies to understand how your audience interacts with your content.</li>
</ul>
<ul></ul>
<ul></ul>
<h3>3. Online reviews and ratings</h3>
<ol start="3"></ol>
<p>As mentioned above, potential customers will want to know how your brand treats people who do business with you. And they’ll do so by visiting the reviews and ratings you’ve received.</p>
<p>So, spruce up your record by doing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Review analysis</strong>: Claim your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/10/create-google-my-business-account">Google Business Profile</a>, Yelp account, and other <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/01/business-directory-listings">business listings</a>. These platforms allow you to respond directly to reviews, both positive and negative. So, check them regularly.</li>
<li><strong>Rating systems</strong>: Analyze the average star ratings given to your products or services on platforms like <a href="https://www.google.com/shopping?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Shopping</a> and industry-specific review sites. These ratings offer a direct indicator of customer perception.</li>
</ul>
<ul></ul>
<p>Here’s how one brand uses its great ratings. <a href="https://smilealot.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smile a Lot</a> is a Canada-based dental care business. Their official Instagram profile proudly displays high ratings and positive reviews their customers leave for them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/brand-perception-wordstream-smileallot.webp" alt="Brand perception - online review screenshot." width="865" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-87146 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/brand-perception-wordstream-smileallot.webp 865w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/brand-perception-wordstream-smileallot-480x333.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 865px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyx-F90MPY4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>4. Focus groups</h3>
<p>Use online communities like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/16/create-facebook-group">Facebook groups</a> or niche online forums on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/drive-traffic-from-reddit">Reddit</a> that are relevant to your industry. Here, you can engage in discussions and pose questions to get a feel for brand perception among your target audience.</p>
<p>Try searching for your business&#8217;s name in these forums. If you search for the products you sell, you may also see how your competitors are perceived.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.deargirlsltd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dear Girls</a> is an emotional well-being organization for Black women. Besides a Discord group and an active <a href="https://www.instagram.com/deargirlsltd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a> page, the brand has recently put out a call for its members to join a focus group. That will give them a source of direct feedback from the organization’s core audience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/brand-perception-wordstream-deargirls.webp" alt="Brand perception - focus group flyer." width="613" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-87147 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/brand-perception-wordstream-deargirls.webp 613w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/brand-perception-wordstream-deargirls-480x470.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 613px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C6JKvSeIlcf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>5. Net Promoter Score (NPS)</h3>
<p>Net Promoter Score, or NPS, measures customer loyalty by asking how likely they are to recommend a company&#8217;s product or service to others. It’s a great tool for incorporating <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/24/customer-feedback">customer feedback into your strategy</a>.</p>
<p>Negative NPS feedback acts as a red flag, highlighting areas where brand perception needs improvement. The proactive nature of NPS surveys demonstrates your commitment to customer success and a willingness to enhance brand perception.</p>
<p>There are several free NPS calculators available online. Tools like SurveyMonkey’s <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/nps-calculator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPS Calculator</a> allow you to create and send NPS surveys to measure customer loyalty and their likelihood to recommend your brand.</p>
<h3>6. In-depth interviews</h3>
<p>Do you know who your best customers are? You know, the ones who use your product the most, have maximum lifetime value (LTV), are willing to give feedback, and have switched from a competitor brand to yours recently?</p>
<p>If you can identify them, involve them in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One-on-one conversations</strong>: Schedule video calls with a handful of loyal customers or those who haven&#8217;t engaged with your brand recently.</li>
<li><strong>Stakeholder interviews</strong>: Expand your perspective by interviewing key suppliers and partners.</li>
</ul>
<ul></ul>
<p>Ask open-ended questions to delve into their experiences, motivations, and overall brand perception. Their insights will reveal blind spots in your brand perception and expose areas for improvement across the customer journey.</p>
<h3>7. Search engine data</h3>
<p>Monitor how often your brand is searched for on search engines, which is an indicator of brand recognition and interest. Use tools like <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Trends</a> or the <a href="https://ads.google.com/intl/en/home/tools/keyword-planner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads Keyword Planner</a> to monitor how often your brand name and related <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide">keywords</a> are searched. This will indicate brand awareness and interest levels.</p>
<p>Identify and analyze variations of your brand name and associated keywords. Look at branded terms (product names, taglines) and non-branded terms related to your industry. This helps reveal what aspects of your brand or products are attracting the most attention.</p>
<p>Let’s say you work for <a href="https://www.fourseasonsheatingcooling.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Four Seasons HVAC</a>, a Chicago-based HVAC contractor that offers heating, air conditioning, plumbing, and electrical services. Keywords like “HVAC service” and “air conditioner repair” are as relevant to them as branded key phrases like ”four seasons heating and cooling.” By keeping an eye on the search volume of their branded keyword, they can see if they are gaining or losing popularity. They can also track the People Also Ask section on Google to see what kind of questions people are asking about them.</p>
<p>You can also set up <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-set-up-google-alerts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Alerts</a> for your business or industry topics. You’ll get emails straight from Google whenever relevant content pops up on the search engine.</p>
<h3>8. Local events</h3>
<p>Participating in local events is a powerful way to engage directly with the community and gain valuable insights into brand perception. Select local events that align with your brand values and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a>. This could include community fairs, trade shows, sports events, or local festivals. Sponsoring such events is also a good idea.</p>
<p>Once you have chosen events to participate in, use your social media, website, and local advertising to promote them. Monitor the engagement these announcements receive to gauge initial interest and sentiment.</p>
<p>At the event, use surveys or quick polls at your booth to collect immediate feedback. Offer a small incentive for completing these surveys, like a discount or free sample of your products. Pay attention to how attendees react to your products or marketing materials. Direct interactions with the audience will provide qualitative insights that are as valuable as structured survey responses.</p>
<p>After the event, analyze the surveys and feedback forms that you gathered. Look for patterns or recurring themes that indicate general sentiment towards your brand.</p>

<h2>How to improve brand perception</h2>
<p>To enhance your brand perception, start by listening closely to your customers. Use surveys and social media monitoring to gather their honest feedback. <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-respond-to-negative-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Address the negative reviews</a> and comments quickly and constructively. This will show that you value customer input and are committed to improvement.</p>

<p>Next, amplify the positive. Share customer success stories and positive reviews on your platforms. Engage actively with your audience on social media, respond to queries, and join conversations. This demonstrates your brand&#8217;s commitment to customer satisfaction and its active presence in the community. Participate in local events to achieve the same results.</p>
<p>Finally, measure the impact of your efforts by tracking changes in customer satisfaction and brand loyalty over time. Adjust your strategies based on what the data tells you, and make sure your brand consistently aligns with customer expectations and industry standards.</p>
<h2>Boost your brand perception</h2>
<p>Brand perception may feel like a secondary metric to measure your business’ success. But it underpins every other tactic you use to find and sway new customers. A great brand perception can make your ads more efficient, your social media marketing more energetic, and your lead-generation efforts more effective. So, take a little time to monitor your reputation. It’ll pay back handsomely.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fitbit released its first product, the Fitbit Tracker, in 2009. By 2012, the brand had sold over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/472591/fitbit-devices-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 million</a> fitness trackers; by 2016, that number had jumped to over 22 million.</p>
<p>How did Fitbit grow so fast? By using a strategy called bandwagon advertising. It leverages social proof and the fear of missing out to encourage people to try new products and continue using them.</p>
<p>Here’s how bandwagon advertising works and how to use it to grow your business.</p>

<h2>What is bandwagon advertising?</h2>
<p>Bandwagon advertising taps into our desire to be part of the crowd. It convinces us that something is better simply because other people—especially those we look up to—already use it.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple breakdown of how bandwagon advertising works:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Message:</strong> &#8220;Everyone&#8217;s doing it, so should you!&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> Make you feel like you&#8217;re missing out.</li>
<li><strong>Psychology:</strong> People trust what others choose and don&#8217;t want to be left out.</li>
</ul>
<p>A simple version of bandwagon advertising would be images and copy showing many people happily using your product. Think of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">social media ads</a> with happy crowds using a new phone, social media posts filled with positive reviews, or an image of an influential soccer player chugging the latest sports drink. When people see these messages, they’re attracted to the idea of joining the “in crowd” by buying the product.</p>
<p>To make the idea more concrete, let’s return to Fitbit’s example. The company uses three tactics that combine to create a bandwagon advertising strategy.</p>
<p>First, it created<a href="https://cassiuslife.com/504676/will-smith-fitbit-premium-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> partnerships with celebrities</a> to promote its wearable trackers as the next big thing. It wasn’t just athletes; people like Sarah Jessica Parker and Will Smith donned their Fitbits to engage audiences of all types.</p>
<p>Second, the brand launched specific <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/28/user-generated-content">user-generated content</a> campaigns to show how everyday users enjoy their fitness tracker. It then used the content on social media and in its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/25/email-newsletter-ideas">newsletters</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, Fitbit built bandwagon advertising right into its product. Users can choose to automatically share their workouts on social media, tapping into a powerful networking effect.</p>
<div id="what-are-the-advantages-of-bandwagon-advertising"></div>
<h2>What are the advantages of bandwagon advertising?</h2>
<p>Bandwagon advertising uses<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/27/trust-signals"> social proof</a> to influence consumer behavior.</p>
<p>With social proof as its foundation, bandwagon advertising:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Builds trust and credibility: </strong>When potential customers see others enjoying your product, it helps validate their buying decision.</li>
<li><strong>Creates urgency and FOMO:</strong> Bandwagon advertising makes it seem like everyone&#8217;s getting something you don’t have, and you don’t want to be left behind.</li>
<li><strong>Boosts brand awareness and sales:</strong> The more people see others using and loving your product, the more likely they are to remember your brand and buy from you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ready to turn the bandwagon effect into real results? In the next section, we&#8217;ll discuss seven bandwagon advertising ideas you can implement for your small business.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Bandwagon marketing starts with knowing your audience.</strong> Download the free guide, <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteTargetAudience.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_TargetAudineceGuide_Download">How to Find Your Target Audience</a>, to get started.</p>

<h2>7 bandwagon advertising ideas and examples</h2>
<p>Bandwagon advertising is a concept that’s easy to explain but can sometimes feel difficult to execute. Done well, it can give small and medium-sized businesses an advantage over the rest of the competition. Here are some bandwagon advertising ideas you can use for your next campaign.</p>
<h3>1. User-generated content competitions</h3>
<p>User-generated content is a great way to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/13/ugc-instagram">boost engagement</a> with your audience. It bypasses skepticism and builds trust because it showcases real people using and loving your product. That’s the perfect application of bandwagon advertising.</p>
<p>Here’s a great example of how to turn your customers into brand ambassadors. <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-run-a-facebook-giveaway-or-contest/">Run a contest</a> encouraging them to create and share photos or videos using your product. This uses social proof and increases <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">brand awareness</a> for free.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-filippo.webp" alt="Bandwagon advertising - social post with a contest." width="884" height="514" class="aligncenter wp-image-85595 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-filippo.webp 884w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-filippo-480x279.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 884px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Take inspiration from<a href="https://filippoberio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Filippo Berio</a>, a famous olive oil brand. The brand ran a contest on Pancake Day, asking users to post pictures of their delicious pancake creations (presumably made with Filippo Berio olive oil) and tag them with the branded <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags">hashtag</a> #FilippinFilippo. The winner received a hamper filled with goodies, and Filippo Bero got tons of amazing photos to share on their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/01/11/social-media-marketing-tips">social media</a> profiles.</p>
<h3>2. Nostalgia-driven bandwagon</h3>
<p>People crave connection. And what connects us better than shared memories? Nostalgia-driven bandwagon advertising taps into this emotion, creating an instant bond with your target audience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-erstwilder.webp" alt="Bandwagon advertising - social post sharing My Little Pony-themed products." width="616" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-85596 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-erstwilder.webp 616w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-erstwilder-480x468.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 616px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here’s an example from <a href="https://www.erstwilder.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ErstWilder</a>, a jewelry brand. It launched a limited-edition collection of My Little Pony accessories. Here&#8217;s how they leveraged nostalgia-driven bandwagon advertising:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choose a nostalgic product:</strong> My Little Pony is a beloved cartoon from the 80s and 90s. By referencing it, ErstWilder instantly connected with a generation.</li>
<li><strong>Encourage participation:</strong> The brand encouraged fans to share photos with the hashtag #ErstWilderMLP, creating a community and showcasing the popularity of the collection.</li>
<li><strong>Create a sense of urgency:</strong> The copy mentions that it’s a limited edition, creating urgency and a fear of missing out, further fueling the bandwagon effect.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Interactive online polls</h3>
<ol start="3"></ol>
<p>Social media is all about <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/engaging-posts-on-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engagement</a>, and what better way to engage your audience than by asking their opinion? <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-do-a-poll-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Interactive online polls</a> create a fun and interactive way to leverage the power of the bandwagon effect, just like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cookscountry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@cookscountry</a> did on Instagram.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-pie2.webp" alt="Bandwagon advertising - Bracket showing various pie types." width="370" height="588" class="aligncenter wp-image-85597 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-pie2.webp 370w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-pie2-189x300.webp 189w" sizes="(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px" /></p>
<p>Cookscountry didn&#8217;t just ask its audience what pie they liked. The brand’s team turned it into a captivating series titled &#8220;Thanksgiving Pie Showdown.&#8221; They created four polls, each featuring two delicious Thanksgiving pie options.</p>
<p>The top contenders faced off in semi-final polls, keeping the audience engaged and building anticipation for the ultimate showdown. The two finalists battled it out in a final poll, with the winner crowned &#8220;Thanksgiving Pie Showdown Champion.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-pie1.webp" alt="Bandwagon advertising - Two-question poll to pick pie winner." width="366" height="586" class="aligncenter wp-image-85598 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-pie1.webp 366w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-pie1-187x300.webp 187w" sizes="(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px" /></p>
<p>Voters even had a chance to win all the pies in the competition. This added more excitement and boosted participation.</p>
<p>While the brand wasn’t selling pies, it used the bandwagon advertising effect to engage an audience for its media brand. Ideally, many of those participating in the popular poll will stick around to see what the business does next.</p>
<h3>4. Customer testimonials</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/03/testimonial-advertising">Testimonials</a> are gold for marketers! They build trust, sound believable, and get people on the bandwagon.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-outdoorvoices.webp" alt="Bandwagon advertising - Proposal scene in a social media post." width="878" height="500" class="aligncenter wp-image-85599 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-outdoorvoices.webp 878w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-outdoorvoices-480x273.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 878px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.outdoorvoices.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outdoor Voices</a> gets it. They use short video testimonials with real people using their clothes for everything from hiking to yoga to proposing to your significant other. They even have a hashtag, #DoingThings, to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/19/brand-community">build a community</a> and show how versatile their stuff is—showing everyday people, not models, keeping testimonials genuine, building trust, and driving more sales for the brand.</p>
<h3>5. Comparative advertising</h3>
<p>Competitor marketing can be a clever way to leverage the bandwagon effect. The idea is to focus on a unique feature or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">value proposition</a> you offer that sets your offering apart. Subtly suggest that everyone&#8217;s choosing you because of it, and watch the customers roll in.</p>
<p>Take<a href="https://www.motel6.com/en/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Motel 6</a>, for instance. Although its marketing doesn&#8217;t explicitly criticize other hotels, its &#8220;Pets Stay Free&#8221; policy speaks volumes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-motel6-1.webp" alt="Bandwagon advertising - Social post promoting Motel6 free pet policy." width="889" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-85600 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-motel6-1.webp 889w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-motel6-1-480x324.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 889px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>By highlighting this perk, Motel 6 subtly implies that other places might charge extra for furry companions. This positions them as the more pet-friendly and budget-conscious option. It also creates a bandwagon effect for pet owners as they see other pet owners taking advantage of this policy.</p>
<h3>6. Influencer endorsements</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/26/influencer-marketing">Influencers</a> can be a powerful tool for small businesses. They create a bandwagon effect where people are nudged to try a product because someone they admire seems to love it.</p>
<p><a href="https://pieminister.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pieminister</a>, a Bristol-based pie company, brilliantly uses celebrity endorsements. When famous mentalist Derren Brown (who lives in Bristol) performed in town, Pieminister sent him a sample pack. Impressed, Derren tweeted about the pies. He mentioned that there was &#8220;no request asking me to tweet.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-pieminister.webp" alt="Bandwagon advertising - Tweet from Darren Brown about pies." width="881" height="530" class="aligncenter wp-image-85601 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-pieminister.webp 881w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-pieminister-480x289.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 881px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This authentic endorsement was gold. This social proof, combined with Derren&#8217;s large following, increased Pieminister&#8217;s social media reach by a whopping<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2014/jun/26/celebrity-endorsements-promote-business-smes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 2,574%</a>!</p>
<h3>7. Influencer and community challenges</h3>
<p>Combining influencer power with interactive challenges creates a double-whammy of bandwagon effects to build brand awareness and loyalty.</p>
<p>One of the best examples is <a href="https://www.elfcosmetics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ELF Cosmetics</a>. It created the <a href="https://www.chatdesk.com/tiktok-campaigns-and-case-studies/elf-eyeslipsface-hashtag-challenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#eyeslipsface</a> challenge on TikTok, incorporating an original song and hashtag. The brand partnered with a whole squad of established and emerging beauty influencers, who created full-face looks using only elf products. ELF also encouraged users to share their own elf looks. The campaign resulted in billions of video and hashtag views.</p>
<h2>Jump on the bandwagon advertising…erm…bandwagon</h2>
<p>People are social creatures. When we see others having success, we want to join in. The examples above show just how influential a bandwagon advertising campaign can be.</p>
<p>Just remember to keep things light. Never use shame or “othering” to guilt people into trying your products. Instead, show them how people they admire solve problems and gain fulfillment using what you sell.</p>

<h2>What is neuromarketing?</h2>
<p>Neuromarketing merges neuroscience, psychology, cognitive science, and marketing to understand and influence consumer behavior. It uncovers subconscious and emotional factors impacting choices.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/what-is-neuromarketing.webp" alt="graphic showing what makes up neuromarketing" width="936" height="502" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81932" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/what-is-neuromarketing.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/what-is-neuromarketing-480x257.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Specialists use neuromarketing techniques to study the human brain and predict decision-making behavior. Let&#8217;s explore why you should implement neuromarketing techniques in your copywriting.</p>

<div id="why-use-neuromarketing"></div>
<h2>Why use neuromarketing?</h2>
<p>Why apply neuromarketing techniques to your copywriting and other marketing activities? Here are some benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Better understanding of consumer behavior:</strong> Neuromarketing unveils emotions, attention, and memory triggers in consumer behavior, thus enabling the creation of impactful marketing messages.</li>
<li><strong>More effective ways to optimize website design:</strong> By studying eye-tracking data and user behavior, you can optimize design elements to encourage desired actions.</li>
<li><strong>Improved personalization and targeting:</strong> Uncover individual preferences and emotional triggers to tailor messages and offers for specific consumer segments.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced content creation:</strong> Understanding how the brain processes information helps you craft compelling stories that evoke emotions and drive engagement.</li>
</ol>
<p>Numbers speak volumes. According to the stats, neurological engagement can increase advertising effectiveness by up to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050920322389" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19%</a>. We also know that <a href="https://ethiqueadvisory.com/blogs/unleash-the-power-of-storytelling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">63%</a> of users remember brands that tell stories, and <a href="https://financesonline.com/customer-reviews-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">74%</a> of consumers trust businesses more after reading positive reviews.</p>
<div id="what-are-neuromarketing-examples"></div>
<h2>Neuromarketing examples in copywriting</h2>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to be a scientist. By analyzing research insights, you can identify neurological responses, emotional triggers, and attention patterns influencing your target most. Apply them to tailor your overall marketing strategy and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/performance-marketing">drive purchasing decisions</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of neuromarketing in action.</p>
<h3>1. Two odd numbers in headings</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/features/is-your-brain-wired-for-numbers-69194" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brain loves numbers</a>. They make content more digestible and provide order to chaos.</p>
<p>Why two numbers? To double the effect: The first one grabs attention, and the second one explains why read the content.</p>
<p>Why odd numbers? It&#8217;s about <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/odd-vs-even-number-psychology-6307047bf5de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">psychology</a> again: Even numbers look friendlier, while odd ones are more thought-provoking. It doesn&#8217;t mean you should use only the odd numbers. Consider the effect (emotion) you want to evoke with your content.</p>

<h3>2. Questions in subheads</h3>
<p>Online readers scan the content to understand if it&#8217;s what they need. Format subheads as questions to clarify what readers will learn, spark curiosity, and appeal to FOMO.</p>
<p>Questions encourage scanners to continue the investigation to ensure they haven&#8217;t missed anything and satisfy their <a href="https://www.enneagrammer.com/the-three-instincts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social instinct</a>.</p>

<h3>3. The Socratic method in introductions</h3>
<p>Post three questions or statements in a row to engage users in communication.</p>
<p>Why three?</p>
<p>The human brain <a href="https://www.psychotactics.com/harness-the-psychological-power-of-3-to-improve-communication/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grasps three the best</a>, so the sequence of three makes it easier to remember the information. Writers <em>do</em> love the <a href="https://copyblogger.com/rule-of-three/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rule of Three</a>: It builds the rhythm and keeps readers glued to your message.</p>

<h3>4. Power words and active verbs in content</h3>
<p>Power words are persuasive and descriptive. They trigger an emotional response, make readers experience different states, and push them in particular directions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/22/power-words">Power words</a> are adjectives indicating and explaining your statements. Like these:</p>

<h3>5. Sensory language when appropriate</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.enchantingmarketing.com/sensory-words/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sensory words</a> are lexical items appealing to the human physical senses. When reading the content with such words, users &#8220;see,&#8221; &#8220;hear,&#8221; &#8220;touch,&#8221; &#8220;smell,&#8221; or &#8220;taste&#8221; it.</p>
<p>Sensory words are powerful because they paint scenes in readers&#8217; imagination. They activate the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0093934X12000028" target="_blank" rel="noopener">somatosensory cortex</a>, making us recognize these words faster. Sensory words make readers feel as if they are in your story, thus remembering your message better.</p>

<h2>20 neuromarketing techniques to encourage desired actions</h2>
<p>With the above emotional triggers in mind, include the following neuromarketing principles in your copywriting to make it work.</p>
<h3>1. Authority</h3>
<p>Position your brand as an industry expert through research findings, data, and credible collaborations.</p>
<p>Why do you think <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/26/influencer-marketing">influencer marketing</a> works? Users subconsciously believe famous people can&#8217;t go wrong because they choose the top products/services for themselves.</p>
<p>But: Authority isn&#8217;t only about top celebs with millions of subscribers on social media. Think of micro- or nano-influencers: They have the most loyal audience. Collaborate with experts in your niche: CEOs, top managers, or specialists who know what they talk about.</p>
<h3>2. Common enemy</h3>
<p>Struggling with a common enemy unites people. It&#8217;s not only about physical enemies but pains, complexes, or bad habits, as well. Concepts like hunger, poverty, diseases, or climate change are also here.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s your brand&#8217;s mission? Is it socially responsible?</p>
<p>Users are loyal to businesses that align with their identities and share the same values. Prescribe this element and incorporate corresponding meanings into your content strategy.</p>
<p>Create a positive ethos for your brand: Why does it matter? Why should people listen to your message?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-common-enemy.webp" alt="neuromarketing technique of common enemy in copywriting" width="936" height="403" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81940" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-common-enemy.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-common-enemy-480x207.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.deathwishcoffee.com/pages/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>3. Consistency and commitment</h3>
<p>Encourage commitment through regular communication, loyalty programs, and subscription services.</p>
<p>The more you interact with a customer, the more they trust your product, service, team, or individual specialist. The challenge is to establish a productive interaction and get a response.</p>
<p>You can initiate a dialog in messengers, newsletter emails, or online chat. Tests, quizzes, and other interactive content also work.</p>
<h3>4. Cross-marketing</h3>
<p>This trigger is about the intersection of several target audience segments. Organize your content so website visitors see your minor products with major ones.</p>
<p>In ecommerce, we know this trick as &#8220;You may also like&#8221; or &#8220;Buy together:&#8221; When examining a product description, a customer sees related items they might also want to buy.</p>
<p>Informative or educational websites address the same principle with content elements like &#8220;Related articles,&#8221; &#8220;Extra read,&#8221; &#8220;Editor&#8217;s Pick,&#8221; etc.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://cxl.com/blog/seo-vs-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>5. Framing</h3>
<p>Different framing techniques impact perception:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comparative framing:</strong> Highlight superiority over competitors.</li>
<li><strong>Loss aversion framing:</strong> Use phrases like &#8220;limited time offer.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Goal framing:</strong> Present your product as a solution to specific goals.</li>
<li><strong>Attribute framing:</strong> Highlight appealing features.</li>
<li><strong>Time framing:</strong> Encourage immediate action by prescribing deadlines (&#8220;today only,&#8221; &#8220;first three subscribers will get…,&#8221; &#8220;two hours left,&#8221; etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Flattery</h3>
<p>Incorporate genuine praise or appreciation to build rapport. Personalized emails and positive feedback boost customer loyalty.</p>
<p>Incorporate genuine praise or appreciation to build rapport. Personalized emails and positive feedback boost customer loyalty.</p>
<p>You can personalize a customer by name, profession, age, social status, or hobbies. It is realistic to find a suitable appeal for every niche and customer segment.</p>
<p>When a subscriber, prospective client, or webpage visitor sees a familiar hook, they subconsciously realize you&#8217;re talking to them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-flattery.webp" alt="neuromarketing technique using flattery in copywriting" width="817" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81942" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-flattery.webp 817w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-flattery-480x351.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 817px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.classcreator.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Their response to a personalized greeting will be faster and warmer than to generic wording.</p>
<h3>7. Greed</h3>
<p>Appealing to one of the core human weaknesses helps boost engagement and raise sales. Promotions, discounts, and contests encourage prospective customers to open their wallets.</p>
<p>Greed pushes subscribers to invite friends to groups, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-time-to-post-on-social-media">repost social media content</a>, and share links. Spontaneous purchases are also here.</p>
<p>Palmary examples of using this neuromarketing principle: Black Friday and Cyber Monday campaigns most brands organize.</p>
<h3>8. Herd behavior</h3>
<p>Every person is a unique individual, and no one wants to recognize themselves as part of a so-called &#8220;herd,&#8221; but:</p>
<p>Social instinct is among the top three basic ones, so we can&#8217;t resist appreciation and a sense of belonging to some group. Most websites appeal to this instinct with messages like:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&#8220;100,000+ downloads already&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;Rating: 4.5/5 stars&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;With over 300k subscribers and 4 million readers, we are&#8230;&#8221;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>When a user sees such messages, they subconsciously approve your offer. After all, so many people can&#8217;t be wrong, huh? So, everything is okay with the product/service you have for them.</p>
<h3>9. Intrigue</h3>
<p>This one is like cliffhangers in a movie series, cutting off episodes at the most intriguing moment to motivate the audience to come back and watch the next one.</p>
<p>A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>In next week&#8217;s video, I will tell how I&#8217;ve my first 100 thousand subscribers.</em></li>
<li><em>I&#8217;ve become popular by a happy accident, but I will talk about it a little later.</em></li>
<li><em>I have to pause now; please wait for the second part in tomorrow&#8217;s release.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>10. Justification</h3>
<p>It is easier to push a site visitor to the desired action if you explain <em>the why&#8217;s</em> behind it. Reveal all the benefits of purchasing in this particular place and time.</p>
<p>Collect all available arguments and added values. Simplify messaging, designs, and instructions to minimize cognitive load.</p>
<h3>11. Instant benefit</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/sales-funnel-template/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sales funnel</a> is a core marketing instrument, but sometimes it&#8217;s possible to get loyal clients once they land at your website. Think of a perk (a here-and-now benefit) to offer to visitors:</p>
<p>A free template, checklist, or ebook can become the lead magnet to hook a user to stay with you and become your client.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-instant-benefit.webp" alt="instant benefit neuromarketing example" width="936" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81943" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-instant-benefit.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-instant-benefit-480x241.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.creative-copywriter.net/the-insiders-guide-to-copyediting-and-proofreading-free-checklist" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>12. Novelty</h3>
<p>Appeal to the brain&#8217;s attraction to novelty by introducing innovative elements and collaborations.</p>
<p>Please note that the word &#8220;new&#8221; itself doesn&#8217;t work. The trigger will do the job if your offer is <em>truly </em>fresh, unusual, and unique. Think of it as your UVP (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/unique-selling-proposition">unique value proposition</a>).</p>
<p>What makes you different from competitors? What can you do for a customer that they don&#8217;t?</p>
<h3>13. Reciprocity</h3>
<p>The principle of reciprocity suggests that when you provide value to your audience, they are more likely to engage with your brand. Offer free resources, trials, discounts, or personalized recommendations.</p>
<p>The catch is you&#8217;ll ask something in return. For example, an email address to send informative newsletters with compelling content, encouraging to buy.</p>
<p>But remember: Reciprocity works when used right. It&#8217;s critical to know your limit, especially today when the audience is fed up with tons of &#8220;gifts&#8221; and offers they find in inboxes daily. Being too aggressive with marketing messages, you risk unsubscriptions and negative reactions.</p>
<p>Be honest and write about what you&#8217;ll send users once they share emails with you.</p>
<h3>14. Result</h3>
<p>The common example is content assets presenting &#8220;before&#8221; and &#8220;after&#8221; to users. Photos or videos demonstrating how your product works do the magic!</p>
<p>The trick is to present everything in as much detail as possible so that people can see the difference between the first and second versions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before&#8221; and &#8220;after&#8221; is not the only way to demonstrate results. Case studies do wonders in all niches, too. Working with the same principle, they are the format where you can show results with a text.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-results.webp" alt="neuromarketing technique example of showing results" width="936" height="460" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81944" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-results.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-results-480x236.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://smartblogger.com/products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>15. Scarcity</h3>
<p>Create urgency through limited availability tactics. Ethically use limited quantity, time-limited offers, and scarcity techniques to drive action.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about FOMO again: People don&#8217;t want to miss an offer that will be unavailable soon.</p>
<p><strong>Two options here: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s a super popular product/service of extra quality.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s originally for a narrow circle of &#8220;chosen ones.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>Scarcity works with any restrictions: color, features, time, date, quantity, cost, etc. When using this trigger, it&#8217;s critical to keep your word. If sales close tomorrow, that&#8217;s what should happen.</p>
<h3>16. Social proof</h3>
<p>Use testimonials, endorsements, ratings, and reviews to establish trust and credibility.</p>
<p>Testimonials remain the most popular social proof, but it&#8217;s critical to make it trustworthy. Today&#8217;s users aren&#8217;t as naive as some marketers continue to believe: They won&#8217;t trust comments from John Doe with stock photos in avatars.</p>
<p>Share reviews from real people: Make videos, provide active links to their social media profiles, use signed and stamped thank-you letters from partners, etc.</p>
<p>Another instrument to boost social proof for users is your contact information. Many websites hide it, placing nothing but a standard contact form instead.</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>It hurts <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/14/google-e-e-a-t">E-E-A-T</a> factors and kills user loyalty and trust. Your address, phone number, email, and active social media accounts are worth placing on the website.</p>
<p>Certificates, ratings, budges–all they confirm your expertise and emphasize your responsibility and integrity in customers&#8217; eyes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-social-proof.webp" alt="social proof neuromarketing example" width="936" height="407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81945" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-social-proof.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-social-proof-480x209.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>17. Specifics</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s still an issue for many websites. They continue generating vague content assets, bringing words but no value.</p>
<p>Compare:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&#8220;We sell the best windows in Chicago!&#8221; </em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;Our energy-saving windows keep 93.4% of heat in your apartment.&#8221;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, the example is a little hackneyed, but numbers and facts work better than sophisticated metaphors when it comes to converting traffic into leads.</p>
<p>Even if your niche is info products, customers want to know how long it will take to get results.</p>
<h3>18. Storytelling</h3>
<p>Harness storytelling&#8217;s power to evoke emotions, build connections, and make your brand memorable.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.go-globe.com/storytelling-statistics-trends-infographic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human brain operates with stories</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It retains 70% of information through them, while only 10% comes from data and facts.</li>
<li>It responds better to narratives as they activate brain areas responsible for experiences.</li>
<li>Combining data with a story increases info retention from 5-10% to 67%.</li>
</ul>
<p>The secret is that stories don&#8217;t impose anything but, at the same time, bring the right idea to readers. Your task is to build a story in a way readers would choose your business over the others.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-storytelling.webp" alt="storytelling neuromarketing example" width="570" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81946" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-storytelling.webp 570w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-storytelling-480x505.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 570px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>19. Upsell</h3>
<p>This trigger serves a specific purpose: Make a customer buy more than they planned.</p>
<p>The oldy-moldy <em>&#8220;Buy two–and take the third one for free&#8221;</em> hook still works, grabbing even the savvy customers who understand the trick. Indeed, it&#8217;s hard to resist the temptation to get a free product.</p>
<h3>20. More emotional triggers</h3>
<p>Here are some additional emotional triggers you can use in your copywriting:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Trust: </strong>Building credibility and reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Fear:</strong> Tapping into common anxieties or concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Belonging: </strong>The need to be part of a community or tribe.</li>
<li><strong>Curiosity:</strong> Piquing interest to learn more.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Throughout my journey in the marketing realm, I&#8217;ve encountered a diverse range of professionals, each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses. Among them, I&#8217;ve noticed a particular group that possesses an uncanny intuition when it comes to understanding human behavior and effectively connecting with target markets. Interestingly enough, many of these individuals have a genuine interest in psychology, and it became evident that their deep understanding of human nature helped them to succeed in their marketing roles.</p>
<p>Now, let me be clear—I don&#8217;t hold a formal degree in psychology. However, I&#8217;ve developed a fascination with the subject, treating it as a personal hobby. Over time, I&#8217;ve discovered the immense relevance of psychology to my marketing career.</p>

<h2>How to use the five basic personality traits in your marketing</h2>
<p>How can marketers leverage their understanding of the big five personality traits to craft more effective marketing campaigns that truly resonate with their audiences? Let’s dive into each of those personality traits and how to use them in your campaigns.</p>
<h3>Openness to experience</h3>
<p>This personality trait refers to the degree of a person&#8217;s intellectual curiosity, creativity, and preference for novelty and variety. Individuals high in openness tend to be imaginative, adventurous, and open-minded.</p>
<p>They are often willing to try new things, appreciate art and beauty, and enjoy intellectual pursuits. Those low in openness are more traditional, practical, and prefer familiarity over novelty.</p>
<h4>How to appeal to this personality type in your marketing</h4>
<p>Capturing the attention of individuals high in openness to experience requires embracing innovation, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/27/blog-post-ideas">creativity</a>, and a sense of adventure. Here are some ways to leverage it in your marketing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Craft campaigns that spark curiosity, ignite imagination, and challenge the status quo.</li>
<li>Showcase how your product or service brings new perspectives, fosters self-discovery, or offers unique experiences.</li>
<li>Leverage <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/20/digital-marketing-trends">emerging trends</a>, cutting-edge technologies, and out-of-the-box concepts to appeal to their appetite for novelty and unconventional thinking.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/personality-marketing-openness-to-experience-example.jpg" alt="personality marketing - openness to experience example from hotel for adventures" width="406" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76298" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/personality-marketing-openness-to-experience-example.jpg 406w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/personality-marketing-openness-to-experience-example-204x300.jpg 204w" sizes="(max-width: 406px) 100vw, 406px" /></p>
<h3>Conscientiousness</h3>
<p>Conscientiousness describes the degree to which a person is organized, responsible, reliable, and self-disciplined. Individuals high in conscientiousness are generally goal-oriented, diligent, and dependable. They are often well-organized, pay attention to details, and are committed to achieving their goals.</p>
<p>Conversely, individuals low in conscientiousness tend to be more spontaneous, flexible, and less focused on structure and organization.</p>
<h4>How to appeal to this personality type in your marketing</h4>
<p>The conscientiousness factor is all about reliability, organization, and attention to detail. Tailoring your paid media campaigns to appeal to this trait can go a long way. Here are some ways to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/20/product-positioning">Highlight features</a> such as efficiency, precision, and adherence to high standards.</li>
<li>Showcase how your product or service streamlines processes, saves time, or ensures meticulous quality.</li>
<li>Provide clear instructions, guarantees, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/03/testimonial-advertising">testimonials</a> to instill confidence in conscientious individuals who appreciate thoroughness and reliability.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/personality-marketing-conscientiousness-example.jpg" alt="big five personality traits in marketing - example of facebook ad using conscientiousness" width="506" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76282" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/personality-marketing-conscientiousness-example.jpg 506w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/personality-marketing-conscientiousness-example-480x567.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 506px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Extraversion</h3>
<p>Extraversion refers to the extent to which a person seeks social interaction, excitement, and stimulation from the external environment.</p>
<p>Extraverts are outgoing, assertive, and energetic. They enjoy being around people, are often talkative and sociable, and gain energy from social interactions.</p>
<p>Introverts, on the other hand, prefer quieter, less stimulating environments, and tend to be more reserved and reflective.</p>
<h4>How to appeal to this personality type in your marketing</h4>
<p>Understanding the spectrum of extraversion within your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience"> target audience</a> can be a game-changer. Are they outgoing and sociable individuals who thrive in social settings? Or do they lean towards introversion, preferring quieter, more introspective experiences? By <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/21/emotional-ad-copy-examples">tailoring your messaging</a> and ad formats to align with their preferences, you can strike a chord with each segment.</p>
<p>For extraverts, consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Highlighting the social aspects of your product or service.</li>
<li>Showcasing vibrant gatherings and interactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>For introverts, consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emphasizing the personal benefits.</li>
<li>Highlighting the value of self-reflection that your offering can provide.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/personality-marketing-extraversion-example.jpg" alt="personality marketing - low levels of extraversion example in instagram ad from bombas" width="292" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76297" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/personality-marketing-extraversion-example.jpg 292w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/personality-marketing-extraversion-example-146x300.jpg 146w" sizes="(max-width: 292px) 100vw, 292px" /></p>

					<div class='et-box-content'><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/26a1.png" alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong> Get the guide &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite120WordsforMarketingWithEmotion.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_120WordsPhrases_Download">135 of the Best Words &amp; Phrases for Marketing with Emotion</a></div></div>
<h3>Agreeableness</h3>
<p>Agreeableness represents the degree to which a person is warm, compassionate, cooperative, and considerate of others. Individuals high in agreeableness are typically empathetic, kind, and value social harmony. They are inclined to be helpful, trustful, and forgiving. People low in agreeableness may be more competitive, skeptical, and less concerned about others&#8217; feelings and needs.</p>
<h4>How to appeal to this personality type in your marketing</h4>
<p>Acknowledging the level of agreeableness within your audience helps you shape your messaging to foster a sense of trust, harmony, and cooperation.</p>
<p>Is your target audience composed of individuals who highly value collaboration and teamwork? If so, emphasize how your product or service promotes unity and creates positive relationships.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/personality-marketing-agreeableness-example.jpg" alt="personality traits in marketing - example of high agreeableness in ppc copy" width="936" height="298" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76279" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/personality-marketing-agreeableness-example.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/personality-marketing-agreeableness-example-480x153.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For audiences with lower agreeableness, focus on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/07/unique-selling-proposition">unique selling points</a>, individuality, and empowerment to resonate with their desire for independence and self-expression.</p>
<h3>Neuroticism</h3>
<p>Neuroticism, sometimes called emotional instability, refers to the extent to which a person experiences negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, and moodiness. Individuals high in neuroticism are more prone to worry, experience frequent mood swings, and may have a heightened sensitivity to stress. Those low in neuroticism tend to be more emotionally stable, resilient, and less affected by negative emotions.</p>
<h4>How to appeal to this personality type in your marketing</h4>
<p>Understanding the emotional landscape of your audience is vital for creating impactful paid media campaigns. Consider the range of neuroticism within your target market—are they prone to anxiety and stress or more emotionally stable?</p>
<p>For those with higher neuroticism, focus on alleviating their concerns and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-pain-points/">addressing pain points</a>. Highlight the security, peace of mind, and stress relief your offering can provide.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/personality-marketing-neuroticism-ppc-ad-example.jpg" alt="personality trait marketing - example appealing to neuroticism in paid search ad copy" width="936" height="328" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76278" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/personality-marketing-neuroticism-ppc-ad-example.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/personality-marketing-neuroticism-ppc-ad-example-480x168.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For emotionally stable individuals, emphasize the positive aspects, such as joy, serenity, and emotional well-being, that come from engaging with your product or service.</p>
<div id="identify"></div>
<h2>How to identify which personality traits to appeal to in your marketing</h2>
<p>The big five personality traits are just that, a combination of individual personality factors that comprise a whole. So how do you go about learning where your ideal customer lands on this spectrum of personality? There are a couple of ways you could collect data.</p>
<h3>Distribute a personality test to your customers</h3>
<p>One way to identify the right personality trait (or traits) to target is by simply selecting a sample size of your best customers and incentivizing them to partake in a personality test. From these results, you can have a general outline of commonalities among what you consider to be your target audience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/personality-test-example.jpg" alt="big five personality traits test example from truity" width="936" height="460" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76284" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/personality-test-example.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/personality-test-example-480x236.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<h3>Conduct testing through your marketing channels</h3>
<p>This option will be more time-consuming and will require you to be very scientific in your approach.</p>
<p>You will want to map out each personality trait and through ad copy, imagery, tone, etc., really hone in on how each trait is represented in a marketing format.</p>
<p>You will then want to run the variations against each other <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/customer-data">gathering as much data</a> as possible for each. From there you will be able to map a general outline of your target audience’s personality. Now, to be clear, personality is an individual set of traits. However, that doesn’t mean you won’t find commonalities amongst larger data sets of individuals&#8211;particularly within certain industries.</p>
<p>Let’s say, for example, your target audience was comprised of sales professionals. Although the individuals within that profession may vary greatly on a personal level, there are most likely common personality traits among them that directed them to and helped them succeed in their chosen profession. A sales professional may be high in extroversion, moderate to low in agreeableness, moderate in conscientiousness, low in neuroticism, and across the board in openness to experience. This information is highly valuable when considering<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/12/29/best-marketing-tips"> how you market to these people</a>.</p>
<div id="when"></div>
<h2>When (and when not) to use the big five personality traits in your targeting</h2>
<p>You can use personality traits to target your marketing when you have a clear understanding of who your target audience is and whether or not they fall into any of these traits.</p>
<p>However, It’s important to keep in mind that the less <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/niche-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">niche</a> your target audience and more importantly your brand is, the less effective optimizing for personality becomes.</p>
<p>Let’s say for example that you sell pencils. Everyone can need and use pencils across a broad spectrum of personality traits. If your company is just plain old pencils, you may be able to sell to everyone, but your product isn’t going to necessarily stand out to anyone in particular. The marketing may be more focused on the quality or cost of the product versus anything else.</p>
<p>This is where the importance of <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-create-a-brand-identity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand identity</a> comes into play. Take beer for example. Beer is beer, everyone over the legal age can purchase and drink beer, however, many beer companies tailor their marketing to accentuate certain lifestyles.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/personality-traits-marketing-example-heineken.jpg" alt="personality traits marketing - example of heineken ad" width="916" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76286" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/personality-traits-marketing-example-heineken.jpg 916w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/personality-traits-marketing-example-heineken-480x314.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 916px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This Heineken ad for sports fans may also be targeting openness to experiences with it&#8217;s &#8220;all fans&#8221; messaging.</em></p>
<p>So the personality traits that your brand conveys, attracts, or attempts to be attractive to fall within a particular demographic and therefore a particular set of personality traits.</p>
<h2>Applying the big 5 personality traits for better marketing</h2>
<p>Marketing is, for the most part, the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/23/influence-buyers-marketing-psychology">art of persuasion</a>. The term persuasion or persuasiveness often resonates in a manipulative, Machiavellian way for a lot of people. Instead, I encourage you to view persuasion through the lens of commonality. What I mean by that is we are most easily persuaded by those we perceive to be most like us or those we share common values or interests with. There is a fine line between trust and persuasion in the business of selling goods and services. But, let’s bring this all back to paid marketing.</p>
<p>By tailoring our messaging, imagery, and tone to align with the unique traits of our audience, we can strike a chord that resonates deeply. Whether it&#8217;s appealing to the extraversion of social butterflies, fostering trust and cooperation for agreeable individuals, showcasing reliability and attention to detail for the conscientious, alleviating concerns for those prone to neuroticism, or sparking curiosity and embracing novelty for the open-minded, understanding and leveraging these personality traits can transform the impact of our marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Gathering insights on your target audience&#8217;s personality traits may involve conducting personality tests, collecting data from your best customers, or conducting scientific testing through our marketing channels. While personality remains an individual set of traits, we can uncover commonalities among larger data sets, particularly within certain industries, to inform our marketing strategies effectively.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Appeal to one (or more) of these key buying motives to increase sales and revenue for your business while better connecting with customers.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/31/buying-motives">5 Powerful Buying Motives &#038; How to Use Them to Increase Sales</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why do people buy? It’s a question marketers have asked themselves for decades. <em>Centuries</em>, even. You have a product or service. You know your product or service solves a very tangible problem. You even know who your ideal customer is. But what hidden mechanism inside that customer pushes them from the point of “I’m considering it” to “I’m committed to buy?” And how do you craft the kind of messaging that appeals to said mechanism?</p>
<p>That’s what we’re here to talk about today. Turns out, there are <strong>five key motives</strong> that lay dormant within all prospective buyers. And as a marketer or business owner, it’s your job to appeal so strongly to those hidden motives that your customer has no choice but to pull the trigger.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/five-key-buying-motives.webp" alt="five buying motives" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74762" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/five-key-buying-motives.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/five-key-buying-motives-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The five key buying motives we’re going to discuss today are, in order:</p>
<ol>
<li>The need for security</li>
<li>The need for esteem</li>
<li>The need for self-actualization</li>
<li>The need for variety and novelty</li>
<li>The need for efficiency and convenience</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s dive in.</p>
<h2>1. The need for security</h2>
<p>Chance the Rapper was onto something when he wrote I Might Need Security. Every person on earth seeks security in some fashion—even the greatest risk-takers and independent souls—<strong>need for security</strong> is one of the key motives that drives consumer behavior.</p>
<p>The need for security is rooted in the fundamental human desire for safety and protection. It can be triggered by a number of factors, from physical threats, to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/recession-proof-small-business-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial instability</a>, to emotional vulnerability–the list goes on.</p>
<p>How does that relate to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/28/behavioral-segmentation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consumer behavior</a>? Well, consumers who are motivated by the need for security tend to value products and services that offer reliability, predictability, and stability. They are risk-averse, and generally speaking, are hesitant to try new things or take chances that could compromise their safety or well-being.</p>
<p>Well, at least the part of them that needs security is averse to these things.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean you need to suddenly back all of your products with a 30-day money-back guarantee. But it does mean that, in order to appeal to the need for security, you need to focus, above all else, on <strong>building trust with your customers</strong>.</p>
<p>Testimonials, reviews, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/03/how-to-write-a-case-study">case studies</a> can be <em>massive </em>when it comes to making your customer feel like they are in safe hands. This is invaluable <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/04/marketing-collateral">marketing collateral</a> that you should promote on your website, product pages, <a href="https://localiq.com/products/targeted-email-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email campaigns</a>, sales calls–anywhere you get the chance. If you’re a B2B business, try offering a free trial or demo to give customers the chance to actually use your product before committing.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Testimonials, case studies, and reviews can all go a long way in appealing to your prospects’ need for security. </em></p>
<p>Everybody has been burned before. Everybody has bought that one product or service and immediately experienced buyer’s remorse; or worse, been done tangible or financial harm.</p>
<p>Emphasizing safety and trust, being transparent, and specifically highlighting your track record of integrity and credibility, can go a really long way in assuaging those concerns for buyers.</p>

<h2>2. The need for esteem</h2>
<p>The need for esteem is a powerful buying motive that is driven by the human desire for <strong>recognition, respect, and status</strong>. People who are motivated by the need for esteem want to feel <em>valued and respected</em> by others, and as such, they often seek out products and services that <strong>enhance their image and social status</strong>.</p>
<p>Think about that one person you know who (either personally or second-hand), has the G-Wagon in their garage. Rest assured, the need for esteem was <em>heavily </em>involved in that purchase, and you better believe that Mercedes appeals to that need in its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/16/copywriting-mistakes">messaging</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/buying-motives-esteem-g-wagon.webp" alt="buying motives - esteem - example of g wagon ad appealing to esteem buyer motive" width="776" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74757" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/buying-motives-esteem-g-wagon.webp 776w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/buying-motives-esteem-g-wagon-480x371.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 776px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Interestingly, Mercedes stresses safety and strength in a lot of its G-Wagon ads (thus appealing to the need for security), but the need for esteem is clearly present in this one.</p>
<p>Messaging: <em>My Car Is My Castle. </em></p>
<p>Implication: Buying a G-Wagon is akin to owning an enormous, stone-clad home that people will find universally impressive.</p>
<p>Appealing to the need for esteem requires you, as a marketer, to focus on building a strong <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-create-a-brand-identity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand identity</a> that communicates prestige, quality, and exclusivity.</p>
<p>Here are some time-honored strategies you can use to do just that:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Go hard on exclusivity</strong>. Those motivated by the need for esteem are much more likely to buy your product if it is a limited edition, of “premium” quality, or if it equips them with status among their peers.</li>
<li><strong>Offer personalized experiences</strong>. Think about the luxury shirt company that brings a customer in, offers him a glass of whisky, and brings out a distinguished-looking gentleman to tailor his shirt. By offering <em>personalized</em> products or services, you can appeal to the need for esteem.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage social media influencers and celebrities.</strong> We talk a lot about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/01/10/social-proof-guide">social proof</a> in marketing, and there’s no better way to show your customer they’re among elite company than by partnering with a celebrity or an esteemed influencer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Market your product as elite, and you’ll have customers that value esteem in your back pocket.</p>
<h2>3. The need for self-actualization</h2>
<p>You know that one friend who, no matter what job or career they’re in, can’t seem to find satisfaction? The need for self-actualization is <em>strong </em>with this one.</p>
<p>The need for self-actualization is driven by the desire to <strong>reach one&#8217;s full potential and achieve personal growth and fulfillment</strong>. People with this buying motive seek out products and services that <strong>help them develop their skills, pursue their passions, and achieve their goals</strong>.</p>
<p>While we don’t all have the benefit of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/10/nonprofit-marketing-tactics">marketing a nonprofit</a>, you can and should stress that by purchasing your product, your customers can either better themselves, better their situation, or better the situations of those around them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/buying-motives-self-actualization.webp" alt="buying motive - self actualization - ad from college that appeals to self actualization buyer motive" width="461" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74758" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/buying-motives-self-actualization.webp 461w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/buying-motives-self-actualization-231x300.webp 231w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Attend UV Irvine, and you can give a passion greater purpose (thereby achieving your full potential).</em></p>
<p>Here are some examples of self-actualization in action:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your software helps business owners save valuable time and money–time and money that they can in turn devote to cultivating their passions or running their businesses.</li>
<li>Your ecommerce brand donates a portion of all sales to charity, thereby making the buyer feel better about their purchase.</li>
<li>Your online class helps customers learn a valuable skill that they can use to earn more money or create something meaningful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, you don’t need to run a nonprofit to appeal to the need for self-actualization; and if you’re running a small business, especially a <em>local</em> business, customers should inherently feel good about buying from you, rather than a large company. But if you can take that a step further by emphasizing the fact that customers can deeply improve their lives by buying from you, you’re going to sell a lot of products.</p>

<h2>4. The need for variety and novelty</h2>
<p>As a guy who can never work two days straight in the same place, this one hits pretty close to home. The need for variety and novelty drives people to seek out <strong>new and exciting experiences</strong> and to <strong>avoid boredom and monotony</strong>. When people are influenced by this buyer motive, they purchase products and services that offer new and unique experiences or allow them to express their individuality.</p>
<p>Like our last example, some of your ability to appeal to this buyer motive will be determined by your vertical. If you’re in the travel industry, for example, the need for variety is going to be a core target in a lot of your marketing messaging. By offering people the opportunity to travel to a new place, you’re giving them a chance to shrug off the malaise of their everyday lives, have new experiences, and come home feeling refreshed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/buying-motives-variety.webp" alt="buying motive - variety - ad that appeals to variety buyer motive for travel company" width="462" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74759" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/buying-motives-variety.webp 462w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/buying-motives-variety-232x300.webp 232w" sizes="(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This slogan, “Let yourself go,” appeals deeply to the need for variety.</em></p>
<p>But like the other buyer motives on this list, your ability to appeal to the need for variety isn’t <em>limited</em> by your vertical.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re a clothing store, like True Classic. Customers love your basic t-shirts, but perhaps they’re getting a bit stale. By introducing new products and new lines, you can keep people engaged and encourage purchase behavior: even among customers that already own your t-shirts.</p>
<p>Or let’s say you’re a fast food giant, and you want to drive more sales around a critical <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/fall-marketing-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fall holiday</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/buying-motives-variety-burger-king.webp" alt="buying motive example ad from burger king around halloween" width="499" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74760" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/buying-motives-variety-burger-king.webp 499w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/buying-motives-variety-burger-king-480x576.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 499px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Even offering the same product, but in new and novel ways (like creative packaging), can be a way of appealing to the need for variety.</p>
<p>Keep your customers and prospects on their toes, and you give yourself a great chance of driving sales among the segment of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a> that’s driven by this powerful buyer motive.</p>
<h2>5. The need for efficiency and convenience</h2>
<p>You’ve heard all the statistics by now, but it’s worth a reminder: the average human attention span is<a href="https://www.thetreetop.com/statistics/average-human-attention-span#:~:text=Average%20Human%20Attention%20Span%20Statistics&amp;text=The%20average%20human%20attention%20span,than%20goldfish%20(9%20seconds)." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 8.25 seconds</a>. <em>8.25 seconds. </em>In less than the amount of time it takes the average person to open and close the refrigerator, you can lose their attention with a marketing campaign.</p>
<p>That’s what makes this buyer motive, the need for efficiency and convenience, so powerful. The need for efficiency and convenience drives individuals to seek out products and services that <strong>make their lives easier, save them time and effort,</strong> and <strong>streamline their daily routines.</strong></p>
<p>By way of example, check out this banner ad from Shell:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/buying-motives-efficiency-convenience.webp" alt="ad example that appeals to buying motive of efficiency and convenience" width="330" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74761" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/buying-motives-efficiency-convenience.webp 330w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/buying-motives-efficiency-convenience-165x300.webp 165w" sizes="(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px" /></p>
<p>Not only does this ad explicitly tout efficiency; it contains a call to action that is universally appealing to the need for efficiency. <em>Let’s go. </em>99% of people are on the run, and quickly moving from one task to the next. This call to action says that you <strong>need not stop what you’re doing to use this product</strong>.</p>
<p>The message, <em>Let’s make what we’ve got go further, </em>is all about doing more with less. That’s the need for efficiency in a nutshell. Not only should the process of buying your product be as quick and seamless as possible for people; your product should actually make their lives easier, so your customers can spend their valuable time doing the things they want to do.</p>
<h2>Appeal to a buyer motive; sell a product</h2>
<p>Appeal to a motive; <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">sell a product</a>. It’s really that simple. Think deeply about what motivates your customers to buy your product or service, and group it into one of these five buckets. From there, take a cue from the marketing campaigns we’ve called out in this post and craft some messaging that directly appeals to said buyer motive. I’m confident that if you can do that, you’ll see results in the form of increased sales and revenue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/baba-shiv-how-wines-price-tag-affect-its-taste" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experiment</a> was conducted for wine tasters sometime ago. The volunteers received two bottles of wine and were told to describe the taste of each one. Bottle A came with a price tag of $5, while the other bottle had a price tag of $45.</p>
<p>While both bottles had the same exact wine in them, most volunteers claimed the costly wine tasted better than the cheap bottle.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/customer-perceived-value-wine.png" alt="customer perceived value - pricier wine tastes better to consumers" width="658" height="470" class=" wp-image-69209 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/customer-perceived-value-wine.png 658w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/customer-perceived-value-wine-480x343.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 658px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This is perceived value in action! So how does it all work and how can you improve the perceived value of your product or service? Read on to find out.</p>
<h2>What is customer perceived value in marketing?</h2>
<p>Perceived value is a customer&#8217;s view or appraisal of a product or service based on their perception of its costs and benefits. This includes whether it meets (or will meet) their needs and expectations, how it compares to competitors, and its quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://hbr.org/2006/01/decisions-and-desire">Studies have shown </a>that our brain is wired to make choices based on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">emotional triggers</a>—and that includes purchasing decisions. So, rather than considering manufacturing costs when assessing whether a product or service is worth the price, they rely on subjective judgments and emotions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/customer-perceived-value-benefits-costs.png" alt="definition of customer perceived value" width="720" height="463" class="size-full wp-image-69179 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/customer-perceived-value-benefits-costs.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/customer-perceived-value-benefits-costs-480x309.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>The power of customer perceived value</h2>
<p>Leveraging the power of perception can help your business in several ways, including:</p>
<h3>Charge higher prices</h3>
<p>As the perceived worth of a product rises, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/03/price-increase-letter-examples">businesses can charge a higher price</a> or sell more units, resulting in increased revenue. For example <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM6F3AM/A/polishing-cloth?fnode=7b3655df564c0e3287562568725633718d68cbbb472cc106db622977d4e6574e8d82ddec40cc5f96f1352dfbd0248b07ad94e0f8d78f16d414f8606816aed0a5f9b2dd63ea46214f1bebf3e9ad94cb8454e066bc827bc1fa55273889f335ae9e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple released a polishing cloth</a> in 2021 with a <strong>$19 tag</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/customer-perceived-value-apple-polishing-cloth.png" alt="customer perceived value - apple's $19 polishing cloth" width="650" height="450" class="size-full wp-image-69172 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/customer-perceived-value-apple-polishing-cloth.png 650w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/customer-perceived-value-apple-polishing-cloth-480x332.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /><a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM6F3AM/A/polishing-cloth?fnode=7b3655df564c0e3287562568725633718d68cbbb472cc106db622977d4e6574e8d82ddec40cc5f96f1352dfbd0248b07ad94e0f8d78f16d414f8606816aed0a5f9b2dd63ea46214f1bebf3e9ad94cb8454e066bc827bc1fa55273889f335ae9e"></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/technology/apple-polishing-cloth.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Times</a> referred to this pricing as &#8220;<strong>bold</strong> even by Apple’s standards, a company whose legions of loyal customers are conditioned to steep stomach prices.” Interestingly, the polishing cloth was Apple&#8217;s most back-ordered item in October 2021.</p>
<p>Crazy right? But that’s what the power of perception can do.</p>
<h3>Greater customer satisfaction</h3>
<p>Customer satisfaction is usually a function of value. When your customers perceive your products well, they’re more apt to feel their needs are being met—especially to validate their investment. Remember that you need to deliver on this value, however, so you aren’t setting them up to be disappointed in the long run.</p>
<h3>Improve customer loyalty</h3>
<p>By convincing purchasers that your items are more valuable than competitors, you improve your chances of developing lasting connections with them. For example, here is what <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/apple-polishing-cloth">PC Mag</a> has to say about Apple’s polishing cloth.</p>
<p><em>The Apple Polishing Cloth fully demonstrates the power of the company&#8217;s branding—it doesn’t even matter that Apple&#8217;s official page on how to clean your device(Opens in a new window) suggests only that you use a &#8220;clean, damp, lint-free cloth.&#8221; So long as Apple sells a product that fits the definition, fans will buy it.</em></p>
<h3>Increase demand</h3>
<p>Of course, individuals with a favorable impression of your product are more likely to convert and spread positive word-of-mouth, resulting in greater demand.</p>
<h2>Easy ways to increase a product’s perceived value</h2>
<p>We have seen how perception benefits businesses. But how do we forge this perception? Here’s how to increase perceived value for your<a href="https://mydigitalkube.com/business-ideas"> small business</a>?</p>
<h3>1. Create scarcity</h3>
<p>When you indicate that a product is limited in availability, you suggest that it is either running out because it’s popular, or rare because it’s valuable.</p>
<p>This is one of the most prevalent methods used by <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/25/ecommerce-marketing-trends">ecommerce websites</a> to induce FOMO and enhance conversions.Here are some easy and effective examples of scarcity copy:</p>
<ul>
<li>20% discount ends in two days</li>
<li>Out of stock / only X left in stock</li>
<li>Limited to x per buyer</li>
<li>Your item is kept in a basket for 15 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/increase-customer-perceived-value-out-of-stock.png" alt="how to increase customer perceived value - out of stock example" width="720" height="388" class="size-full wp-image-69180 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/increase-customer-perceived-value-out-of-stock.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/increase-customer-perceived-value-out-of-stock-480x259.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>2. Increase the price</h3>
<p>As you saw in the wine-tasting experiment, and as <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/09/190906104111.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other studies show</a>, consumers often associate a higher price with more value. Social psychologist Robert Cialdini explains that customers tend to substitute price for quality, especially when they’re unfamiliar with a product.</p>
<p>Just stay practical about it—you do not want to charge $19 for a cleaning cloth like Apple. Experiment with your product pricing strategy and find that sweet spot.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/customer-perceived-value-pricing-strategy-matrix.png" alt="customer perceived value - pricing strategy matrix" width="605" height="550" class=" wp-image-69176 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/customer-perceived-value-pricing-strategy-matrix.png 605w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/customer-perceived-value-pricing-strategy-matrix-480x437.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 605px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://zapier.com/blog/pricing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<h3>3. Show markdowns</h3>
<p>Another technique to increase customer perceived value is to show that your product is worth more than the given price. For example, you could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide the original price if you’re running a sale or bundle discount</li>
<li>Indicate other savings or gains the customer can get, such as time and resources and what those are valued at.</li>
</ul>
<p>The New York Times does this below by showing that you aren’t paying for a dollar’s worth of news per week, but rather, $4.25 worth of news, but only for $1.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/customer-perceived-value-markdown-example.png" alt="how to increase customer perceived value - price markdown example" width="308" height="314" class=" wp-image-69181 aligncenter" /></p>

<p>Many consumers are used to seeing deals like this  on <a href="https://mydigitalkube.com/online-selling-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online shopping sites</a>. Just make sure you stay honest and don’t overexaggerate, otherwise you could give off the impression of being a sleazy infomercial if you are not cautious.</p>
<h3>4. Use charm pricing</h3>
<p>Notice how almost all of the prices you see end in “99”? For instance, if something costs $5, they display $4.99 as opposed to $5, or $999 as opposed to $1000.</p>
<p>This tactical pricing strategy is called “charm pricing” and according to the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/36/2/328/1942926" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Journal of Consumer Research</a> and this <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ee6b/d0c4e357f043a51618a672bf7d0f15df8825.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIT study</a>, consumers perceive &#8220;odd prices&#8221; to be cheaper than they really are.</p>
<p>The online sales platform <a href="https://medium.com/@gumroad/a-penny-saved-psychological-pricing-57e6acb3ae14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gumroad</a> tested this and discovered that it greatly increased their conversion rates. Here are the results of the experiment:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/increase-perceived-value-charm-pricing.png" alt="how to increase customer perceived value - charm pricing example" width="600" height="546" class="size-full wp-image-69182 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/increase-perceived-value-charm-pricing.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/increase-perceived-value-charm-pricing-480x437.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>5. Include high-quality visuals</h3>
<p>One issue online shoppers face is not being able to physically touch a product to confirm its authenticity or assess its quality. This means you need to use high-quality visuals that demonstrate its best features and benefits. <a href="https://bellroy.com/collection/slim-your-wallet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bellroy</a> does a great job with this on its site with a slider bar that allows you to compare wallet sizes based on number of credit cards you&#8217;re using.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/customer-perceived-value-bellroy-wallets.png" alt="customer perceived value - bellroy's wallet slider" width="720" height="372" class="size-full wp-image-69174 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/customer-perceived-value-bellroy-wallets.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/customer-perceived-value-bellroy-wallets-480x248.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>6. Display customer testimonials and reviews</h3>
<p>Prospective customers are eager to learn what existing customers think of a product or service. In fact,  <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/online-review-stats/">93%</a> of people are influenced by online reviews, and online product reviews are trusted 12x more than a manufacturers’ description. This makes it crucial to include customer testimonials and reviews on your website and social media channels.</p>
<p>Not only will they improve your perceived value, but they&#8217;ll also ease anxieties of potential customers, set you apart from competitors, and build your credibility and trust.</p>
<h3>7. Offer top-notch customer support…</h3>
<p>Not only do businesses that provide memorable client experiences get word-of-mouth recommendations, excellent internet evaluations, and greater customer retention rates, but also, customers are willing to pay more for a better experience and support.</p>
<p>Personalized support raises the perceived value of your products and services.</p>
<p>Here are some customer support ideas to improve product value:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a premium community for your customers</li>
<li>Offer a periodic live meetings with customers</li>
<li>One-on-one consultations and meetings with clients</li>
</ul>
<h3>8. …and a seamless user experience</h3>
<p>Speaking of customer experience, customers should have a good experience in all their interactions with all of your digital assets. Make sure you optimize</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast page speed</li>
<li>A quality experience free of annoying popups</li>
<li>Mobile functionality</li>
<li>Accessibility</li>
<li>Attractive design</li>
<li>A variety of payment methods</li>
<li>An easy checkout process</li>
</ul>

<h3>9. Leverage influencers</h3>
<p>Getting someone your audience knows and trusts to endorse your product or service can make a big difference in your perceived value. You do not have to spend a fortune on celebrity endorsements. Simply find industry influencers in your niche and use our tips for influencer collaboration and outreach.</p>
<h3>10. Pay close attention to your branding</h3>
<p>The importance of branding in customer perception cannot be overemphasized. Regardless of how excellent your goods or services are, your clients may overlook the actual value you deliver if your branding and design are off.</p>
<p>To use branding to your advantage, make sure you have a consistent and attractive brand identity across all of your assets, both digital and physical. This includes your website, social channels, emails, packaging, swag, signage, and more.</p>
<p>Daily Harvest is an ecommerce company that combines <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/23/how-brand-your-business">proper branding</a> and gorgeous product graphics to sell nutritious smoothies.</p>
<h3>11. Offer free trials and samples</h3>
<p>No one has as clear an understanding of your product as you, and not everyone will read through its features or benefits.</p>
<p>Instead of telling prospects how fantastic your service is, allow them to experience the it themselves by providing free trials and samples. Regardless of whether they use it, the mere offer demonstrates confidence which can improve its perceived worth.</p>
<p>As part of their client acquisition strategy, several B2B SaaS providers provide free plans and short-term trials, enhancing their products&#8217; perceived value.</p>
<h3>12. Be socially responsible</h3>
<p>One way to appeal to emotions to improve your customers’ perception of your brand and product is to use social responsibility.</p>
<p>Studies show that customers are prepared to pay extra for items made by socially responsible enterprises. Humans are a cooperative species by nature. We feels good when we do acts of kindness for others, but we feel even better when we earn something while doing it.</p>
<p>Consider donating a portion of your proceeds to a cause you care about or giving back to the communities of which you are a part.</p>
<p>People love buying from such firms, and it boosts their perceived worth.</p>
<h3>13. Know what matters to your audience</h3>
<p>Even if your product is the best on the market, it’s not going to matter if it doesn’t resonate with your customers. You need to be aware of the emotional factors that motivate them, the benefits they seek and the problems they’re looking to avoid.</p>
<p>Your value proposition needs to come from an intricate understanding of yoru target audience and buyer personas.</p>
<h2>Wrap up</h2>
<p>If there is anything to take away from this piece, it should be that customer perception is crucial for business success. Your customers are the engine that propels your business forward, and they want to know that their time and money are well spent. So put this need at the center of all your marketing efforts, follow the tips in this post, and you will increase the perceived value of your goods and services.</p>

<h2>What is color psychology?</h2>
<p>Color psychology is the theory that certain colors elicit a physical or emotional reaction and, in doing so, shape human behavior. This isn’t quite as simple as seeing red and getting angry or seeing blue and feeling at ease—but almost. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6396577/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medical studies</a> suggest that the color red correlates to an increase in blood pressure, and the color blue corresponds with a decrease.</p>
<p>Because of this impact on behavior, color can play a big role in creating a mood. According to <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/does-paint-color-affect-your-mood" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Architectural Digest</a>, this makes choosing the right paint colors crucial for setting the tone of your home. Warm colors tend to energize, while cool colors tend to calm.</p>

<h2>Why does the psychology of color in marketing matter?</h2>
<p>Color can play a big role in marketing—whether you’re paying attention to it or not. The colors that you use in your branding, including your logo, and your other <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/04/marketing-collateral">marketing collateral</a> evokes an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">emotional response</a> in your audience, whether they realize it or not.</p>

<p>And as noted in our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/23/influence-buyers-marketing-psychology">marketing psychology guide</a>, we make decisions based on emotion, not logic.</p>
<p>Bottom line: You need to consider color psychology when you’re building your brand and creating your campaigns.<br />
<a id="how"></a></p>
<h2>How to use color psychology to improve your marketing</h2>
<p>Now that we’re clear on what the psychology of color is and how influential using the right or wrong colors can be in your marketing, here’s how to use color psychology to make your marketing even more effective.</p>
<h3>1. Learn color psychology essentials</h3>
<p>Familiarizing yourself with the basics can go a long way toward employing color psychology in your marketing. We covered earlier how red can evoke heightened alertness or anxiety, while blue can have an adverse calming effect. Here are some more fundamental color associations to consider with your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/11/09/emotional-ads"> emotional ads</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Red:</strong> excitement, passion, anger, danger, action, anxiety, power.</li>
<li><strong>Orange:</strong> playfulness, friendliness, creativity, warmth, enthusiasm.</li>
<li><strong>Yellow:</strong> happiness, optimism, warning, joy, originality, enthusiasm.</li>
<li><strong>Green:</strong> Youth, vibrancy, vigor, nature, growth, stability.</li>
<li><strong>Blue:</strong> Calm, stability, depth, peacefulness, trust.</li>
<li><strong>Purple:</strong> Royalty, luxury, romance, introspection, calm.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice how there are some overlaps. You’re not limited to only one color—or one tone of that color—per emotion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/color-psychology-marketing-emotion.png" alt="color psychology in marketing - emotional associations" width="547" height="606" class="aligncenter wp-image-62740" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/color-psychology-marketing-emotion.png 547w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/color-psychology-marketing-emotion-480x531.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 547px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.conversioner.com/blog/color-psychology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></p>
<h3>2. Start with emotion first</h3>
<p>Whether you’re rethinking your brand colors or deciding on a palette for new ads, you need to start with the emotion you want your audience to have. Should they respond with fear? Curiosity? Confidence? Use these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/21/emotional-ad-copy-examples">emotional ad copy examples</a> for inspiration.</p>
<p>Once you know the desired outcome, make sure to choose the right color.</p>
<p>Take this example ad from a Lego campaign with the tagline “Make your own story.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/color-psychology-marketing-lego.png" alt="color psychology marketing - orange lego ad" width="720" height="474" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62728" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/color-psychology-marketing-lego.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/color-psychology-marketing-lego-480x316.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The ad shows a Lego Darth Vader grilling with Leia sitting in the sun hanging out nearby. It’s a playful scene with these Star Wars figures, dropping them into a casual, fun atmosphere to make a new story. It’s no wonder that the background is orange—an open, inviting color that inspires <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/02/08/seven-innovative-ads">creativity</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4da.png" alt="📚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide download &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite120WordsforMarketingWithEmotion.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_120WordsPhrases_Download">135 of the Best Words &amp; Phrases for Marketing with Emotion</a></p>
<h3>3. Get inspired by other brands</h3>
<p>The best way to get better at using the psychology of color is to pay attention to ads, websites, and branding and how the colors make you feel. Check out the website for <a href="https://bloomscape.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomscape</a>, an ecommerce plant website targeting Millennial and Gen-Z consumers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/color-psychology-marketing-bloomscape.jpg" alt="color psychology marketing - bloomscape's warm green homepage" width="720" height="372" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62724" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/color-psychology-marketing-bloomscape.jpg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/color-psychology-marketing-bloomscape-480x248.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The forest green font and bar at the top toes the line between earthy and trendy. The cream is a homey natural accent that pairs well with the light peach, a warm, creative revision of Millennial pink. The variety of greens is offset with warm terracotta pots, as well as the red and orange accents on the plants. The effect makes me want to water and nurture my own plants, and maybe even buy a succulent or two.</p>
<h3>4. Keep it consistent with your branding</h3>
<p>When SEO company Reboot ran a study on logo recognition, <a href="https://www.rebootonline.com/blog/what-importance-colour-brand-recognition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">78%</a> of participants were able to recall the primary color of the logo while only 43% were able to remember the company name.</p>
<p>If your audience remembers your brand by its color, then you want to make sure it’s the same and it’s everywhere. That’s why keeping your colors consistent with your branding is paramount, and the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/01/brand-strategy">most successful brands</a> recognize this. Remember the Dunkin Donuts rebrand to Dunkin a few years ago? All those image changes, same old but iconic color choices.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/color-psychology-marketing-dunkin-e1657635732586.png" alt="color psychology marketing - dunkin old and new logo" width="719" height="167" class="aligncenter wp-image-62723 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/color-psychology-marketing-dunkin-e1657635732586.png 719w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/color-psychology-marketing-dunkin-e1657635732586-480x167.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 719px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Dunkin’ is a good example because its branding is all over everything—with orange, pink, brown, as well as variations on these colors. It’s the multiple colors and variations that (in most cases) keep your branding from becoming flat or two-dimensional. This leads us to the next tip—giving yourself the right palette to work with.</p>
<h3>5. Create a brand color palette</h3>
<p>You want to keep the colors in your marketing consistent, but you don’t want to be forgettably one-note. Worse, this could look spammy. The solution is to have a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/03/website-color-scheme">color scheme</a> to work with that allows for some variety but sets some standards.</p>
<p>So if you don’t already have a brand color palette, it’s time to make one.</p>
<p>Here are a few common types of color palettes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analogous:</strong> Colors next to each other on the color wheel.</li>
<li><strong>Complementary:</strong> Opposite colors that create high contrast.</li>
<li><strong>Monochromatic:</strong> Different shades or tones of the same primary color.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re looking for some help coming up with the palette or some inspiration, check out the free design tool <a href="https://coolors.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coolors</a>. It contains example pallets and can automatically generate your own based on a starting color or even a photograph.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/color-psychology-marketing-gradient.png" alt="color psychology marketing - maroon gradient" width="720" height="203" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62730" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/color-psychology-marketing-gradient.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/color-psychology-marketing-gradient-480x135.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A monochromatic color palette from Coolors.</em></p>
<h3>6. Keep cultural context in mind</h3>
<p>Perception of color isn’t universal. In fact, <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2017/analyzing-language-color-0918" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIT</a> researchers found that the words that we have and use to talk about color varies by language. Some communities have three color categories, while others have up to 12—a significant range in categories, before even getting into individual colors.</p>
<p>It follows that psychology of color isn’t universal then, either. That’s why it’s important to keep cultural context in mind for your branding and marketing. Here’s an excellent cheat sheet visualization to use as a starting point:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/color-psychology-marketing-cultures-1.png" alt="color psychology marketing - color in cultures around the world" width="720" height="304" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62733" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/color-psychology-marketing-cultures-1.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/color-psychology-marketing-cultures-1-480x203.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/color-psychology-in-ux-b371fde795d3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></p>
<h3>7. Try to add some blue</h3>
<p>If you’ve gotten to this point and you&#8217;re thinking that keeping track of cultural context, sticking with a palette, and relying on the color psychology basics is overwhelming and impossible, don’t worry. Getting versed in the basics and incorporating color psychology into your marketing workflow is going to take some time and some practice.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, here’s a quick rule of thumb: <strong>When in doubt, add some blue.</strong></p>
<p>It turns out that blue is the most popular favorite color <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/international/articles-reports/2015/05/12/why-blue-worlds-favorite-color">across the world</a>. That might be one of the reasons that some of the <a href="https://designbuddy.com/what-do-worlds-top-brands-logos-have-in-common">world’s most successful brands</a> have blue in their logos. Facebook, Twitter, Vimeo, American Express, IBM—the list goes on and on.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/color-psychology-marketing-blue-logos.png" alt="color psychology marketing - blue logos" width="720" height="322" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62727" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/color-psychology-marketing-blue-logos.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/color-psychology-marketing-blue-logos-480x215.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.logomaker.com/blog/2017/09/27/blue-logos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a shortcut or a sure thing, blue’s a safe bet.</p>
<h3>8. Run color tests with your audience</h3>
<p>Now, this might sound like I’m going against everything before. But the reality is that you can’t always predict how your audience will respond to a certain color—let alone certain shades, tones, or tints in your color palette. That’s where <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/02/26/ab-testing-best-practices">A/B testing</a> comes in. Try testing two different color backgrounds in your ads or buttons on your website and see which your audience prefers.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/what-are-ab-testing-best-pratices-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="288" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4880" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/what-are-ab-testing-best-pratices-1.jpg 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/what-are-ab-testing-best-pratices-1-480x230.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Then use that information. That’s the best way to leverage color psychology to improve your marketing. Test—and keep testing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The brain. It is the control center for every process in your body, and with so much to do every day (like keeping you alive), it has to rely on shortcuts—for remembering, problem-solving, and—what we&#8217;re talking about today—decision making.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-availability-heuristic.png" alt="marketing psychology- availability heuristic" width="634" height="434" class="aligncenter wp-image-61206" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-availability-heuristic.png 634w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-availability-heuristic-480x329.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 634px, 100vw" />So in terms of consumers making purchasing decisions, being aware of these shortcuts can help you to understand, predict, and leverage their behaviors in your favor. No, you&#8217;re not looking to maliciously manipulate your prospects and customers. But yes, there are ways to influence their actions—actions they will be glad they took.</p>
<p>In this article, you&#8217;ll learn seven psychological principles you can leverage in your marketing and influence the buying decisions of your prospects.</p>

<h2>What is marketing psychology?</h2>
<p>Marketing psychology is the practice of aligning your content, communication, and strategies with the many predictable, often subconscious, human behavioral patterns that have been identified through experimentation and research. These common behaviors originate from heuristics—a fancy word for shortcuts the brain takes for tasks it carries out thousands of times a day, like comprehending information, making decisions, and solving problems.</p>
<p>There are several ways to use marketing psychology, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resonating with your audience by using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">emotional trigger words</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/01/psychology-copywriting-tips-examples">Applying psychology principles to copywriting</a>.</li>

</ul>

<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-color-psychology-emotions.png" alt="marketing color psychology" width="476" height="526" class="aligncenter wp-image-61430" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.drip.com/blog/color-psychology" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a><br />
Regardless, the idea is not to change the way your audience thinks. These patterns are hard-wired in our brains! It&#8217;s to change your content and approaches to align with the way they think. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/01/psychology-copywriting-tips-examples"></a></p>
<p><a id="how"></a></p>
<h2>How to use marketing psychology responsibly</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m not trying to sugarcoat things. These &#8220;shortcuts&#8221; are also referred to as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/06/cognitive-biases">cognitive biases</a>, thinking traps, or cognitive distortions. Which leads me to a crucial point: the idea behind marketing psychology is not to exploit, manipulate, or deceive. So if you want to <a href="/blog/ws/2021/01/15/consumer-psychology">use consumer psychology to win over more customers</a>, remember these points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DO</strong> make sure that their decision to choose you is truly the best one for them. Winning over customers that aren&#8217;t a good fit for your business is a lose-lose.</li>
<li><strong>DON&#8217;T</strong> use these tactics to make promises you can’t keep or to represent more capabilities than you have.</li>
<li><strong>DO</strong> align your business goals with the goals of your prospective buyers to make it a win-win. And use data to measure the effectiveness of your marketing psychology strategies.</li>
<li><strong>DON&#8217;T </strong>forget that you&#8217;re a human and consumer too. Beware of other businesses practicing manipulative marketing psychology.</li>
</ul>
<h2>7 marketing psychology strategies &amp; examples to influence purchasing decisions</h2>
<p>For each of these seven tactics, I&#8217;ll explain what each one is, offer some simple examples, and then provide specific ways you can apply them in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/18/best-marketing-strategies">marketing strategies</a>—whether for your website, product pages, landing pages, and more.<br />
<a id="commitment"></a></p>
<h3>1. The commitment &amp; consistency bias</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://tactics.convertize.com/definitions/commitment-and-consistency">commitment and consistency bias</a> says that we have the tendency to act in line with our previous behaviors and expressions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-commitment-and-consistenc-bias.png" alt="marketing psychology - commitment and consistency bias" width="477" height="528" class="aligncenter wp-image-61419" /></p>
<p>This phenomenon has a few manifestations that can work to your advantage in marketing.</p>
<h4>Create a lead nurture funnel</h4>
<p>Once we heed a small request, we are more likely to comply with similar ones that follow. This is the concept behind the marketing funnel! At the top of the funnel are small requests for your audience, which gradually get bigger as the prospect moves <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/01/bottom-funnel-conversions">downward to the bottom</a>.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-funnel-commitment.png" alt="marketing funnel commitment levels" width="720" height="513" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59656" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-funnel-commitment.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-funnel-commitment-480x342.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /><br />
For example, you ask readers to read your content, then you ask them to give their email in exchange for a free guide, then you ask them to attend an event or webinar, and then you invite them to a free trial or consult.</p>
<p>Since your audience is subconsciously inclined to keep their behaviors consistent, they are more likely to continue pursuing and engaging with the content and offers from the business they first started with. Plus, compared to their first action (reading a blog post), a free trial is a big jump, but compared to the previous action (attending a <a href="/blog/ws/2016/05/03/marketing-webinars">webinar</a>), it’s not as drastic.</p>
<h4>Have progress markers for tasks</h4>
<p>Another form of the commitment bias is the sunk cost fallacy—the need to follow through with something once we’ve invested time and/or money into it. For example, Yelp lets you draft <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">reviews</a> without creating an account. When you begin writing, Yelp uses fun cues like “Don&#8217;t leave us hanging &#8211; what else you got?” to encourage you to complete the review.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/marketing-psychology-influence-decisions-yelp-3-1.png" alt="how to use marketing psychology to influence purchasing decisions—yelp review process" width="800" height="548" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<p>Then, once you finish the review, they ask you to create an account—without which you can’t post your review.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/marketing-psychology-influence-decisions-yelp-2-1.png" alt="how to use marketing psychology to influence purchasing decisions—yelp encouraging signup to publish review" width="800" height="459" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<p>Now you don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to create an account and post the review, but more likely than not, you’ve put in the effort to write it, so you want to make the time you spent worth it. You’re not going to abandon the process now, are you?</p>
<h4>Break your content up into digestible tidbits</h4>
<p>You can also leverage the commitment and consistency bias to <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/commitment-consistency-ux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase engagement with your content</a>—particularly <a href="/blog/ws/2014/05/05/longform-content">long-form content </a>over 5,000 words. Instead of just asking your audience to commit to reading an article that they don’t yet know is worth their time, present it in <a href="https://www.mightycitizen.com/insights/articles/bite-snack-meal-are-you-making-your-web-content-digestible#:~:text=The%20idea%20was%20simple%20enough,meal%20is%20the%20whole%20shebang.">bite-snack-meal</a> form.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bite: </strong>Small piece of information without details.</li>
<li><strong>Snack</strong>: Combination of bites. Audience wants more information but not detail.</li>
<li><strong>Meal</strong>: Large piece of information, filled with details and thorough explanations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take, for instance, <a href="https://elitecontentmarketer.com/grammarly-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elite Content Marketer&#8217;s</a> extensive review of Grammarly. Instead of asking readers to commit to reading the whole piece, it start with the bite and the snack upfront. The bite is the overall verdict. The snack is a visual of the pros and cons of the product. And then the meal is the detailed review.</p>
<p>If the reader has engaged with the smaller, more digestible pieces of information at the beginning, they will be more likely to perform the larger request: to read the full piece. Should they choose not to read it, they can at least get the key takeaways at the top and obtain value from the content.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-bite-snack-meal.png" alt="marketing psychology - bite snack meal approach" width="431" height="667" class="aligncenter wp-image-59696" /></p>
<h4>Speak to your audience&#8217;s self-perception</h4>
<p>I highly doubt this was done intentionally, but the call to action button below is a great example of the C&amp;C bias in copywriting. If someone is on this website, it&#8217;s because they care about their pet. According to this pop-up, not signing up is inconsistent with this self-perception.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/call-to-action-examples-best-pet-parent.png" alt="call to action examples - best pet parent" width="600" height="487" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59012" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/call-to-action-examples-best-pet-parent.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/call-to-action-examples-best-pet-parent-480x390.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /><br />
<a id="anchoring"></a></p>
<h3>2. The anchoring bias</h3>
<p>The anchoring bias is the tendency of an individual to use the first piece of information presented to them as a benchmark (or anchor) for making a subsequent decision. As you can imagine, this tactic is particularly useful for pricing.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-anchoring-bias.png" alt="marketing psychology - the anchoring bias" width="539" height="602" class="aligncenter wp-image-61420" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-anchoring-bias.png 539w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-anchoring-bias-480x536.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 539px, 100vw" /><br />
Here are some types and examples of anchoring:</p>
<h4>Indicate mark-downs</h4>
<p>Not only does the buyer see this as a bargain, but also, a higher starting price tends to send the message that the item is of higher value. Notice how I said &#8220;tends.&#8221; Every business has a unique audience with unique <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/01/how-customers-perceive-a-price-is-as-important-as-the-price-itself" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perceptions on price</a>. Make sure you understand how pricing changes affect the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323214382_Effects_of_price_discount_on_consumers'_perceptions_of_savings_quality_and_value_for_apparel_products_mediating_effect_of_price_discount_affect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perceived quality of your products</a> in the eyes of your customers.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/marketing-psychology-markdowns.png" alt="marketing psychology - example of anchoring using markdowns" width="400" height="661" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59533" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/marketing-psychology-markdowns.png 400w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/marketing-psychology-markdowns-182x300.png 182w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<h4>Show the amount saved</h4>
<p>Many SaaS and subscription companies offer a cheaper annual plan over their monthly subscriptions, as with Zoom in the example below. Another way to display this would be to show the monthly rate for the month-to-month plan, and then the reduced monthly rate for the yearly plan. However, if the difference is not all that significant, it may be more worth your while to show the total savings from the year.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-example-pricing.png" alt="marketing psychology example - savings shown" width="720" height="506" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59664" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-example-pricing.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-example-pricing-480x337.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /><br />
<a id="choice"></a></p>
<h3>3. The paradox of choice</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re at the supermarket and you want to buy some tea. As you approach the aisle, the rainbow of packaging looks great. But as you start browsing, you start feeling not-so-great. There&#8217;s black tea. Green tea. White. Red. Regular tea, decaf, or herbal. Fruit tea. Zingers. Loose leaf. Probiotic. Sleep-enhancing. Memory boosting. And that&#8217;s just for one brand. Overwhelmed, you abort the mission altogether.</p>
<p>That’s the paradox of choice!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-the-paradox-of-choice.png" alt="marketing psychology - the paradox of choice" width="600" height="665" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61421" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-the-paradox-of-choice.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-the-paradox-of-choice-480x532.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The paradox of choice says that as the number of options to choose from increases, the more stressed we feel about making a decision and the more likely we are to not make one at all. We also are more likely to have doubts about whether the decision we made was the right one. Here are some ways to remove analysis paralysis for your audience.</p>
<h4>Keep varieties and options to a minimum</h4>
<p>In an experiment by Sheena Iyengar, when a supermarket made six types of jam available for tasing, it attracted 40% of shoppers, 30% of whom bought jam. But when this was repeated with 24 types of jam, it attracted 60% of shoppers and resulted in only 3% of purchases. If you want to increase your conversion rates, consider decreasing the options available to your audience. Perhaps offer a sale on a select number of products, or reduce your five pricing packages down to three.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-paradox-of-choice-jam.png" alt="psychology in marketing - paradox of choice" width="720" height="446" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59666" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-paradox-of-choice-jam.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-paradox-of-choice-jam-480x297.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<article><em><a href="http://www.yourmarketingrules.com/the-paradox-of-choice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></article>
<h4>Limit the number of items in your main navigation menu</h4>
<p>While a big part of marketing is to go against the norm so you can stand out, there are still many areas where this could work against you. For example, you might see that a competitor has just five items in their website&#8217;s navigation bar. So maybe you think to have 10 in yours so prospects can see that you have more to offer. The truth is, websites should only have <a href="https://www.jimdo.com/blog/fixing-website-navigation-bar/#:~:text=A%20good%20rule%20of%20thumb,likely%20to%20leave%20your%20website.">3-6 items in their navigation bar</a>.</p>
<p>Too many options to choose from, and the visitor becomes confused on what to do or where to go. By narrowing down those menu options (and even the other click options on the home page), you spare them from these unnecessary decisions so they have the mental energy to make the more important ones as they get deeper into your site.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-nav-bar.png" alt="navigation menu with too many elements" width="720" height="310" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61422" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-nav-bar.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-nav-bar-480x207.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This site could benefit from consolidating the menu in its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/27/website-header-examples">website header</a> with drop-downs.</p>
<h4>Have only one CTA per landing page</h4>
<p>You&#8217;ve heard this a thousand times, but it&#8217;s worth repeating. You should have one unique landing page for each product or offering, with one <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">clear call to action</a> per landing page. Multiple options will distract your prospects from the desired action you want them to take, can make for a less cohesive user experience, and can lead to a loss of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/website-conversion">conversions</a>. And when you&#8217;re running paid ads, you can&#8217;t afford to waste your ad spend.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-one-CTA.png" alt="marketing psychology examples - one CTA per landing page" width="720" height="463" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59667" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-one-CTA.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-one-CTA-480x309.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Remove navigation, social buttons, and footers too</h4>
<p>So maybe you&#8217;ve removed the email signup button from the page where you want users to buy now. But are there other options to click on the page that are less prominent? Is there a link-heavy footer on the bottom? What about social media icons that link to your profiles or allow the visitor to share? In a <a href="https://vwo.com/success-stories/taloon/">case study by VWO</a>, they were able to increase conversion rate by 100%, simply by eliminating the navigation menu.<br />

<a id="socialproof"></a></p>
<h2>4. Social proof</h2>
<p>Coined by the author Robert Cialdini in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Robert-Cialdini/dp/1863501568" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Influence</a>, social proof says that we tend to follow others in new situations where “appropriate” behavior is unknown to us. It&#8217;s our way of ensuring we feel safe, liked, and/or accepted.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-social-proof-1.png" alt="marketing psychology - social proof" width="488" height="538" class="aligncenter wp-image-61423" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-social-proof-1.png 488w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-social-proof-1-480x529.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 488px, 100vw" /><br />
What does that mean in marketing? <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/05/customer-testimonials">Testimonials</a>. Reviews. And more. Here are a few ways you can use <a href="/blog/ws/2017/01/10/social-proof-guide">social proof</a> to influence <a href="/blog/ws/2017/08/28/behavioral-segmentation">buyer behavior</a>.</p>
<h4>Have an organized testimonials page</h4>
<p>Create a dedicated <a href="/blog/ws/2017/07/19/customer-testimonial-examples">testimonial page</a> so prospective clients can see others just like them, benefiting from your solution. For example, below is the <a href="https://localiq.com/success-stories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testimonial page on the LOCALiQ website</a>. Notice that you can filter by industry or service provided—which is ideal.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/marketing-psychology-localiq-testimonials_0-1.png" alt="how to use marketing psychology to influence purchasing decisions—example of dedicated testimonial page" width="800" height="404" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<h4>Adorn your website with testimonials&#8230;</h4>
<p>Don&#8217;t just reserve these for your testimonials page. Include them in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/04/landing-page-trends">landing pages</a> and homepage, too—ideally with headshots to add more credibility.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/marketing-psychology-testimonials-on-homepage.png" alt="marketing psychology - testimonials on homepage" width="714" height="382" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59532" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/marketing-psychology-testimonials-on-homepage.png 714w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/marketing-psychology-testimonials-on-homepage-480x257.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 714px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>&#8230;and your ads</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/03/testimonial-advertising">Testimonials</a> and reviews make for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/01/12/how-to-write-great-advertising-copy">compelling ad copy</a> as well. In the ad below, the copy <em>is </em>the creative for the ad.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/testimonial-ads-examples-calm.png" alt="testimonial ads examples - calm" width="600" height="573" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58137" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/testimonial-ads-examples-calm.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/testimonial-ads-examples-calm-480x458.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You can use our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/03/testimonial-advertising">testimonial advertising examples</a> for inspiration and ideas.</p>
<h4>Highlight endorsements from popular brands</h4>
<p>You may also want to include the logos, or in the example below, faces, of any big names or brands that use your product (with their permission, of course).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/marketing-psychology-social-proof-mobile-monkey-1.png" alt="how to use marketing psychology to influence purchasing decisions—picture of influencer giving testimonial" width="800" height="423" class="aligncenter" /><br />
Another similar option would be to list major media outlets that have featured your product. Seeing these familiar faces and names endorsing your business helps potential customers to feel confident and secure that you deliver results.</p>
<h4>Include stamps of approval</h4>
<p>If you have partnerships, awards, or other <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/27/trust-signals">trust signals</a> that speak to your credibility, add those too!<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-social-proof-badges.png" alt="" width="720" height="284" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59672" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-social-proof-badges.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-social-proof-badges-480x189.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Use the numbers to get more subscribers</h4>
<p>You don’t always need a prominent name to build trust and <a href="/blog/ws/2014/08/05/increase-email-signups">get signups</a> for your offers. There’s also the “wisdom of the crowd” approach, where you can boast that a large group of people is using your products or resources.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/marketing-psychology-wisdom-of-crowd-1.png" alt="how to use marketing psychology to influence purchasing decisions—website copy boasting 5000 members" width="500" height="500" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<p><a id="reciprocity"></a></p>
<h3>5. The reciprocity effect</h3>
<p>Two wrongs don&#8217;t make a right, but it certainly <em>feels</em> right&#8230; am I right? Reciprocity is our human tendency to respond to a gesture with one of similar nature, which of course goes for positive behaviors too.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-reciprocity-effect.png" alt="marketing psychology - the reciprocity effect" width="529" height="583" class="aligncenter wp-image-61424" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-reciprocity-effect.png 529w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-reciprocity-effect-480x529.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 529px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what positive reciprocity looks like in marketing.</p>
<h4>Offer exceptional customer service</h4>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s important to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">proactively ask for reviews</a>, but if you focus on providing an awesome experience for your customers, you can bet that you&#8217;ll organically collect them. Even though it&#8217;s &#8220;your job&#8221; to serve them and their job to pay you, the extra effort you make to meet their needs inspires the extra effort they&#8217;ll make to write you a review—or even through a little something extra in their cart or to their order.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/most-popular-social-media-platforms-linkedin-community.png" alt="most popular social media platforms - linkedin post example" width="400" height="659" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54135" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/most-popular-social-media-platforms-linkedin-community.png 400w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/most-popular-social-media-platforms-linkedin-community-182x300.png 182w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<h4>Provide free (valuable) information and education</h4>
<p>This is <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/13/content-marketing-strategy">content marketing</a> and SEO in a nutshell. No, your readers aren&#8217;t going to reciprocate by providing free education back to you, but let&#8217;s say they&#8217;re deciding between your company and a competitor, and you both have great reviews. Which company do you think they’ll feel more inclined to choose? The one that has been generously providing resources all along&#8230;or the one with only social proof?<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/marketing-psychology-influence-decisions-reciprocity-1.png" alt="how to use marketing psychology to influence purchasing decisions—reciprocity—localiq free learning hub" width="800" height="497" class="aligncenter" /><em>LOCALiQ&#8217;s <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marketing Lab</a> is a free learning hub for local business owners and marketers.</em><br />
And let&#8217;s not forget that Google reciprocates quality content which higher rankings.</p>
<h4>Offer free tools and trials</h4>
<p>In the B2B SaaS industry, a great example of reciprocity would be offering a free trial of your software or a free tool. WordStream, of course, has their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords">Free Google Ads Performance Grader</a>, which performs over 40 hours of audit work for you in a matter of minutes. Again, if it comes down to deciding between one agency and another, the buyer may be more inclined to reciprocate your free and valuable offerings with their business.</p>

<a id="exposure"></a></p>
<h3>6. The mere exposure effect</h3>
<p>Social psychologist <a href="https://www.psy.lmu.de/allg2/download/audriemmo/ws1011/mere_exposure_effect.pdf">Robert Zajonc</a> performed several experiments in the 1960s and found that “mere repeated exposure of an individual to a stimulus is a sufficient condition for the enhancement of his attitude toward it.”<br />
In other words, familiarity leads to preference, even on the subconscious level.&lt;</p>
<h4><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-mere-exposure-effect.png" alt="marketing psychology - the mere exposure effect" width="503" height="568" class="aligncenter wp-image-61425" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-mere-exposure-effect.png 503w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-mere-exposure-effect-480x542.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 503px, 100vw" /></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/23/google-display-ads">Display ads</a> are often dismissed as an ineffective ad type because their click-through rates are so low, but that’s not their point. Display ads give your business exposure. Mere exposure!<br />
The more exposure to your business, the more familiar your audience becomes with it, and the more familiar it becomes with it, the more they will trust, engage with, and prefer it over competitors. Combine this with the commitment and consistency effect you’ve got yourself some loyal customers.<br />
This is why brand awareness is so important. Indeed, display ads can improve click-through and conversion rates on all your other ads and campaigns. Hence the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/14/view-through-conversions">view-through conversion metric</a>.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-funnel.png" alt="ad types for each stage of the marketing funnel" width="600" height="481" class="aligncenter wp-image-61426 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-funnel.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-funnel-480x385.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Use retargeting ads to increase CTR</h4>
<p>But click-through rates aren&#8217;t low for all display ads. In fact, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/13/retargeting-ad-ideas">retargeting ads</a> can have click-through rates 2-3 times higher than regular display ads. Just watch your ad frequency so you<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/marketing-psychology-influence-decisions-brand-affinity-1.png" alt="marketing-psychology-influence-decisions-brand-affinity" width="800" height="432" class="aligncenter" /><br />
But watch your frequency because if your ad keeps aggressively following a prospect on the internet, you can quickly become that annoying brand that doesn’t care about privacy. An appropriate <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1990-00422-001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay between exposures</a> gives them time to settle in so the repetitions are more effective.</p>
<h4>Send the same message across all channels</h4>
<p>You can also repeat your messaging and <a href="/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">unique value proposition</a> (USP) across your brand assets, including your website, blog posts, <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/25/email-newsletter-ideas">newsletters</a>, ads, and other touchpoints. As a prospect becomes more and more familiar with your USP, the more appealing it becomes. And this is why including an array of channels and mediums in your <a href="/blog/ws/2020/11/23/content-marketing-trends">content marketing </a>strategy is so important.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/psychology-copywriting-illusory-truth-thoughtspot.png" alt="" width="631" height="578" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50648" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/psychology-copywriting-illusory-truth-thoughtspot.png 631w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/psychology-copywriting-illusory-truth-thoughtspot-480x440.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 631px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Ahrefs CMO <a href="https://twitter.com/timsoulo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Soulo</a> recently mentioned how their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/24/blogging-tips">blog</a>, receiving close to 400k monthly visitors (as per their own tool), facilitates the mere exposure effect.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-mere-exposure-tweet.png" alt="marketing psychology - tweet about mere exposure effect" width="499" height="317" class="aligncenter wp-image-59674" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-mere-exposure-tweet.png 499w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-mere-exposure-tweet-480x305.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 499px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Promote your content</h4>
<p>The mere exposure effect also makes a strong case for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/26/content-promotion-strategies">promoting your content </a>on social media (and encouraging others to promote it too), especially your guides and blog posts. You can share the same content more than once—just make sure you allow enough time in between postings.</p>
<h4>Have a brand style</h4>
<p>While brand awareness measures how many people know about your brand, brand recognition measures how quickly a person can associate a piece of content they see or hear with your brand.<br />
To build brand recognition, you should have an appealing, eye-catching logo as well as a brand style guide. Choose just a few colors and fonts to use consistently in your content so people can build automatic associations between that look and feel and your business.<br />
<a id="pygmalion"></a></p>
<h3>7. The Pygmalion effect</h3>
<p>This last <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/20/ppc-ad-copy">psychological tactic</a> can be used both on your customers and your own team.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.edutopia.org/blog/pygmalion-effect-communicating-higher-expectations-ben-solomon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pygmalion effect</a>, also known as the Rosenthal effect, says that if you, or others, believe something to be true of yourself, it will eventually become so. So if a teacher holds his or her students to high standards with the belief that they are capable of meeting them, the students are highly likely to perform better. Similarly, setting high standards for your employees with enthusiasm can have the same effect.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-the-pygmalion-effect.png" alt="marketing psychology - the pgymalion effect" width="573" height="475" class="aligncenter wp-image-59677" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-the-pygmalion-effect.png 573w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marketing-psychology-the-pygmalion-effect-480x398.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 573px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Unify your team and improve the customer experience</h4>
<p>This is why identifying the <a href="/blog/ws/2012/12/11/core-values">core values</a> for your brand—and keeping those top-of-mind with your team—is so important. This gives individuals a clear set of expectations and qualities to strive for and incorporate into everything they do. The more positive feedback they receive, the more and more they will truly exemplify those values. This not only makes for a unified team, but also makes for a consistent and extraordinary customer experience.</p>
<p>Indeed, expectations can shape reality.</p>
<h4>Create a positive feedback loop with your customers</h4>
<p>You can also apply this tactic directly to your audience. By conveying that a higher level of performance is attainable, a better version of themselves is on the horizon, or that they can become the best in their field, you encourage them to act in a way that aligns with those beliefs.</p>
<p>These actions might start out by downloading your content or<a href="/blog/ws/2016/10/19/get-more-instagram-followers"> following you on social media</a>. The more confidence they have that they can achieve their goal with your help, and that they’re already on the way to doing it, the more likely they are to be a customer. Even better, as they achieve their goals over time, they can become <a href="/blog/ws/2016/11/10/customer-loyalty">loyal customers</a>.</p>
<p>Hold your team to high standards and show your customers that they are capable of achieving their goals, and success will flow from there.</p>
<h2>Psychology and marketing: use them together!</h2>
<p>At the end of the day, psychology and marketing go hand-in-hand naturally, but there are ways to use psychology intentionally to improve your marketing results. Just remember, focus on building great products and earning the trust of your audience through responsible marketing strategies. It’s a combination proven to work better in the long term.</p>
<p>To recap, here are the marketing psychology strategies to influence buyer decisions:</p>
<ol>

<li>Break your content up into digestible tidbits</li>

<li>Unify your team and improve the customer experience</li>
<li>Create a positive feedback loop with your customers</li>
