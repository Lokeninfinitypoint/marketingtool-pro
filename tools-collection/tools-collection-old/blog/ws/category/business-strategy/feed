										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Understanding the small business marketing landscape is crucial if you want to be competitive and stand out.</p>
<p>What are your competitors doing? How are they investing their marketing budgets? What new trends and tactics are they planning to try in 2026?</p>
<p>LocaliQ has the answer to all these questions and more in our second-annual Small Business Marketing Trends Report for 2026, including tons of data and insights from over 300 small businesses!</p>
<p>If you want to see the full report, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-marketing-trends-report-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jump on over to LocaliQ</a> or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/smb-marketing-trends-report?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2026SmallBusinessMarketingTrendsReport_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links">download it here</a>. And keep reading for 10 key takeaways from the report you need to know to inform your 2026 planning.</p>
<h2>10 biggest takeaways from LocaliQ’s 2026 Small Business Marketing Trends Report</h2>
<p>We rounded up 10 fast facts from the report to help you understand the small business marketing landscape and make the most of your 2026 planning.</p>
<h3>1. Most SMBs <em>still</em> aren’t investing in paid search</h3>
<p>According to the report, only 45% of SMBs are investing in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/search-advertising">search advertising</a>—up from 40% last year, which means the majority of small businesses are still not running ads on top search engines like Google and Bing.</p>
<p>But, more SMBs are investing in SEO than last year—53% compared to 39% in 2024, which means small businesses are primed to capture high-intent, local searchers.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-channels.webp" alt="smb marketing channels 2025 vs 2024" width="1500" height="1688" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95196" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-channels.webp 1500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-channels-1280x1440.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-channels-980x1103.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-channels-480x540.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Running Google Ads already and worried you&#8217;re wasting spend?</strong> Find out with a free, instant audit &gt;&gt; <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Google Ads Performance Grader</a></p>
<h3>2. But SMBs running paid search are satisfied with results</h3>
<p>When it comes to how satisfied small businesses are with their marketing investments, search advertising was one of the top tactics they were pleased with—behind video marketing and advertising and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reputation-management">reputation management</a>.</p>
<p>Search advertising is effective at <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/12/how-to-generate-leads">driving leads</a> and can be pretty easy to measure and tie back to ROI, so it’s not a surprise to see it so high on the list.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-results-satisfaction.webp" alt="smb marketing channel satisfaction 2025" width="1500" height="1398" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95198" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-results-satisfaction.webp 1500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-results-satisfaction-1280x1193.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-results-satisfaction-980x913.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-results-satisfaction-480x447.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1500px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>3. Low-cost strategies have grown in importance</h3>
<p>Last year, low-cost marketing strategies like listings, reputation management, and content marketing were fairly low on the list of channels small businesses were investing in. But, in 2025, more SMBs are investing here.</p>
<p>As more small businesses reel in spending while keeping an eye on the economy (more on this later), it makes sense that low-cost or basically free strategies would become more important. Small businesses are looking for ways to stretch their budgets, and listings, reputation management, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-marketing">content marketing</a>—along with SEO—can help them get in front of local searchers looking to make a purchase.</p>
<p>One low-cost strategy small businesses still aren’t investing in, though, is website chat. This could be an opportunity for small businesses to provide a contact method that <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-08-27-gartner-survey-finds-self-service-and-live-chat-will-surpass-traditional-channels-as-top-customer-service-technologies-by-2027" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most consumers actually prefer</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Looking for more low-cost ways to promote your business?</strong> Download now &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite30BestWaysToPromote.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Marketing_The30BestWaysToPromoteYourBusiness_Download">30+ Ways to Promote Your Business (On Any Budget!)</a></p>
<h3>4. Facebook continues to be the most popular social platform SMBs are using for marketing</h3>
<p>Social media marketing and advertising are, unsurprisingly, still big hits for businesses, with 66% investing in social media marketing and 56% investing in social ads.</p>
<p>Facebook was the most popular social platform for SMBs to use for marketing for the second year in a row.</p>
<p>Of those businesses investing in social media marketing or social ads, a whopping 91% (up from 80% last year) were doing so on Facebook, followed by Instagram and LinkedIn.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-social-media-channels.webp" alt="smb social media platforms used 2025 vs 2024" width="1500" height="1722" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95199" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-social-media-channels.webp 1500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-social-media-channels-1280x1469.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-social-media-channels-980x1125.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-social-media-channels-480x551.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">Social media marketing</a> and advertising continues to be a winning strategy for small businesses—it’s a great place to engage and grow an audience while ads make it easy to expand and find similar prospects.</p>
<h3>5. Smaller businesses have small budgets (unsurprisingly)</h3>
<p>I mean, this is kind of obvious. But understanding the typical <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing budget</a> for your SMB competitors is really handy. LocaliQ found that less than 10% of SMBs had no budget and 52% (up from 38% in 2024) had monthly budgets under $2,500.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-budget.webp" alt="2025 smb marketing budgets by monthly spend" width="1500" height="1748" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95200" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-budget.webp 1500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-budget-1280x1492.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-budget-980x1142.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-budget-480x559.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And because the report was able to break down marketing budgets by business size, we were able to see a clear correlation between business size and budget. Which, again, isn’t necessarily a surprise, but it should be validating to small businesses who are doing so much with not a lot.</p>
<p>This just shows the importance of adopting those low-cost strategies we mentioned earlier and taking advantage of creative marketing ideas to get in front of potential customers.</p>

<h3>6. They’re also less likely to have dedicated marketing support</h3>
<p>The smaller the business, the less likely they are to have staff dedicated to marketing. Which does make mastering marketing strategies a challenge—those often take some kind of time commitment.</p>
<p>What’s also interesting is that this year’s report found that fewer SMBs were working with a marketing partner (only 34% in 2025 compared to 60% in 2024!)—meaning these businesses are taking on the majority of the marketing work themselves, even if they have no or few employees dedicated to marketing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-agency-partner.webp" alt="2025 smbs working with marketing partner" width="1500" height="1331" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95201" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-agency-partner.webp 1500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-agency-partner-1280x1136.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-agency-partner-980x870.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-agency-partner-480x426.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This may explain why low-cost strategies like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/01/business-directory-listings">listings</a> and reputation management were so well-represented; they’re often quicker to get off the ground (even if they may require more back-end work later) and don’t require a lot of time or budget to start driving results.</p>
<h3>7. Most SMBs are using AI</h3>
<p>Most small businesses are fully on board the AI train. 56% of SMBs are using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-uses-in-marketing">AI for some part of their marketing</a>! Most are using it to save time and generate ideas for activities like content creation, design, social media management, and more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-ai.webp" alt="smb ai use 2025" width="1500" height="1296" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95202" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-ai.webp 1500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-ai-1280x1106.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-ai-980x847.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-ai-480x415.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1500px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>8. The economy continues to be a concern</h3>
<p>66% of SMBs noted that economic uncertainty will be their biggest challenge in 2026, up from 48% in 2025.</p>
<p>This isn’t shocking as the economy has remained unstable over the last few years and the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-businesses-and-tariffs-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduction of tariffs in 2025</a> has had many SMBs hesitant to make changes to their budgets or spending behaviors.</p>
<p>Not only was the economy the biggest challenge SMBs noted, but it was also the main reason they were planning to decrease their budgets in 2026.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-challenges.webp" alt="smb biggest challenges for businesses 2026" width="1500" height="1393" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95203" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-challenges.webp 1500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-challenges-1280x1189.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-challenges-980x910.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-challenges-480x446.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1500px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>9. But small businesses aren’t planning to cut budgets in 2026</h3>
<p>While the economy is the main factor behind SMBs decreasing budgets in 2026, only 8% are planning to do so. 54% of SMBs are planning to keep their budgets the same and 39% plan to increase in 2026.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-budget-investment.webp" alt="marketing budget planning for 2026" width="1500" height="2058" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95204" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-budget-investment.webp 1500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-budget-investment-1280x1756.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-budget-investment-980x1345.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-budget-investment-480x659.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This is promising, despite economic concerns—with SMBs planning to either maintain or increase budgets, they have a better chance at driving results and investing in the right marketing strategies to grow their businesses.</p>
<h3>10. Customer referrals remains the greatest source for new leads (but getting new leads is still challenging)</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/get-more-customers-like-best-customer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Getting new customers</a> continues to be a top challenge for small businesses, with 59% saying it will be one of their top challenges for 2026, up from 45% in 2025. This is something we hear time and time again—generating leads and getting new customers is hard, especially with limited budget and resources.</p>
<p>But when it comes to getting new customers, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/14/referral-program-ideas">referrals</a> continues to lead the pack, followed by organic and direct website traffic, and digital marketing and online advertising.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-new-lead-sources.webp" alt="sources for new leads in 2025 by smbs" width="1500" height="1466" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95205" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-new-lead-sources.webp 1500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-new-lead-sources-1280x1251.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-new-lead-sources-980x958.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-new-lead-sources-480x469.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This speaks to the importance of investing in the right strategy to continue bringing in loyal customers and reaching new audiences where they’re spending time online.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve really gotten into marketing podcasts lately as my preferred mode of learning. They’re so convenient to listen to while walking the dog or taking a road trip.</p>
<p>The problem is choice overload. There are so many options that it&#8217;s hard to decide which show to cue up next.</p>
<p>So, I asked marketers to name their favorite marketing podcasts. The only rule is that they had to be shows from approachable, ground-level marketers (no big names).</p>
<p>To make it even easier to pick your next pod, I asked the hosts for a little background on their shows, the big takeaway they’ve learned from producing them, and which episode stands out as a must-listen. Enjoy!</p>

<h2>5 of the best marketing podcasts, according to the pros</h2>
<p>I’m impressed with the variety of podcasts people proposed. There are quick listens for bite-sized takeaways on specific tactics and deep dives into big topics that are shaping marketing right now.</p>
<div id="seo-office-hours"></div>
<h3>1. SEO office hours</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.goodsignals.com/seo-office-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO Office Hours</a> is a weekly, one-hour podcast that brings together some of the smartest <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">search engine optimization</a> pros in the business. But what’s really cool is that it’s a Q&amp;A format recorded live from Zoom, complete with an audience full of the questions we all have about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google">getting found through search</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-office-hours.webp" alt="Best marketing podcasts - SEO office hours." width="937" height="459" class="aligncenter wp-image-93769 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-office-hours.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-office-hours-480x235.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.goodsignals.com/seo-office-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>If a live Q&amp;A chat about SEO reminds you of John Mueller’s old Webmaster Hangouts, that’s intentional. “When John stopped, I didn’t want that resource to disappear,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelchidzey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Chidzey</a>, co-host of SEO Office Hours and CEO of <a href="https://www.goodsignals.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Good Signals</a>. “I reached out and asked if he’d be okay with me giving it a go, and he’s been incredibly supportive ever since.”</p>
<p>Michael tuned into Mueller’s sessions religiously. “They weren’t just Q&amp;A sessions. They were a lifeline for anyone struggling with a traffic drop, wanting to sound out a new idea, or discussing some sort of change or update.”</p>
<p>With Mueller’s blessing, he worked to create a similarly supportive atmosphere, but with a collaborative mindset. “Of course, I’m not John Mueller from Google, so I built the show in my own way,” Michael told me. “I invited special guests to bring their perspectives. The first was a good friend of mine, Jo Juliana Turnbull. She was so good that I asked her to come back as a regular host. From there, we evolved into a panel format with me, Jo, and two rotating guests.”</p>
<p>For Michael’s co-host, Jo, it’s the lack of barriers that makes the show special. “We welcome first-time speakers, we answer all<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/2025-local-seo-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> SEO questions</a>, there is no such thing as a silly question,” she said. “People feel welcome, and we have a regular group of attendees from all over the world.”</p>
<p>The live format plays a big role in the podcast, since it lets the audience run the show. “As a host, I’m constantly watching the audience’s expressions: puzzled looks, nods of agreement, those moments of real engagement,” Michael said. “That dictates whether we dig deeper into a topic, clarify something, or swiftly move on to the next question.”</p>
<p>“Today, SEO Office Hours feels less like a podcast and more like a weekly gathering of some of the smartest, most generous people in the industry,” Michael added. “And honestly, even if I weren’t running it, I’d still be there every Friday.”</p>
<h4>One big takeaway</h4>
<p>The lesson for Michael is that consistency wins the day. “When we started SEO Office Hours, I set a target: every Friday for three months, no matter what,” he said. “Without that commitment, it would have been easy to stop after the first or second episode. But when giving up isn’t an option, you focus on making it better and better—and on optimizing your time to keep it going.”</p>
<p>“I think that mindset applies to everything in marketing: whether it’s launching a newsletter, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-media-strategy">building a social presence</a>, or implementing a content strategy. Consistency compounds. The longer you stick with it, the more valuable it becomes.”</p>
<h4>The past episode to have in your playlist</h4>
<p>Michael said they’ve begun rotating in occasional co-hosts, and that’s expanded the show’s ability to deliver diverse ideas. “One of my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4qHN3pqZtU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favorite episodes</a> was when I sat in the audience myself and Yordan Dimitrov co-hosted with Jo,” he said. “It was amazing to experience the show from the audience’s perspective and see just how valuable—and fun—it is when you’re on the other side.”</p>

<h3>2. Market Movers: Building Brands &amp; Links with Linkifi</h3>
<p>There’s nothing niche about <a href="https://www.marketmoverspod.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Market Movers: Building Brands &amp; Links</a>. Each week, the show’s co-hosts (and <a href="https://www.linkifi.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linkifi</a> co-founders) <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-panteli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christopher Panteli</a> and Nick Biggs invite guests with wildly different backgrounds and takes on the world of marketing.</p>
<p>That variety means we listeners get tips on<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-in-marketing"> making AI work for marketing</a> one week, and the next we learn how to keep overtly salesy “knobheads” out of our online community.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-market-movers.webp" alt="Best marketing podcasts - Market Movers Podcast" width="779" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93770 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-market-movers.webp 779w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-market-movers-480x370.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 779px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://marketmoverspod.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>“We’re broader than a lot of marketing shows,” Christopher explained. “We don’t stick to a narrow niche. We cover a wide range of topics and invite a variety of guests. A lot of them we’ve actually met in person, often at conferences. Having that prior connection really breaks down the third wall and makes the conversations more open.”</p>
<p>That open exchange of ideas that happens when professionals meet is exactly the vibe Christopher and Nick curate on their show. “We were doing a lot of networking at conferences and kept meeting interesting people with great stories and insights,” Christopher said. “You pick up so many useful tidbits at conferences that it almost feels like a waste not to share them.”</p>
<p>My favorite part of Market Movers is the enthusiasm Nick and Christopher bring to learning right along with the audience. “We don’t pretend to know everything, and we’re genuinely curious,” Christopher said. “When a guest talks about something we don’t fully understand, we’re not afraid to ask more questions and dig deeper.”</p>
<h4>One big takeaway</h4>
<p>If you find yourself stuck in the planning phase of projects for too long, you’re not alone. Running the Market Movers podcast has helped Christopher get past his analysis paralysis.</p>
<p>“One of the biggest mindset shifts I’ve had is that you just have to test things and get them out there,” Michael said. “You can plan forever, but real value comes from launching and learning in real-time. Whether it’s a new funnel, an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-nurturing-emails">email sequence</a>, or anything else, it’s better to put it live, get feedback, and make changes on the fly.”</p>
<p>“Some of the best results I’ve seen have come from launching something that flopped, tweaking it, relaunching it, and eventually figuring out what worked and why,” he continued. “That’s been the biggest shift for me, to stop waiting for perfect. Just launch, learn, and refine.”</p>
<h4>The past episode to have in your playlist</h4>
<p>“Personally, the solo <a href="https://www.marketmoverspod.com/e/the-7-figure-deal-tim-stoddart-s-risky-bet-on-copyblogger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview I did with Tim Stoddart</a> really stuck with me,” Christopher said. “His story is powerful. He’s overcome a lot and achieved a huge amount, and I think he’s in a really good place now. That episode definitely resonated with me, and I’d recommend giving it a listen.”</p>

<h3>3. The Marketing Mindset Podcast</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/colby-flood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colby Flood</a> prioritizes an “Education First” philosophy at his agency,<a href="https://www.brighterclick.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> BrighterClick</a>. That mantra drives<a href="https://www.brighterclick.com/marketing-mindset-podcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> The Marketing Mindset</a>—a podcast that gets in the weeds of ground-level marketing with people who live and breathe it every day.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-marketing-mindset.webp" alt="Best marketing podcasts - Marketing Mindset" width="835" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93771 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-marketing-mindset.webp 835w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-marketing-mindset-480x345.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 835px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfney7s8PpE8dHdI296ujqFIDv4Z4ydlO" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>“What I think sets Marketing Mindset apart is the intent behind it,” Colby said. “Everything we share is driven by a single priority, which is helping people grow and learn, both personally and in their business. That means keeping the content transparent, trustworthy, and free from hidden agendas.”</p>
<p>I love how they dig deep into a specific topic in each episode. Look over the list and you’ll see titles like “How to start <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/tiktok-marketing-for-small-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling on TikTok</a> Shops” and “Creating a Facebook Ads Creative Report Template.” There’s even a seven-part series dedicated to building a high-level creative strategy process.</p>
<p>“My vision for the podcast has evolved from being a place to communicate with people already well-known in the industry, to also finding the people working in the weeds to have them share their expertise, and help build their personal brands,” Colby said.</p>
<p>“Our goal is simple,” he added. “Keep the main priority the main priority, which is delivering honest, actionable insights that help people succeed.”</p>
<h4>One big takeaway</h4>
<p>I’m guilty of reading a marketing success story and forgetting all the background context that led to the result. Colby said that getting the full story from his guests reminds him of all the turbulence that happens before a smooth landing.</p>
<p>“One of the most refreshing things I have learned from hosting the show is that a lot of growth lessons come in hindsight,” he said. “Yes, there are people who can plan and execute exactly as intended, but more often the real breakthroughs are understood retrospectively.”</p>
<p>“On social media, it can seem like every success story was the result of a flawless plan,” Colby explained. “People share how they did X, Y, or Z, and it led to a big win, and it can give the impression that it was all intentional from the start. In reality, many of those wins become clear only when you look back and analyze what actually drove the results.”</p>
<p>“Through my own experience and countless guest conversations, I have realized the value of post-implementation reviews. Taking the time to reflect on what truly worked and why can turn everyday actions into long-term growth lessons.”</p>
<h4>The past episode to have in your playlist</h4>
<p>“One episode that really stands out to me was my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI9jscqQ1Qo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with Ben</a>, the CEO of True Classic,” Colby shared. “Before that conversation, I was a meticulous planner. I would map out the year, then the quarter, then the month, break that into weeks, and even down to daily tasks. Planning has value, but Ben really shifted my perspective on execution.”</p>
<p>“He emphasized the importance of focusing on what needs to be done today or this week, especially in a fast-moving business. Things change so quickly that planning too far ahead can sometimes work against you, particularly in a startup.”</p>
<p>“Looking back, I think my heavy focus on planning was a bit of a defense mechanism to avoid failure. But real growth comes from failing fast, learning quickly, and pivoting when needed. That episode helped me embrace the idea of spending less time perfecting a plan and more time acting on it.”</p>

<h3>4. The Marketing Chatroom</h3>
<p>If you’re looking for a little fresh air in the sometimes stuffy confines of digital marketing, I highly recommend giving <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9cBWyQM0Rb4_eMtKTsSPxBD1eOnYy0go" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Marketing Chatroom</a> a listen. Host <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kayla-bryant-sacramento/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kayla Bryant</a>, general manager of <a href="https://twotreesppc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Two Trees PPC</a>, brings a vibe that she describes as “upbeat, slightly silly, and that should feel like you’re talking to a friend.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-marketing-chatroom.webp" alt="Best marketing podcasts - The Marketing Chatroom" width="814" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93772 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-marketing-chatroom.webp 814w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-marketing-chatroom-480x354.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 814px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9cBWyQM0Rb4_eMtKTsSPxBD1eOnYy0go" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>“Based on what I hear from guests and listeners, my podcast is more approachable and casual,” she said. “I talk with marketers about their real challenges and unique approaches toward success in their careers.”</p>
<p>Kayla and her guests get into the tactical side of marketing often, but the best bits for me are the episodes that explore soft—but critical—<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/07/marketing-skills">marketing skills</a> like empathy and creativity. It’s interesting to learn how people in the field put those ideas into practice.</p>
<p>“I thought it would be cool to have a platform to highlight insights from marketing professionals in a variety of industries, roles, and places in their careers,” she said. “I&#8217;ve learned that as a host, I don&#8217;t have to be perfect or have a formal plan or specific questions prepared. As long as I have a guest with a story to tell and a general episode theme in mind- being open to a genuine conversation about something the guest is passionate about or expert at produces the best results.”</p>
<h4>One big takeaway</h4>
<p>Remote work has plenty of benefits, but sometimes it can feel a little isolating. Kayla said that listening to her guests confirms that a collaborative attitude is still critical for marketing success.</p>
<p>“Across the board, through my conversations, I&#8217;ve noticed that the most successful marketers (in my opinion) are those who have a true team mindset,” she explained. “They&#8217;ve become leaders in the space because they rise by lifting up others. They all started in the trenches doing the work, but they&#8217;ve found opportunities to improve upon their own work and taught others along the way. They aren&#8217;t afraid to share their knowledge alongside their challenges.”</p>
<h4>The past episode to have in your playlist</h4>
<p>“I struggle to not label every episode as my favorite, because each one is so interesting and unique,” Kayla told me. Fair enough, I’m not sure I can pick favorites from my work, either.</p>
<p>But if I were picking a place to start in the Marketing Chatroom, I’d say the<a href="https://youtu.be/mAZfQrUynoM?si=_wF4S936V0mkCJnp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> chat with David Young</a> on the power of storytelling. Storytelling has become almost cliché these days, but David does a great job of grounding it in results.</p>
<div id="fm"></div>
<h3>5. Plugin.fm</h3>
<p>Where many podcasts cover marketing broadly across every industry,<a href="http://plugin.fm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Plugin.fm</a> stays narrow and deep by helping practitioners build a software business to navigate various growth challenges.</p>
<p>“Most marketing podcasts are marketers talking to other marketers,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/goranmirkovic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goran Mirkovic</a>, the chief marketing officer at <a href="https://freemius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freemius</a>, who co-hosts the show with Patrick Rauland. “Ours is different because it speaks directly to indie software makers and encourages them to take bigger swings with their products.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-pluginfm.webp" alt="Best marketing podcasts - Plugin.fm" width="937" height="608" class="aligncenter wp-image-93773 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-pluginfm.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-pluginfm-480x311.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="http://plugin.fm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>Originally, the show was a great way for the Freemius folks to learn about their <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-pain-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">target audience’s struggles</a> and to build relationships with industry leaders. “The podcast gave us a reason to sit down with them for an hour and ask the questions we genuinely cared about,” Goran said.</p>
<p>As they compiled more episodes, though, Goran said they noticed the library had a different purpose. “[It became] more about co-creating useful resources with industry experts for indie founders and small software teams who don’t have mentors or investors guiding them. What began as a learning tool has grown into a library of practical stories and strategies from real builders.”</p>
<p>While marketing is a core component of the show’s topics, it also seeks to solve other hurdles like pricing experiments, subscription headaches, and customer support struggles.“These are the challenges that actually keep small teams up at night,” Goran said. “Our goal is to inspire and educate, not to sell.”</p>
<h4>One big takeaway</h4>
<p>Software startups can get caught up in the race to grow fast. So can we marketers. Goran said the conversations on Plugin.fm have reminded him that having a strong foundation is more important than growing sky-high too fast.</p>
<p>“Stop chasing ‘scale’ too early,” he said. “A lot of our guests reinforced the idea that you don’t need 10,000 customers. What you need is 50 loyal ones who give feedback, renew, and tell others about you. That shift in mindset is freeing. Instead of obsessing over growth hacks, focus on building something so useful that a small group sticks with you. Scale comes later if you get that right.”</p>
<h4>The past episode to have in your playlist</h4>
<p>As a content marketer who’s always riding the tumultuous waves of SEO, Goran’s pick for one of his favorite episodes of Plugin.fm hit home for me.</p>
<p>“One that really stood out was our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2zgI2b6q44" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conversation with Rand Fishkin</a>,” Goran said. “He’s someone everyone associates with SEO, yet he told us that SparkToro gets fewer than 50 visits a month from Google. This is a guy whose work has been cited in Congress and even by the US president, but <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/03/organic-traffic">organic search</a> barely moves the needle for his business. That hit our audience hard because it showed how much the game has changed and why you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-marketing-pros-drive-traffic">can’t rely only on Google for growth</a>.”</p>

<h2>3 more marketing podcasts for your learning pleasure</h2>
<p>I got so many great recommendations for this list that I couldn’t expand on all of them. Here are a handful of additional marketing podcasts worthy of your next long drive.</p>
<div id="content-briefly"></div>
<h3>6. Content, Briefly</h3>
<p><a href="https://podcast.superpath.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Content, Briefly</a> is one of my personal favorite marketing podcasts, so I was glad when another marketer suggested it. It’s a weekly interview show that focuses on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/13/content-marketing-strategy">content marketing</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcast-wordstream-content-briefly.webp" alt="best marketing podcasts - Content, Briefly" width="702" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93784 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcast-wordstream-content-briefly.webp 702w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcast-wordstream-content-briefly-480x410.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 702px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://podcast.superpath.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></p>
<p>What I like about this one is that hosts Jimmy Daly and Eric Doty ask guests about the specific tactics and tools they use to do their jobs. So while there’s plenty of friendly chatting to enjoy, you also get some specific takeaways to apply.</p>
<div id="the-artificial-intelligence-show"></div>
<h3>7. The Artificial Intelligence Show</h3>
<p>For good and bad, AI is an absolute wrecking ball in<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-marketing-trends-2025"> marketing</a>. There are a few things it hasn’t changed significantly. That’s why I’m so grateful that hosts Paul Roetzer and Mike Kaput tackle these tumultuous topics in<a href="https://www.marketingaiinstitute.com/podcast-showcase" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> The Artificial Intelligence Show</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcast-wordstream-artificial-intelligence-show.webp" alt="best marketing podcasts - The Artificial Intelligence Show" width="937" height="391" class="aligncenter wp-image-93785 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcast-wordstream-artificial-intelligence-show.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcast-wordstream-artificial-intelligence-show-480x200.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>

<p>The show breaks down AI news, with a strong bent towards how it affects marketing. Even though it’s a current events format, there is a lot of actionable information you can use. For example, Paul and Mike often discuss the impacts of new AI tech that is useful in marketing.</p>

<h3>8. Breaking B2B</h3>
<p>I was lucky enough to gather some of<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samdunning/?originalSubdomain=uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Sam Dunning’s</a> wisdom in a past post on<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-trends-2025"> SEO trends</a>.

<h2>The best marketing podcasts in 2025</h2>
<p>I can’t say which podcast is best, but I can say which podcasts I think you should prioritize. It’s the ones that talk about the challenges you have. Scroll through their playlists, look up a few of the guests, and read some of the intros. You’ll get a sense of what they cover.</p>
<p>I also highly recommend reaching out to the podcasters. Ask about their show, share ideas, and suggest guests. We’re all communicators trying to make a connection, after all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you start a small business, you often have to step outside your comfort zone. You know your core business inside and out. But launching a brand requires you to take on other tasks, like marketing, that may feel foreign and, frankly, intimidating.</p>
<p>Creating a small business logo is one of the earliest and most crucial marketing decisions you’ll make. And for those small business owners who aren’t designers by trade, there are two ways to approach the task.</p>
<p>One is to hire a graphic designer. These professionals understand the ins and outs of color, fonts, proportion, and other design theories that help them effortlessly create a clean, effective logo. Other business owners opt to go it alone, relying on design tools to help them craft their logo.</p>
<p>Regardless of the path you choose, this guide can help. You’ll get a primer on logo design—what it is, why it matters, and basic design principles and tools to inform your process.</p>

<h2>Why create a small business logo?</h2>
<p>Humans are wired to process visual information. Our brains process images <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6125597/#CR12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60,000</a> times faster than text, and 90% of information transmitted to the brain is visual.</p>
<p>If you want your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">brand to become instantly recognizable to your audience</a>, you need a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-logo-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">logo</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/black-star-coffee-logo-on-cup.webp" alt="black star coffee logo on coffee cup" width="900" height="544" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93617" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/black-star-coffee-logo-on-cup.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/black-star-coffee-logo-on-cup-480x290.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>When you see a black coffee cup on the streets near <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CXbHIdMod-Z/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MTFsaThkcXI2OXprdw==" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this cafe</a>, you know immediately it came from Black Star.</em></p>
<p>As your logo becomes more familiar to your audience, it becomes like a familiar face in a crowd—an instantly recognizable presence, and a source of comfort whenever they see it.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever sighed with relief when, hours into a road trip, you spot golden arches in the distance and know a Big Mac is in your future, then you’ve felt this firsthand.</p>
<p>Here are some more stats that speak to the importance of a small business logo:</p>
<ul>
<li>People need to see something at least <a href="https://www.b2bmarketing.net/en/resources/blog/marketing-rule-7-and-why-its-still-relevant-b2b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven times</a> before recalling it. Having a logo to include in all corners of your business will help your customers recall you later.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.websiteplanet.com/blog/logo-design-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">59%</a> of shoppers prefer to buy from recognizable brands.</li>
<li>The consistent presentation of a brand can increase sales by<a href="https://www.websiteplanet.com/blog/logo-design-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 23%</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://dailyblogging.org/technology/logo-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30%</a> of Americans notice the logo first when evaluating a business’s product or service.</li>
<li><a href="https://financesonline.com/logo-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50%</a> of consumers are more likely to shop from a brand with a recognizable logo, and 60% would avoid brands that have odd or unappealing logo designs.</li>
</ul>
<div id="elements-of-a-great-small-business-logo"></div>
<h2>Elements of a great small business logo</h2>
<p>Of course, a small business logo is more than a randomly selected image. It’s a carefully designed icon that clearly represents your brand.</p>
<p>Successful small business logos should:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Include your business name in a legible font. </strong>While huge, established brands may get away with an icon-based logo (the Nike swoosh, the Apple apple), a smaller brand should incorporate its name.</li>
<li><strong>Be memorable. </strong>Consumers have a hard time remembering logos that are bland or overly complicated.</li>
<li><strong>Be relevant.</strong> Another thing that can make your logo hard to remember? It’s not clearly connected to your business. Make sure your design has a discernible tie-in to your work.</li>
<li><strong>Be simple. </strong>Your logo must be legible and recognizable from near or far.</li>
<li><strong>Incorporate your brand colors and fonts. </strong>If you’ve already established colors and fonts for your business, use them in your logo. This is how you set a consistent <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-create-a-brand-identity/">brand identity</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Be timeless. </strong>You’re building a business with longevity; you want your logo to go the distance with you. Designing something that’s too “of the moment” will lead your logo to become stale or outdated.</li>
</ul>

<div id="how-to-create-a-small-business-logo"></div>
<h2>Steps to create a small business logo</h2>
<p>Feeling amped to create your own logo, or ready to hire a pro to tackle the project for you? Either way, these steps can guide the process.</p>
<p>Learn the basics about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/brand-perception">representing your brand visually</a>, so you can have more informed conversations with your professional graphic designer or apply them yourself.</p>
<div id="know-your-brand-identity"></div>
<h3>1. Know your brand identity</h3>
<p>In order to represent your brand visually, you must know how to articulate your brand identity.</p>
<p>Defining it starts with answering two simple questions: “What do we do, and why do we do it?”</p>
<p>This question will lead you to your brand’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/02/how-to-write-a-business-mission-statement" rel="noopener">mission statement</a>, which encompasses how, what, and why you do your work. This can include tangible and intangible benefits for your customers.</p>
<p>For example, a test prep business might literally help students perform better on their SATs. But it also helps them feel more confident on test day. And when that confidence contributes to higher scores, they gain access to more opportunities in higher education.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/foley-prep-logo-example.webp" alt="foley prep logo small business example" width="900" height="280" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93618" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/foley-prep-logo-example.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/foley-prep-logo-example-480x149.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://foleyprep.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This</a> colorful logo makes test prep look exciting—like an opportunity to expand one’s mind.</em></p>
<p>Your brand’s mission will help you home in on other elements of your identity. If your test prep company wants to inspire confidence in its students, then your identity might be that of an enthusiastic coach or an encouraging older sibling.</p>
<p>Finally, consider your brand identity in contrast with your competitors. How does the work you do (and the way you do it) stand out from what they do?</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Need help articulating what makes your business special?</strong> Get the guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLValuePropositionGuide.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_ValuePropositionGuide_Download">How to Create a Unique Value Proposition From the Ground Up</a></p>
<div id="look-to-other-brands-for-inspiration"></div>
<h3>2. Look to other brands for inspiration</h3>
<p>Once you have a handle on your brand identity, you can look outward. How do brands you admire represent <em>their </em>identities visually through their logos?</p>
<p>There’s plenty of inspiration to pull from multinational brands with instantly recognizable logos. How does a well-designed logo convey feelings or values through design?</p>
<p>For example, the Nike swoosh is an abstract shape. But it mimics a checkmark and implies upward motion. It is simple and bold, which conveys grace and confidence. These are all attributes that help an athlete shine on the court or field, which ties directly into Nike’s mission of empowering athletes to “Just do it.”</p>
<p>You can also consider logos from smaller brands you admire. Looking to your peers can help you identify themes that resonate with your audience, or you may spot a visual white space your logo can fill.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/two-sparrows-homestead-logo-example.webp" alt="small business logo - two sparrows homestead" width="900" height="417" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93619" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/two-sparrows-homestead-logo-example.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/two-sparrows-homestead-logo-example-480x222.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/TwoSparrowsHomestead/about/?_rdr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This</a> logo’s old-fashioned, hand-crafted feel leans into the business’s identity as a “suburban farmhouse.”</em></p>
<p>As an example, if you’re opening a gift shop in a seaside town, how many of your competitors have a blue logo with ocean-related imagery? If you opt to take a different visual path, you stand out immediately from your peers.</p>
<div id="start-aligning-your-brand-with-design-elements"></div>
<h3>3. Start aligning your brand with design elements</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve defined what your brand represents, how can you use visual elements to convey that message?</p>
<p>Return to your brand identity discussions. As you think about what your brand represents and what you want your customers to feel, how does that translate into your brand’s visual identity?</p>
<p>A <a href="https://localiq.com/industries/professional-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">law firm</a> might want its clients to feel safe, confident, and heard. That might mean it wants its visuals to convey trustworthiness and authority?</p>
<p>How can you use design elements like font, color, and graphics to evoke those feelings?</p>
<p>Let’s start with fonts. While there are thousands of individual fonts, they can be broken down into a handful of high-level categories, each of which has its own aesthetic vibe.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/log-fonts-and-meanings.webp" alt="logo fonts and their meanings chart" width="900" height="617" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93621" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/log-fonts-and-meanings.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/log-fonts-and-meanings-480x329.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Next, consider color. Different shades, hues, tints, and tones all have the power to awaken specific feelings in viewers. A pastel pink feels gentle and soothing, while a neon pink feels electric and energetic.</p>
<p>Understanding the psychology of color (and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/12/color-psychology-marketing">how to use it</a> in your logo) can help you spark immediate emotional resonance in anyone who sees it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/color-psychology-emotional-triggers.webp" alt="color psychology and emotional triggers" width="723" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93620" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/color-psychology-emotional-triggers.webp 723w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/color-psychology-emotional-triggers-480x531.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 723px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.conversioner.com/blog/color-psychology" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Last up are graphics. Do you want your logo to include an icon, drawing, or image? When considering your options, think again about how the image style ties into your brand identity.</p>
<p>A cartoon might feel whimsical and playful, while an icon can convey a more serious tone. You can also experiment with different degrees of representation in your image.</p>
<p>For example, a yoga studio might opt for a line drawing of a yogi sitting in the lotus position. Or if they wanted to be slightly less representational, they might select an icon of a lotus flower.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/posies-logo-example.webp" alt="small business logo example - posies" width="310" height="452" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93622" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/posies-logo-example.webp 310w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/posies-logo-example-206x300.webp 206w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px" /></p>

<div id="understand-logo-types"></div>
<h3>4. Understand logo types</h3>
<p>Your end goal is to bring these parts together to create a unified logo. And to do that, you must understand the types of logos out there</p>
<p>Many brands ‌create several versions of their logo, so knowing your options from the start will help you decide which logo variations to create for your small business.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/types-of-logos.webp" alt="types of logos with examples" width="900" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93604" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/types-of-logos.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/types-of-logos-480x427.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="combine-elements-and-create-options"></div>
<h3>5. Combine elements and create options</h3>
<p>Once you’ve decided on a general direction for your logo, you can begin experimenting with colors, fonts, and graphic elements. Or, ask your professional graphic designer to work their magic!</p>
<p>This part can be tricky for those without a professional background in design, but graphic design tools with AI features can help.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canva</a> now invites users to describe an idea with words and uses AI to present options that suit the brief. The tool allows for back-and-forth, so you can ask Canva to refine its initial output until you’re happy with the results.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/canva-logo-builder-ai-example.webp" alt="canva logo builder ai example" width="900" height="628" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93623" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/canva-logo-builder-ai-example.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/canva-logo-builder-ai-example-480x335.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A conversation with Canva AI, asking it to create potential logos for a fictitious residential construction firm.</em></p>
<div id="pick-a-design-and-create-a-set-of-logos"></div>
<h3>6. Pick a design and create a set of logos</h3>
<p>Most brands will design several variations of their logos for different applications. While the full logo might look great on direct mailers you send to your neighbors, you might opt to use the symbol alone as the profile photo on your Instagram page.</p>
<p>To see how brands use different configurations of their logos, take a well-known brand like Nike.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the logo is just the symbol. Other times, the swoosh appears below the brand name. And in other instances, the swoosh is paired with the famous Nike tagline, “Just do it.”</p>
<p>Eventually, you’ll spell out all potential configurations and rules for using your logo in <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-brand-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your brand kit</a>.</p>
<div id="small-business-logo-templates"></div>
<h2>Small business logo templates</h2>
<p>Canva has premade logo templates you can personalize, or you can use it as inspiration for your mood board. <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAE4XV7hvzw/30ATPA8S6Pa23qBxyjAcEw/view?utm_content=DAE4XV7hvzw&amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_source=sharebutton&amp;mode=preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here are some small business logo templates</a> we love to help you get started.</p>

<h2>Designing a small business logo that tells a story</h2>
<p>In the end, what matters more than the details is the larger story your small business logo tells.</p>
<p>Do viewers instantly understand what you do? Does your logo make them feel something? Do long-time followers of your brand recognize it from across the room?</p>
<p>These are the true hallmarks of a great small business logo.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every business relies on leads–potential customers who have shown some level of interest in their product or service. But not all leads are the same. Some are ready to buy, while others need time, education, and engagement before they consider making a purchase.</p>
<p>Businesses categorize leads into three types to better understand and manage them: cold, warm, and hot. Cold leads are people who may not be aware of your brand or actively looking for a solution, while hot leads are highly engaged prospects who are ready to take action.</p>
<p>This article focuses on the key differences between hot vs. cold leads and why distinguishing between them matters. Knowing where a lead falls on the spectrum helps businesses tailor their marketing and sales efforts, ensuring that cold leads are nurtured effectively while hot leads receive the right push to convert.</p>

<div id="what-are-cold-leads"></div>
<h2>What are cold leads?</h2>
<p>Cold leads are individuals or businesses that haven’t interacted with your brand before. They’re unfamiliar with your product or service and often aren’t actively looking for solutions, yet. While they may not convert immediately, with the right approach, they can be nurtured into warm and eventually hot leads.</p>
<p>Cold leads share a few characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>They lack awareness of your brand or offerings.</li>
<li>They aren’t actively searching for the solutions you provide.</li>
<li>They require time and effort to build trust and interest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Common examples include website visitors who haven’t interacted with your brand beyond a single page view or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-media-strategy">social media followers</a> who have never engaged with your content.</p>
<p>Similarly, people who interacted with your brand only once and didn’t show interest after can also be considered cold leads. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>People who <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/11/call-to-action-examples-for-email-newsletter-signups">signed up for a newsletter</a> but never opened an email.</li>
<li>Leads who downloaded a resource but haven’t engaged further.</li>
<li>Tradeshow or webinar attendees who haven’t responded to follow-ups.</li>
</ul>
<p>When working with cold leads, don’t jump straight into a sales pitch as that can push them away. These people are not ready to buy your products or avail your services, so engage them by offering them free advice and information, and keep them coming back to your website by posting helpful content.</p>

<div id="what-are-hot-leads"></div>
<h2>What are hot leads?</h2>
<p>Hot leads are individuals or businesses who are highly interested in your product or service and ready to make a purchase. They’ve moved past the awareness and consideration stages, and demonstrate strong intent to buy.</p>
<p>These leads are characterized by their active engagement with your brand, such as submitting inquiries, requesting demos, or reaching out for more information. They often have <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/25/buyer-persona-examples">clearly defined needs or problems to solve</a> and are actively comparing solutions, making them prime candidates for conversion.</p>
<p>For example, if someone directly requests pricing or contacts your sales team, they are a hot lead. The same goes for website visitors who spend significant time exploring product or service pages. These behaviors signal that they are not just interested but are preparing to make a decision.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/pool-installation-contact-form-png.webp" alt="contact form for pool installation company" width="1200" height="609" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90548" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/pool-installation-contact-form-png.webp 1200w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/pool-installation-contact-form-980x497.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/pool-installation-contact-form-480x244.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw" /></p>

<p>For hot leads, the focus should be on conversion. Fast and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/personalized-marketing">personalized responses</a> can reinforce their decision while highlighting your unique selling points and removing any potential barriers to purchase can ensure a smooth transition to a sale. At this stage, the goal is to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization-marketing">simplify their buying process</a> and build confidence in their choice.</p>
<p>When you identify someone as a hot lead, do not delay your responses to them because they are likely talking to a competitor as well. Address all of their concerns and make the purchase process as frictionless as possible to convert hot leads into paying customers.</p>

<div id="how-to-convert-cold-leads-into-hot-leads"></div>
<h2>The three phases of converting cold leads into hot leads</h2>
<p>Converting cold leads into hot leads involves guiding them through three key phases: awareness, engagement, and nurturing. Each phase builds upon the last, gradually increasing their interest and readiness to buy.</p>
<h3>1. Awareness phase</h3>
<p>Start by making your brand visible to cold audiences. Use targeted ads, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO</a>, and social media to reach potential customers who may not know about your offerings. Use engaging, educational content, like blogs, videos, and guides, that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/28/pain-points">addresses common pain points</a> and introduces your solution in a way that feels helpful rather than sales-driven.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fix-a-sink-search-result-google-png.webp" alt="blog post search result for how to fix a sink from a home services business" width="1200" height="264" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90549" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fix-a-sink-search-result-google-png.webp 1200w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fix-a-sink-search-result-google-980x216.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fix-a-sink-search-result-google-480x106.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A blog post that ranks in SERPs can help you get on a potential lead&#8217;s radar.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Get copy-and-paste social media posts ready for the whole year</strong> in our <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteMonthlySocialMediaCalendarTemplate.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Template_MonthlySocialMediaCalendar_Download">free social media template</a>!</p>
<h3>2. Engagement phase</h3>
<p>Once you’ve captured their attention, focus on deepening the connection. Offer personalized emails and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/15/lead-magnet-ideas">lead magnets</a>, such as free trials, webinars, or downloadable resources, to encourage interaction. Build trust by sharing case studies and testimonials that showcase how others have successfully used your product or service.</p>

<h3>3. Nurture phase</h3>
<p>To keep the momentum going, maintain consistent follow-ups and use retargeting campaigns to stay top of mind. Marketing automation tools can help you track their engagement and deliver tailored content based on their actions. As they move closer to making a decision, ensure your messaging addresses their specific needs and concerns to make the transition into a hot lead seamless.</p>

<p>By moving cold leads through these phases, you’ll steadily build interest, trust, and readiness to convert, transforming them into valuable, sales-ready prospects.</p>
<h2>Tools and techniques for managing hot and cold leads</h2>
<p>Effective lead management is essential for converting prospects into customers and optimizing your sales funnel. The right tools and techniques can help you categorize leads, track their progress, and engage them strategically.</p>
<h3>CRM software</h3>
<p>These tools allow you to organize your leads, track interactions, and monitor their journey through the sales funnel. By keeping everything in one place, CRM software ensures that no opportunity slips through the cracks.</p>
<h3>Lead scoring</h3>
<p>By assigning scores based on behaviors such as email opens, website visits, or demo requests, you can identify when a cold lead transitions into a warm or hot lead. Most CRMs and marketing automation tools have a customizable <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-scoring">lead scoring</a> system that helps prioritize efforts, ensuring that the most sales-ready leads receive attention first.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/lead-scoring-from-dash-by-localiq-300x216.webp" alt="lead scoring number on dash by localiq dashboard" width="300" height="216" class="aligncenter wp-image-90491 size-medium" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/lead-scoring-from-dash-by-localiq-300x216.webp 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/lead-scoring-from-dash-by-localiq-480x346.webp 480w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/lead-scoring-from-dash-by-localiq-png.webp 625w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h3>Data analytics tools</h3>
<p>These tools provide valuable information about lead behavior, engagement levels, and conversion rates. By understanding what works and what doesn’t for different lead types, you can adjust your approach to maximize efficiency and results. <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> is a prime example of a data analytics tool you can use to measure the effectiveness of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/11/03/lead-nurturing">lead nurturing strategies</a>.</p>
<p>Combining these tools and techniques enables you to streamline your lead management process and tailor your efforts to each lead’s specific needs, improving your chances of success.</p>
<div id="building-a-feedback-loop"></div>
<h2>Beyond the funnel: Building a feedback loop</h2>
<p>The sales process doesn’t end with conversion, it’s just the beginning of a longer journey. Even hot leads need continued nurturing after they’ve made a purchase to ensure loyalty and long-term value. Engaging with customers post-sale provides opportunities to strengthen relationships, encourage repeat business, and gain valuable insights.</p>
<p>To build a feedback loop, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-get-customer-feedback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">encourage feedback from converted leads</a> to refine your strategies for both cold and hot prospects. Understanding what resonated with successful leads can help you replicate those tactics, while insights from those who didn’t convert can highlight gaps in your approach and areas for improvement.</p>

<h2>9 tips to stretch your marketing budget</h2>
<p>These expert tips will help you optimize even the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/06/small-marketing-budget" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smallest marketing budget</a>.</p>
<div id="get-discounted-marketing-tools"></div>
<h3>1. Get discounted marketing tools</h3>
<p>Have you ever saved money by visiting an online marketplace that offers discounts on popular things like computer hardware or name-brand fashions? <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikiya/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nikiya Griffith</a>, director of content marketing at <a href="http://teamohana.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TeamOhana</a>, pointed out similar options for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency">marketing software</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keeping an eye on marketplaces like AppSumo that offer steep discounts on software can really help stretch a budget,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Especially if you&#8217;re a solopreneur or small business.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is #notanad for AppSumo, but I did take Nikiya’s advice and had a look through the <a href="http://appsumo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AppSumo</a> website. I started by using its AI personal shopper.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/how-to-stretch-budget-wordstream-appsumo-png.webp" alt="Stretch your marketing budget - screenshot from AppSumo" width="803" height="274" class="aligncenter wp-image-90296 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/how-to-stretch-budget-wordstream-appsumo-png.webp 803w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/how-to-stretch-budget-wordstream-appsumo-480x164.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 803px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>It gave me a handful of options, including an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-ai-photo-generators">AI image generator</a>, an AI brand marketing platform, and an AI-powered text-to-speech app—all at discounted prices.</p>
<p>Besides software, there are courses and PDFs listed on the site as well. And there’s a tab labeled “Shop Last Call,” which looks to be extra special last-minute deals.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Speaking of discounted tools&#8230;</strong>we have some free ones for you:</p>

</ul>
<div id="befriend-your-finance-team"></div>
<h3>2. Befriend your finance team</h3>
<p>The typical trope is that marketers and finance teams work against each other. One group is tasked with spending money to get customers, and the other is judged by how judiciously it protects a business&#8217;s bottom line. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristinblitch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kristin Blitch</a>, director of marketing at <a href="https://rjeinteriors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RJE Interiors</a>, believes there’s a better way to approach this relationship.</p>
<p>“This is going to sound silly, but befriend your finance team,” she said. “Our CFO is one of my closest allies, so I work with the team to see where I can cut expenses and make sensible savings.”</p>
<p>Kristin added that her partnership with finance makes it easier to try new strategies. &#8220;When I ask to spend money, trust has been built that it&#8217;s not just something on a whim,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;There&#8217;s intentionality and reason behind it. From there, I can make things work and bring new things to the table because we&#8217;ve usually got a plan in place.&#8221;</p>
<p>One constant challenge for marketers is proving the value of our actions to the rest of the team. Having an ally in finance who understands what you do and why you do it would be a big step in alleviating that challenge.</p>
<div id="leverage-your-internal-influencers"></div>
<h3>3. Leverage your internal influencers</h3>
<p>Unless you’re producing big-budget, celebrity-filled commercials, your biggest marketing costs aren’t tied up in the creative—it’s paying for the distribution channels (like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/18/social-media-advertising">paid social media ads</a>).</p>
<p>Kristin has a solution for that, too. &#8220;I work to have our internal team help us share our communications (especially the important ones) externally to improve reach in conjunction with any boosting or advertising,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re launching a new product or starting a new campaign, you could ask your team to post about it on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/generating-leads-on-linkedin">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/how-to-stretch-budget-wordstream-RTE-png.webp" alt="Stretch your marketing budget - RJI LinkedIn repost." width="784" height="792" class="aligncenter wp-image-90297 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/how-to-stretch-budget-wordstream-RTE-png.webp 784w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/how-to-stretch-budget-wordstream-RTE-480x485.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 784px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Internal influencing can be as easy as asking your team to repost important company updates.</em></p>
<p>I’ve written about the power of internal influencers before (it was one of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2025-marketing-tips">top tips from expert marketers</a> for 2025). They’re a fantastic way to expand the reach of your marketing messages without extra ad costs.</p>
<p>Kristin said they can also add a trust layer to your marketing. “Having authenticity and word of mouth from our team to their followers (directly) means more compared to just paying for the clicks.”</p>
<div id="dont-overspend-on-seasonal-campaigns"></div>
<h3>4. Don’t overspend on a few seasonal campaigns</h3>
<p>As an experienced digital marketing consultant at <a href="http://localiq.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LocaliQ</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mkaywood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miranda Kaywood</a> gets a behind-the-scenes view of how businesses allocate their marketing budgets. She cautioned against spending most of your advertising dollars on a few seasonal campaigns.</p>
<p>“Instead of exhausting your budget all at once, I recommend pacing it out to maintain consistent visibility,” she said. “Consistency is crucial for building long-term brand recognition, as it requires multiple touchpoints with consumers to create meaningful connections.”</p>
<p>This is true even for seasonal businesses. Say you run a lawn care service. Many of your competitors will turn marketing on in March as the weather gets warm. If you’ve shared a steady stream of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/winter-content-ideas">helpful content all winter</a>, the people it helped will be more likely to choose you come <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/spring-content-ideas">spring</a>.</p>
<p>And once you get a revenue bump from those successful gambits, compound it by putting some of it back into advertising. “Invest in these solutions, and once you see a positive ROI, reinvest the returns back into your marketing strategy through a budget increase or trying out different marketing avenues,” Miranda said.</p>

<h3>5. Target second or third Google Ads positions</h3>
<p>The top spot on a Google search results page almost always gets the most clicks. But that real estate comes at a price. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamschwind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adam Schwind</a>, founder of <a href="https://sparkdigitalgroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spark Digital Group</a>, believes there’s gold in not fighting the big spenders for those extra clicks.</p>
<p>“Rather than competing for the number one spot in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-run-google-ads">Google Ads</a>, where costs can be significantly higher, businesses can maximize their budget by targeting the second or third position,” he said. “This approach reduces cost per click (CPC) while still maintaining strong visibility and competitive click-through rates (CTR), ensuring a better return on ad spend.”</p>
<p>I really like this bit of advice. I’ve watched the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2024-google-ads-benchmarks">search ad costs</a> we track yearly rise. Just in the last four years, the average cost-per-lead from our benchmark reports jumped by roughly 50%.</p>
<p>Adam’s suggestion is a great option for tempering those cost increases to keep your budget intact.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong> Free budget-saving resource:</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/ways-to-save-money-in-google-ads?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_SaveMoneyinGoogleAds_Download">6 Easy Ways to Save Money on Google Ads Now</a></p>
<div id="be-ready-to-pivot"></div>
<h3>6. Be ready to pivot</h3>
<p>Experimentation is a constant part of great marketing. What’s important, Miranda said, is to make sure you’re not doubling down on the experiments that don’t pan out.</p>
<p>“It’s key to regularly check in and see what’s actually working so you can understand how your marketing dollars are being spent,” she explained. “You might discover that some platforms, ads, or audiences perform better than others—and you need to pivot to make sure you’re always effectively using your dollars.”</p>
<p>That’s true whether you manage your own marketing budgets or have outside help. “Your marketing partner (i.e., LocaliQ) can help with this, but it’s important for you to stay on top of it, too,” Miranda added.</p>
<p>A great place to start is while creating your yearly <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/07/best-marketing-strategies">marketing strategy</a>. Be precise about which metrics matter to you most in the coming year. Set a benchmark based on your industry and on your prior results. Then, establish a cadence for review and be prepared to shift your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-budget">budget</a> from what’s not working to what is.</p>
<div id="be-strategic-with-your-marketing-channels"></div>
<h3>7. Be strategic with your marketing channels</h3>
<p>It can be tempting to jump into a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/26/marketing-channels">marketing channel</a> that gets a lot of buzz from other businesses. Adam said that can lead to a leaky marketing budget if it’s not the right channel for your unique brand.</p>
<p>“Small businesses must be strategic about where they invest their marketing budget,” Adam explained. He gave the example of a divorce law firm, which may not benefit as much from building a large following on every social channel since “divorce clients seek legal help when needed, not ongoing engagement.”</p>
<p>Miranda made a similar point. “Small businesses should focus on a few key marketing channels, such as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/03/08/facebook-marketing-ideas">Facebook</a> and Google, rather than trying to cover everything with a limited budget,” she said.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Not all channels are ideal for all audiences.</em></p>
<p>Which channels are right for your business?</p>
<p>To answer that you’ll need to know who your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">most valuable audience</a> is and figure out how they typically learn about brands and services in your industry. Do they actively search certain <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide">keywords</a> on Google? Or do they commonly talk about your topics on a social media platform?</p>
<div id="go-organic"></div>
<h3>8. Go organic</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/colby-flood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colby Flood</a>, founder of <a href="https://www.brighterclick.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brighter Click</a>, is bullish on SEO and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/01/19/social-media-marketing-plan">organic social media</a> for growing brands and has a specific prescription for them to succeed.</p>
<p>“SEO is a strategy that takes time and consistency, but the compounding growth it brings is well worth the wait,” Colby said. “I recommend prioritizing gaining a minimum of 3-5 backlinks and publishing 1-2 <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/27/blog-post-ideas">blog articles</a> per month for smaller websites.”</p>
<p>We’ve published a guide on getting <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2010/04/01/build-amazing-backlinks">quality backlinks</a> to get you started there.</p>
<p>“Organic content marketing on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/19/social-media-for-small-business">social media</a> is another great way to build an audience, but like SEO, it takes time and consistency,” Colby added. “Many direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands are shifting towards organic social media as a driver for sales.”</p>
<p>Colby pointed to Fresh Chile Company as a great example of a DTC brand that’s crushing it on social media. I checked them out, and yeah, a niche product with over 200K followers across Meta platforms is pretty impressive.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/how-to-stretch-budget-wordstream-chile-1024x661.webp" alt="Stretch your marketing budget - Instagram post from the Fresh Chile Company." width="1024" height="661" class="aligncenter wp-image-90299 size-large" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/how-to-stretch-budget-wordstream-chile-1024x661.webp 1024w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/how-to-stretch-budget-wordstream-chile-300x194.webp 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/how-to-stretch-budget-wordstream-chile-768x496.webp 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/how-to-stretch-budget-wordstream-chile-1080x698.webp 1080w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/how-to-stretch-budget-wordstream-chile-1280x827.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/how-to-stretch-budget-wordstream-chile-980x633.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/how-to-stretch-budget-wordstream-chile-480x310.webp 480w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/how-to-stretch-budget-wordstream-chile-png.webp 1412w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The Fresh Chile Company&#8217;s Instagram page is a perfect mix of promotion, product ideas, and customer praise.</em></p>
<div id="know-your-customer"></div>
<h3>9. Know your customer</h3>
<p>Both Colby and Kristin told me that knowing your customer is one of the most important steps in getting more from each marketing dollar.</p>
<p>“The single most important aspect of marketing is understanding your customer better than your competitors,” Colby said. “Do not assume your customers think the same way you do. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/10/best-online-survey-tools">Send out surveys</a>, pick up the phone and call them, dive into <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reddit-marketing">Reddit threads</a>, do whatever you can to understand the pain points they have relative to your business and how you help solve them.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/how-to-stretch-budget-wordstream-lawn-png.webp" alt="Stretch your marketing budget - screenshot from Reddit." width="956" height="719" class="alignnone wp-image-90300 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/how-to-stretch-budget-wordstream-lawn-png.webp 956w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/how-to-stretch-budget-wordstream-lawn-480x361.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 956px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Reddit is a great place to see what questions your target audience is asking.</em></p>
<p>He offered a systematic approach to the task. “We recommend completing voice of customer and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/competitors-ads">competitor research</a> to better understand the rational and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">emotional motivators</a> that best resonate with your audience,” he said. “From there, we’d select 3-5 motivators to test over a 90-day period. When analyzing ad creative performance, we generally start by looking at the high level to understand how performance averaged based on the messaging motivators, ad format, creative design style, UGC Creator, etc.”</p>
<p>For Kristin, knowing your customer gives you the freedom to be creative and play a little. “Know your target audience and know how and where to reach them,” she said. “Once you know how to reach them, have fun. It’s scary to make the first video that feels like it might be different, but do it. Having fun is the ultimate way to engage your followers. Once you find something that works, keep tweaking it and having fun.”</p>
<h2>You don’t have to turn off marketing to stay on budget</h2>
<p>One big takeaway from all of these tips is that you don’t have to stop marketing to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/local-advertising-costs-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">save money on advertising</a>. Actually, keeping a consistent presence on your top channels can help reduce overall costs compared to stopping and starting.</p>
<p>The theme I picked up on was the need to be agile. That means testing to see what works, ditching what doesn&#8217;t, and being ready to shift gears quickly when needed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you’re writing ads alone on your laptop or drafting promotional emails on a deadline, it can be too easy to forget that you’re not simply completing another marketing task. You’re speaking directly to your target audience. That’s why you want to be as specific as possible, by using their language, appealing to their motivations, and reaching them on the marketing channels where they spend time.</p>
<p>In this article, we’re sharing real-world examples of ads and emails that address their target audience directly and effectively that you can use for inspiration.</p>
<p>Before we jump into the examples, let’s go over what exactly a target audience is—and why it’s so important in improving your marketing tactics and outcomes.</p>

<h2>What is a target audience?</h2>
<p>Many of the search ads, social ads, commercials, and other marketing promotions that you see are created with the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a> in mind. A target audience is a group of people with shared attributes you intend to reach with your marketing campaign or materials.</p>
<p>Here are the common attributes of a well-defined target audience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographics: </strong>Think age, gender identity, job title, education, location, marital status.</li>
<li><strong>Motivations: </strong>Is the person concerned with personal safety, the environment? Interested in learning new things?</li>
<li><strong>Pain points: </strong>How are their current solutions not working?</li>
<li><strong>Marketing channels: </strong>Do these individuals watch TV, spend time on Facebook, or scroll TikTok? Where can you reach them?</li>
<li><strong>Content preference: </strong>Would they prefer a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post">blog post</a> or a newsletter? A how-to video or a case study?</li>
</ul>

<p>Figuring out these details will help you fill out a specific target audience—which will help make your marketing stronger.</p>

<div id="why-do-you-need-a-target-audience"></div>
<h2>Why you need a target audience</h2>
<p>To avoid targeting everyone and no one—and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/losing-money-in-google-ads">wasting your budgeted ad spend</a> in the process—you need a target audience.</p>
<p>When the target audience is missing or muddy, it’s obvious. Take this commercial from T Mobile that was somehow a Super Bowl spot in 2024, for example.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YVeCwSWNLrM?si=riJj2FkPjZW7o3Ri" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>It is entirely unclear who this is for—Scrubs fans? Musical fans? Aquaman fans? Suburbanites with internet issues and parties to host? As far as I can tell, there’s no specific customer profile in mind. That’s what makes this commercial so frustrating for me. This seems like it was created with a little something for everyone, but by appealing to everyone, you’re often appealing to no one. And this makes your marketing and advertising ineffective.</p>
<div id="real-world-target-audience-examples"></div>
<h2>12 real-world target audience examples</h2>
<p>The examples below feature brands, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/04/marketing-collateral">marketing assets</a> directly reaching a specific group of people, and a breakdown of that target audience. We may have the full brief of demographics, motivations, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-pain-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pain points</a>, and all—not many people share their target audience definition publicly—but there’s a lot we can infer. And with that, there’s a lot to learn from.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<div id="lowes-suburban-parents"></div>
<h3>1. Lowes: Suburban parents</h3>
<p>This <a href="https://www.ispot.tv/ad/nBuA/lowes-summer-is-open" target="_blank" rel="noopener">television commercial from Lowes</a> promises to help turn any backyard into a summer hot spot, or, well, all summer hot pots. This campaign ran in the summer of 2020 and highlighted products that can make a backyard filled with fun, quality time, and escape even during lockdowns and quarantines.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-lowes.webp" alt="example of ad from lowes" width="885" height="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89120" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-lowes.webp 885w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-lowes-480x271.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 885px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here’s who they’re targeting:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographics: </strong>Parents ages 30s-40s with young kids who are suburban homeowners with disposable income.</li>
<li><strong>Motivations: </strong>Spending quality time outside; making memories for their kids.</li>
<li><strong>Pain points: </strong>Pandemic-related closures limiting summer plans and family memories; unusable or unwelcoming yard space.</li>
</ul>
<div id="jenis-ice-cream-corporate-gifters"></div>
<h3>2. Jeni’s Ice Cream: Corporate gifters</h3>
<p>I received this email a few weeks ago from Jeni’s, which makes delicious and occasionally odd flavors of ice cream sold in scoop shops, grocery stores, and through their website.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-jenis.webp" alt="example of marketing email from jenis ice cream targeting professionals" width="353" height="583" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89121" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-jenis.webp 353w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-jenis-182x300.webp 182w" sizes="(max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px" /></p>
<p>Let’s start with the imagery. The open Mac laptop reads tech, finance, startups—and, of course, money. It’s clear that the focus is a corporate audience. The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/21/emotional-ad-copy-examples">copy</a> is also telling. While “a lot of gifts” is vague, it’s also casual and implies being busy. This tracks with the rest of the wording—promising a “quick” way to send more than 25 gifts at once.</p>
<p>Here’s this target audience example breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographics: </strong>HR professionals, marketers, and entrepreneurs who are primarily women.</li>
<li><strong>Pain points: </strong>Time—this busy target audience is looking for fast and efficient solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing channels:</strong> Email, appropriate for a dedicated professional.</li>
</ul>

<div id="peloton-fitness-newbies"></div>
<h3>3. Peloton: Fitness Newbies</h3>
<p>It’s hard to think of a Peloton ad and not think of <em>the </em>Peloton ad. But this commercial takes a different tactic (and, well, a less problematic and less viral one).</p>
<p>Here, Peloton is appealing to those new to fitness and interested in establishing a routine, regardless of physical goals. Instead, this ad stresses that taking Peloton classes can be fun.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RGv9hBLUteY?si=_4u3rI-yAkJd5YgP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s who we can infer they’re targeting:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographics: </strong>This is wider, but it’s still limited to those who can afford to shell out more than $1,000 for a bike and $40 for a monthly subscription.</li>

<h3>4. USAA: Veterans</h3>
<p>In this Google Ad, this national bank is speaking to a specific audience: Veterans. USAA has an exclusive marketing contract with the United States Military, so its ads often include portrayals of veterans and those in service to appeal to this specific audience.</p>
<p>USAA still includes this in the ad copy. Take a look:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-usaa.webp" alt="example of google ad from usaa" width="749" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89122" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-usaa.webp 749w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-usaa-480x385.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 749px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of this target audience example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographics: </strong>Veterans, specifically those interested in owning a home.</li>
<li><strong>Pain points: </strong>Cost and confusing mortgage processes.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing channels: </strong>Google Search.</li>

<h3>5. Northeastern University: Ambitious college grads</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://www.ispot.tv/ad/2zIB/northeastern-university-katherine-latoff-real-word-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this commercial</a>, Northeastern University highlights its co-op program and the opportunity to get real-world career experience while still enrolled in a full-time program. In this case, it’s a graduate degree program, which makes its target audience and their motivations clear.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-northwestern-university.webp" alt="example of video ad from northwestern university" width="875" height="510" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89123" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-northwestern-university.webp 875w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-northwestern-university-480x280.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 875px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here’s a potential breakdown of their target audience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographics: </strong>Recent college graduations in their 20s living in urban settings with corporate career aspirations.</li>
<li><strong>Motivations: </strong>Getting farther in a career faster with more education.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing channels: </strong>YouTube, Facebook, Instagram.</li>
</ul>
<div id="figs-emergency-medical-responders"></div>
<h3>6. FIGS: Emergency Medical Responders</h3>
<p>FIGS scrubs are comfortable, youthful, and, most prominently, stylish. The sets come in bright colors, muted palettes, or bold ombre. The company offers tapered legs, jumpsuit styles, and grandfather collars. A lot of their marketing highlights these features, updated scrubs that you’re excited to grab for the day at work.</p>
<p>But this commercial shifts focus and takes a different tone entirely, and it’s clearly targeting a different audience. The emergency medical providers at the motorsport racing track pictured count on their well-fitting, durable gear not to inhibit their movement when seconds matter most. With this spot, FIGS highlights its durability, comfort, and reliability—and the grave impact of scrubs that fall short on any of these.</p>
<p><iframe title="FIGS EXTREMES | FIGS Scrubs" width="1080" height="608" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wORueepoCTw?feature=oembed"  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This target audience example includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographics: </strong>Emergency medical professionals. This isn’t exclusive to motorsports, think paramedics, ER staff, ICU nurses.</li>
<li><strong>Motivations: </strong>Reliability in high-stress, high-stakes moments. No one needs their scrubs sagging down as a distraction in those moments.</li>
<li><strong>Pain points: </strong>Ill-fitting scrubs.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing channels: </strong>TV, Instagram, Facebook.</li>
</ul>
<div id="maisonette-parents-with-fashionable-babies"></div>
<h3>7. Maisonette: Parents with fashionable babies—in the Northern Hemisphere</h3>
<p>Maisonette is an ecommerce marketplace for boutique baby and kids clothing, toys, and more. I saw this <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-nurturing-emails">marketing email</a> from the brand (where I love to virtually window shop) in my inbox in the fall:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-maisonette.webp" alt="example of email marketing message from baby retailer" width="462" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89124" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-maisonette.webp 462w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-maisonette-231x300.webp 231w" sizes="(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/31/email-subject-lines">subject line</a> is already doing some work in telling us the target audience. The convention of an “edit” is used in fashion often. Vogue, for instance, regularly publishes with this structure: “The Essentials Edit,” “The Fall Edit,” etc. Fashionable kids and babies—or, really, parents who find this appealing.</p>
<p>Then, the copy in the first part of the marketing email and the products pictured define the target audience even further—locating it specifically in the Northeast where the temperatures are dropping.</p>
<p>Here’s a closer look at this target audience example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographics: </strong>Parents of babies, toddlers, and young kids who live in the Northeast.</li>
<li><strong>Motivations: </strong>High-quality clothing, guaranteed to be cute and chic.</li>
<li><strong>Pain points: </strong>The same squishy, puffy, shapeless coats as every other kid.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing channels: </strong>Email, Instagram, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reddit-marketing">Reddit</a>.</li>
</ul>
<div id="cozy-earth-women-in-search-of-casual-outfits"></div>
<h3>8. Cozy Earth: Women in search of casual, cute, easy outfits</h3>
<p>Cozy Earth has served me this ad a few times now, and with good reason. The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-ad-targeting">Instagram video ad</a> shows a woman in her late 20s or early 30s in a curated, neutral homey setting getting dressed for a very temperate fall day, starting with a long, flowy dress and layering on a soft cable-knit sweater and accessories. The effect? Effortlessly put together. And the caption underscores this focus: “Maximum style, minimal effort.” The dream.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-cozyearth.webp" alt="example of instagram ad from cozy earth" width="353" height="584" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89125" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-cozyearth.webp 353w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-cozyearth-181x300.webp 181w" sizes="(max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px" /></p>
<p>Here’s a potential breakdown of their target audience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographics: </strong>Women ages 20s to 30s, with disposable income (based on Cozy Earth’s pricing).</li>
<li><strong>Motivations: </strong>The women in this target audience want to look nice and up-to-date…</li>
<li><strong>Pain points: </strong>But their primary pain point is a lack of time: to get ready, to plan outfits, to keep up with trends. Minimal effort means minimal time.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing channels: </strong>Instagram, YouTube, TikTok.</li>
</ul>
<div id="grammarly-customer-experience-leaders"></div>
<h3>9. Grammarly: Customer experience leaders</h3>
<p>Grammarly is a professional tool to review writing for errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation, as well as provide <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-uses-in-marketing">AI-powered suggestions</a> to improve tone, clarity, and more. It’s used in educational settings and in workplaces alike.</p>
<p>In the ad below, Grammarly is targeting a specific professional: CX, or customer experience, leaders.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-grammarly.webp" alt="example of ad from grammarly targeting cx audience" width="355" height="585" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89126" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-grammarly.webp 355w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-grammarly-182x300.webp 182w" sizes="(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px" /></p>
<p>The jargon—something that a writing tool is keenly aware of—is on purpose. CX for customer experience appears in the headline, and then we see CSAT, or customer satisfaction, scores in the caption. By using this specific language, Grammarly is speaking directly to its target audience as an insider. So when it promises to share the secrets to other CX leaders&#8217; communication skills, it’s speaking with authority. In this case, it’s jargon done right.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a closer look at their potential target audience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographics: </strong>Customer experience or customer service leaders.</li>
<li><strong>Motivations: </strong>Improving CSAT and NPS scores with stronger communication.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing channels: </strong>Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn.</li>
</ul>
<div id="bombas-healthcare-workers"></div>
<h3>10. Bombas: Healthcare workers</h3>
<p>I’ve received a few pairs of Bombas socks as gifts, and my primary association with the brand has been its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/purpose-driven-marketing">purpose-driven marketing</a> commitment to donate one essential item to someone experiencing homelessness for every item purchased. A great cause.</p>
<p>Lately, I’ve been seeing the brand’s Sunday slippers, grip slippers, and more across my Instagram feed. This video ad below is a great example—even though I’m not the target audience. In the clip, a healthcare worker getting up for the day slips into her Bombas slippers to get ready, pulls on scrubs, and Bombas compression socks that she swears by to avoid tired, achy feet during her long shifts.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-bombas.webp" alt="example of ad from bombas" width="344" height="581" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89127" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-bombas.webp 344w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-bombas-178x300.webp 178w" sizes="(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=794317596112168" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Here’s a closer look at the potential target audience for this ad:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographics: </strong>Healthcare workers who are on their feet for long shifts.</li>
<li><strong>Motivations: </strong></li>
<li><strong>Pain points: </strong>Sore, tired feet from long hours at work—and activities like long runs or weekend weddings on off days.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing channels: </strong>Facebook, Instagram, TikTok.</li>
</ul>
<div id="optimizely-content-marketers"></div>
<h3>11. Optimizely: Content marketers</h3>
<p>Most of these examples are B2C because, without access to the campaign briefs, it’s often easier to determine the target audience for these ads. But here’s a great B2B example from Optimizely.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-optimizely.webp" alt="example of ad from optimizely" width="352" height="582" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89128" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-optimizely.webp 352w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-optimizely-181x300.webp 181w" sizes="(max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px" /></p>
<p>This sponsored Instagram post could easily appear on Instagram or even as a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/12/google-discovery-ads-vs-display">display ad</a>. It’s targeting content marketers interested in learning more about organizing content effectively and strategically for long-term value.

<p>Here’s a breakdown of this target audience example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographics: </strong>Content marketers working in B2B or B2C with large workflows and multiple team members.</li>
<li><strong>Motivations: </strong>A streamlined content workflow that performs well.</li>

<li><strong>Marketing channels: </strong>LinkedIn, Instagram, Email.</li>
</ul>

<div id="wellnessliving-yoga-studio-owners"></div>
<h3>12. Wellnessliving: Yoga studio owners</h3>
<p>Here is a perfect example from Wellnessliving, a software commonly used by gyms and workout studios. In this <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/07/instagram-story-ads">Instagram Story ad</a>, Wellnessliving is targeting owners of yoga studios. It’s incredibly clear, and the ad is effective in its simplicity.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-wellnessliving.webp" alt="example of ad from wellnessliving" width="275" height="562" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89129" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-wellnessliving.webp 275w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-wellnessliving-147x300.webp 147w" sizes="(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px" /></p>
<p>The static image Story ad shows two women in yoga gear smiling and features a simple headline: “Grow your yoga studio revenue by 57%” with a clear CTA to book a demo. You know who it’s talking to, what the offer is, and where clicking the link will take you. Talking to your target audience doesn’t have to be more complicated than this.</p>
<p>Let’s look at this target audience example breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographics: </strong>Yoga studio owners—or owners-to-be.</li>
<li><strong>Motivations: </strong>Growing a studio with more classes, more students, and more revenue.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing channels: </strong>Instagram, YouTube.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s hard to imagine a time in B2B marketing history when everything changed this quickly.</p>
<p>Just in the last couple of years, we&#8217;ve seen incredibly volatile Google SERPS, entire job categories created (AI prompt engineer?), and hundreds of new tools and features just waiting for us to learn.</p>
<p>The one theme running through the B2B marketing trends for 2025 is a continuation of this evolution. But with change comes opportunity. Marketers who plan for what&#8217;s coming will take giant leaps ahead of their competitors.</p>

<p>Let these B2B marketing trends guide you as you create your 2025 marketing strategy.</p>
<div id="ai-agents-go-mainstream"></div>
<h3>1. AI agents go mainstream</h3>
<p>AI agents are revolutionizing how everything from a factory floor to a dentist&#8217;s office operates. And they&#8217;re poised to do the same for B2B marketing.</p>
<p>These semi-autonomous problem solvers are already tackling several tasks for marketers, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimizing campaigns</li>
<li>Personalizing marketing messages</li>
<li>Creating content</li>
<li>Improving customer engagements</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>AI agents, like </em><a href="https://localiq.com/products/ai-lead-management/?itm_source=localiq&amp;itm_medium=homepage" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>LocaliQ’s Dash</em></a><em>, will help marketers provide more personalized and engaging experiences for prospects and customers.</em></p>
<p>Developers, both big and small, will continue to iterate on how AI agents help marketers. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-trends-2025">Facebook</a>, for example, is bringing an AI agent to its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-tactics">ads manager</a>. You’ll just feed it your marketing goals and give it some guidelines, and it’ll deliver the best outcome based on changing factors.</p>

<p>This is probably the fastest-evolving <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-marketing-trends-2025">trend in AI for marketing</a>. If you&#8217;re ready to jump on it, here&#8217;s how to get started.</p>
<h4>Follow thought leaders</h4>
<p>Find a few<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/08/ppc-influencers"> marketing thought leaders</a> who talk about AI agents on LinkedIn, in podcasts, and in their<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/25/email-newsletter-ideas"> newsletters</a>. Don&#8217;t hesitate to get active in the comments—you&#8217;ll find many of the best recommendations there.</p>
<h4>List jobs to be done</h4>
<p>AI agents are designed to take on specific tasks. Make a list of workflow bottlenecks and growth opportunities you don’t have the bandwidth to address. Then, look for AI agents that handle them.</p>

<div id="experience-marketing-comes-back-into-focus"></div>
<h3>2. Experience marketing comes back into focus</h3>
<p>Experiential marketing fell out of favor for a while. In large part, that&#8217;s down to marketers focusing on digital mass communication strategies like content and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">social media marketing</a>. Of course, the pandemic gave that shift a huge shove, too. But the trend is shifting back now. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/74-fortune-1000-marketers-increase-190000092.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">74%</a> of Fortune 1000 marketers report that they’ll be increasing spending on experiential marketing in 2025</p>
<p>Almost paradoxically, AI is helping to make experience marking en vogue again for two reasons. First, the specter of robo-crafted content has marketers looking for new ways to connect with audiences more authentically. A conference, webinar, or even sponsored coworking sessions are great ways to do that.</p>

<p>At the same time, new <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency">AI tools</a> help marketers make more of every event. You can now use AI to pull insights from a keynote speech or expert panel and almost instantly <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-repurposing">repurpose</a> it into a series of blog articles, social posts, and video scripts.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Some marketing leaders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/markrogers88_im-adding-a-really-cool-hire-to-the-content-activity-7289999140804018176-NuM2?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are hiring</a> specifically to curate content fodder from marketing events.</em></p>
<p>Events are excellent opportunities to gather first-party data, expert insights, and overall industry trends. Here’s how you can take advantage of the experiential marketing trend.</p>
<h4>Find ways to host events</h4>
<p>A conference is great, but it’s not in every brand’s budget. Try looking at more manageable events like webinars or even AMA (ask me anything) events on<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reddit-marketing"> Reddit</a>. You can also get some of the benefits by attending other brands’ events.</p>
<h4>Get intentional about repurposing</h4>
<p>Before any event you host or attend, create a list of how you can repurpose the information you gather there. When you go in knowing you want five blog articles, three short videos, and a dozen LinkedIn posts, you’ll seek out insights to fill them.</p>

<h3>3. AI education is now non-negotiable</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/ai-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More than half</a> of marketers say AI is already important in their role, but 70% said their employers don’t provide generative AI training. In 2025, businesses that create an AI curriculum will close the knowledge gap and be set up for success.</p>
<p>The educational chasm is only going to get deeper. New tools and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-in-marketing">use cases for AI</a> in marketing are increasing exponentially. Wait too long, and the learning curve could get too steep to climb.</p>

<p>Expect to see many more B2B businesses baking in some AI training and experimentation in 2025. The evidence of this marketing trend will be noticeable as thought leaders <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-uses-in-marketing">share their trials</a> and learnings publicly.</p>

<p>AI will only get more entrenched in marketer’s workflows this year. Here are a few ways you and your team can get ahead and stay ahead.</p>
<h4>Formalize your AI education</h4>
<p>Create a structure around you and your team’s learning activities. Set aside learning time blocks, have experimentation sprints, and dedicate meetings to share new ways to use AI.</p>
<h4>Make use of free tools</h4>
<p>Many new AI tools, like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/25/ai-content-generators">copy generators</a>, offer free versions as a way to gain market penetration. Others offer a “free forever” plan with limited but still useful features. Use these affordable options to try out new platforms and test use cases.</p>

<h3>4. AEO is the newest component of SEO</h3>
<p>30-plus years ago, B2B businesses started focusing on getting their websites to appear at the top of Google search pages. Early<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-trends-2025"> SEO tactics</a> were clumsy, rules were ambiguous, and results varied greatly. In 2025, we’ll see B2B marketers take their best shot at answer engine optimization (AEO) so their sites sit atop results in AI platforms like Perplexity and Google’s Gemini.</p>
<p>AI answer engines’ place in search is growing. Google expanded its<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-overviews"> AI Overviews</a> last year. Perplexity’s user base<a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/perplexity-ai-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> continues to increase</a>. And<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/05/chatgpt-seo"> ChatGPT</a> launched its<a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> search-focused platform</a>. For each search involving these tools, there are citations to websites that can deliver both<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness"> brand awareness</a> and clicks from the interaction.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/b2b-marketing-trends-wordstream-lily-ray.webp" alt="B2B marketing trends -Linkedin post from Lily Ray." width="503" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-89032 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/b2b-marketing-trends-wordstream-lily-ray.webp 503w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/b2b-marketing-trends-wordstream-lily-ray-480x573.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 503px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>SEO expert Lily Ray </em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lily-ray-44755615_seo-activity-7269046589665538048-K70c?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>pointed out</em></a><em> how many places a brand can be cited in an AI search result.</em></p>
<p>It’s very likely that we’ll see more online searches involving AI-generated answers. Marketers will follow the search migration and focus more on AEO in 2025. And just like the early days of SEO, those in the know will land more of that coveted citation real estate. Use these tips to get started.</p>
<h4>Get specific in copy and content</h4>
<p>Answer engines seem to like to cite pages with direct answers to specific questions. So, ranking in an AE will be similar to grabbing the coveted feature snippet on a standard Google search. Make sure your copy includes a direct answer to the questions you’re trying to rank for.</p>
<h4>Get your structure down</h4>
<p>FAQs, meta descriptions, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/15/what-is-schema-markup">schema markups</a> will help answer engines understand and share your pages. Go back to those basics if you haven’t already done so.</p>
<h4>Shore up your local listings</h4>
<p>AI search tools pull data for local businesses from <a href="https://localiq.com/products/listings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business listings</a>. If your business has a physical location, make sure your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/holiday-local-listings-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">directory listings are complete</a> and up to date.</p>
<div id="employee-ambassadors-take-the-lead"></div>
<h3>5. Employee ambassadors take the lead</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO</a> is most certainly not dead, but it does look a lot different than it did just a few years ago. Google SERPs are now rowdy places with frequently violent shifts in rankings and rules. In 2025, we’ll see many B2B marketers respond by diversifying their traffic sources. One popular way to do this is to help their employees become brand ambassadors.</p>
<p>Employee brand ambassadors work a lot like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/03/21/social-media-influencers">traditional influencers</a>, but they’re employed by the business they’re promoting. They’ve been popular in B2C marketing for a while (this <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bartoli" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Papa John’s pizza maker</a> has 1.4 million TikTok followers).</p>
<p>Scroll through LinkedIn, and you’ll see how the trend is taking over in the B2B space as well.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/b2b-marketing-trends-wordstream-nielson-1.webp" alt="B2B marketing trends -Linkedin post from Amanda Nielson." width="344" height="578" class="aligncenter wp-image-89033 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/b2b-marketing-trends-wordstream-nielson-1.webp 344w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/b2b-marketing-trends-wordstream-nielson-1-179x300.webp 179w" sizes="(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Employee brand ambassadors are bringing the </em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/verydemanda_adhd-hack-power-walk-on-your-treadmill-during-activity-7282129975061716992-B-jJ?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>TikTok vibe to LinkedIn</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>There will be many variations on the internal influencer theme. Many will be marketers whose job it is to promote the brand online. But you’ll also see more engineers, customer success reps, and sales pros amplify their business’s digital footprint.</p>
<p>Keep these ideas handy as you consider joining this B2B marketing trend.</p>
<h4>Offer a variety of ways to participate</h4>
<p>Not everyone in your office (virtual or otherwise) will be eager to post <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/tiktok-video-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok-like videos</a> or create extensive product demos for LinkedIn. And you don’t need them to. Start by asking them to repost a post or shout out a milestone on their account. Give them the option to jump in doing whatever feels natural and build from there.</p>
<h4>Give them tools and incentives</h4>
<p>Unless they were hired as an influencer, you’re asking something extra from someone who may not be familiar with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/01/09/social-media-marketing-strategies">social media marketing best practices</a>. As you create your employee brand ambassador program, include some incentives (like helping them build their personal brand) and support (like writing captions for them).</p>
<div id="ai-transparency-becomes-a-big-debate"></div>
<h3>6. AI transparency becomes a big debate</h3>
<p>While many people don’t care if robots created your marketing copy, most want you to tell them if it was. In two recent surveys,<a href="https://www.telusdigital.com/insights/ai-data/article/generative-ai-transparency" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 71%</a> and<a href="https://www.bynder.com/en/blog/bynders-human-touch-survey-uncovers-consumers-opinions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 69%</a> of respondents said that businesses should say when they use AI. Another poll by the AI Policy Institute showed that<a href="https://nz.news.yahoo.com/80-percent-americans-think-presenting-100042782.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMUqxLsFl6ObVWeYbGRQs4HIT1_gn2V3jEvIg8lsBaFosbN-MtrPUZnA7R6JV_9b7tMl1kzU1Dcn4AB36B8jhATmV8gwfmvFUfytLhZDRWboebj_qKhWK66B4AwL7yYTAsqhIGEwJxO0MnJKS5IftAkC02p-9iIKykZSIOgXQZuy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 80%</a> of Americans think it should be illegal to pass off AI-generated content as created by humans.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/b2b-marketing-trends-wordstream-ai-images.webp" alt="B2B marketing trends -AI-generated image." width="936" height="474" class="aligncenter wp-image-89034 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/b2b-marketing-trends-wordstream-ai-images.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/b2b-marketing-trends-wordstream-ai-images-480x243.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-ai-photo-generators"><em>AI photo generators</em></a><em> are getting really good, making it hard for the average consumer to know what’s real and what’s AI.</em></p>
<p>We’ll also see new federal, state, and industry <a href="https://www.akingump.com/en/insights/ai-law-and-regulation-tracker/new-hampshire-imposes-new-regulations-on-ai-and-criminalizes-deepfakes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI regulations</a> add energy to the need for transparency.</p>
<p>The exact way B2B marketers react is still unknown. We may see brands self-regulate by adding disclosures about their AI use. Or we may get vertical best practices from individual industries (like healthcare, for example).</p>
<p>No matter what it looks like, 2025 will be the year transparency becomes a big part of the AI transformation. Here are some ways to be prepared.</p>
<h4>Create an internal AI use policy</h4>
<p>The most important step in planning for AI is codifying how your team should use it (and how they should discuss it). It’s okay to start simply with rules around writing blog posts and creating images. Remember to consider privacy since many AI models use the information you give them as a part of their training protocol.</p>
<h4>Consider an AI use statement</h4>
<p>If you want to get ahead of industry or legal standards, consider adding an AI use statement to your website. Explain how you use AI for asset creation, customer data, or other purposes.</p>
<h2>Map your success with these B2B marketing trends</h2>
<p>Few aspects of B2B marketing escaped the sudden shifts over the last couple of years. If you&#8217;re feeling a little dizzy from it all, know you&#8217;re not alone and that there&#8217;s a path to success. The most important step is to stay informed. Find a few information sources you enjoy, try some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/bluesky-for-marketing">new social media platforms</a>, and dedicate time to learning it all.</p>

<h3>3. Generate 50 sales-qualified leads per month</h3>
<p>If email plays a role in your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-objectives-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing objectives</a> (and it very well should), here’s an example SMART goal to model after:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Specific: </strong>Generate 50 sales-qualified leads each month through a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/13/targeted-email-marketing-strategies">segmented email</a> campaign.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Purpose-driven marketing is all about aligning a brand&#8217;s mission with its values to create a deeper connection with consumers. By focusing on a social or environmental cause, companies can connect more meaningfully with their audience and build stronger brand loyalty. But it’s not as simple as selecting a cause and launching a campaign.</p>
<p>In this guide to purpose-driven marketing, we’ll explain the meaning and importance of purpose-driven marketing and then show some examples of brands that do it well.</p>

<h2>What is purpose-driven marketing?</h2>
<p>Purpose-driven marketing is the strategy of aligning external communications, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/brand-personality-messaging">brand identity</a>, and marketing activities with a meaningful cause. The central cause could be <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/28/green-marketing">environmental</a>, social, philanthropic, or economic, but it must be baked into the identity of the brand. Ideally, it’s also integrated into the founding story and the central operations of the business.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.warbyparker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warby Parker</a> is a great example. The direct-to-consumer glasses brand connects breaking up a monopoly on prescription glasses in the US with a critical global issue of access to both exams and eyewear with its core belief: “We believe everyone has the right to see.” Through its non-profit partners, Warby Parker’s philanthropic program donates a pair of glasses for each one sold. The company’s Buy a Pair, Give a Pair program has distributed more than 15 million pairs of glasses.</p>

<h2>Purpose-driven marketing vs. cause marketing</h2>
<p>Corporate social responsibility has been in the news more regularly over the last several years. The 2016 election, the onset of the 2020 pandemic, and Gen-Z’s aging into the workforce have motivated the trend. But not all marketing that relates to causes is purpose-driven marketing. Sometimes, it falls in the category of<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/22/cause-based-marketing"> cause marketing</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the key differences.</p>
<h3>Duration</h3>
<p>Plenty of companies run short-term marketing campaigns for socially responsible causes, whether it’s connected to a specific time of year, product launch, or special initiative.</p>
<p>Companies with purpose-driven marketing strategies have their support for these causes integrated into the business operations and values, so the commitment is longer-term.</p>
<h3>Founding mission</h3>
<p>With purpose-driven marketing, social responsibility is a part of the founding mission of the company.</p>
<p>With cause marketing, companies partner with nonprofits, offer direct support, or call attention to an issue. This is great but not a core part of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/23/how-brand-your-business">brand’s identity</a>.</p>
<h3>Business operations</h3>
<p>Cause marketing doesn’t always require business operations, but purpose-driven marketing does. Think Warby Parker’s Buy a Pair, Give a Pair program. That scale and direction require operational support, including integration in any financial forecasting.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola recently introduced plant-based bottles. While supporting the environment is an excellent cause, it’s not a cornerstone of the brand’s mission or identity, so it’s not purpose-driven marketing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-cocacola.webp" alt="Purpose-driven marketing - Coca-cola ad for plant-based bottled." width="848" height="428" class="aligncenter wp-image-87589 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-cocacola.webp 848w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-cocacola-480x242.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 848px, 100vw" /></p>

<div id="why-use-purpose-driven-marketing-strategies"></div>
<h2>Why use purpose-driven marketing strategies?</h2>
<p>Purpose-driven marketing strategies can make a big difference in the world. But they also have benefits for businesses that practice them. They’ll help win loyal customers, increase brand recognition, retain and engage employees, and even increase profits.</p>
<h3>Winning loyal consumers</h3>
<p>If you’re running a small business or <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-create-a-small-business-marketing-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">managing the marketing</a> for one, you’re thinking about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/25/optimize-lead-generation-process">customer acquisition</a>. The biggest business benefit of purpose-driven marketing is winning loyal customers.</p>
<p>Last year, Toms of Maine—a <a href="https://www.tomsofmaine.com/the-backstory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand</a> committed to natural products and giving back to its community—commissioned a study of 2,000 Gen Z and Millennial consumers to learn about values and habits. The results were clear: <a href="https://www.carbonneutralcopy.com/sustainable-purchases-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80%</a> of respondents base their purchases on a brand’s mission or purpose, and 85% would rather spend more money on a better, more sustainable product than its lower quality, lower cost alternative.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-gen-z.webp" alt="Purpose-driven marketing - Graphic showing 4 in 5 gen z buy based on brand's mission." width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-87590 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-gen-z.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-gen-z-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.carbonneutralcopy.com/sustainable-purchases-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>If you’re considering incorporating purpose-driven marketing into your business model, know that consistency in your marketing, mission, and practices is key to keeping these loyal customers, though. <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/google_cloud_cxo_sustainability_survey_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">84%</a> of consumers say that unsustainable practices will alienate them from a brand.</p>
<h3>Encouraging brand recognition</h3>
<p>By spending time online, we’re all seeing hundreds—if not <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2023/05/03/how-many-ads-do-we-really-see-day-spoiler-it-s-not-10000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thousands</a>—of ads each day. Throw in all the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/26/influencer-marketing">influencer mentions</a>, sponsored content, organic social media posts, and brand placement in shows and movies, and you can see how we’re constantly taking in branding.</p>
<p>In this environment, you want to give your small business every opportunity to stand out and find more ways to get your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">brand recognized</a>.</p>
<p>Purpose-driven marketing creates a strong and memorable brand story, as the commitment to the cause is central to the company’s origin. Stories are remembered up to <a href="https://womensleadership.stanford.edu/node/796/harnessing-power-stories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">22 times</a> more than facts, helping your customers and potential customers remember your brand.</p>
<p>Your brand is also more likely to get positive press mentions. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378426615001934" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Research</a> shows that companies with stronger commitments to corporate social responsibility receive more press coverage overall and, in this coverage, are perceived more favorably.</p>
<p>Aligning your business with a cause can help foster more passionate internal advocates, too. And this can impact your brand recognition and customer relationships. In fact, <a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2018/majority-of-consumers-buying-from-companies-that-take-a-stand-on-issues-they-care-about-and-ditching-those-that-dont-accenture-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">65%</a> of consumers report that a brand’s employees and its CEO can influence their purchases. This leads us right to the next benefit of purpose-driven marketing.</p>
<h3>Attracting employees</h3>
<p>The next major benefit of a purpose-driven marketing strategy is attracting, engaging, and retaining employees. <a href="https://www.bluebeyondconsulting.com/blog/what-do-employees-value-most/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80%</a> of employees consider working for a company with values that align with their own extremely important.</p>
<p>People want to feel connected to the work they’re doing, and this is becoming more true as Gen Z begins to make up a larger percentage of the workforce. <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/consumer-business/welcome-to-gen-z.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deloitte</a> found that, compared to other generations, Gen Z is more concerned about a company’s ethical standards and social impact. Last year, Deloitte also found that <a href="https://www.esgtoday.com/over-40-of-gen-z-millennials-would-switch-jobs-over-climate-concerns-deloitte-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40%</a> of Gen Z and Millennials have changed career plans because of their urgent and escalating concerns about climate change.</p>
<p>This is another area where commitment to your mission is critical. If you’re attracting passionate employees, your company needs to stay true to its core values in order to keep them engaged at work. And if you’re able to keep your employees engaged, you’ll see real, tangible benefits to your business.</p>
<h3>Increasing profits</h3>
<p>Employee engagement corresponds with productivity and presence, which translates to profitability for your business. <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236366/right-culture-not-employee-satisfaction.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup</a> found that companies with engaged employees see a 17% increase in productivity and 41% less absenteeism. These same companies are also <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236366/right-culture-not-employee-satisfaction.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">21%</a> more profitable on average.</p>
<p>The potential increase in profits is also directly attributable to purpose-driven marketing. <a href="https://www.babson.edu/social-innovation-institute/thought-leadership/project-roi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project ROI </a>found that companies with strong commitments to social responsibility have a 6% higher market value and generate 20% more revenue.</p>
<p>Those are some significant gains.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-lush.webp" alt="Purpose-driven marketing - Lush search engine results." width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-87591 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-lush.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-lush-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The copy is informative. It’s clear that the company offers hair care, skincare, and bath products. But the copy shares more without getting repetitive—the ingredients are “fresh,” the hair products are “zero-waste alternatives,” and the products are “Vegetarian &amp; Cruelty-Free.” This is an excellent use of space, fitting this commitment to social causes into short snippets of SEO copy.</p>
<p>All this and inventing the bath bomb? Amazing.</p>
<h3>2. Cuddle + Kind: Google Ads copy</h3>
<p><a href="https://cuddleandkind.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cuddle + Kind</a> makes handmade, organic, safety-certified stuffed animals for babies and children. The full-size knit animals have outfits, names, and birthdays. They also each have a wristband that shares the company’s philanthropic mission of donating 10 meals for each doll sold.</p>
<p>Cuddle + Kind donates proceeds from each sale—not just the full-size animals—to combat child hunger. The brand shares that since launching in 2015, it has helped provide 31 million meals for children in need.</p>
<p>This worthy mission makes it into the company’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/24/google-ads-examples">Google Ads copy</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-cuddle.webp" alt="Purpose-driven marketing - Cuddle and Kids Google Ad." width="740" height="195" class="aligncenter wp-image-87592 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-cuddle.webp 740w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-cuddle-480x126.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 740px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>My favorite thing here is the description line, “Believe in the gift you give.” It’s a lovely sentiment that frames the product as a wonderful purchase. It’s a gift that’s good for more than just the recipient.</p>
<h3>3. TOMS: website structure and copy</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.toms.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TOMS</a> is a shoe company that was launched in 2006 with a one-for-one shoe program. For every pair of original iconic flats sold, the company would donate a pair.</p>
<p>In 2019, after significantly expanding its offerings with more shoe styles and accessories, TOMS changed its commitment to social impact. Instead of one-for-one donations, TOMS allocated a third of its profits for giving, including grants and donations. The business was able to evolve this without changing its brand identity. Giving is still its core value.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/14/website-examples">website</a> does a great job of capturing this value and putting it front and center with a tab in the main navigation for its Impact page. Take a look at the hero copy of the Impact overview page below.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-cuddle-1.webp" alt="Purpose-driven marketing - Tom's ad." width="758" height="227" class="aligncenter wp-image-87593 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-cuddle-1.webp 758w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-cuddle-1-480x144.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 758px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The copy here emphasizes a continuation of the same mission: “to improve lives” and “drive sustainable change.”</p>
<h3>4. Blueland: CTAs</h3>
<p>Emphasizing your brand’s impact and commitment to its core values doesn’t always have to be serious in tone, especially if it doesn’t align with your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/brand-personality-messaging">brand personality</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.blueland.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blueland</a> is a cleaning product brand created with a simple mission: to prevent single-use plastics by making eco-friendly alternatives easy to find and use. I recently switched to Blueland laundry tablets. They come in a sleeve of brown paper packaging, and I’m never going back to lugging a clunky jug of free-and-clear back from Target.</p>
<p>The brand is light, clean, and youthful, and its commitment to environmentalism is enthusiastic and matter-of-fact. Here’s an excellent example of how Blueland uses this in small moments, including the website footer <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">call to action</a> to join the newsletter.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-emails.webp" alt="Purpose-driven marketing -Blueland email newsletter signup page." width="804" height="587" class="aligncenter wp-image-87594 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-emails.webp 804w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-emails-480x350.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 804px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The joke in the headline and the promise of no spam and no waste? Sold.</p>
<h3><strong>5. </strong>Viv: Email marketing</h3>
<p>I love <a href="https://vivforyourv.com/?srsltid=AfmBOorEhZlXf4ACGgcWNJtwGRLfopo4n3n_kLbb1ZaseNpBe5T_lPSi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Viv’s</a> marketing. The period care company is committed to toxin-free ingredients and sustainable solutions.</p>
<p>This sounds serious, and it is. But Viv doesn’t let the severity of these issues weigh down its storytelling or its brand. It’s an excellent decision considering its target demo of young buyers.</p>
<p>Viv speaks to its younger audience, who are concerned about comfort and sustainability—those looking for smaller, better alternatives to major players in the market.</p>
<p>Viv’s brand is youthful and playful. It uses casual confessional videos, bright contrasting colors, lots of emoji, and conversational copy. This is consistent in its social media posts, on its website, and in its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/01/email-marketing-tips">email marketing</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a recent example of an email that I received with a celebratory subject line: “WE HIT A SUSTAINABILITY MILESTONE”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-viv.webp" alt="Purpose-driven marketing - Viv marketing." width="375" height="576" class="aligncenter wp-image-87596 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-viv.webp 375w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-viv-195x300.webp 195w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /></p>
<p>Sending an email to let customers and potential customers know about what’s already happened is compelling. It calls attention to the fact that other period care products are still kicking while Viv is offering a tangibly better alternative. With all the greenwashing claims in marketing these days, this focus on a tangible milestone is perfect.</p>
<h3>6. Patagonia: Video marketing</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.patagonia.com/home/">Patagonia</a> might be the best, most well-known example of a company committed to purpose-driven marketing. The brand has made news for its anti-consumption marketing decisions, including a full-page ad in The New York Times urging readers <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/stories/dont-buy-this-jacket-black-friday-and-the-new-york-times/story-18615.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not to buy the jacket</a> and a decision to cease production of iconic <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/transitioning-away-from-logos.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">logo-branded vests</a> and other gear.</p>
<p>These unconventional marketing tactics align with the company’s core values, including its promise “to make products that give back to the Earth as much as they take.”</p>
<p>Patagonia’s Stories We Wear is an incredibly moving long-form video series. Each installment features one person who reflects on the emotional importance of one item of clothing.</p>
<p>For example, Patagonia ambassador and runner Jenn Shelton focuses on a jacket she wears often. It’s one that she wore hiking with her son in the Dolomites. Novelty doesn’t have the same appeal, she says. “I don’t get that dopamine hit when you get a new thing the way I get a dopamine hit when I put on an old piece.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-patagonia.webp" alt="Purpose-driven marketing - Screenshot of Patagonia video." width="880" height="513" class="aligncenter wp-image-87597 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-patagonia.webp 880w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-patagonia-480x280.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 880px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXHbUkqkRjQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>The series underscores Patagonia’s environmental concerns and anti-consumerism message to buy less and make it mean more.</p>
<h3>7. Jiminy’s: Social media marketing</h3>
<p><a href="https://jiminys.com/?ref=blog.smile.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jiminy’s</a> might be my new favorite brand name. The company creates dog food that’s more sustainable than its meat-based counterparts, saving hundreds of gallons of water per bag and producing next to no greenhouse gas emissions, all by using insect-based protein. (Get it, crickets?)</p>
<p>The sustainable dog food brand leverages <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/28/user-generated-content">user-generated content</a> across their social media, particularly on Instagram. This is an excellent call, taking advantage of the adorable pups who enjoy their product and celebrating their consciously consuming owners.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-jiminys.webp" alt="Purpose-driven marketing - Jiminy's social media post." width="875" height="558" class="aligncenter wp-image-87598 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-jiminys.webp 875w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-jiminys-480x306.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 875px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Just look at this good (insect protein-loving) boy.</em></p>
<h2>Commit to purpose-driven marketing</h2>
<p>We went over a lot in this guide, including what purpose-driven marketing is, its potential business benefits, and some excellent examples. If you’re launching your startup or rethinking your small business brand, consider how a purpose-driven marketing strategy might benefit your business and the world in which it operates.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Understanding the small business marketing landscape can be a challenge, but it’s important to know if you want to be competitive and stand out.</p>
<p>What are your competitors doing? How are they investing their marketing budgets? What are they planning for 2025?</p>
<p>LocaliQ wanted to answer all these questions and more, so we created <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-marketing-trends-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Small Business Marketing Trends Report for 2025</a> with data and insights from over 730 small businesses!</p>
<p>If you want to see the full report, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-marketing-trends-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jump on over to LocaliQ</a> or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/smb-marketing-trends-report?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2025SmallBusinessMarketingTrendsReport_Download">download it here</a>. And keep reading for 10 key takeaways from the report you need to know to inform your 2025 planning.</p>
<h2>10 biggest takeaways from LocaliQ’s 2025 Small Business Marketing Trends Report</h2>
<p>We rounded up 10 fast facts from the report to help you understand the small business marketing landscape and start your 2025 planning.</p>
<h3>1. Most SMBs aren’t investing in paid search</h3>
<p>According to the report, only 40% of SMBs are investing in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/search-advertising">search advertising</a>, which means the majority of small businesses are not running ads on top search engines like Google and Bing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-current-marketing-channels.webp" alt="marketing channels smbs are investing in according to localiq 2025 marketing trends report" width="1501" height="1594" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86955" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-current-marketing-channels.webp 1501w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-current-marketing-channels-1280x1359.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-current-marketing-channels-980x1041.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-current-marketing-channels-480x510.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1501px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Plus, only 39% of SMBs are investing in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO</a>. This means that small businesses are largely missing out on the opportunity to capture high-intent, local searchers.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/first-page-of-google?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_10WaysFirstPageGoogle_Download">10 Tangible &amp; Free Ways to Get on the First Page of Google</a></p>
<h3>2. Less than half of SMBs are investing in social ads</h3>
<p>We were surprised to find that less than half of small businesses are investing in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-ads-101">social media ads</a> on platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, and more.</p>
<p>These platforms are important because customers spend so much time on social media and are increasingly relying on them to discover new businesses. In fact, TikTok is now the <a href="https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/blog/is-tiktok-a-search-engine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fourth most popular search engine</a>, with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/do-gen-z-use-tiktok-search-more-than-google-thomas-haynes-idnye/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one in 10</a> Gen Zers more likely to use it than Google.</p>
<p>By not running ads on popular social media sites, SMBs are missing out on ways to engage and convert customers where they’re spending (a lot!) of time online.</p>
<h3>3. But SMBs running paid search are satisfied with results</h3>
<p>When it comes to how satisfied small businesses are with their marketing investments, search advertising topped the list as the tactic they are most satisfied with.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-channels-satisfaction.webp" alt="how satisfied smbs are with their marketing channel investments according to localiq 2025 marketing trends report" width="1501" height="1399" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86956" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-channels-satisfaction.webp 1501w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-channels-satisfaction-1280x1193.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-channels-satisfaction-980x913.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-channels-satisfaction-480x447.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1501px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This makes sense to us! It’s pretty easy to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-reports">measure results for search advertising</a> compared to tactics like reputation management or social media marketing, so this could definitely be a factor. But we also know that search ads are effective for small businesses at <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/17/website-visibility">driving website visits and conversions</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>How are your Google Ads <em>really</em> performing?</strong> Find out with a free, instant audit &gt;&gt; <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Google Ads Performance Grader</a></p>
<h3>4. SMBs are also not taking advantage of low-cost online presence strategies</h3>
<p>Back to the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/26/marketing-channels">marketing channels</a> and tactics SMBs are investing in—we would be remiss if we didn’t mention the lack of investment in strategies like reputation management, listings, and website chat.</p>
<p>These strategies contribute to a strong web presence—<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/01/business-directory-listings">listings and reputation management</a> can help you capture and draw in potential customers on search engines and map apps while chat can help you capture website leads and convert them quicker.</p>
<p>Many listings, reputation management, and <a href="https://localiq.com/products/chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website chat tools</a> or strategies are also fairly low-cost, making them a strong fit for small businesses.</p>
<h3>5. Facebook is the most popular social platform SMBs are using for marketing</h3>
<p>Facebook is not only the most popular social media platform for users—it was also the most popular social platform for SMBs to use for marketing.</p>
<p>Of those businesses investing in social media marketing or social ads, nearly 80% were doing so on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/02/facebook-marketing-for-small-business">Facebook</a>, followed by Instagram and LinkedIn.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-social-media-channels.webp" alt="social media channels small businesses are investing in according to localiq 2025 marketing trends report" width="1501" height="1423" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86957" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-social-media-channels.webp 1501w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-social-media-channels-1280x1213.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-social-media-channels-980x929.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-social-media-channels-480x455.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1501px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>6. Smaller businesses have small budgets (unsurprisingly)</h3>
<p>Okay…duh? But understanding the typical <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing budget</a> for your SMB competitors is really handy. LocaliQ found that only 5% of SMBs had no budget and 38% had monthly budgets under $2,500.</p>
<p>And because the report was able to break down marketing budgets by business size, we were able to see a clear correlation between business size and budget. Which, again, isn’t necessarily a surprise, but it should be validating to small businesses who are doing so much with not a lot.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-budget-breakdown.webp" alt="monthly marketing budget breakdown for smbs according to localiq 2025 marketing trends report" width="1501" height="1749" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86958" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-budget-breakdown.webp 1501w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-budget-breakdown-1280x1491.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-budget-breakdown-980x1142.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-budget-breakdown-480x559.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1501px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This just shows the importance of adopting those <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-marketing-strategies">low-cost strategies</a> we mentioned earlier and take advantage of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/12/marketing-ideas">creative marketing ideas</a> to get in front of potential customers.</p>
