<h2>Best landing page builders</h2>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/landing-page-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Landing page</a> builders are a critical part of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">landing page creation</a> process. If you&#8217;re looking for efficient and user-friendly options, here are six noteworthy choices:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://carrd.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Carrd</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Ideal for creating free landing pages, Carrd offers simplicity and ease of use.</li>
<li><a href="https://convertkit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ConvertKit</strong></a>: If your goal is to drive email newsletter signups, ConvertKit is an excellent choice.</li>
<li><a href="https://unbounce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Unbounce</strong></a><strong>:</strong> It&#8217;s great for small businesses with budget constraints, providing flexibility in landing page creation.</li>
<li><a href="https://swipepages.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Swipe Pages</strong></a><strong>: </strong>If you prioritize mobile-first landing pages, optimized designs, the ability to integrate tags, and the passing of GCLID on lead submission, Swipe Pages is designed with these features in mind. I use it the most and have even created my own landing page with it. You can see it <a href="https://promo.triangledigital.xyz/">here</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.leadpages.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Leadpages</strong></a><strong>: </strong>For those looking to sell products on a landing page, Leadpages offers an effective solution.</li>

</ol>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/best-landing-page-builder-tool-landingi.webp" alt="best landing page builder - landingi tool" width="858" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-78576" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/best-landing-page-builder-tool-landingi.webp 858w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/best-landing-page-builder-tool-landingi-480x336.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 858px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>These specialized landing page builders can help you streamline the process of creating high-converting landing pages, whether you&#8217;re focused on simplicity, lead generation, or sales.</p>
<p>However, if your website is already running on platforms like Wix, Squarespace, and Shopify, and you find them suitable for creating landing pages, there&#8217;s no reason not to continue using them. These platforms offer a wide range of features and can be a convenient choice if you&#8217;re already familiar with their interface and functionality.</p>
<p>In fact, if you&#8217;re already paying for services on these platforms, it makes even more sense to leverage them for your landing pages, as it can help you save costs and simplify your online presence. This approach allows you to maintain a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/brand-consistency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistent brand experience</a> across your entire website and landing pages while utilizing the tools you&#8217;re already investing in.</p>

<h2>How to find the right landing page builder: Checklist</h2>
<p>What makes <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/08/landing-page-examples">great landing page</a> building software? Here&#8217;s my checklist as someone who has been involved in web development for over 15 years and understands the importance of landing pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ease of use: </strong>The software should allow you to create one-page websites with ease, minimizing the need for serious coding or CSS styling. Simplicity is key.</li>
<li><strong>CTA integration:</strong> The ability to seamlessly integrate your preferred call to action (CTA) methods, whether it&#8217;s collecting email addresses, prompting phone calls, or facilitating immediate purchases.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics: </strong>A good landing page platform should offer built-in analytics to keep a close eye on how your marketing strategies are working, helping you make data-driven decisions. It&#8217;s also essential to have the ability to add custom scripts to the head and body of the HTML, which is great for incorporating tools like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/14/how-to-use-google-tag-manager">Google Tag Manager</a>, allowing you to manage various tracking and marketing scripts in one place without needing deep technical skills. Moreover, your analytics should have the capability to track leads and record GCLID values, which is particularly valuable for things like <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2998031?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Offline Conversion Import</a>. This feature can be used in conjunction with <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/11021502?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enhanced Conversions for leads</a>, providing the ability to model lost conversions due to cookie depreciation.</li>
<li><strong>Custom domain usage: </strong>The option to use a custom domain for your site, which enhances your brand&#8217;s professionalism and credibility.</li>
<li><strong>Quality templates:</strong> A variety of quality landing page templates for common concepts. The focus should be on quality over quantity, ensuring a professional and modern appearance for your landing pages.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Landing page best practices to remember as you build your own</h2>
<p>Once you find the right landing page builder, make sure you incorporate these best practices into the landing pages you create.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/best-landing-page-elements.webp" alt="elements of an effective landing page to consider when building your landing page" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-78578" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/best-landing-page-elements.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/best-landing-page-elements-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Your offer</h3>
<p>Your offer is the linchpin of your campaign. An offer that&#8217;s irresistible and tailored to the needs and desires of your target audience ensures that your prospects feel they&#8217;d miss out by saying no. Techniques like a risk reversal strategy, a time-bound guarantee, or a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/unique-selling-proposition">unique selling proposition</a> can help you create offers that are impossible to refuse.</p>
<h3>Contact form</h3>
<p>Placing your contact form right next to the offer line is a strategic move. The immediacy of a well-placed contact form can significantly impact your conversion rates. Visitors are more likely to engage when the form is within easy reach, allowing them to take the next step without effort.</p>
<p>In addition to optimizing the placement of your contact form, it&#8217;s crucial to streamline the user experience by limiting the number of fields and minimizing required information. While obtaining valuable data is essential, overloading your contact form with fields, especially required ones, can deter potential leads. It&#8217;s advisable to strike a balance between gathering pertinent information and ensuring a seamless interaction.</p>
<p>For instance, instead of requesting a full name, phone number, and detailed company description upfront, consider asking for just the essentials like email and a brief description of their goals. This reduces friction in the conversion process, making it easier for visitors to engage with your offer, as they won&#8217;t be discouraged by a lengthy form to fill out.</p>
<h3>Strong calls-to-action</h3>
<p>You want visitors to your landing page to take an action. This means you need clear and strong calls to action throughout the page. Try A/B testing CTAs to see what messaging, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/20/call-to-action-buttons">button color</a>, and more resonates best with your audience and drives the most conversions. For ideas and inspiration, you can download our free guide: <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download">The Best Call to Action Phrases Ever (&amp; Why They Work!)</a>.</p>
<h3>Clickable phone number</h3>
<p>In today&#8217;s mobile-centric world, making your phone number clickable is akin to rolling out the welcome mat for potential customers. By enabling a direct call with one click, you eliminate friction and make it easier for visitors to reach out. This small but considerate feature can set you apart.</p>
<h3>Clickable email link</h3>
<p>Much like the clickable phone number, a clickable email link streamlines communication. It&#8217;s a hassle-free way for visitors to connect with you. By simply clicking the link, they can initiate an email conversation without the need for manual data entry.</p>
<h3>Service highlights</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/20/product-positioning">Highlighting your services</a> gives visitors a snapshot of what you offer without requiring them to dig deep. It acts as a teaser, capturing their attention and motivating them to explore further. It&#8217;s a quick and engaging way to present the value you bring.</p>
<p>For local service businesses, this can be a game-changer, as it simplifies the process of connecting with your physical storefront or office. It&#8217;s a practical way to bridge the online and offline worlds, ensuring that your customers can reach you with ease.</p>
<h3>Business address</h3>
<p>The inclusion of your address not only fosters trust but also enhances the convenience for your customers. By making your address clickable to a Google Maps link or embedding a Google Maps view directly on your website, you provide an extra layer of accessibility. This allows potential customers to easily find your location, get directions, and explore the surrounding area.</p>
<h3>Case study or social proof</h3>
<p>Real-world results and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/03/how-to-write-a-case-study">success stories</a> are the foundation of your authority. Sharing these case studies demonstrates your ability to deliver on your promises. They serve as a powerful endorsement that sets you apart from the competition and builds trust.</p>

<p>Let’s get started.<br />
<a id="productvideos"></a></p>
<h2>11 landing page trends to watch for and try in 2023</h2>
<p>Now, there are lots of landing page trends we’re expecting to see this year—AI generated design, immersive 3D animations, ChatGPT in action. But not every trend with the newest technology will work for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">your audience</a> (or, let’s be honest, your budget). So here are the 11 landing page trends that are straightforward to implement so you can get started with right away.</p>
<h3>1. Exceptional product videos</h3>
<p>This list isn’t ranked, but this is the first clear trend for a reason: Your product videos should be a high-priority <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/04/marketing-collateral">marketing asset</a>. One that you use again and again. It’s no wonder we’re seeing these front-and-center on more and more landing pages.</p>
<p>Your product videos should already be sleek and enough to anchor these pages. The key to using them effectively is selecting the most relevant or appealing portions and splicing away. Goldcast, an event marketing software, does this really well.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-video-goldcast-example.png" alt="landing page trends - example of product video by goldcast" width="720" height="339" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-69569 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-video-goldcast-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-video-goldcast-example-480x226.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.goldcast.io/demo?utm_term=goldcast&amp;utm_campaign=Goldcast_Brand&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=5475040858&amp;hsa_cam=18958841891&amp;hsa_grp=146441259529&amp;hsa_ad=635858021654&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-301148239910&amp;hsa_kw=goldcast&amp;hsa_mt=b&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA8OmdBhAgEiwAShr403kq28eJiZ07GVXz9p3zQMDM6gESb5t3msNrL8HNuzwsolt3qjvjrhoCfLAQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a> | </em><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-video-goldcast.mp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Click to watch the video</em></a><a href="https://www.goldcast.io/demo?utm_term=goldcast&amp;utm_campaign=Goldcast_Brand&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=5475040858&amp;hsa_cam=18958841891&amp;hsa_grp=146441259529&amp;hsa_ad=635858021654&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-301148239910&amp;hsa_kw=goldcast&amp;hsa_mt=b&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA8OmdBhAgEiwAShr403kq28eJiZ07GVXz9p3zQMDM6gESb5t3msNrL8HNuzwsolt3qjvjrhoCfLAQAvD_BwE"><em></em></a></p>
<p>The videos featured here show off the product’s various capabilities in quick shorts, and the gallery setup lets users refer back if they want to.</p>
<p>Vimeo also does a great job of integrating the product video in the design of its page and using the asset to encourage a conversion more subtly.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-vimeo-product-video.png" alt="landing page trends - example of product video by vimeo" width="720" height="350" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-69570 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-vimeo-product-video.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-vimeo-product-video-480x233.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://vimeo.com/solutions/marketing?vcid=42496&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=seat_plan&amp;utm_term=nonbrand&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA8OmdBhAgEiwAShr408ZpaPnW8vw-05xE8aGEDH7E5nmyaDlmjuSL0m1CmheUemLG3h4PVRoCGgQQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a> | </em><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-vimeo-video-example.mp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Click to watch video</em></a></p>
<p>This looks great, and it highlights Vimeo’s video editing capabilities without a clunky walkthrough of the product. Plus, the video is incredibly captivating, just like the copy promises.</p>
<p>And this brings me to the next landing page trend to implement now.</p>

<p><a id="integrated"></a></p>
<h3>2. Integrated landing page copy and design</h3>
<p>Whether you’re a marketing team of one juggling designer and copywriter hats or working in a department with design and content groups, it’s easy for your visuals and your words (let&#8217;s hope they&#8217;re <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/22/power-words">power words</a>) to get started in silos. This year, you might want to change that.</p>
<p>Check out this great example from Coda, a Notion-like tool for collaborative document and list creation. The realistic cartoon visual of the lizard with an umbrella tail contrasts nicely against the rest of the neutral, modern page—and the headline makes the punny copy/design.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-coda.png" alt="landing page trends - example of integrated copy and design by coda" width="720" height="384" class="size-full wp-image-69559 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-coda.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-coda-480x256.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://coda.io/start/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>

<p>Simple, effective, and worth trying out with your audience.<br />
<a id="simple"></a></p>
<h3>3. Simple, streamlined design</h3>
<p>Understated design for landing pages is a part of a larger branding trend that’s, well, counter-intuitive: <a href="https://www.envato.com/blog/graphic-design-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-branding</a>. Think monochromatic packaging, clean and unassuming color schemes, and minimal brand elements.</p>
<p>While the design style has been around for a while, it’s becoming more popular as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/09/gen-z-stats">Gen-Z</a> buying power increases. Research suggests that this generation is, overall, skeptical of brands. <a href="https://www.edelman.com/trust/2022-trust-barometer/special-report-new-cascade-of-influence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">73%</a> Gen-Zers only buy from brands that they believe in.</p>
<p>Here’s a great example from Typeform’s landing page for easy-to-create surveys. The background is beige (and, uh, blah), and the buttons and font are both a standard black.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-typeform.png" alt="landing page trends - streamlined design by typeform" width="720" height="346" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-69560 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-typeform.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-typeform-480x231.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://try.typeform.com/survey-builder/?gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;&amp;tf_campaign=us_ca-generic-survey-english-desktop_17147702106&amp;tf_source=google&amp;tf_medium=paid&amp;tf_content=137266692918_596400465533&amp;tf_term=surveys&amp;tf_dv=c&amp;tf_matchtype=e&amp;tf_adposition=&amp;tf_location=1018127&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA8OmdBhAgEiwAShr406X2s9yAZlKUDXyZVyUt5FFc1vXThpoIJL9PkZj5dSqa8dTP4fP_whoCfPcQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>The effect? Straight-to-the-point page that makes the tool <em>seem </em>easy. Simple design is still design, after all, and anti-branding is still branding.<br />
<a id="monochromatic"></a></p>
<h3>4. Monochromatic backgrounds</h3>
<p>If anti-branding doesn’t match your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/brand-personality-messaging">brand personality</a>—or, for that matter, your target audience—you can still keep it simple in 2023. Monochromatic website backgrounds are trending, and this style lends itself well to all of your landing pages. After all, you want your landing page skimmable and conversion-focused.</p>
<p>Take a look at Squarespace.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-squarespace.png" alt="landing page trends - monochromatic background example by squarespace" width="720" height="361" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-69561 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-squarespace.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-squarespace-480x241.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.squarespace.com/?channel=pnb&amp;subchannel=go&amp;campaign=pnb-go-us-en-core_comp_general_tier1-phr&amp;subcampaign=(mailchimp_mailchimp_phr)&amp;&amp;cid=13842267359&amp;aid=139711133505&amp;tid=aud-77699953542:kwd-65462921&amp;mt=p&amp;eid=&amp;loc_p_ms=1018127&amp;loc_i_ms=&amp;nw=g&amp;d=c&amp;adid=617163381528&amp;channel2=pnb&amp;subchannel2=go&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA8OmdBhAgEiwAShr40-hmam__07MQIkg5QzCEQonHQuzZegvFQQRzPNy-rS8dEbUG4ZFPshoCO4gQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>The natural curves in the design add depth, but the monochromatic palette keeps it, well, as background. And of course the go-to self-serve website builder takes the color scheme and extends it to the landing page in the landing page. You love to see that attention to detail.</p>

<p><a id="deepgreens"></a></p>
<h3>5. Deep greens</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/12/color-psychology-marketing">Color psychology matters</a>. Pantone’s color for the year is a deep pink <a href="https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year/2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Viva Magenta</a>, and we’ll see this in a few examples today (don’t skip ahead just ahead, just pay attention to the buttons in the next trend). But the hues we’re seeing everywhere are on the other side of the color wheel. Greens.</p>
<p>Green has been trending in <a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/sage-green-color-of-the-year-trend-2022-37011516" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interior design</a> for a few years now, and it’s always been a popular brand color for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/12/19/best-healthcare-website-design">healthcare</a> and wellness-related companies in particular. More recently, green has been everywhere—see the Squarespace background above, and the Ellevest example below.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-ellevest.png" alt="landing page trends - deep greens example by ellevest" width="720" height="336" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-69562 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-ellevest.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-ellevest-480x224.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.ellevest.com/getstarted?ko_click_id=ko_496863bb219b9d580&amp;c1=%7Bc1%7D&amp;source=%7Bsource%7D&amp;kw=%7Bkw%7D&amp;cr5=%7Bcr5%7D&amp;cr7=%7Bcr7%7D&amp;cr6=%7Bcr6%7D&amp;utm_source=gaw&amp;utm_medium=paid-search&amp;utm_campaign=search-nw-usa-brandmembership&amp;utm_content=%7Bev_utm_content%7D&amp;placement=%7Bplacement%7D&amp;camp_det=%7Bcamp_det%7D&amp;geo=%7Bgeo%7D&amp;subj=%7Bsubj%7D&amp;desc=%7Bdescription%7D&amp;hd_text=%7Bhd_text%7D&amp;ad_text=%7Bad_text%7D&amp;img_txt=%7Bimg_txt%7D&amp;cta_txt=%7Bcta_txt%7D&amp;promo=%7Bpromo%7D&amp;live_date=%7Blive_date%7D&amp;lp=%7Blp%7D&amp;utm_term=ellevest" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>Notice that these greens are rich, whether they’re jewel-toned or earthy. When you’re giving your landing page a refresh, consider adding some deep green tones for an updated look for 2023.</p>
<p><a id="playful"></a></p>
<h3>6. Playful buttons</h3>
<p>Trends in design or copy are great inspiration to experiment with, but at the end of the day the best landing page is a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/08/event-landing-pages">high-converting landing page</a>.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean your buttons need to be perfunctory “submit” or, for that matter, big and orange. In fact, Unbounce found that getting specific in the call to action button can improve the conversion rate by up to <a href="https://unbounce.com/conversion-rate-optimization/design-call-to-action-buttons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90%</a>. Changing up your CTA is a great way to start playing around with your landing page buttons</p>
<p>You can stick to creative copywriting, or you test out the design. Lemonade, a pet insurance company, does this so well. The landing page design features minimal black, white, and gray design with line-drawn cats and dogs in motion, plus the brand’s bright pink accents and buttons. And some of these elements interact on the page—including one of the little pets and the buttons.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-lemonade.png" alt="landing page trends - playful buttons example by lemonade" width="720" height="361" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-69564 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-lemonade.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-lemonade-480x241.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.lemonade.com/pet?utm_source=google-search-generic_pet_us_bau_prospect&amp;utm_medium=ua&amp;utm_campaign=12008312635&amp;utm_term=116389736375_%2Bpet%20%2Binsurance%20%2Bhealth_c&amp;utm_content=483815063651" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em> </em><br />
<a id="micro"></a></p>
<h3>7. Micro animations</h3>
<p>Animation on your landing page is great for keeping your user’s attention and making the time on page memorable. (The pets from the Lemonade page? Adorable.) But animations can also help direct your user to interact with your page. Micro animations are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/03/29/ux-conversion-rates">UX design</a> tools that guide a user to move further down the page or take an action. These are something you’ll want to try out in 2023.</p>
<p>This could be as simple as links changing color when the user hovers over them as a subtle encouragement to click, or as complex as something like this submit button.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-buttons.png" alt="landing page trends - example of animated button" width="500" height="245" class="size-full wp-image-69571 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-buttons.png 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-buttons-480x235.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/4269554-Submit-Button" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>View the animation here.</em></a><a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/4269554-Submit-Button" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>
<p>Either way, I’d be surprised if these UX designs don’t nudge a few extra conversions for you this year.<br />
<a id="handwriting"></a></p>
<h3>8. Handwriting-like font and emphasis</h3>
<p>It’s early, but we’re already seeing some themes in design trends for this year: playful visuals with personality, understated branding that appears barely there, and minimalist marketing. The common thread here isn’t new: It’s humanizing brands to create a more personal interaction between potential customers and marketing materials.</p>
<p>Another related landing page design trend to this? Handwriting-like fonts and elements.</p>
<p>Here’s a great subtle example from <a href="https://flocksy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flocksy</a>, a graphic design subscription company.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-flocksy.png" alt="landing page trends - handwriting font example by flocksy" width="720" height="291" class="size-full wp-image-69565 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-flocksy.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-flocksy-480x194.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><a id="succint"></a></p>
<h3>9. Bold, succinct copy</h3>
<p>Minimalist <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/22/marketing-copy">marketing copy</a> is all over the place, but most of us still need copy on our landing pages. So this year, choose your words selectively and make them count. Keep it short and make it bold.</p>
<p>MasterClass does this really well. (Not surprising, considering the oh-so-humble brand name.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-masterclass.png" alt="landing page trends - bold succinct copy by masterclass" width="720" height="378" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-69563 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-masterclass.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-masterclass-480x252.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /><a href="https://www.masterclass.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
<em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>The headline is the value proposition: Learn from masters at their craft quickly.</p>
<p>There’s very little copy on the rest of the page, because that’s the big, bold draw.</p>
<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><strong>Speaking of bold copy&#8230;</strong></span></p>
<p><strong> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4e3.png" alt="📣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Free guide: <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download" class="waffle-rich-text-link">The 36 Best Call to Action Phrases (Ever)</a> </strong><span></div></div></span><br />
<a id="norisk"></a></p>
<h3>10. No risk free trials</h3>
<p>We can admit it: Even as marketers who know the purpose of free trials and the importance of stakes to encourage a real product test and convert a customer, putting in your credit card information for a tool you want to try is annoying. It just is!</p>
<p>That’s why brands who can avoid it are doing so. We’ve seen a number of “no risk” or “no credit card required” disclaimers around email address forms for trails recently, and we think this is going to keep getting more popular. (Because it’s appealing, of course it is!)</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-no-risk-trials.png" alt="landing page trends - no risk free trial example by constant contact" width="720" height="387" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-69566 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-no-risk-trials.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-no-risk-trials-480x258.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.constantcontact.com/landing1/newsletter-software?&amp;cc=GOO-245720&amp;pn=search&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA8OmdBhAgEiwAShr40_vCfJizehCzZGeBmq3PhSW2l4Y9m8SBgaX0rszl_1MnSWycKXKt3BoC5l0QAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source </em></a><br />
<a id="howto"></a></p>
<h3>11. How-to sections</h3>
<p>While the goal of any landing page is going to be to convert visitors, the content is going to vary. It could be a free trial promo. An event or webinar registration. A product overview to book a demo.</p>
<p>All of these could benefit from a how-to section.</p>
<p>People like visuals and lists to break down larger topics. In fact, Semrush found that pages with lists every 500 words get <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/anatomy-of-top-performing-articles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70%</a> more traffic. While your landing page isn’t an article or a blog post, it is a page you’re looking to drive traffic towards. An<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website"> increase in traffic</a> that significant is worth a shot.</p>
<p>Take a look at this example from Lettuce Grow.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-how-to-section.png" alt="landing page trends - how to section example" width="720" height="317" class="size-full wp-image-69567 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-how-to-section.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-how-to-section-480x211.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.lettucegrow.com/the-farmstand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>The pictures are eye-catching and display the product even if I’m not looking for an in-depth guide. The copy is super skimmable. And it makes the product look accessible and easy to use.</p>
<p>Breaking down your product or service in these crisp steps with compelling visuals and skimmable copy will help communicate to your landing page visitors what you’re offering and how well it works—even when they’re not necessarily looking for a step-by-step.</p>
<h2>Test out these landing page trends in 2023</h2>

<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">The Complete Guide to (Persuasive) Landing Pages &#8211; With Examples!</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember when you were a kid and bowling was fun? That&#8217;s because you had the bumper lanes. All you had to do was pitch the ball down the lane and watch. The ball was pretty much guaranteed to hit at least one pin; it was just a matter of which one and how many.</p>
<p>Fast forward to your adult days and the ball is going into the gutter left and right.</p>
<p>Switch over to your business and marketing without landing pages is like bowling without the bumper lanes—a pretty unpredictable and oftentimes frustrating experience (unless, of course, you&#8217;re a professional).</p>

<h2>What is a landing page?</h2>
<p>A landing page is a page that a visitor arrives (lands) on after clicking on a call to action (CTA) for an offer. The offer can be anything (a product, coupon, free guide, or a demo, for example) and the CTA can be anywhere (like a Google ad on the SERP or a newsletter signup button right on your homepage).</p>
<p>A landing page is specific to the offer and provides more details the person needs in order to make a confident decision.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/what-is-a-landing-page-example.png" alt="what is a landing page - ad, landing page, thank you page flow" width="395" height="758" class="wp-image-63873 aligncenter" /><br />
<a id="landing-page-importance"></a></p>
<h2>Why are landing pages important?</h2>
<p>Landing pages aren’t just important—they’re essential. They’re designed to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/17/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate">improve conversion</a>, which is ultimately one of your most important metrics. How so? Well, if someone clicks on an ad for your product and lands on your homepage, they’ll have too much information and too many choices for actions.</p>
<p>But if they are brought to an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/effective-landing-pages">effective landing page</a> describing the features and benefits of that product only, with a button or form to obtain that offer right there, think about how much more likely they are to convert. This means that landing pages lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>More leads and sales: </strong>Higher conversion rates mean more purchases, sign-ups, free trials, you name it. In fact, businesses with more than 30 landing pages <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/15424/The-Key-to-More-Leads-Create-More-Targeted-Conversion-Opportunities-Data.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generate 7x more leads</a> than those with fewer than five.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher ROI: </strong>Whether you&#8217;re spending on ads, your website, email service, or something else, you&#8217;re getting more results for the same price— just by changing the URL the visitor goes to.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/importance-of-landing-pages-vs-leads-generated.png" alt="graph showing that businesses with 41+ landing pages generate 600+ leads" width="720" height="429" class="wp-image-63858 size-full aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/importance-of-landing-pages-vs-leads-generated.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/importance-of-landing-pages-vs-leads-generated-480x286.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t just stop there. When you optimize your landing pages using the tips in this guide, you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increase brand credibility: </strong>Whether it’s influencer endorsements, partnership badges, reviews, or stats, the trust signals you use on your landing pages build your credibility, regardless of whether the user actually converts.</li>
<li><strong>Create a memorable experience: </strong>Because landing pages are specific to an offer and even the user, the copy, imagery, and messaging are highly customized, making for a personalized and memorable experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, landing pages provide a quality experience for visitors and drive conversions using targeted messaging that matches each user’s needs.<br />
<a id="websites-vs-landing-pages"></a></p>
<h2>Landing pages vs. websites</h2>
<p>Understanding the difference between a landing page and a website can be confusing since there are different ways to create landing pages for your business. Some businesses create landing pages using their website builder (like SquareSpace) or content management system (like WordPress). In this case, the landing page is a page on your website; it lives on your website&#8217;s domain.</p>
<p>Other businesses use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/05/b2b-marketing-automation-tactics">marketing automation</a> (like Marketo, for example) to create landing pages. In this case, the landing page isn&#8217;t actually part of your website&#8217;s domain, but lives on a subdomain. So instead of the landing page being at website.com/ebooks/beginners-guide-to-saas, it might live at, say marketing.website.com/beginners-guide-to-saas.</p>
<p>While your website contains all of the information about your business, a landing page contains only the information specific to a particular offer.<br />
<a id="types"></a></p>
<h2>Types of landing pages</h2>
<p>There are as many types of landing pages as there are offers. There are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/08/event-landing-pages">event landing pages</a>, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/19/webinar-landing-pages">webinar landing pages</a>, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/05/product-landing-pages">product landing pages</a>, newsletter signup landing pages, and more. But in general all landing pages fall into two categories: lead generation landing pages and click-through landing pages.</p>
<h3>Lead generation landing pages</h3>
<p>With lead generation landing pages, the offer is not your final product or service, but something higher up in the funnel, like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/18/gated-content">gated content</a>. By providing their contact information to obtain the offer, the visitor <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/17/b2b-lead-generation">becomes a lead</a> that you can now follow up with, via phone or email, to nurture through your funnel into customership.</p>
<p>Lead generation landing pages contain a form right on the page for the user to request the offer. Upon filling out the form, they are brought to a thank you page that confirms the next steps—such as that a person will reach out to you, that the guide has been sent to your inbox, or that you can click on a button to download the file.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ebook-landing-page-example-donedone.png" alt="ebook landing page example by donedone" width="720" height="393" class="wp-image-63842 size-full aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ebook-landing-page-example-donedone.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ebook-landing-page-example-donedone-480x262.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/24/landing-pages-for-lead-generation">Lead generation landing pages</a> are most commonly used by B2B businesses or those that have big-ticket items, as well as by ecommerce businesses looking to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/05/increase-email-signups">build their email list</a>.</p>

<h3>Click-through landing pages</h3>
<p>With click-through landing pages, there is no form on the page. The page is dedicated to explaining the features and benefits of the offer, and when the user clicks on the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/13/call-to-action-examples">CTA button</a>, it leads them to a new page where the user obtains the offer. Click-through landing pages are typically used for bottom-funnel offers or sales, where the second step is the account creation portal, app store, or checkout window.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/click-through-landing-page-example-landbot.png" alt="click-through landing page example by landbot" width="720" height="411" class="wp-image-63841 size-full aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/click-through-landing-page-example-landbot.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/click-through-landing-page-example-landbot-480x274.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Click-through landing pages are commonly used by ecommerce and SaaS businesses, but anyone can use them.<br />
<a id="create-landing-page"></a></p>
<h2>Before you create a landing page</h2>
<p>Now that know why you need landing pages, it&#8217;s time to start creating them. But before you start cranking out those 41+ landing pages to get those 600 leads, you have some homework to do. In order to make these pages purposeful, impactful, and specific, you need to ask yourself:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What’s my goal?</strong> In an ideal world, what would visitors do upon reaching your landing page? Would they buy something? <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/27/landing-page-forms">Fill out a form</a>? Toss aside their keyboard, break out a harmonica, and play a sweet blues rift? The first step for any strategy is determining goals. You have to <em>define</em> conversions before you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/02/13/tracking-conversions-in-adwords"><em>track </em></a><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/02/13/tracking-conversions-in-adwords">conversions</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Who is my audience?</strong> Not just your general <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/target-market-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">target market</a>, but who is the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a> you&#8217;re reaching with this specific campaign? Loyal customers will require different messaging than newsletter subscribers or cold audiences. The better you understand your audience, the better your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/02/landing-page-copywriting">landing page copy</a> can resonate with them.</li>
<li><strong>How are they getting to my landing page? </strong>A person arriving at your landing page from a Google ad will be in a different mindset than someone arriving from an email, or from social, or from a banner ad. Keep this in mind when coming up with the creative and messaging.</li>
<li><strong>Who am I competing against?</strong> Really, this is three questions: Who am I competing against, how are they succeeding, and how can I copy their success? Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so if your competitors are doing something that works, you should go ahead and do likewise. They’ll (probably) thank you for it.</li>
</ol>
<p><a id="how-to-write-a-landing-page"></a></p>
<h2>How to write landing pages that convert</h2>
<p>Once you’ve answered the fundamental pre-landing page questions, it’s time to write your awesome, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/08/persuasive-landing-pages">persuasive landing pages</a>. Landing pages should have a snappy headline, scannable body copy, a clear call to action, and a strategic thank-you page. Here&#8217;s how to write them:</p>
<h3>1. Start with an appealing offer</h3>
<p>Your product or service, of course, is your highest value offer. But you&#8217;re looking to capture leads, you need to make sure you have a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/15/lead-magnet-ideas">lead magnet</a>: something your audience feels is worth giving up their contact information for. This could be a high-quality guide, informative webinar, or even a discount on their first order.</p>
<h3>2. Create a strong headline</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/20/landing-page-headline-formulas">strong landing headline</a> takes different forms, depending on the landing page, the offer, and the CTA that preceded it. In some cases, it&#8217;s the same as the ad headline so as to make the experience as seamless as possible and ensure message match. This is especially important for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/quality-score">Quality Score</a> in Google Ads.</p>
<p>In other cases, it&#8217;s something more creative or evocative to capture attention and express your brand voice. These <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">emotional words and phrases</a> can help you out with that.</p>
<p>Regardless, your headline needs to answer the one question your users have: What&#8217;s in it for me?  When in doubt, a benefit-focused headline is a good first step. You can always A/B test and iterate.</p>

<h3>3. Write concise and engaging copy</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/06/how-to-write-copy-that-sells">Copy that sells</a> is clear, concise, credible, and compelling.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clear</strong> copy means it uses plain, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/05/conversational-tone">conversational language</a> that your customers use. It should be easy to read and organized with a proper <strong>information hierarchy</strong>. You have about <a href="http://www.interactivemarketinginc.com/landing-pages.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight seconds to convince users</a> to stay on your page, so it’s absolutely vital that visitors can capture the essence of your offer with a quick glance.</li>
<li><strong> Concise</strong> means it gets to the point quickly. It provides the essential information to inform and interest your audience and nothing more. You can always add more information at the bottom in the form of accordion-style FAQs.</li>
<li><strong>Credible </strong>copy uses facts rather than opinions and contains trust signals, which we&#8217;ll get to in a bit.</li>
<li><strong>Compelling</strong> copy means it has the right mix of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/21/features-vs-benefits">features and benefits</a> but also uses <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/22/power-words">powerful words</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Add a form</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re creating a lead-generation landing page, you&#8217;ll need to add a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/22/lead-capture-form">lead capture form</a>. Your form should capture enough information so that you can follow up in a customized manner, but not so much information that it takes extra time or thought to fill out. A good rule of thumb is to have seven fields or less. Name and email are a safe bet. Ask for a phone number only if it&#8217;s necessary. Then you may need to get additional details to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/25/lead-qualification">qualify or score your leads</a>.</p>
<h3>5. Follow up with a thank you page</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/23/thank-you-page-examples">thank you page</a> is essential. For one, it confirms for the visitor that they have completed all necessary steps. It also contains the instructions for obtaining the offer, such as checking your inbox or even clicking on a button right on that page to download the piece of media. And finally, you can use your thank you pages to introduce visitors to other resources or even a lower-funnel offer.</p>

<a id="landing-page-optimization"></a></p>
<h2>How to optimize your landing pages for conversion</h2>
<p>Follow the above steps, and you&#8217;ll have a good landing page. Follow the above <em>and</em> below steps and you&#8217;ll have a great landing page that converts. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/02/cpc-landing-page-optimization">Here&#8217;s how to optimize your landing pages</a> for conversion:</p>
<h3>1. One goal, one CTA</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, each landing page should have one goal and one CTA. Additional links on the page—like navigation links, footer links, or social share buttons—all serve as secondary CTAs that reduce the chances of the user taking the action you want them to take. Remove these or keep them to a minimum.</p>
<p>If your landing page is long, you can have multiple CTAs placed throughout that all point to the same form or destination, as with the example below. Also notice how the main navigation is removed from the page, giving the user just one option.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/how-to-write-a-landing-page-cta-example.png" alt="how to write a landing page - example of a landing page with one conversion goal" width="453" height="912" class="wp-image-63860 aligncenter" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4e3.png" alt="📣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Free guide</strong> &gt;&gt; </span><strong><a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download" class="waffle-rich-text-link">The 36 Best Call to Action Phrases (Ever)</a></strong><span><strong> </strong></div></div></span></p>
<h3>2. Keep it clean and organized</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, the information on your landing page should be prioritized so that the most important elements are visible above the fold (or before the user has to scroll), like the CTA, key benefit(s), and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">value proposition</a>. The rest of the information should be presented in an organized, skimmable manner, with plenty of visual elements to balance it out (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/31/f-z-patterns-landing-page-design">F and Z patterns</a> are your friend). If you&#8217;re optimizing for SEO, consider using tab, drop-down, or accordion-style functionality to include additional copy without cluttering up the page.</p>
<h3>3. Use trust signals</h3>
<p>These are crucial for landing page conversion, and there are lots of different types.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer quotes:</strong> Pull quotes from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/03/testimonial-advertising">testimonials</a> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/03/how-to-write-a-case-study">case studies</a>, or include <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">customer reviews</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Influencer endorsements:</strong> If confidentiality is not an issue, include logos of well-known brands who use your product or service, or quotes from influencers.</li>
<li><strong>Data: </strong>There are lots of options here, like “over X five-star Google reviews,” “trusted by X customers,” or “over x leads generated/money saved.”</li>
<li><strong>Awards and recognition: </strong>Do you have any partnership or certification badges? Any form of recognition or award from a third party helps build trust, including just being featured in a publication or being a finalist, even if you didn’t win.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/landing-page-example-loomly-trust-signals.png" alt="example of landing page with trust signals by loomly" width="720" height="429" class="size-full wp-image-63831 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/landing-page-example-loomly-trust-signals.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/landing-page-example-loomly-trust-signals-480x286.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>4. QA your landing pages</h3>
<p>Before you make your landing page live, go through the process as if you’re a user. Read the page in full, fill out the form, and make sure the correct thank you page loads and the offer is delivered. If you have tracking set up, make sure the information makes its way into your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/09/crm-for-small-business">CRM</a> or database. Repeat this process on mobile devices.</p>
<h3>5. Optimize for mobile</h3>
<p>Speaking of which, make sure your landing pages look and function just as well on desktop as they do on mobile. You may need to make adjustments on the back end of the page so that things appear differently on mobile.</p>
<h3>6. Run A/B tests</h3>
<p>There are several components to a landing page that influence your users&#8217; behaviors. The headline, the image used, the button colors, even the button copy all have an impact. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/07/landing-page-test-ideas">Test your landing pages</a> regularly to find out what works and what doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<h2>Examples of great landing pages</h2>
<p>Ready to see all of the tips above put into practice? We’ve got some of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/08/landing-page-examples">best landing page examples</a> to better illustrate what makes a successful landing page that drives conversions.</p>
<h3>1. Free trial landing page example &#8211; CallRail</h3>
<p>This<a href="https://hey.callrail.com/call-tracking-software/"> landing page example from CallRail</a> is what I landed on after clicking one of its LinkedIn ads. Here’s what makes it great:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clean design:</strong> There are only 26 words visible above the fold, six of which are the two CTA buttons (which are for the same offer). The colorful graph design is appealing to the eye and the blue buttons stand out against the black.</li>
<li><strong>Compelling headline:</strong> “Know what makes your phone ring and smartly route inbound calls” gives me a clear idea of what CallRail does and how it can benefit me.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Trust badges:</strong> Trusted by more than 180,000 businesses, with three badges. Plus testimonial quotes from real customers.</li>
<li><strong>Clear copy:</strong> CallRail uses cards to explain its features and benefits, in super short copy.</li>
<li><strong>Button at bottom:</strong> Since this page is long, the CTA is repeated at the bottom of the page, with a nice, fear-based <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/05/best-call-to-action-phrases">CTA phrase</a>: “You’re wasting money on marketing. Find out where.”</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. SaaS landing page example &#8211; Loomly</h3>
<p>I ended up on <a href="https://go.loomly.com/social-media-software/">Loomly’s click-through landing page</a> after clicking on a Google Ad that appeared for “social media software.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/saas-landing-page-example-loomly.png" alt="saas landing page example by loomly" width="720" height="426" class="size-full wp-image-63830 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/saas-landing-page-example-loomly.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/saas-landing-page-example-loomly-480x284.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what makes it great:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Targeted messaging:</strong> The headline may not be the most compelling, but it reads &#8220;Social Media Software,&#8221; a direct connection to the query that triggered the ad to appear. Note that Loomly refers to itself as a brand management platform, so this is a great example of tailoring its messaging.</li>
<li><strong>Clean design:</strong> Like CallRail, this landing page has just one action, to start a free trial, with multiple buttons that all lead to the free trial signup form.</li>
<li><strong>Video:</strong> An embedded <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/13/explainer-videos">explainer video</a> on the page is used to outline the features and benefits. Studies have shown that adding video to landing pages can increase conversions by <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/02/conversion-rate-statistics">86%</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Trust badges:</strong> Testimonial quotes from customers, plus badges for awards from G2, Capterra, and Source Forge</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Signup landing page example &#8211; Lyft</h3>
<p>This landing page from Lyft is a great example of very minimalist, clean design.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/sign-up-landing-page-example-lyft.png" alt="signup landing page example by lyft" width="720" height="449" class="size-full wp-image-63833 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/sign-up-landing-page-example-lyft.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/sign-up-landing-page-example-lyft-480x299.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what makes it great:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prominent form:</strong> The form on this landing page is right at the top, and it only has one field, the user’s mobile number. There are more steps to the form, but this is a great way to reduce friction and barriers to entry.</li>
<li><strong>(Really) big headline:</strong> There is no image above the fold, but the headline serves as the focal point: “It pays (a lot) to drive right now.” Benefit focused, conversational, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/22/marketing-copy">compelling copy</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Information hierarchy:</strong> “Don’t have a car?” is above the fold, likely strategically placed to prevent drop-off from visitors who exit thinking they can’t drive without a car. Later on, you learn how it works, the insurance protection, and then FAQs. This is all necessary information, but it is presented in a way that is not cluttering up the page.</li>
<li><strong>Scroll-triggered floating bar:</strong> There is a lot of content on this page, but rather than having multiple buttons placed on the page, there is a floating bar that appears after a certain point of scrolling.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/lyft-landing-page-example.png" alt="example of landing page with floating bar by lyft" width="720" height="462" class="size-full wp-image-63832 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/lyft-landing-page-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/lyft-landing-page-example-480x308.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>4. Ecommerce landing page example &#8211; Blk &amp; Bold</h3>
<p>This ecommerce landing page example is from <a href="https://blkandbold.com/pages/subscriptions">Blk &amp; Bold</a>, a coffee subscription company.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ecommerce-landing-page-example-blk-bold.png" alt="ecommerce landing page example by blk and bold coffee subscription company" width="720" height="561" class="size-full wp-image-63835 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ecommerce-landing-page-example-blk-bold.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ecommerce-landing-page-example-blk-bold-480x374.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what makes it great:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strong headline:</strong> Never Run Out of Coffee Again addresses <em>the</em> pain point for all coffee lovers.</li>
<li><strong>Clear copy:</strong> Before you scroll, you immediately understand how it works in three steps, not to mention the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/08/persuasive-landing-pages"> power word</a> &#8220;easy&#8221; in there.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> On the bottom left, there is a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/15/website-accessibility">website accessibility</a> icon that when you click it, gives you options for presenting the information depending on your needs.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/accessibility-landing-page-example.png" alt="accessible landing page example by a coffee subscription company" width="720" height="559" class="size-full wp-image-63834 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/accessibility-landing-page-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/accessibility-landing-page-example-480x373.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>5. Appointment landing page example &#8211; Mr. Rooter</h3>
<p>Our final landing page example is from Mr. Rooter, a multi-location plumbing company. Here&#8217;s what makes it great:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Large, vibrant image: </strong>The full-width image of a smiling man (perhaps Mr. Rooter himself) heading into a job on a sunny day gives this brand a friendly, inviting feel.</li>
<li><strong>Information hierarchy: </strong>I landed on this page after clicking an ad for &#8220;plumber near Brockton, MA.&#8221; The location in the upper right-hand corner of the page reassures me immediately that I&#8217;m in the right place, and the contact number is extra large.</li>
<li><strong>Simple form: </strong>This form is five fields and visible above the fold, making it super easy to book an appointment.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/appointment-landing-page-example-mr-rooter.png" alt="appointment landing page example by mr rooter" width="720" height="361" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-63836" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/appointment-landing-page-example-mr-rooter.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/appointment-landing-page-example-mr-rooter-480x241.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you can see below, conversion rates vary by industry—apparel sees 2.77% while vehicles sees 7.98%. But one thing that&#8217;s true no matter which one you&#8217;re in is that a good landing page is a must if you want to meet or exceed your industry&#8217;s average.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/best-landing-page-examples-conversion-rate-benchmarks.jpeg" alt="best landing page examples - conversion rate benchmarks" width="720" height="525" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58470" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/best-landing-page-examples-conversion-rate-benchmarks.jpeg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/best-landing-page-examples-conversion-rate-benchmarks-480x350.jpeg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In this post, I&#8217;ve collected 11 of the best landing page examples from a variety of industries. We&#8217;re going to go over what makes them work, what I might change, and how you can apply the ideas to your own pages.</p>

<h2>Takeaways from these landing page examples</h2>
<p>You can catch our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/15/landing-page-best-practices">landing page best practices here</a>, but these are some of the key themes you&#8217;ll see woven throughout this post:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build trust: </strong>Include logos of your biggest clients, awards, review and testimonials (ideally with a headshot of the customer).</li>
<li><strong>Organize your information: </strong>Use not just font sizes, but colors, backgrounds, font weights, and the layout to give the reader a hierarchy.</li>
<li><strong>Keep the layout clean: </strong>You&#8217;ll see that these pages all have visuals, alternating background colors, F and Z patterns, with plenty of white space.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat the CTA in long pages: </strong>Long landing pages are effective, but make sure you have the CTA prominent at the beginning, middle, and end.</li>
</ul>

<h2>1. LinkedIn Jobs &#8211; sticky but nondisruptive CTA</h2>
<p>LinkedIn&#8217;s landing page below, for LinkedIn Jobs, takes advantage of the bottom right pop-out box common on social media platforms to include a non-disruptive CTA.<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/product-landing-page-examples-linkedin-full-page-scaled.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em></em></a></p>

<h3>What makes it great</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simple, clean branding: </strong>Not just the visuals, but the simple tagline at the top: Talk to the right people. Hire the right people.</li>
<li><strong>Data-backed trust signals: </strong>#1 rated in increasing quality of hire, 3x more qualified applicants, being preferred over a top competitor by SMBs.</li>
<li><strong>Testimonial with photo: </strong>Putting a face next to a testimonial makes it more real and trustworthy.</li>
<li><strong>CTA:</strong> There is a sticky &#8220;Start your job post&#8221; pop-out tab at the bottom of the page.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Next Bee &#8211; superb organization</h2>
<p>This landing page example is a great one to model after if you have a lot of information to convey on your page.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/landing-page-examples-next-bee.png" alt="product landing page examples - next bee" width="720" height="566" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58270" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/landing-page-examples-next-bee.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/landing-page-examples-next-bee-480x377.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/landing-page-examples-next-bee-full.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>View the full landing page here.</em></a> | <em><a href="https://info.nextbee.com/landing/v9.4/referral_marketing_platform.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go to actual landing page</a></em></p>
<h3>What makes it great:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefit-focused headline:</strong> Now this is a<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/20/landing-page-headline-formulas"> high-converting landing page headline</a>. Accelerate Your Referral Funnel is much more appealing than Try Our Referral Platform.</li>
<li><strong>Confidence:</strong> Show us a better solution &#8211; we will give you a $200 gift card</li>
<li><strong>Information and action hierarchy:</strong> We start with the ultimate benefit and most important CTA, then the guarantee and trust signals, followed by benefits and testimonials, and ending with more details on its features and then four more CTAs</li>
<li><strong>Page organization:</strong> Next Bee manages to pack 14 different descriptions of its platform features onto one clean page, using tabs and cards.</li>
<li><strong>CTA:</strong> Friendly orange (and nicely contrasting with the green) CTA to request a demo smack dab in the middle of the first paint of the page, repeated again in the benefits section, and then once more amid three others at the bottom of the page (request a free POC, get ROI analysis, get strategic advice).</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/landing-page-examples-nextbee-ctas.png" alt="landing page example - nextbee ctas" width="720" height="362" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58288" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/landing-page-examples-nextbee-ctas.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/landing-page-examples-nextbee-ctas-480x241.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>One thing I might change: </strong>Title case for everything interferes with the readability of the copy, especially the packed description below the headline. My brain sees them all as headlines rather than flowing information.</p>
<h2>3. Adobe &#8211; active words</h2>
<p>Adobe&#8217;s landing page example below is for Creative Cloud (and Billie Eilish?). The word choice on this page is the thing to pay attention to.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/landing-page-examples-adobe-for-students.png" alt="product landing page examples - adobe" width="720" height="576" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58272" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/landing-page-examples-adobe-for-students.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/landing-page-examples-adobe-for-students-480x384.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>What makes it great</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Headline:</strong> The 60% discount for students and teachers is the most prominent piece of information on the first page, and also matches the headline of the ad that preceded it.</li>
<li><strong>Price slash:</strong> Showing the original, higher price enhances the perceived value of the product and makes the discount that much more appealing (one of our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/23/influence-buyers-marketing-psychology">marketing psychology tactics</a>).</li>
<li><strong>FAQ section: </strong>The accordion-style FAQs at the bottom are the perfect way to add more information to the page without cluttering it up. This is the information that someone with the highest intent will seek out. This also works well if your landing page is indexed and you want it to rank.</li>
<li><strong>Active, interesting verbs: </strong>No need for exclamation points when your words are lively. Words in this landing page: <em>create whenever, make it then PDF it, share, make, paint, get inspired, stroke and be stoked, boost your skills, make the leap, take the stage, watch and learn.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/product-landing-page-examples-active-verbs.png" alt="landing page examples - adobe's active, interesting words" width="720" height="552" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58289" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/product-landing-page-examples-active-verbs.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/product-landing-page-examples-active-verbs-480x368.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>One thing I might change:</strong> The exasperated-looking Billy Eilish hero image. I feel like something a little more upbeat would help speak to the 60% discount mentioned right next to it.</p>
<h2>4. Unbounce &#8211; short and simple</h2>
<p>This landing page example for Unbounce&#8217;s Conversion Intelligence tools gives us some nice design inspiration.</p>

<h3>What makes it great</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trending design: </strong>mixing real photos in with illustrations and graphics is one of the popular <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/04/landing-page-trends">landing page trends</a> of this year.</li>
<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Not every landing page has to be long. This entire page can <em>almost</em> be captured in one screenshot. The strategy here is to link to a separate page with all of the features, allowing visitors to focus on the testimonial, three core benefits provided, and the demo CTA.</li>
<li><strong>Repetition: </strong>This simple <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/20/copywriting-techniques">copywriting technique</a> can improve memorability and strengthen your messaging.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>One thing I might change:</strong> Just kidding. No way am I going to make a suggestion for a landing page company. Plus, I don&#8217;t have anything!<br />

<p>This landing page example for BairesDev, an IT contracting agency, leaves us with some awesome <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/02/landing-page-tips-and-tricks">landing page tips</a>.</p>

<h3>What makes it great</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The communication: </strong>The three most prominent pieces of information on the page are represented in three different ways—large &#8220;Talent that delivers&#8221; text, a confident-looking picture of a man, and a contrasting yellow &#8220;jump-start your business&#8221; button—the perfect way to convey your messaging without overwhelming the user.</li>
<li><strong>The copy: </strong>The &#8220;dream-team outcomes without the hassles of hiring&#8221; flows perfectly and shows us that rhyming and alliteration don&#8217;t have to serve cute or playful purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Quantifiable trust signals: </strong>Super important in the IT industry. 10+ years experience, only the top 1% of tech talent, 91.2% customer satisfaction, 70.3 NPS, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Testimonials galore: </strong>Not only is the page packed with big-name logos (Google, Salesforce, Pinterest, Rolls Royce, etc.) but there&#8217;s a carousel of cards at the bottom with reviews from people in these companies. A great example of<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/03/testimonial-advertising"> testimonial advertising</a>.</li>
<li><strong>The form: </strong>Not only is it a simple, three-field form, but if prospects don&#8217;t know what they need, they have three options to choose from. Hovering over each option gives you a little more information. Also, the specific form title and benefit-focused submit button.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/landing-page-examples-simple-form.png" alt="landing page examples - simple form" width="500" height="563" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58291" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/landing-page-examples-simple-form.png 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/landing-page-examples-simple-form-480x540.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>One thing I might change:</strong> The delivery team/extended team blurbs beneath the hero image aren&#8217;t fully clear to me. Perhaps a verb in front of each or a repositioning of the CTA to cover both.</p>
<h2>6. Elite Martial Arts &#8211; emotional appeal</h2>
<p>This landing page isn&#8217;t as fancy as the others on this list, but it goes to show that you can still create an effective landing page without an in-house designer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/great-landing-page-examples-elite-martial-arts.jpg" alt="landing page examples - elite martial arts confidence" width="543" height="897" class="aligncenter wp-image-58298" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/great-landing-page-examples-elite-martial-arts.jpg 543w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/great-landing-page-examples-elite-martial-arts-480x793.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 543px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>What makes it great</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emotion!</strong> The key word in this landing page headline is confident, supported by the confident belt-tightening image in the background. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/01/13/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing">Marketing with emotion</a> can be subtle while making a big impact.</li>
<li><strong>Quantified trust signals:</strong> 100,000 plus active students, more than 1 million students trained since 1969, certifications based on 40 years of tradition and research development.</li>
<li><strong>The first paint:</strong> As a local business, the intent of visitors to this page (assuming the ad used <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/07/google-ads-geotargeting">location targeting</a>) will be pretty high. Elite is smart to include its address and hours right at the top so people can get a feel right away for whether this establishment will work with their schedule.</li>
</ul>
<h2>7. Powell &amp; Sons &#8211; local optimization</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s another small business website landing page that&#8217;s clean, professional, and covers all the bases</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/service-landing-page-examples-powell.png" alt="best landing page examples - powel &amp; sons" width="720" height="626" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58427" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/service-landing-page-examples-powell.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/service-landing-page-examples-powell-480x417.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>What makes it great</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local SEO: </strong>This landing page also happens to be the website&#8217;s homepage, and in this scenario it works. The page has done its <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/local-seo-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local SEO</a> homework with local keywords in the headings, body copy, and meta data and a map embedded on the page.</li>
<li><strong>The real photos: </strong>Rather than stock images, the photo of the kitchen at the top and the owner himself halfway down the page on the page are real and more trustworthy.</li>
<li><strong>Reviews WITH dates: </strong>This reassures me that the business is active with happy customers NOW. Not eight years ago.</li>
<li><strong>Skimmability: </strong>This page provides the immediate information visitors to this page are looking for without having to comb through paragraphs or blocks of text. Plus the form is prominent, making the desired action clear and easy to take.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ecommerce landing page examples</h2>
<h2>8. Houzz &#8211; eye candy</h2>
<p>This v. attractive landing page for a Google ad that appeared when I typed in &#8220;architecture agency near me.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/landing-page-examples-houzz-lp.jpg" alt="landing page examples - houzz" width="720" height="698" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58278" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/landing-page-examples-houzz-lp.jpg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/landing-page-examples-houzz-lp-480x465.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>What makes it great</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The color: </strong>The paint samples, contrasting with the pink/red logos, on top of the natural wood background is eye candy.</li>
<li><strong>The concision: </strong>This landing page has an explanation on how to use the service, quantifiable features, big-name trust signals, and reviews all in one clean layout with minimal words. The numbers and quotes speak for themselves.</li>
<li><strong>The clarity: </strong>Of course, finding an architect or building designer is not as simple as 1 2 3. But by giving the user a clear picture of what to expect when they enter their zip code, Houzz improves chances of them taking this action.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What makes it great</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The imagery: </strong>Vibrantly colored, mouth-watering images throughout the page make it look great while marketing the service at the same time.</li>
<li><strong>Conversational tone:</strong> &#8220;Top-rated faves&#8221; changes my perception, from that of a business marketing to me to a person telling me about the business. Plus the reviews stick with this tone.</li>
<li><strong>The CTA game:</strong> The page starts and ends with a loud and clear $80 offer with specific <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/20/call-to-action-buttons">CTA button</a> copy (&#8220;See meals &amp; pricing&#8221; and &#8220;Get $80 off.&#8221;)</li>
<li><strong>The &#8220;5 reasons you&#8217;ll love Freshly&#8221;</strong>: Not only does this also show the user how the service works, but the colorful imagery and Z-pattern make it easy and enjoyable to read.</li>

<p>If you ask me, events provide opportunities to create some pretty <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/23/cool-landing-pages">cool landing pages</a>.</p>
<h2>10. Borrell Miami &#8211; active design</h2>
<p>Borrell Miami is an annual local advertising conference that attracts 500 marketing executives each year—but you don&#8217;t have to be running a national campaign to use the ideas from this event landing page.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/event-landing-page-example-borrell-miami.png" alt="event landing page examples - borrell miami" width="720" height="555" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58305" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/event-landing-page-example-borrell-miami.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/event-landing-page-example-borrell-miami-480x370.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>What makes it great</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The design: </strong>The colors and curves on this page give it life and movement.</li>
<li><strong>Information hierarchy: </strong>All of the immediate details about the event are available above the fold, including the event hashtag and theme. Then the FAQs are next.</li>
<li><strong>Video from last year&#8217;s event: </strong>This is the best way to show potential registrants what to expect and highlight the most attractive aspects of your event.</li>
</ul>
<h2>11. Miro &#8211; skimmability</h2>
<p>Miro is a free online whiteboard—which is pretty cool if you ask me!</p>

<h3>What makes it great</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The layout: </strong>Although there&#8217;s a lot of information here, the layout of the page makes it easy for me to take it in. Plus the large hero image puts the second half of text below the fold.</li>
<li><strong>The skimmability: </strong>The topic, date, and speakers are made clear right off the bat. If I don&#8217;t feel like reading the intro paragraphs, there&#8217;s a three-bullet list on what I will learn. Nice <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/02/landing-page-copywriting">landing page copywriting</a>.</li>
<li><strong>The form: </strong>Four fields, &#8220;Sign me up&#8221; CTA (rather than boring old &#8220;Submit), and perfectly contrasting purple to the yellow.</li>

<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/04/landing-page-trends">11 Landing Page Trends &#038; Ideas for 2022 (That You Can Actually Implement)</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>So, the thing with all the “2022 trend” content we see this time of year is that most of it is too futuristic to be actionable for small businesses (non-fungible tokens, anyone?).</span></p>
<p><span>That’s why in this post, I&#8217;m sharing with you 11 landing page trends for 2022 </span><b><span>that you can actually implement</span></b><span>, like: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The best colors and copywriting styles</span></li>
<li><span>What NOT to include in your forms</span></li>
<li><span>The right way to include testimonials</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Check them out, take action, and be prepared for more conversions!</span></p>
<h2>11 landing page ideas &amp; trends for 2022</h2>
<p>If you decide to try out any of these ideas, don&#8217;t forget to stick to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/15/landing-page-best-practices">landing page best practices</a> like keeping them consistent with their corresponding ads, optimizing for mobile, having a<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/23/thank-you-page-examples"> thank you page</a>, and more.</p>
<h3><span>1. </span><span>Interactive, customizable experience</span></h3>
<p><span>I didn’t put this list in order and rank these trends, but this first landing page trend might be my favorite: interactive landing pages for a customizable experience. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/04/interactive-content">Interactive content</a> is a great way to increase engagement and time on page—both good things for your landing page performance.</span></p>
<p><span>More importantly, though, offering your landing page visitors the opportunity to customize their experience with your brand in a fun, appealing way is good for building customer relationships. That’s because people want personalized content. In fact, <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/4481/personalized-marketing/#dossierKeyfigures">90%</a> of US customers reported that they find messaging that wasn’t personalized or relevant “annoying.” Yikes. Luckily, you can avoid that.</span></p>
<p><span>Take a look at this landing page example from monday.com.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-ideas-trends-interactive.png" alt="landing page ideas and trends of 2022 - interactive content" width="720" height="260" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54409" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-ideas-trends-interactive.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-ideas-trends-interactive-480x173.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span><a href="https://monday.com/test/aw/swd/workos/?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_banner=%20SWD_Product_Flex_CheckboxSWD_1X1_Get_Free_WorkOS_EN" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></span></p>
<p><span>This is the landing page from a software-focused ad, and the copy already reflects this personalization. Then, the tool lets you select the templates you’d need to get a better look at how Monday.com could help your team—a fun way to customize your first intro to the product.</span></p>
<h3><span>2. </span><span>Conversational copy</span></h3>
<p><span>Most landing page trends are design-focused. This makes sense—landing page design is usually the first thing a visitor notices, and it’s usually the first thing to start looking dated. (Or, worse, when you think of anything that requires Flash.)</span></p>
<p><span>This year, though, conversational copy is a must-try trend. Check out PayPal’s chatty landing page here.</span></p>

<p><span>Opening with a question is an effective way to invite your visitor to engage, and the casual tone of “Want some?” makes these sound like more of an offer than an opportunity. Excellent way to encourage conversions with your landing page. Try adding a conversational feel to your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/02/landing-page-copywriting">landing page copy</a> and see what comes of it.</span></p>
<h3><span>3. </span><span>Explainer videos</span></h3>
<p><span>I’ll be honest, I was hesitant to put video on the list (it can’t be a trend if it’s more of an expectation at this point, can it?), but when you look at the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/08/landing-page-examples">best landing page examples,</a> you see that it’s not just any videos. It’s explainer videos that illustrate the product and its use. </span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/13/explainer-videos">Explainer videos</a> are short clips, often with a product view and voiceover, that walk the user through your company’s product or service. Here’s an example from Miro, a visualization tool that’s already using this landing page trend.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-ideas-trends-explainer-video.png" alt="landing page ideas and trends of 2022 - explainer video" width="720" height="389" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54411" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-ideas-trends-explainer-video.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-ideas-trends-explainer-video-480x259.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span><a href="https://miro.com/aq/twitter/mind-map/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=WebsiteClicks_Mind_Mapping&amp;utm_content=Consolidated&amp;utm_term=mind_map_left_old" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></span></p>
<p><span>Including videos is great for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/landing-page-optimization">increasing conversions on your landing page</a>. Explainer videos seem to perform even better. According to <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/state-of-video-marketing-new-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HubSpot</a>, 94% of people report watching explainer videos to find out more about a product, and 84% report being <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/23/influence-buyers-marketing-psychology">influenced into making a purchase</a>.</span></p>
<h3><span>4. </span><span>Customer reviews</span></h3>
<p><span>If you’re running a small business right now, you know that your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/online-review-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online reviews</a> are important. Whether it’s a social media shout-out, a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/16/get-more-google-reviews">Google My Business review</a>, or a suggestion on Reddit, an unsolicited positive view of your goods or services is valuable <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/01/10/social-proof-guide">social proof</a>. It lets you know what your current customers enjoy and, even more, it gives your prospective customers a personalized recommendation. And we all trust personalized recommendations more than even the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/03/ad-copy-examples">best ad copy</a> or images. </span></p>
<p><span>That’s why it’s not surprising that one of the landing page trends for this year is using customer reviews so that any visitor sees them right away. Chameleon does this really well—check out the header view here.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-ideas-trends-chameleon.png" alt="landing page ideas and trends of 2022 - chameleon example" width="720" height="260" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54412" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-ideas-trends-chameleon.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-ideas-trends-chameleon-480x173.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span><a href="https://www.trychameleon.com/go/g2-love?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_campaign=nov&amp;utm_content=low-tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></span></p>
<p><span>Here, Chameleon uses persuasive copy geared toward product managers and product marketers with some illustrated examples of in-app messaging. Then, if you scroll down, you see real reviews from G2 that are related to Chameleon’s in-app messaging capabilities. </span></p>
<p><span> <img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-ideas-trends-reviews-example.png" alt="landing page ideas and trends of 2022 - customer reviews" width="720" height="260" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54418" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-ideas-trends-reviews-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-ideas-trends-reviews-example-480x173.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></span></p>
<p><span>G2 is a respected site for reviews, and using the logo and reviews from here makes it clear that these are trustworthy from other product managers who probably know what they’re doing. With these targeted, trustworthy reviews and the personalized copy, Chameleon’s landing page is compelling for its specific audience.  </span></p>
<h3><span>5. </span><span>Email-only forms</span></h3>
<p><span>No one wants to fill out multiple fields to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/11/call-to-action-examples-for-email-newsletter-signups">sign up for a newsletter</a> or start a free trial. You don’t, I don’t, your leads don’t. That’s why in 2022, we’ll see even more email-only forms on landing pages.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>If you’re looking to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/10/high-converting-landing-pages"> increase your landing page conversion rates</a>, you should try out this landing page trend, too. <a href="https://www.omnisend.com/blog/best-signup-forms-conversions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Omnisend research </a>found that most landing pages use only one field and, even more, conversion rates fall dramatically after three fields. </span></p>
<p><span><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-ideas-trends-signup-rate-graph.png" alt="landing page ideas and trends of 2022 - average signup rate vs form fields" width="720" height="411" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54413" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-ideas-trends-signup-rate-graph.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-ideas-trends-signup-rate-graph-480x274.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" />And while we&#8217;re on the topic of forms, take a page out of our book of<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/02/landing-page-tips-and-tricks"> best landing page tips</a> and test the position of the form on your landing page.</span><span></span></p>
<h3><span>6. </span><span>Gender-neutral copy and gender-inclusive forms</span></h3>
<p><span>If you’re going to ask for additional information, make sure you’re doing it the right way. Gender inclusivity is important to keep in mind for your landing page design and copy, and in general. At WordStream, for instance, the <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/branding-grammar.html">style guide</a> outlines that “they” is used for a singular pronoun for hypotheticals instead of defaulting to a he or she. It’s important to keep this in mind for your landing pages, too, as gender neutral copy is quickly becoming an expectation for 2022 design. </span></p>
<p><span>Facebook has been doing this <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2014/02/facebook-custom-gender-options-here-are-all-56-custom-options.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for years</a> for users setting up social profiles, offering dozens of gender options and adding more as needed. Snapchat, on the other hand, doesn’t ask for a gender for its users. </span></p>
<p><span>Now, these are two social platforms, but it’s still good to keep this in mind for your landing page copy and your form fill options. If you need a title, then be sure to include Mx., and if you need a gender, be sure to offer multiple gender identities as well as a “Rather not say” option.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-ideas-trends-gender.png" alt="landing page ideas and trends - gender-inclusive forms" width="720" height="256" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54420" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-ideas-trends-gender.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-ideas-trends-gender-480x171.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.ruth-ng.co.uk/how-to-ask-about-gender-in-forms-respectfully" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<h3><span>7. </span><span>Animation with motion</span></h3>
<p><span>Video and interactive content can make your landing page more engaging for your audience—and we already know that we’re going to see more of this in landing page design over the next year. Another landing page trend we’ll see: animation with motion.</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/02/12/great-landing-pages">great landing page example</a> from Podcorn of how subtle motion can be effective:</span></p>
<p><span><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-trends-animation.gif" alt="landing page ideas and trends - animation" width="512" height="260" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54424" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span><a href="https://podcorn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></span></p>
<p><em><span> </span></em><span>The movement here is light, the imagery is playful, and the effect is perfect.</span></p>
<h3><span>8. </span><span>Playful imagery </span></h3>
<p><span>Playful imagery another landing page design trend to test out this year—particularly if it works for your brand. This means lots of line-heavy animation (like in the previous example from Podcorn), abstract elements (like the background of the Chameleon example above), and lots of bold color. It can also mean mixing animation with photographs or product images.</span></p>
<p><span>Take a look at ContentCal uses this last tactic for playful imagery.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-ideas-trends-playful-elements.png" alt="landing page ideas and trends of 2022 - playful design elements" width="720" height="345" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54417" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-ideas-trends-playful-elements.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-ideas-trends-playful-elements-480x230.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span><a href="https://www.contentcal.com/your-2022-content-tool-kit" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></span></p>
<p><span>Here, ContentCal mixes bold, classic colors with abstract designs with animated product images and photos of real humans. Together, these elements make for a playful, appealing landing page.</span></p>
<h3><span>9. </span><span>Early-aughts design </span></h3>
<p><span>In case you haven’t heard, the early-aughts are back. That means low-rise jeans, hair clips, graphic shirts, glitter lip gloss—basically many of the reasons I’m glad Instagram didn’t exist to capture some cringeworthy outfits during middle school or high school years. It also means the design aesthetic in general—glossy images, glitter, bubble fonts, bright colors.  </span></p>
<p><span>Now that the aesthetic is back, this trend is openly a throwback and that nostalgia is great for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">appealing to emotions</a> and attracting customers. This is what makes Glossier’s landing page design great.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-ideas-trends-early-aughts-example.png" alt="landing page ideas and trends of 2022 - early aughts" width="720" height="402" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54415" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-ideas-trends-early-aughts-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-ideas-trends-early-aughts-example-480x268.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span><a href="https://www.glossier.com/?g_campaign=TEXT_GG_BR_US_EN_Core_Exact_ACQ&amp;g_campaignid=975856517&amp;g_adgroupid=56897955548&amp;g_adid=563884149117&amp;g_keyword=glossier&amp;g_keywordid=aud-1472288481785:kwd-304992691388&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAkZKNBhDiARIsAPsk0WgZIlux1HRSm0fUJ43jfQ8febREYRAGGGcMZPJd94HxcXZCN2GxMWQaAoXPEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></span></p>
<p><span>The red and pink is thick, and the mirror is playful and adds shine that corresponds to the second part of this landing page. In that image, the bottles are bright oy glittery, they’re playfully tilted, and they’re sitting on a shiny reflective surface. Even more, though, the stacked graphics coordinate colors with the other images and overlap in places—just like the logo stickers. Well done.</span></p>
<h3><span>10. </span><span>Dreamy backgrounds </span></h3>
<p><span>We’ve gone over a lot of elements of landing pages so far, including the copy, imagery, video, design. But we haven’t talked about one big element: the background. This year, we can expect to see even more dreamy, gradients in landing page backgrounds. </span></p>
<p><span>Google made <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/02/improve-core-web-vitals">Core Web Vitals</a> a search ranking factor earlier this year, and there is another update expected early in 2022. That means that having a quick load time is more important than ever. Making sure your images are compressed and your page has lazy-load enabled are good places to start. A dreamy, gradient background can also add depth to your design without increasing the load time.</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s a great example of this in action from Starry Internet.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-ideas-trends-dreamy-gradient.png" alt="landing page ideas and trends of 2022 - dreamy background" width="720" height="340" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54410" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-ideas-trends-dreamy-gradient.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-ideas-trends-dreamy-gradient-480x227.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span><a href="https://starry.com/internet" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></span></p>
<p><span>Even though this blue is bright, it’s light and the peach that it fades into by the bottom contributes to the topsy-turvy dreamy feel—without adding more design elements. </span></p>
<h3><span>11. </span><span>Coral </span></h3>
<p><span>Pantone released its predictions for 2022: warm, familiar, comforting colors. At the top of the list for next spring? <a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/pantone-color-trend-report-spring-summer-2022-36978201" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coral</a>. This is going to be a landing page trend, too.</span></p>
<p><span>This color fits with some larger themes that we’ve seen here—dreamy, approachable playful, simple. The color is warm and light, which makes it ideal for a background or accents on your page. Or, you can go all-in, like the Recess does on its landing page below.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-trends-coral.png" alt="landing page ideas and trends of 2022 - the color coral" width="720" height="299" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54408" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-trends-coral.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/landing-page-trends-coral-480x199.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span> </span><span><a href="https://takearecess.com/shop/sparkling-water/the-recess-sampler?gclid=Cj0KCQiAkZKNBhDiARIsAPsk0Wh0s-cyeEuS1NiXfrY3TEvcEieG8YjKiexIefw5bIJ-YncjwR9oIW8aAkNSEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></span></p>
<p><span>I love this monochromatic look: the background gradient, the product colors, the reflection on the box and in the clouds, and even the button colors. It’s an excellent use of this landing page trend—and what could call for trendy more than a CBD seltzer right now?</span></p>
<h2><span>Try out these landing page trends in the new year</span></h2>
<p><span>That was a lot—animation, videos, backgrounds, forms. But that’s because there are so many ways to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/effective-landing-pages">make effective landing pages</a>. Here’s a recap of the landing page trends you need to try in 2022:</span></p>

<p>The worst feeling is when you think your work is complete, but it’s really just begun. You spent all this time prepping an email or building out an ad only to find out that, yes it’s working fine, but it’s missing something&#8230;</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/thank-you-page-examples-email-meme.png" width="400" height="472" alt="thank you page examples: email meme" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>Don’t let this happen to your thank you pages! A thank you page with missing elements can make all the difference between a fleeting customer and a loyal customer.</p>
<p>In this post, we share 16 thank you page examples that prove just that. And we’re going to have some fun by giving each one a quality score from 1-20 based on four key factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clarity</li>
<li>Next steps</li>
<li>Creativity</li>
<li>Level of appreciation</li>
</ol>
<h2>Our criteria for these thank you page examples</h2>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Before we get into the details, here are the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/03/thank-you-pages">thank you page best practices</a><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN"> we used in our evaluation:</span></span></p>
<h3>Keep it short and sweet</h3>
<p>When it comes to thank you pages, the more concise the better. A few sentences should do the trick. If you have more information to relay, you should have a follow up method in place beyond your thank you page.</p>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Also, there should be a prominent heading on the page clearly confirming that the user has successfully completed the action.</span></p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/thank-you-page-examples-wemod.png" width="720" height="387" alt="thank you page examples: wemod's short and sweet download thank you page" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<h3>Be clear and purposeful with next steps</h3>
<p>When users get to your thank you page, you don’t want them wondering “Now what?” If there are additional steps to be taken to complete the action, make these clear.</p>
<p>And even though they’ve completed an action already, now it’s time to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/07/customer-engagement-strategy"> keep them engaged.</a> Add in a second call to action, such as to:</p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Share on social</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Join a referral program</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Claim a discount</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Leave a review</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Download a guide or case study</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Book a demo or consult</span></li>
</ul>
<p>These are great opportunities to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/01/bottom-funnel-conversions">push your customers further down the funnel</a>. Whichever one you choose, make those next steps clear so you can get a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/08/10/increase-conversion-rates">conversion boost</a> and open the doors for further interaction.</p>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">For example, our content download thank you pages have a clear green button to get the guide and then a clear next step to try our free Google Ads Grader tool. </span></p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/thank-you-page-examples-wordstream.png" width="720" height="357" alt="thank you page examples: wordstream's clear CTAs" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<h3>Less is more&#8230;</h3>
<p>There’s nothing worse than a busy thank you page. If you’re including too many visuals,  callouts for next steps, or calls to action, you’ll end up with an eye sore that will just confuse viewers. In fact, multiple offers can decrease landing page conversions by up to<a href="https://www.business2community.com/online-marketing/the-50-best-landing-page-statistics-2021-edition-that-help-drive-conversions-02353338"> 266%.</a> So don’t lose sight of the purpose of your thank you page. Treat it like a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/02/landing-page-tips-and-tricks">landing page</a> and test out different variants until you know what truly works.</p>
<h3>&#8230;but keep it eye-catching</h3>
<p>While you don’t want to confuse your viewers, you still want to catch their attention. But with landing pages, you only have about <a href="http://interactivemarketinginc.com/landing-pages.html">eight seconds</a> to make an impression, and this number could be even less for thank you pages. Plus, people are <a href="https://www.office.xerox.com/latest/COLFS-02UA.PDF">80%</a> more likely to read content if it’s combined with bold, attention-grabbing imagery. So be sure to have at least one eye-catching element to grab attention in a pinch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/thank-you-page-examples-appleton.png" width="720" height="408" alt="thank you page examples: appleton's eye catching contact us thank you page" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"> <em>This thank you page uses appealing imagery and a clear white button to draw your eye to the desired action.</em></p>
<h3>&#8230;and on-brand</h3>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Just like a landing page should be consistent with the ad before it, your thank you page should be consistent with the landing page before it. To maintain <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/brand-consistency/">brand consistency</a>, be sure that your thank you page copy and visuals match up with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/10/content-style-guide">your style guide.</a> This means including similar colors, logos, as well as voice and text styling as your website or other company materials. </span></p>
<h3>Actually say thank you&#8230;</h3>
<p>While it’s great to get bonus engagement activity from your thank you page, don’t lose sight of the point behind it: to thank your customers! <a href="https://aytm.com/blog/customer-appreciation-survey/#:~:text=For%20customers%2C%20the%20best%20way,when%20businesses%20offer%20free%20items.">91%</a> of consumers say they’re more likely to do business with companies that appreciate their customers. One of the easiest ways for your business to do just that is by simply saying thank you.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/thank-you-page-examples-lewis.png" width="720" height="472" alt="thank you page examples: team lewis's clear confirmation thank you page " typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<h3>&#8230;and personalize it!</h3>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing">Personalized</a> CTAs convert<a href="https://www.graphicszoo.com/article/38-amazing-landing-page-design-statistics-that-can-improve-your-conversion-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 202%</a> better than normal CTAs. This means you should segment your thank you page offers to match your various <a href="/blog/ws/2015/09/23/buyer-personas">audience personas </a>for better results. You could also use automation to get the page to contain the first name they provided in the form.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/thank-you-page-examples-personalized.png" width="720" height="445" alt="personalized thank you page example" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<h2>Thank you page examples we can learn from</h2>
<p>With the above tips in mind, we’re now going to review some thank you page examples from across the web.<strong>: </strong>Let’s have some fun rating each one based on the elements below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clarity: </strong>Is the thank you page concise and organized? Does it clearly confirm the action the user just took?</li>
<li><strong>Next steps: </strong>Are next steps clear without being aggressive or underwhelming? Are they easy to take?</li>
<li><strong>Creativity: </strong>Does the thank you page have fun, eye-catching visuals or copy? Is it consistent with the brand?</li>
<li><strong>Level of appreciation: </strong>Does the brand say thank you in a thoughtful or personalized way?</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll assign a score of 1-5 for each of these four elements (five being strongest), so the maximum quality score is 20.</p>
<h3>1. Kuat</h3>
<p>The first thank you page example comes from biking brand Kuat.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/thank-you-page-examples-kuat.png" width="720" height="413" alt="thank you page example by kuat" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<h4><strong>Our thank you page score: 11</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clarity: 2</strong><br />
While “PRODUCT REGISTRATION” is loud and clear, the user doesn’t get explicit confirmation that they’ve successfully registered until they read the body text. But Kuat does provide support contact information, which is helpful.</li>
<li><strong>Next steps:1</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">Asking customers for a review</a> is a great idea for a next step, since reviews are crucial for <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local SEO</a>, but Kuat gives several different options and doesn’t link to them, so there is almost zero chance the user will take this action.</li>
<li><strong>Creativity: 4</strong><br />
The page is on-brand and uses a creative and eye-catching image, but the copy is slightly bland.</li>
<li><strong>Level of appreciation: 4</strong><br />
Kuat says thanks in the body text, but could replace the “PRODUCT REGISTRATION” heading with “Thanks for registering your product!” But it does express appreciation for its customers’ support in the bold text.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Kickresume</h3>
<p>This Kickresume thank you page example confirms an ebook send.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/thank-you-page-examples-kickresume.png" width="720" height="257" alt="thank you page examples: kickresume simple page" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.mailmunch.com/blog/thank-you-page-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<h4><strong>Our thank you page score: 12</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organization: 5</strong><br />
This is the perfect example of a sweet and simple thank you page. “Your book is on the way!” confirms the action taken and adds a level of excitement. However, calling it a &#8220;book&#8221; could confuse viewers, since this is for an ebook, and it could have mentioned when and where users can expect it.</li>
<li><strong>Next steps: 4</strong><br />
The next step—to share the ebook on social—is clear and the buttons to share are put right below for ease of access.</li>
<li><strong>Creativity: 3 </strong><br />
The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/05/best-call-to-action-phrases">call-to-action phrase</a> is creative, and encouraging users to help their friends get a dream job is a clever way of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/01/13/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing">marketing with emotion</a>. Otherwise the page is blank and bland.</li>
<li><strong>Level of appreciation: 0</strong><br />
Kickresume forgot to thank its customers! It could have said something like “Thanks for letting us help you!” or &#8220;Thanks for downloading the ebook!&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. SimplyMeasured</h3>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">This SimplyMeasured thank you page example is for a free reporting guide download.</span></p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/thank-you-page-examples-simplymeasured.png" width="720" height="347" alt="thank you page examples: simplymeasured guide download" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.mailmunch.com/blog/thank-you-page-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<h4><strong>Our thank you page score: 15</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organization: 5</strong><br />
This page confirms that the user has completed the required action and tells them how to obtain the guide without any fluff. And kudos to them for calling out a potential <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/28/pain-points">customer pain point</a> when receiving their guide and how to resolve it if needed.</li>
<li><strong>Next steps: 2</strong><br />
By keeping the navigation bar, SimplyMeasured offers another CTA at the top (to request a demo), but could have pointed to it a bit more clearly.</li>
<li><strong>Creativity: 3.</strong> The visual of its dashboards is eye-catching without being distracting, and brand consistency is clear here, but the copy doesn’t feel super friendly or compelling.</li>
<li><strong>Level of appreciation: 5 </strong><br />
Saying thank you twice never hurts!</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Content Marketing Institute</h3>
<p>Content Marketing Institute had this thank you page  for folks who signed up to download specific courses.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/thank-you-page-example-content-marketing-institute.png" width="600" height="1040" alt="content marketing institute thank you page example" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/6117/thank-you-come-again-best-practices-for-thank-you-pages.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<h4><strong> Our thank you page score: 14</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clarity: 5</strong><br />
Am I surprised that a content marketing brand thank you page embodied <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/06/how-to-write-copy-that-sells#clearcopy">crystal clear copywriting</a>? Not in the slightest. CMI makes its thank you clear with a black, bolded headline and then provides the link to download the course with “as promised” right after it. It also reinforces what, exactly, the user just downloaded with multiple mentions of the course name.</li>
<li><strong>Next steps: 1</strong><br />
People love to follow trends, so the suggestions of other popular content is a nice touch. However, there are three options to download, plus an event registration CTA, and each offer is the same color and size as the CTA to download the intended course. And then there are the options in the navigation bar. So while the copy is cohesive and it flows nicely, there is too much of it for a thank you page and users could struggle to pick where to go next.</li>
<li><strong>Creativity: 3</strong><br />
CMI’s clean graphics here take the cake. The simple imagery to go along with the selected course gives a customized feel and the page stays on-brand. But as mentioned, the page is busy and overwhelming.</li>
<li><strong>Level of appreciation: 5 </strong><br />
Bold, black, and exclamation point—no complaints here!</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Wrike</h3>
<p>Online productivity tool Wrike displays this colorful thank you page after an ebook download.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/thank-you-page-examples-wrike.png" width="720" height="438" alt="wrike thank you page example" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<h4><strong>Our thank you page score: 20</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clarity: 5 </strong><br />
The content throughout this thank you page example is not only clear, concise, and organized, but the steps to get the eBook are also super easy—they can even click the button to view the guide right in their browser.</li>
<li><strong>Next steps: 5</strong><br />
In comparison to the CMI thank you page example above, this is a much better way of providing additional content. With less text and fewer options on the page, it’s easier for viewers to quickly make a decision. Plus, suggesting related resources that don’t require a download may convert better since these people have already completed a download once.</li>
<li><strong>Creativity: 5</strong><br />
Wrike seriously deserves full points here because it was able to make a visually appealing thank you page using abstract graphics—which is refreshing. It also keeps its viewers engaged in a unique way by suggesting content to take them back to the site.</li>
<li><strong>Level of appreciation: 5</strong><br />
Unlike other forms of content creation, thank pages are one of the few areas where exclamation points are okay. The big, friendly exclamation point at the end of Wrike’s thank you adds emphasis to its level of appreciation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Backlinko</h3>
<p>This thank you page example by Backlinko is for a newsletter sign up.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/backlino-thank-you-page-example.png" width="720" height="437" alt="backlinko thank you page example" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/6117/thank-you-come-again-best-practices-for-thank-you-pages.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<h4><strong>Our thank you page score: 11</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clarity: 4</strong><br />
<span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">While the user hasn’t quite completed all of the required actions, the page could still use a heading that confirms completion of the first step. </span></li>
<li><strong>Next steps: 4</strong><br />
The next step here—to confirm your subscription—is clear. And Backlinko is one step ahead of its customers with the reminder to check their spam folder. However, the screenshot of the call to action button in the email it is referring to could lead users to think that this is the button to click and is broken. And why so many steps to confirm, Backlinko? I know it’s the usual “go to your email to confirm,” but spelling out the steps like this makes it seem like a chore.</li>
<li><strong>Creativity: 3</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/30/seo-basics">SEO</a> can be daunting to some, so Backlinko’s mention of “<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/05/24/link-building-now">link building strategies</a>” and “<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/05/seo-strategy">SEO tips</a>” drives home the value of the newsletter and encourages the user to confirm their subscription. But while the content is strong and conversational, the page is visually lackluster and unappealing.</li>
<li><strong>Level of appreciation: 0</strong><br />
This is a multi-step process, and Backlinko hasn’t yet thanked its user for subscribing. Instead, it comes right out of the gate with an urgent and stern-sounding message.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Grimont Wines</h3>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">This <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/07/thank-you-for-your-order-messages">thank you for your order</a> page example by Grimont Wines is for completed purchases.</span></p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/thank-you-page-example-grimont-wines.png" width="720" height="382" alt="thank you page example with countdown" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://optinmonster.com/anatomy-of-the-perfect-thank-you-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<h4><strong>Our thank you page score: 17</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organization: 5</strong><br />
No complaints here! The confirmation is clear and the copy is organized and concise.</li>
<li><strong>Next steps: 3</strong><br />
Grimont Wines incentivize users to make another purchase with a 20% discount offer, and the countdown to when this offer expires adds urgency. However, it could have made this offer more prominent with bigger text and a link back to its shopping page, and the social share buttons on the bottom could distract users away from taking the primary action.</li>
<li><strong>Creativity: 4</strong><br />
The thank you page design matches that of the bottle which is aesthetically pleasing and draws the eye into the thank you text. And the live countdown portion adds a level of fun and excitement. However, the super-light text style is hard to read.</li>
<li><strong>Level of appreciation: 5</strong><br />
I love how the thank you is highlighted in the middle of the thank you page for an added punch of appreciation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>8. The Name Stamp</h3>
<p>The name Stamp’s post-purchase thank you page is a two-in-one combo with its note of appreciation <em>and</em> secret offer.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/thank-you-page-examples-the-name-stamp.png" width="720" height="344" alt="thank you page examples: the name stamp's clear secondary offer" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<h4><strong>Our thank you page score: 20</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clarity: 5 </strong><br />
The organization of this thank you page is on-brand for The Name Stamp’s site—keeping everything consolidated to the middle of the page to draw the eye in so nothing gets missed. And even with two large headings on the page, The Name Stamp makes both the completed action and the next steps clear.</li>
<li><strong>Next steps: 5</strong><br />
In comparison to the thank you page example above, Name Stamp promotes its deal more clearly. Using “secret” in their copy entices viewers because it adds a feeling of exclusivity.</li>
<li><strong>Creativity: 5</strong><br />
Emojis are a welcome twist to a standard thank you page. The emojis not only match the brand well but also help to make the appreciation and promotion portions pop.</li>
<li><strong>Level of appreciation: 5</strong><br />
Another super appreciative thank you page example with two thank you sentiments included.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9. Hubspot</h3>
<p>This thank you page example is from Hubspot for downloading a free ebook.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hubspot-thank-you-page-example.png" width="720" height="347" alt="thank you page example by hubspot" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/hack-your-thank-you-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<h4><strong>Our thank you page score: 15</strong></h4>
<p>Between the personalization, purpose, and pretty design, this thank you page is hitting (mostly) all the marks!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clarity: 5</strong><br />
Hubspot provides clear confirmation that the user has completed the action and how to get the ebook. They also bullet out the ebook’s highlights to pack a value punch.</li>
<li><strong>Next steps: 5</strong><br />
Hubspot is a household name for all things <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/22/conversion-rate-optimizations">conversion optimization</a>, so it&#8217;s no surprise this thank you page example is a top contender. Including the two action options next to one another makes it easy for viewers to quickly understand their options—but the bright and contrasting “Download” button color adds an attractive pop and keeps the visitor focused on the primary action Hubspot wants them to take.</li>
<li><strong>Creativity: 4</strong><br />
The visualization of the ebook and brand consistency gives Hubspot’s thank you page some flair. However, what really sells on this thank you page is the insertion of the user’s name to add a personal touch.</li>
<li><strong>Level of appreciation: 1</strong><br />
At this point, a thank you would be necessary because this person has already input their valuable information. However, the personalized name insertion can still make the customer feel appreciated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>10. RoboForm</h3>
<p>This RoboForm thank you page example is for signing up to use its free product.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/roboform-thank-you-page-example.jpg" width="720" height="445" alt="thank you page example by roboform" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/hack-your-thank-you-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<h4><strong>Our thank you page score: 10</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clarity: 1</strong><br />
<span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">The copy is brief, but the heading only indirectly confirms that the user has signed up. Plus, what did they sign up for? Why should they be glad they did?</span></li>
<li><strong>Next steps: 1</strong><br />
<span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">The action Roboform wants you to take is super clear: to join their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/14/referral-program-ideas">referral program</a>. However, since there isn’t consistency in capitalization between the two headings, it’s not clear that you’ll be getting one of their paid products, Roboform Everywhere, for free. Rather it sounds like by referring customers, you’ll be doing them a favor and getting Roboform everywhere.</span></li>
<li><strong>Creativity: 5</strong><br />
Roboform’s creative elements stay consistent with its brand and compliment its adorable robot mascot nicely. And instead of a standard “thank you” it offers a compliment to butter up its customers—which helps them stand out.</li>
<li><strong>Level of appreciation: 3 </strong><br />
This is not a standard thank you, but Roboform still gets points for still making users feel appreciated in a different way.</li>
</ul>
<h3>11. Educators for Excellence</h3>
<p>Educators for Excellence wraps up our thank you page example roundup with a page made for event registrants.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/thank-you-page-examples-educators-for-excellence.png" width="720" height="457" alt="thank you page examples: educators for excellence" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<h4><strong>Our thank you page score: 15</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organization: 5</strong><br />
The confirmation here is loud and clear. This is one of the few thank you page examples with contact information. For events, including a link for contacts is super helpful.</li>
<li><strong>Next steps: 2</strong><br />
Aside from contacting for questions, it’s unclear what Educators for Excellence is looking for you to do next. The three prominent CTA buttons are layered on top of all the other options within the main navigation bar and footer.<strong> </strong></li>
<li><strong>Creativity: 4</strong><br />
In terms of creative, this thank you page is clean with simple green accents—which is on brand for Educators for Excellence. However, with all that text this thank you page could benefit from a visual. Perhaps a compelling picture showing what to expect at the event.</li>
<li><strong>Level of appreciation: 4</strong><br />
While this brand also says thank you twice like a couple of our other thank you page examples, the lack of punctuation makes me feel like something is still missing here.<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Use these thank you page examples to perfect yours</h2>
<p>Use these thank you page examples as your go-to for your next thank you page brainstorm. And even though I covered a lot above, I want to leave you with some final reminders.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clearly confirm the action you’re thanking your customers for and tell them what to expect next.</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid to bullet out a few of your offer’s highlights to pack a value punch.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/28/trigger-emails">trigger emails</a> to send a follow up to your leads and customers post-action.</li>
<li>Think about what you can add to your thank you page as “icing on the cake,” like a discount code, downloadable coupon, or any other <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/13/sales-promotion-examples">sales promotion</a>.</li>
<li>Treat your thank you page as you would a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/02/landing-page-tips-and-tricks">landing page</a>! That means constantly testing out different variants until you know what truly works.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, keep your thank you page simple and engaging so your brand’s personality and creativity shines through.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The sign of a good marketer is not wasting any digital real estate. From your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/01/homepage-design">homepage</a> to your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/11/23/best-404-error-pages">404 page</a>, every part of your website should be doing <em>something</em> to help engage your customer.</p>
<p>The same rule applies to creating a coming soon landing page. These landing pages can announce new products or a new company—but the challenge is to create a landing page that gets your prospective customer’s attention without overwhelming them. Striking the right balance between revealing information and withholding it can be hard.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/landing20page20generation20speed20resized.png" alt="speed landing page generation" width="800" height="547" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>In this post, we go over what you need to know to create a coming soon page that helps you convert visitors into future buyers.</p>
<h2>What is a coming soon landing page?</h2>
<p>A coming soon landing page is a temporary landing page that’s announcing a new product or service. It’s meant to pique interest, but also to get your customer to act on something.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/coming-soon-landing-pages.jpg" alt="coming soon landing page example" width="800" height="428" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/create-coming-soon-landing-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>That’s right, it’s not enough if your coming soon landing page just announces your new service. You want it to also get a sign up (or some sort of action) from your customer. This means an email submission. Or downloading an ebook. Or registering for an event.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because launching your product or service is a party, and the coming soon page is the party invite.</p>
<p>That means there are also things you’ll want to avoid in your coming soon landing page. Here are two key things to keep in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t just put up a generic maintenance mode template. </strong>Every part of your website should be doing at least two things. By putting up a simple in construction template, you’re telling your customer that you&#8217;re in construction but nothing else. Stay away from coming soon landing page templates, and instead focus on making something that matches your brand.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t over promise or over reveal. </strong>Remember, your coming soon landing page is like a movie trailer. You don’t want to give away the whole plot!</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that we’re clear on what a coming soon landing page and what to avoid, let’s look at what makes a coming soon page a winner.</p>
<h2>5 tips for creating a winning coming soon landing page</h2>
<p>Here are our five best tips for creating compelling coming soon landing pages that will entice your prospects—and keep them coming back!</p>
<h3>1. Be compelling, not overwhelming</h3>
<p>With a coming soon landing page, less is more. The first message is: You’ll like this new product <em>because of X. </em>The second message is: To stay in the loop, <em>do Y</em> (as in sign up for our newsletter or product launch).</p>
<p>To do this, focus on your headline and a short descriptor. Both should speak to what you’re offering and how it’s going to help improve your customer’s life.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s look at how TeekTak does this in the example below.</strong></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/coming-soon-landing-page-example.jpg" alt="coming soon landing page TeekTak example" width="640" height="444" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/coming-soon-pages/"><em>Image</em></a><a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/coming-soon-pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em> source</em></a></p>
<p>The headline:<em> Your Freelance Business, Simplified</em>. This hits the right emotions. Any freelancer can tell you the hassle of logging hours and using different invoices for each client. And while that emotional resonance is felt right away, TeekTak adds just enough of a descriptor to put real-life examples in our head: Time tracking. Invoicing.</p>
<p>Then, TeekTak has a nice clean place to put your email address, with a clear <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">call to action</a> (&#8220;Join Waiting List&#8221;).</p>
<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4e3.png" alt="📣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Free guide</strong> &gt;&gt; </span><strong><a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download" class="waffle-rich-text-link">The 36 Best Call to Action Phrases (Ever)</a></strong><span><strong> </strong></div></div></span></p>
<p>Plus, customers who want more information can click on the CTA button “Play Demo Video.”</p>
<h3>2. Have only one form to fill out</h3>
<p>A coming soon landing page is different from a traditional landing page. A traditional landing page can get away with two or three forms to fill out.</p>
<p>But when you’re announcing the arrival of a new site or product, you want your customer’s focus to be laser-tight—because you’re only offering one thing: an email signup.</p>
<p>The more you give a user to register on your coming soon landing page the greater the risk of losing them. There are only so many things for a customer to do on the page. Let’s say you have a coming soon landing page up, plus your site has several other pages (About us, FAQ, Contact Us, etc). Companies have shown that <em>not</em> including those navigational links can increase conversion by <a href="https://vwo.com/blog/a-b-testing-case-study-navigation-menu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100%</a>.</p>
<p>This is because by cutting distractions the reader is focused solely on the core message of the coming soon page. So there should be social media buttons (more on this below) and there should be one form to fill out.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: Set up a splash page that triggers before the user leaves your page. You can set this to go off after a few seconds.</p>
<h3>3. Set a countdown</h3>
<p>While a coming soon landing page is unique, there’s still the same mechanics of getting someone who lands on your page to convert.</p>
<p>We’ve talked about how the  top 25% of landing pages can convert more than<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/17/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate#:~:text=going%20to%20go%3F-,But%20what%20is%20a%20good%20conversion%20rate%3F,rates%20of%2011.45%25%20or%20higher."> 5%</a> of their visitors. So don’t settle for other oft-quoted numbers, like 2% or 3%.</p>
<p>One way to help increase your coming soon pages conversion rate is to set a countdown. <strong>You can do this by setting an actual, physically changing countdown clock. </strong>Or, if you don&#8217;t know the exact date of launch,  you can be more general and say “arriving this fall” or “out in time for Christmas.”</p>
<div>
<div class="video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video"><iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NFWucjkKeRI?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
</div>
<p>The point is the same—a coming soon landing page can look stagnant and forgotten without a countdown. There is no context for the customer to understand how soon is soon.</p>
<h3>4. Make it shareable</h3>
<p>We like putting sharing social media buttons on coming soon pages for one specific reason.</p>
<p><strong>More than any other landing page, you’re trying to get the word out about your coming soon page.</strong></p>
<p>Your new product or site is likely solving someone’s problem, and so you want to create buzz about your new solution.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: Increase the number of social shares your landing page will get across key platforms by creating a giveaway. On this giveaway, customers can enter by sharing your page on Facebook, retweeting it on Twitter, or posting about it on Instagram.</p>
<h3>5. Make it mobile</h3>
<p>As of this year, over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50%</a> of all web traffic comes from a mobile device. That number may even be higher, depending on your industry.</p>
<p>But whether you’re targeting B2B or B2C customers, you want to think “mobile first” when you’re designing your landing page.</p>
<h2>Examples of killer coming soon landing pages</h2>
<p>One of the best ways to get ideas for creating your own coming soon landing pages is to check out great examples. Here are four killer landing pages that you can learn from!</p>
<h3>1. Arche Travel</h3>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/coming-soon-landing-page-arche-travel.jpg" alt="coming soon landing page Arche Travel example" width="650" height="438" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.seedprod.com/coming-soon-pages-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>Notice how the eyes go to the Subscribe CTA button in the middle of the screen? It’s great placement, because it keeps the user focused on both the intent (subscribe to our mailing list) and the message (take a vacation). If the CTA button was aligned on the right of the page, it’d take our focus off the ocean landscape. This landing page also has social sharing buttons, which is fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>How to improve this page:</strong> Incentives are important ways to convert people on your page. What incentive does the customer get by signing up for this newsletter?</p>
<h3>2. LandApart</h3>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/coming-soon-landing-page-landapart.jpg" alt="coming soon landing page LandApart example" width="662" height="511" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.canva.com/learn/coming-soon-pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>Here’s another striking landing page. Notice how these coming soon landing pages are very visually oriented?</p>
<p>If you’re launching a business or website, you likely don’t have very many images to share. Instead, you can use WordPress templates or plugins to create these very visually-first landing pages where the whole of the landing page is one crisp, clear, thematically relevant image.</p>
<p>One last thing about the image: Look at how the image matches the target audience. This is a site for people who want to camp—and when you get to this landing page, you know you’re in the right spot.</p>
<p>This landing page also touches on something we haven’t talked about yet: exclusivity. This is in a similar vein as setting a countdown. There’s urgency implied with exclusivity. One of the CTA buttons reads “Request invite.”</p>
<p>Now, LandApart may accept everyone who requests an invite, that’s not the issue or the point. The point is it creates urgency for the user, plus it gives more incentive to sign up. People want this, so I’m interested as well.</p>
<p><strong>Notice that this landing page has two CTA buttons</strong>.</p>
<p>You can request an invite (to join), or if you’ve already joined, you can proceed to the beta testing site. Think about, psychologically, the effect of this on the user.There are two doors that lead into a VIP lounge, one door leads to the VIP lounge where you want to be, and the other leads to the offices where you sign up for the VIP lounge.</p>
<p>These are mutually beneficial CTA buttons because the “Go to Beta” button serves as an incentive for the “Request an Invite” button.</p>
<p>There technically isn’t a countdown button on this landing page, but a countdown button isn’t needed. The same with social media sharing buttons. This landing page experience won’t be improved by being able to share it on Twitter or Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>How to improve this page:</strong> This is a highly-effective coming soon landing page. Well, <em>almost</em> nothing. It wouldn’t hurt to do a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/08/19/split-test">split test on the landing page</a> with different colors for the CTA buttons.</p>
<h3>3. LAB Petite</h3>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/coming-soon-landing-page-lab.jpg" alt="coming soon landing page LAB Petite example" width="650" height="474" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.seedprod.com/coming-soon-pages-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>We like LAB Petite’s coming soon page for several reasons.</p>
<p>First, look at the copy. “Are you ready for the best modern handmade goods for your little ones? From clothing to toys, we&#8217;re going to showcase modern makers from around the world who make great things for kids. Sign up below to be informed when LAB Petite launches.”This copy gets the point across, and it also directs the user to act.</p>
<p>Second, LAB petite uses a countdown clock on their page. We really like the countdown page here because who loves to be reminded how long until they can get what they want? Kids. It makes this site launch sort of an event for the family.</p>
<p>Third, this LAB Petite page has a strong CTA that resonates with its copy.</p>
<p><strong>How to improve this page: </strong>We notice LAB Petite is leveraging social media buttons, which is great. But to get a customer to share this on Twitter or Instagram, we think they need to offer an incentive. The incentive could be a coupon or a raffle or a limited offering of a gift with purchases over a certain amount.</p>
<h3>4. App Manager 5.0</h3>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/coming-soon-landing-page-app-manager.jpg" alt="coming soon landing page App Manager 5.0 example" width="650" height="419" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blog.wishpond.com/post/115675436858/coming-soon-page" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>This is a great example of a landing page when you don’t have a stock image that can be used, and you don’t want to just show someone with their phone. App Manager 5.0 created a simple, easy to understand graphic that illustrates the features of their app.</p>
<p>The CTA button is slightly exclusive: “<em>Get on the List!”</em></p>
<p>The copy offers an incentive: if you get early access, you’ll get perks that are only available for their early subscribers.</p>
<p><strong>How to improve this page:</strong> No recommendations here! This page has a great CTA. It has a clear and compelling copy. It offers an incentive and creates urgency with its countdown. A+</p>
<h2>What comes after the coming soon landing page?</h2>
<p>The coming soon page—in case it wasn’t obvious—is the very beginning of the relationship between you and your customer. You don’t just set up a coming soon page and call it a day. The point Is to attract interest, increase brand awareness, get new email subscribers, and more.</p>
<p>So what comes after the coming soon page? Emails.</p>
<h3>Email sequences to follow up on your coming soon landing page</h3>
<p>A coming soon page ought to get you some information from your customer. In this day and age, ideally you’ll get an email address. You want an email list of potential customers: <a href="https://www.salecycle.com/blog/stats/18-essential-email-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">59%</a> of customers said email marketing has motivated them to make a purchase.</p>
<p>Now you can communicate updates to your potential customer—customers who showed an interest. You can create an automated sequence that increases as the date gets closer and closer to the launch date.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/coming-soon-landing-page-email.jpg" alt="coming soon landing page follow-up email example" width="403" height="516" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.appcues.com/blog/product-launch-emails" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<p>You can share updates on construction (if you’re making a physical product). You can share updates on new features or added accessories.</p>
<p>By leveraging the information you got on the coming soon landing page, you can increase the likelihood of having a successful launch.</p>
<h2>Now, create your own killer coming soon landing page!</h2>
<p>We hope you enjoyed this guide on creating killer coming soon landing pages. To recap, you want to:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Be compelling, not overwhelming</strong>. Your coming soon page is a short teaser, not a full commercial. Get to the main benefit quickly, but don’t oversell.</li>
<li><strong>Have only one form to fill out</strong>. Streamline the process and ask only for what’s most important—the customer’s email.</li>
<li><strong>Set a countdown</strong>. If you don’t want a physical countdown timer on your page, that’s fine. Just mention in the copy a general idea of when you’re launching.</li>
<li><strong>Make it shareable</strong>. Make sure your landing page is shareable. But, also give your customer an incentive to share it.</li>
<li><strong>Make it mobile</strong>. Make your CTA button big and appealing on mobile.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the world of marketing, a webinar can be one of the most powerful tools in your arsenal. There&#8217;s a simple reason for that. <strong>Webinars allow you to connect directly with your audience, establishing your credibility in the field and associating your business with that topic in the minds of your prospective customers. </strong></p>
<p>By running a webinar for your audience, you accomplish three things.</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Command the attention of your audience</li>
<li>Educate them on your industry</li>
<li>Build a relationship with prospects</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these factors build trust as you present your product in a transparent manner.</p>
<p>While this sounds all great, what if nobody shows up?</p>
<p>Even the world&#8217;s most prolific webinar host needs an audience. Without an audience, there&#8217;s really no point. It&#8217;s the proverbial tree falling in the woods with no one around to hear it.</p>
<p>The good news: You can skyrocket your attendees by using a customized webinar landing page that is specifically designed to encourage visitors to register. Five key steps go into creating a high-converting webinar landing page, and we’ll be covering all of <a>them.</a></p>

<h2>1. Define your target audience</h2>
<p>Figuring out your target audience for your webinar can be identified through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/31/detailed-demographics">demographic research</a>.</p>
<p>Ask things like:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>What is the age range I’d like to target?</li>
<li>Is there a certain gender this would resonate with?</li>
<li>Where do they live?</li>
<li>What are the pain points that I&#8217;m trying to alleviate for them?</li>
<li>Are there any interests my target audience has in common?</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you know the answers to these questions, you&#8217;ll be able to reach out to them in more targeted ways.</p>
<p>One strategy for getting noticed by your intended audience is through search engine optimization, or SEO, but results from SEO take time. With webinar promotion, time isn’t always available.</p>
<p>If you want a more immediate return, consider running paid ads through Facebook or Google. Not only do these services push your content out immediately, but they also give you advanced targeting criteria, which allows you to zero in on your preferred audience. You can target by age, gender, geographic location, interests, and more.</p>

</div>
<p>Sounds great, right? But don’t get too excited yet—we’re just getting started.</p>
<h2>2. Optimize your headers</h2>
<p>The headlines and subheads on each landing page are essential to your success. Keep in mind that although <a href="https://copyblogger.com/magnetic-headlines/">80% of people</a> may read your headline, <a href="https://copyblogger.com/magnetic-headlines/">only 20%</a> continue to read the rest.</p>
<p>That means your headline needs to be dynamic, and your subheads should continue to pull the reader down the page. Remember, if your headline hooks the reader, they are more likely to skim down to your offer.</p>
<p>So <em>how</em> do you create an engaging headline?</p>
<p>Employ some of these proven tips.</p>
<ul>
<li>Include numbers in your headline. Think &#8220;7 Secrets&#8221; or &#8220;The Top 10,” or even “5 Steps” like yours truly put up here.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t be salesy. Highlight the problem you&#8217;re trying to solve and do just that. No one’s coming to hear your sales pitch.</li>
<li>Make your headline a question. This is not only great for search queries but it also captures the attention of the audience.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to subheaders, you want to make sure that you&#8217;re clear regarding your subject matter. You&#8217;re trying to encourage the reader to continue, but it&#8217;s also a perfect opportunity to sneak in some keywords.</p>
<p>Subheads also help your overall readability. Breaking the copy up makes it easier to digest. When you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/01/02/5-web-writing-tips">outline your content</a> (you should be outlining your content before drafting), be sure to include your subheads.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a great example from the retail giant Best Buy.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="52fe3f5e-1855-4cb5-a3ca-1b739b6591a6" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/better20webinar20landing20pages20best20buy20example_0.png" alt="better webinar landing pages best buy example" width="800" height="1009" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>As you can see, the headline is not only effective, but it is branded with their instantly recognizable logo. The subheads help to create a visible hierarchy of content, drawing the subject down the page effortlessly.</p>
<h2>3. Write quality copy</h2>
<p>If you can move people past the headline, you may have won the battle, but the war is still far from over. If your landing page copy is stale, dry, or full of errors, you&#8217;ll lose the reader.</p>
<p>Don’t oversell the webinar as the be-all-end-all of information. That&#8217;s going to come off like a sales pitch, and you don&#8217;t want that. Do emphasize your unique <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">value proposition</a>. Why is it important for them to attend your webinar? What will they get out of it?</p>
<p>Try to be consistent with your messaging throughout the entire page. You want to keep your benefits and selling points the same throughout the webinar landing page. Remember, you are selling one thing: the webinar.</p>
<p>The webinar landing page is also a great place to include some social proof. If you have customers who have attended your webinars in the past who are willing to provide you with a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/19/customer-testimonial-examples">glowing testimonial</a>, make sure that you use it. Website visitors will believe the word of a peer over the word of a business any day.</p>
<p>Remember, the copy should feel conversational. It should feel like a one-way conversation that you&#8217;re having with the reader. Don&#8217;t be afraid to lean into that connection by using words like &#8220;you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Make sure you&#8217;re <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/11/06/content-editing">editing</a> and proofreading your copy to catch any significant errors. Use a service like Grammarly, or another specialized checking tool to ensure that your content grammatically correct—and that you have not committed any cases of unintentional plagiarism.</p>
<p>Finally, while we&#8217;ve talked a lot about using keywords effectively, you don&#8217;t want to force them into your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/02/landing-page-copywriting">landing page copy</a>. Keyword stuffing not only makes your text awkward; it is something that Google looks explicitly for when penalizing a website&#8217;s SEO score.</p>
<p>This example from Forrester showcases quality copy in action.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="309d0168-84cf-449c-96ef-4a198b49b2c5" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/better20webinar20landing20pages20forrester20example_0.png" alt="better webinar landing pages forrester example" width="800" height="852" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>The paragraphs are short and easy to read. Bullet points break up the copy, too; the structure provides a clear description of the webinar and what it will be covering.</p>
<h2>4. Use images and videos</h2>
<p>No one wants to look at a massive block of text. You have to use some style and flair in your page&#8217;s design. Media, like images and teaser videos, can do a lot to pull a page together.</p>
<p>Now, we&#8217;re not saying to fill your page with a cluster of images or videos. When creating a landing page, it&#8217;s best to keep them limited. However, the photos or videos that you do use should pop to draw the reader in.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a classic case of quality over quantity: Your media should be relevant and speak to the wants and needs of the customer. A video of the presenter explaining your webinar could also go a long way toward establishing credibility. Headshots of your speakers are another great inclusion.</p>
<p>For a prime example of compelling imagery, check out this example from HCL Tech.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="8bd6af54-161e-4516-baf8-b9663708c3f5" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/better20webinar20landing20pages20HCL20example_0.png" alt="better webinar landing pages HCL example" width="800" height="826" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>The header image sets the tone for the audience. After all, reviewing information on a mobile tablet while sipping coffee is something most business professionals can relate to. Right?</p>
<p>The professional black and white headshots of the speakers help to convey authority and helps to complement the overall page.</p>
<p>This example from Network Marketing Pro shows how to use video effectively.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="2855a4d4-fd40-4ac4-9dfc-9ead5e314fc7" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/better20webinar20landing20pages20network20marketing20pro20example_0.png" alt="better webinar landing pages network marketing pro example" width="800" height="759" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>As you can see, the teaser video takes up a large amount of space on the page. Since people digest video content more easily, this makes for a bold, yet effective approach. Combine this with a compelling headline, date and time, minimal copy, and an effective call to action, and you’ve got a recipe for success.</p>
<h2>5. Include a strong call to action</h2>
<p>Your call to action, or CTA, is perhaps the most critical element of your webinar landing page. The CTA button is what allows potential attendees to join the webinar and say, “yes, I’m in!” A strong CTA is essential to increasing your click-through rate.</p>
<p>As such, you have to make sure that the CTA button is large enough to be noticed without dominating the page. If someone likes the idea of your webinar but can&#8217;t find the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/20/call-to-action-buttons">CTA button</a>, you&#8217;re not likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Consider using a contrasting color for your Call To Action to make it stand out against the page. This will draw the customer&#8217;s eye to the button, which should feature copy written in the customer&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a good idea to include a sign-up form on the page, with required form fields highlighted.</p>
<p>These CTA tips can help you achieve a higher conversion rate:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CTA button should be large and link to your opt-in form.</li>
<li>Ensure that the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/03/website-color-scheme">color scheme</a> pulls attention but doesn&#8217;t clash with the rest of the webinar landing page design.</li>
<li>Place the CTA button above the fold. That means the reader should not have to scroll down the page in order to see the button and access your webinar registration form.</li>
<li>Consider adding some subtle clues such as an arrow pointing to the button.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t try to shoehorn your services into the call to action. Products and offers can come at a later time. The landing page intends to get people to sign up for your webinar. Don&#8217;t scare them off by trying to pitch a product at the eleventh hour.</li>
</ul>
<p>This example from Mastin Kipp shows some masterful calls to action.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e2a2bcc6-5477-435d-be7e-9eb87e4066b3" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/better20webinar20landing20pages20mastin20kipp20example_0.png" alt="better webinar landing pages mastin kipp example" width="800" height="1033" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>As you can see, there&#8217;s more than one cooperative CTA. They work together to convert the visitor at the beginning and end of the page. Also, they use some copy with an arrow right above the second CTA to pull the reader&#8217;s attention further.</p>
<h2>Get registrants with killer webinar landing pages!</h2>
<p>Landing pages are a key component of a solid <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/05/webinar-marketing">webinar marketing strategy</a>. If you want to create a perfect webinar landing page that will have a positive impact on your conversion rate, you need to make sure that you&#8217;re keeping these five steps at the forefront of your mind.</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Target your audience</li>
<li>Optimize your headline and subheads</li>
<li>Write quality copy</li>
<li>Use images and videos wisely</li>
<li>Include a powerful call to action</li>
</ol>
<p>By doing this and understanding how these steps fit together, you will be able to draw in a larger audience for your upcoming webinar and leverage that attendance into lead generation and positive growth for your business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re in marketing, you’re no stranger to landing pages. We’ve all clicked through an interesting ad looking for more information and abandoned the landing page because it was too confusing or didn’t hold enough information. And if we’re paying attention, we usually take note of what <strong>not</strong> to do with our own landing pages.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/landing-page-mistakes-crazyegg-example.png" alt="Landing page mistakes CrazyEgg example" width="1813" height="873" /></div>
<p>But what about what we need to do to keep those visitors? Whether you’re using a plug-and-play solution like Marketo or Hubspot or Unbounce to make your landing pages or you’re having an in-house dev team build them out, you can swear by these 11 landing page best practices for better pages and, of course, more conversions.</p>
<h2>Non-negotiable landing page best practices</h2>
<p>I know, 11 best practices feels like a lot, but most of these are small details that have a large impact. Conversion rate optimization is easier than you might think!</p>
<h3>1. Align your landing page with the goal of your ad campaigns</h3>
<p>Now, I think landing pages are harder to create than ads, so I think this tip should be the other way around. But others disagree. Either way, when you’re setting up a landing page, keep your eye on the prize. What ad campaigns will drive traffic to this page? What’s the goal?</p>
<p>Based on that, make sure the language on the page echoes the language in your ads or vice-versa. If your ad says, “Get free internet! Learn how here,” then your landing page should explain exactly how to get free internet. Badda-bing-badda-boom, you have a new customer.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/landing-page-best-practices-align-ad-goals.jpg" alt="Starry internet landing page example" width="734" height="782" /></div>
<h3>2. Simplify your forms</h3>
<p>Though forms can be an important part of landing page design, I’m not going to dive in too deep since we have <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/27/landing-page-forms">another (far more helpful) post on that here</a>. But rule of thumb: Never ask for more information than you need. Try to keep it under seven fields of input. Appreciate white space. When in doubt, always keep it simple. You can get a feel for what your form should include these<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/08/landing-page-examples"> landing page examples</a>.</p>
<h3>3. Test your copy &amp; CTA</h3>
<p>Speaking of keeping it simple, let’s talk <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/02/landing-page-copywriting">landing</a><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/02/landing-page-copywriting"> page copy</a>. Anytime you’re writing copy for a designed page, keep the layout in mind. You don’t want your audience to be staring down a wall of text that they need to comb through to get to the point. When you can, use bullet points, headers, and subheads to drive your point home concisely.</p>
<p>But as always, test your copy. And test your CTA. And then <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/11/25/copy-testing">test some more copy</a>. And then test CTAs again. You’re never going to know what resonates with your audience until the numbers tell you the truth.</p>
<p>You’re going to have to trust me that this landing page has been tested against other copy and different forms and different CTAs. Turns out, competing in AdWords (without just raising bids) is pretty compelling.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/landing-page-best-practices-wordstream-landing-page-copy.jpg" alt="WordStream landing page example" width="705" height="816" /></div>
<h3>4. Keep the design straightforward and easy to navigate</h3>
<p>Have you ever landed on a page and just … gotten lost? It’s happened to me. I’ll be looking to buy concert tickets and all of a sudden, I just can’t find the “Buy Now” button because there are too many dropdowns and display ads and distractions.</p>
<p>Don’t lose conversions because of this. Your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/04/landing-page-design">landing page design</a> should reflect your brand colors and look like something you’d want to include on your website. Along with keeping your forms simple, you want to make the whole page navigable.</p>
<h3>5. Leverage case studies and social proof</h3>
<p>This tip is easy. Any time you can leverage the nice things your customers have said about you, do it. If you don’t have a large cache of compliments, you can lean on logos instead. Just make sure you have permission!</p>
<p>There are a few different platforms that will integrate with your landing pages to keep reviews fresh, like Yelp, Google My Business, and Trustpilot. You can even use simple embed codes. Keep these reviews at the bottom of the page so you don’t distract from the action you want your audience to take. These should be also related to the headline describing the action, or else your audience will get pretty confused.</p>
<p>Munchery popped in some reviews from Trustpilot on their landing page and magically made the section simple and appealing, without distracting from the action above.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/landing-page-best-practices-leverage-customer-reviews.jpg" alt="Munchery landing page example" width="700" height="617" /></div>
<h3>6. Keep your landing page mobile-friendly</h3>
<p>As is important for any marketing, you want to make sure your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/19/webinar-landing-pages">landing pages</a> are compatible with any device or viewable on any screen size. A lot of plug-and-play landing page solutions have this feature built in, allowing you to see common sizes before launching your shiny new page. Just a tip: Play it safe by keeping your buttons and/or forms toward the center of a full-size page with a single-color background. That way, shrinking and stretching on whatever strange screens your page may encounter is less likely to break something important.</p>
<h3>7. Make sure it loads quickly</h3>
<p>If you’re a marketer, you probably already have landing pages whirring away as well as your website. If you’re seeing a high bounce rate on a particular page, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/06/04/quality-score-landing-pages-faq">load</a><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/06/04/quality-score-landing-pages-faq"> time</a> could be the culprit. It can be easy to cut corners with one-off landing pages, but make sure nothing on the page is too heavy or big. Resizing takes up a lot of time. And when your landing page doesn’t load fast enough, it can damage any SEO you’ve done for the page.</p>
<h3>8. Put the important information above the fold</h3>
<p>Just like an email, you want to make sure when someone is clicking through, the important stuff is visible first. This is particularly important for highly actionable pages, like buying tickets or entering a contest.</p>
<p>Things you can put below the fold: any testimonials, case studies, or client logos. Your own terms and conditions. Suggested content (e.g., if you liked this, you’ll also love our guide on our to make your lead forms pop!).</p>
<p>This Guideline page does this really well; there’s minimal text, a simple form above the fold, and more details below.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/landing-page-best-practices-information-above-the-fold.jpg" alt="example landing page" width="750" height="703" /></div>
<h3>9. Update your landing pages regularly</h3>
<p>User experience and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/04/landing-page-trends">landing page trends</a> change. So like any blog post or site page, the content on your landing pages should stay up to date. If your previously best-performing ad begins to fall off, outdated landing pages could be the culprit. Even just a refresh of the background colors, a new CTA, or some fresh copy will prevent fatigue and signal to Google and any ad platform that the content is fresh.</p>
<h3>10. Add a thank you page</h3>
<p>Okay, it may seem like all these tips are pointing you away from confusing your audience … and maybe you’re right. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/03/thank-you-pages">Thank you pages</a> are just another step in this process. Once someone lands on your page and completes an action, give them a visual confirmation that you have their information, the wheels are churning, they have reserved a spot. This can come in the form of a thank you script: “Thank you. Your information has been submitted.” Or you can redirect to a full thank you page that features some of those special extras you may have buried below the fold on the previous page.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/thank-you-pages-examples-2.png" alt="thank you pages examples" width="1343" height="901" /></div>

<h3>11. Build your landing page for SEO</h3>
<p>This is an important one. If you need your landing page to have staying power, try to flex some of your <a href="https://instapage.com/blog/how-to-build-seo-friendly-landing-pages">SEO muscles</a>. If you run a blog (or your own website), you probably already know these basics. Here’s a review:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unique URL:</strong> Giving your landing page a unique URL isn’t just so people land in the right place, it can also optimize for whichever keywords you want to rank for.</li>
<li><strong>Title tag: </strong>This is separate from your header tag, it’s the title of the page. Again, plug-and-play landing page solutions should have an option to alter this (i.e., make it different from your header tag), just remember to fill that field out.</li>
<li><strong>Header tag: </strong>This tag is the title of your page (ironically). Whatever your landing page headline is, shrink it down for your header tag.</li>
<li><strong>Meta description:</strong> I know that a lot of people forget to fill this field out, which could be fine, but for landing pages, you want to. The meta is what google populates under your search result, and landing pages often have some … dispersed copy. So you want to tell google exactly what to grab and put out there on the SERP.</li>
<li><strong>Image file names:</strong> Self-explanatory, obvious, necessary. Name your images! Give them names that reflect the purpose of the page. If you can get your target keywords in there, even better.</li>
<li><strong>Backlinking: </strong>This is the final step, after publishing your page. Not only should you link to your landing page from ad campaigns, you can try to embed the link within blog posts, your website pages, hand it out to affiliate partners, etc. The more spots your link appears, the more google is going to recognize its relevance and authority.</li>
