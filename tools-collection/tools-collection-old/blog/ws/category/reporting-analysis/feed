										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cost per lead (CPL) is a significant metric in digital advertising. For pay-per-click (PPC) and social media campaigns, businesses monitor CPL to understand whether their marketing efforts (and associated costs) are worth it.</p>
<p>The more expensive it is to acquire a lead, the less gross profit you’ll expect to see in the long run, as lead acquisition costs eat into your earnings. Marketers and advertisers want to find the sweet spot between investing in getting the word out about their company and ensuring those efforts are as efficient as possible in converting new prospects into leads.</p>
<p>So, we put together this complete cost-per-lead guide to help with that. We&#8217;ll walk through how you can calculate and lower your cost per lead in a flash.</p>

<h2>How do you calculate cost per lead?</h2>
<p>To identify the best ways to lower CPL, it first helps to understand how it’s calculated. The cost-per-lead formula is pretty simple.</p>
<p>Total cost / total number of conversions = CPL</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/how-to-calculate-cost-per-lead.webp" alt="cost per lead formula" width="935" height="392" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85496" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/how-to-calculate-cost-per-lead.webp 935w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/how-to-calculate-cost-per-lead-480x201.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 935px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>So, if you want to lower your CPL, you have two options: aim to generate more conversions while holding your spending steady or decrease your spending while maintaining your number of conversions.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/26a1.png" alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Get more leads fast using our free<a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDL25LeadGenIdeas.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_LeadGenIdeas_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Definitive Guide to Lead Generation</a></strong> complete with over 25 tips, ideas, and examples!</p>
<div id="how-to-lower-cost-per-lead"></div>
<h2>How to lower cost per lead: 7 tips</h2>
<p>Here are seven ways to lower your cost per lead over time.</p>
<h3>1. Take stock of your current performance metrics</h3>
<p>The first step in finding ways to lower CPL is learning where you stand today. Crunch the numbers for each marketing or advertising campaign you have underway. This will allow you to identify any weak spots quickly. Is there a particular campaign that’s quite costly but not generating many leads? It might be time to forgo that pursuit.</p>
<p>On the flip side, you can ferret out opportunities for improvement. If you have a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/09/free-and-low-budget-marketing-ideas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">low-cost marketing tactic</a> that generates quite a few leads already, can you optimize it further to attract even more leads?</p>
<p>During this process, you might wonder if your CPL is good. It’s a fair question! Any CPL greater than the cost of your product or service is too high. It can also be helpful to measure yourself against competitors by checking out <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/search-advertising-benchmarks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPL benchmarks</a> by industry.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-cost-per-click-2024-scaled.webp" alt="google ads average cost per click 2024 chart" width="2259" height="2560" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-82730" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-cost-per-click-2024-scaled.webp 2259w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-cost-per-click-2024-1280x1451.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-cost-per-click-2024-980x1111.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-cost-per-click-2024-480x544.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 2259px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Once you’ve analyzed your campaigns and identified the ones with a noteworthy CPL—good or bad—you may wish to dig into that specific <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/26/marketing-channels" rel="noopener">marketing channel</a> even further.</p>
<p>You can look at things like CPL across devices (desktop versus mobile) or consider the parts that make up a particular advertising campaign. For example, if a PPC ad has a very poor CPL but a very high click-through rate, that&#8217;s usually an indication of a low <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/landing-page-best-practices/" rel="noopener">conversion rate on the landing page</a>. It’s worth digging into what’s causing your prospects to leave that page without converting.</p>
<h3>2. Rethink your targeting strategy</h3>
<p>When you run digital ads, a considerable portion of the work behind the scenes is setting your targeting strategy. For search engine marketing, you target certain keywords, while social media platforms allow you to target based on users’ demographic information.</p>
<p>Either way, your targeting strategy can make or break your success. Go too narrow or specific, and you severely limit the number of people who can see your ads. Plus, it can drive up the cost of your ads. But go too broad, and your ads will be served to many people who won’t find your message relevant.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/negative-keyword-examples.webp" alt="negative keyword examples in google ads" width="664" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85497" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/negative-keyword-examples.webp 664w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/negative-keyword-examples-480x434.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Google offers<a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2453972?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> examples</a> of negative keywords. </em></p>
<p>You want to find somewhere in the middle that’s just right. With PPC ads, that might mean adding <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2453972?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative keywords</a>, which excludes specific search terms from your campaign and helps you target only the most relevant audience.</p>
<p>For social media ads (like those on Meta), it’s about starting broad and refining as you learn more about what’s working. You may even consider creating lookalike audiences, which target Meta users who share attributes with your current customers.</p>
<h3>3. Try A/B testing</h3>
<p>To <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ab-testing-examples" rel="noopener">A/B test</a> an ad, you run two similar versions of the same concept with a tweak in one area. For example, you might try two headlines on an ad to see which performs better.</p>
<p>This can help you hone in on the messaging that best resonates with your audience, which can drive down cost per lead as you learn to run more efficient, effective ad campaigns.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/lower-cost-per-lead-a-b-test-checklist.webp" alt="checklist of what to include in a/b testing hypothesis" width="935" height="523" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85498" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/lower-cost-per-lead-a-b-test-checklist.webp 935w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/lower-cost-per-lead-a-b-test-checklist-480x268.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 935px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Some digital advertising platforms even help you automate the process. For example, Google’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/responsive-search-ads" rel="noopener">responsive search ads</a> invite you to input up to 15 headlines and four descriptions for each ad. Google then uses AI to serve up different combinations of your headline and description text to see what performs best.</p>
<p>Similarly, Meta has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1738164643098669?id=445653312788501" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an A/B testing feature</a> that allows you to run different permutations of your ad based on an identified hypothesis.</p>
<p>Take advantage of these built-in tools to test different advertising approaches and find the one that gets you the highest response rate among your target audience.</p>
<h3>4. Align keywords with copy</h3>
<p>This one of our seven ways to lower CPL is just as helpful for paid marketing tactics as for organic ones. Whether you’re running PPC ads or drafting your title tags and meta descriptions, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/website-copywriting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aligning your copy</a> with your audience&#8217;s search terms is wise.</p>
<p>The example below exemplifies this approach. These furniture companies, ranking in organic spots one through four on the Google results page, don’t use their brand name or location in the title tag. Instead, they all include some variation of the search term “small space furniture brand.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead-example-serp.webp" alt="example of ad with keywords and copy aligned" width="774" height="555" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85499" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead-example-serp.webp 774w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead-example-serp-480x344.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 774px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>These brands might not be as familiar to searchers, so instead of competing on name recognition, they lead with their value propositions: “You live in a small space and need furniture that will fit it? You can see from our title tag that we’re your retailer.”</p>
<p>When your online presence can draw searchers in with a promise that you offer the solution they need, that’s how you could lower your cost per lead. It increases the likelihood that leads will click through and make a purchase.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f50e.png" alt="🔎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Want help finding the right keywords?</strong> Use our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">Free Keyword Tool</a>!</p>
<h3>5. Strengthen your landing page</h3>
<p>Each ad that you run should drive to a dedicated landing page. You’ve worked to tailor your ad language to suit the keywords you’re targeting perfectly, and your prospect has clicked on your link as a result of that hard work. If they land on your homepage without finding further mention of what they came here for, they can quickly get lost, confused, or distracted.</p>
<p>Instead, hook them in with a customized landing page that continues to address their specific need.</p>
<p>Let’s say you run an ad to promote an upcoming conference you’re hosting. The landing page should drive to a page about that event, with a click-to-action (CTA) to register.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead-keyword-serp.webp" alt="ad example leading to landing page" width="788" height="609" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85500" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead-keyword-serp.webp 788w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead-keyword-serp-480x371.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 788px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/lower-cost-per-lead-cta.webp" alt="landing page associated with ad" width="739" height="434" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85501" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/lower-cost-per-lead-cta.webp 739w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/lower-cost-per-lead-cta-480x282.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 739px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>In<a href="https://vtmerch.com/collections/vault-2024?tw_source=google&amp;tw_adid=705817767517&amp;tw_campaign=21474775600&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw_ZC2BhAQEiwAXSgClm1m6VlYsBZuU_0ZKCHU39PYJYYmWA_ptZs5lc9xswAt4fRPFqgf3hoC4DEQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> this example</a>, the top sponsored result for the search term “conferences for investment professionals” drove to a customized landing page where the CTA invites visitors to “secure [their] seats.” </em></p>
<h3>6. Incorporate a lead capture form</h3>
<p>Once a prospect has made it all the way to your landing page, giving them a clear path to convert is another favorite way to lower CPL.</p>
<p>On a landing page, that means including a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/lead-generation-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lead capture form</a>. This is where you invite your prospects to enter their contact information. There are several CTAs you can try to get you there. The one that works for you will depend on your business, but you might try:</p>
<ul>
<li>Join our newsletter</li>
<li>Register for our event</li>
<li>Download our whitepaper or report</li>
<li>Schedule a call</li>
<li>Book a demo</li>
</ul>
<p>You get the idea. This CTA gives your prospect a reason to want to stay in touch and opens the door for you to continue to connect with them until they’re ready to make a purchase.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Download our free guide to the <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">42 best call-to-action phrases</a> ever</strong> to get ideas for how to attract more low-cost leads!</p>
<h3>7. Make the most of remarketing</h3>
<p>Remarketing allows brands to stay in front of prospects who have visited their website. Maybe you didn’t convert them the first time, but remaining in their field of vision gives you a second chance.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever had a display ad for a product you just viewed follow you across every site you visit for the next few weeks, you’ve experienced remarketing. And if you’ve ever clicked on those ads, you know why they work.</p>
<p>It often takes time for a consumer to get to know, like, and trust a brand. That’s why <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/e-commerce-report-shows-returning-customers-are-more-valuable-than-new-ones-2016-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly half</a> of all transactions on a website come from returning visitors.</p>
<p>If you follow a new prospect around for a few weeks with your remarketing ads, they may eventually come around. And the numbers on remarketing bear that out: studies show a conversion rate that’s over <a href="https://www.i-com.net/blog/remarketing-what-its-all-about-and-does-it-really-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">292%</a> higher for retargeted users than it is for new faces.</p>
<div id="lower-cost-per-lead"></div>
<h2>Try these tactics to lower your cost per lead and save on spend</h2>
<p>There’s no wrong answer here! Working systematically through the list and measuring each technique’s impact on your CPL can help you spot the ones most likely to drive desired results.</p>
<p>As your CPL drops, you can also return to the most effective tactics and look for further opportunities to refine your approach. The best thing about digital marketing is that there’s always room to improve, and you get real-time feedback to help guide your decision-making process.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google is constantly pushing toward more automation and less advertiser autonomy on its platform. Many times, this push for the adoption of newer, more “simplified” features means the discontinuation of older ones that everyone is used to.</p>
<p>One of the most recent victims of this is the discontinuation of first-click, linear, time decay, and position-based attribution models.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/traditional-attribution-models-google.webp" alt="traditional google ads attribution models" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77115" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/traditional-attribution-models-google.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/traditional-attribution-models-google-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/13427716?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google announced</a> the phase-out earlier this year, and we’re at the point where you’re no longer able to use these attribution models. If you have pre-existing conversions that you were using any of them, they will be switched to the data-driven attribution model.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for advertisers going forward? In this article, I’ll run through the changes and how they can affect your strategy in Google Ads.</p>

</ul>
<div id="traditional-attribution-models"></div>
<h2>Traditional attribution models</h2>
<p>Before we delve into future implications, let’s start by taking a look at how traditional attribution models tracked conversions and what the difference is between these and the data-driven and last-click models that remain available:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Last click (still available)</strong>: This model attributes all the credit to the final interaction a user has with an ad before converting.</li>
<li><strong>First click: </strong>First-click attribution gives all the credit to the first interaction in the customer journey, regardless of subsequent interactions.</li>
<li><strong>Linear: </strong>The linear model evenly distributes credit across all touchpoints throughout the customer journey.</li>
<li><strong>Time decay: </strong>Time decay attribution assigns more credit to interactions closer to the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics">conversion</a> and less to earlier interactions.</li>
<li><strong>Position-based:</strong> This model gives more credit to the first and last interactions, while the middle interactions receive less credit.</li>
</ul>

<div id="what-is-data-driven-attribution"></div>
<h2>What is data-driven attribution?</h2>
<p>To understand why Google would discontinue <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/08/attribution-models">traditional attribution models</a>, let’s take a deeper look at the data-driven attribution model.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Data-driven conversion tracking</strong> in Google Ads is an advanced method of tracking and attributing conversions to specific keywords, ads, and campaigns based on historical data and machine learning algorithms. This tracking system aims to provide advertisers with more accurate insights into the effectiveness of their advertising efforts.</p>

<h3>How data-driven attribution works</h3>
<p>Here’s how <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/30/data-driven-attribution-default-update">data-driven attribution</a> works:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Data collection:</strong> Google Ads collects a wealth of data related to user interactions with your ads and website. This includes click data, user behavior on your website, and conversion data (e.g., purchases, form submissions, phone calls).</li>
<li><strong>Machine learning algorithms:</strong> Google uses machine learning algorithms to analyze this data and identify patterns and trends. It looks at various factors, such as the time of day, device type, location, and more, to understand what drives conversions.</li>
<li><strong>Attribution modeling:</strong> Data-driven conversion tracking employs advanced attribution modeling techniques to assign value to different touchpoints in the customer journey. It considers the entire conversion path, including multiple interactions with your ads before a conversion occurs.</li>
<li><strong>Conversion prediction:</strong> Based on historical data and machine learning insights, Google Ads predicts the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/11/increase-conversion-rates">probability of a conversion</a> happening for each click on your ad. This prediction helps determine which ad clicks are more likely to lead to a conversion.</li>
<li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Google Ads uses this predictive data to optimize your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/17/google-ads-bid-management">bidding strategy</a>. It may adjust bids in real-time, allocating more budget to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">keywords</a> and ads that are more likely to result in conversions. This can help you maximize the return on investment (ROI) of your advertising spend.</li>
<li><strong>Performance reporting:</strong> You can view <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/08/google-ads-conversion-tracking-mistakes">detailed performance reports in Google Ads</a> that show how different keywords, ads, and campaigns are contributing to conversions. This information helps you make informed decisions about your advertising strategy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, and on paper, at least, data-driven attribution is the future of conversion tracking. And while I’m not in favor of fewer options for conversion tracking, I am in favor of data-driven attribution as a way to track your results.</p>

<div id="what-is-last-click-attribution"></div>
<h2>What is last-click attribution?</h2>
<p>A silver lining for traditional attribution advertisers is that last-click hasn’t gotten the axe…yet. For those less familiar with it, <a href="https://support.google.com/searchads/answer/6268786?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last-click conversion tracking</a> in Google Ads is a simplified attribution model that assigns all the credit for a conversion to the last ad click a user made before converting. This means that if a user clicks on multiple ads from different campaigns or keywords during their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/19/customer-journey-map-templates">customer journey</a>, only the final click is considered responsible for the conversion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/last-click-attribution-model.webp" alt="last-click attribution in google ads" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77114" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/last-click-attribution-model.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/last-click-attribution-model-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>How last-click attribution works</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s how last-click attribution works and why it is still used despite the removal of traditional attribution models:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>User interaction:</strong> A user interacts with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/15/multi-touch-attribution">multiple touchpoints</a> related to your ads. For example, they might click on an ad in a search result, then see a display ad, and finally, return to your website directly through a bookmark.</li>
<li><strong>Conversion event:</strong> The user ultimately converts, such as making a purchase, signing up for a newsletter, or completing a form on your website.</li>
<li><strong>Credit assignment:</strong> In last-click attribution, all the credit for the conversion is assigned to the very last click that brought the user to your website. In the example above, the direct visit would receive 100% of the credit for the conversion.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Pros and cons of last-click attribution</h3>
<p>Here are some pros and cons of using last-click attribution to track conversions.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Last-click attribution is straightforward and easy to understand. It provides a clear and simple view of which ads or keywords are driving immediate conversions.</li>
<li><strong>Historical use:</strong> Last-click attribution has been the default and most commonly used attribution model for a long time. Many advertisers are familiar with it, and it&#8217;s the default setting in many reporting platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Data availability:</strong> In some cases, especially for smaller advertisers or those with limited tracking capabilities, last-click attribution may be the only practical option due to data limitations.</li>
<li><strong>Alignment with direct response goals:</strong> For businesses focused on direct response advertising and immediate conversions, last-click attribution may align well with their goals.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inadequate for complex journeys:</strong> In the modern digital landscape, customer journeys are often complex, involving multiple touchpoints <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/22/cross-channel-marketing">across various channels and devices</a>. Last-click attribution ignores the influence of all but the last click, providing an incomplete picture of user behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Unfair distribution of credit:</strong> It can unfairly reward the last-clicked ad, even if earlier clicks played a crucial role in the user&#8217;s decision-making process.</li>
<li><strong>Misallocation of budget:</strong> Relying solely on last-click attribution can lead to misallocation of ad spend, as you may overinvest in keywords or campaigns that only appear to perform well due to being last in the click path.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these limitations, last-click attribution is still used because it&#8217;s familiar and easy to implement.</p>
<div id="future-of-google-ads-attribution-models"></div>
<h2>What’s the future of Google Ads attribution models?</h2>
<p>For the time being, you have the option to use Google’s data-driven or last-click attribution models. It may come down to personal preference, or how you wish to view the performance information.</p>
<p>My personal opinion that may clash with other experts in the space is that I love and generally prefer last-click. The reason I love it is for its simplicity and straightforwardness for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/20/google-ads-for-lead-generation">lead generation</a>. We can tie exactly which keyword and ad drove which lead. For me, the scattered attribution and fractions of conversion attribution is generally confusing to many clients. Click, lead, opportunity, sale.</p>
<p>However, I have been using data-driven attribution for some time now. I feel as though it will become the permanent option at some point here, but I also take into consideration that the data-driven model may fuel more intelligent bidding on the machine-learning side. In some respects, you have to embrace these steps forward in artificial intelligence and digital advertising, however forced and unnecessary they may seem.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, you need to choose the available attribution model that works best to help you measure and track your performance so you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/marketing-services">reach your marketing goals</a>.</p>

<h2>What is Google Tag Manager used for?</h2>
<p>Google Tag Manager (GTM) is a free tool developed by Google that allows website owners to manage and deploy marketing tags (snippets of code or tracking pixels) on their website (or mobile app) without having to modify the code. This is done by installing a single container code snippet to the source code, after which all other tags can be managed and deployed from the GTM interface. This effectively removes the need for developers&#8217; intervention for each tag installation and offers marketers greater flexibility and control over their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/marketing-services">digital marketing endeavors</a>.</p>
<p>Google Tag Manager has three key components:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tags:</strong> Tags are snippets of code that execute on a page or mobile app. They can serve a variety of uses, but most of the tags used in GTM are designed to send measurement information from your site to a third party. Examples include the Google Analytics tag and the Google Ads <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/31/conversion-paths-google-analytics">conversion tag</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Triggers:</strong> Triggers are conditions that need to be met for a tag to execute. For instance, you could set a trigger for a tag to execute when a specific page is viewed or when a particular button is clicked.</li>
<li><strong>Variables:</strong> Variables provide additional information that GTM might need for the tag and trigger to work. For example, if you&#8217;re setting a trigger for a particular URL, the URL is the variable.</li>
</ol>

<div id="benefits"></div>
<h2>Benefits of using Google Tag Manager</h2>
<p>Why use Google Tag Manager? Consider these benefits.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Efficiency and speed: </strong>GTM allows marketers and developers to work more efficiently by enabling the addition or update of tags without requiring code changes on the website. This greatly reduces deployment times and allows marketing campaigns to be launched faster.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> GTM provides a high degree of flexibility to digital marketers by allowing them to configure and deploy tags based on their specific needs, without any reliance on developers.</li>
<li><strong>Error reduction:</strong> GTM comes with a debugging option, which ensures tags are working correctly before they go live. This feature significantly minimizes the chances of errors.</li>
<li><strong>Version control:</strong> GTM automatically creates a new version every time changes are made. If something goes wrong, it’s easy to roll back to a previous version.</li>
<li><strong>Improved site performance</strong>: By allowing asynchronous tag firing, GTM ensures that slow-loading tags don’t hamper the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/18/website-maintenance">loading speed of your website</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Consolidation and organization: </strong>GTM helps in maintaining a clean and organized website code by keeping all the tags in one place.</li>

<div id="addgtm"></div>
<h2>How to install Google Tag Manager on your website</h2>
<p>After creating your GTM account, you will need to install it on your website. Here&#8217;s a step-by-step guide:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Access the GTM code:</strong> In your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/12/google-tag-manager">Google Tag Manager account</a>, you&#8217;ll see a popup window with the Google Tag Manager code snippets. These are two pieces of code that need to be added to your site.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/install-google-tag-manager-on-site.jpg" alt="first step to install google tag manager on site" width="936" height="478" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75176" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/install-google-tag-manager-on-site.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/install-google-tag-manager-on-site-480x245.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></li>
<li><strong>Install the first code snippet:</strong> The first piece of code needs to be pasted as high in the &lt;head&gt; of the page as possible. This ensures that Tag Manager can load synchronously and can be a part of rendering the page.</li>
<li><strong>Install the second code snippet:</strong> The second piece of code needs to be pasted immediately after the opening &lt;body&gt; tag on each page of your site. This ensures that Tag Manager functions even if JavaScript is disabled in the viewer&#8217;s browser.</li>
<li><strong>Update your website:</strong> After pasting the codes in the correct locations, save your changes and publish your website.</li>
<li><strong>Verify the Installation:</strong> To confirm that you&#8217;ve installed Google Tag Manager correctly, you can use the preview mode in GTM or use the Tag Assistant Chrome extension. If installed correctly, you should see the GTM container ID appear when you visit your site.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, for the Tag Manager to manage your tags, you need to add and configure them within the GTM interface. GTM does not automatically take over tags that are hardcoded on your site.</p>

<h2>What should I track in Google Tag Manager?</h2>
<p>Here are some advanced features within Google Tag Manager you can use to track information effectively for your business.</p>
<h3>Data layer and its usage</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/datalayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data layer</a> is a JavaScript object that is used in most tag management systems, including Google Tag Manager, to safely pass information from your website to your tag manager container. It acts as a central repository of data on your site that GTM can access to read values or track changes.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re running an ecommerce store, it&#8217;s really useful to track extra details about purchases. This helps you understand your customers better and make smarter business decisions. To do this, you can use something called a data layer. It&#8217;s like a special container that holds all the important information. In the code snippet you shared, the data layer is capturing specific details about a conversion event, like when someone makes a purchase.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-tag-manager-data-layer-example-script.jpg" alt="google tag manager - data layer example script" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75184" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-tag-manager-data-layer-example-script.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-tag-manager-data-layer-example-script-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In this code, the<strong> window.dataLayer</strong> object is initialized (if it doesn&#8217;t already exist) as an array. The<strong> push()</strong> method is then used to add a JavaScript object to the array, containing specific key-value pairs related to the purchase event.</p>
<p>The <strong>&#8216;event&#8217;</strong> key is set to <strong>&#8216;conversion&#8217;</strong>, indicating that a conversion event is being tracked. The <strong>&#8217;email&#8217;</strong> key represents the associated email address, while the <strong>&#8216;visitorType&#8217;</strong> key denotes the type of visitor, specifically a customer. Additionally, the &#8216;order&#8217; key holds the value <strong>1234</strong>, which could represent an order ID or any other relevant identifier.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that for more granular tracking in ecommerce scenarios, such as enhanced ecommerce tracking, Google provides a recommended <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/ecommerce?client_type=gtm#select_an_item_from_a_list" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data layer structure</a>. This structure allows for more comprehensive and detailed tracking of ecommerce-related events, enabling <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/17/ga4-features-for-advertisers">powerful analytics and insights</a> for your online store&#8217;s performance optimization.</p>

<h3>Custom HTML Tags</h3>
<p>Custom HTML tags in GTM are particularly useful when you want to execute a tag that is not part of the built-in templates provided by GTM, or when you want to customize a tag beyond what the available templates allow.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s consider an example where you want to include a custom chatbot JavaScript code from a third-party service on your website. Here&#8217;s how you would do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Within your GTM workspace, click on &#8220;Tags,&#8221; followed by &#8220;New&#8221; to create a new tag.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-tag-manager-custom-html.jpg" alt="create custom html tag in google tag manager" width="936" height="509" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75185" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-tag-manager-custom-html.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-tag-manager-custom-html-480x261.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></li>
<li>For the &#8220;Tag Configuration,&#8221; select &#8220;Custom HTML.&#8221;</li>
<li>Paste your third-party JavaScript code into the HTML text area provided.</li>
<li>Specify the trigger for this tag (for instance, you might want this tag to fire on &#8220;All Pages&#8221;).</li>
<li>Save and publish the tag.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the tag is published, it will inject your custom HTML (in this case, the chatbot JavaScript code) based on the trigger conditions you specified. This means you can manage and deploy custom scripts across your site with ease, directly from GTM.</p>

One of the most important features of GA4 is event tracking, which allows marketers to gather detailed information on user engagement and make data-driven decisions for marketing strategies. In contrast to Universal Analytics, which uses traditional tracking methods, GA4 event tracking relies on a more flexible and customizable approach that allows for greater data accuracy and customization.</p>

<h2>What is Google Analytics 4 and how does it differ from Universal Analytics?</h2>
<p>Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is the latest iteration of Google&#8217;s web analytics service, and it differs from its predecessor, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/23/universal-analytics-going-away">Universal Analytics</a> (UA), in several ways.</p>
<p>First, GA4 is designed to provide better cross-device and cross-platform tracking, allowing marketers to track and analyze user behavior across multiple devices and platforms, including mobile apps, websites, and offline interactions. In contrast, UA provides a more limited view of user interactions, focusing primarily on website sessions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/google-analytics-4-vs-universal-analytics.webp" alt="google analytics differences vs universal analytics" width="812" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73398" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/google-analytics-4-vs-universal-analytics.webp 812w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/google-analytics-4-vs-universal-analytics-480x354.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 812px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Another significant difference between <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/23/google-analytics-4-vs-universal-analytics">GA4 vs. UA</a> is their approach to data modeling. GA4 introduces a new event-based data model, which tracks user interactions as individual events, such as button clicks, video views, or form submissions, rather than grouping them into sessions.</p>
<p>Finally, GA4 provides more advanced machine learning capabilities, enabling marketers to gain deeper insights into user behavior and optimize their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/03/best-marketing-strategies">marketing strategies</a>. For example, GA4&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9846734?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predictive metrics</a>&#8221; feature uses machine learning to forecast user behavior and predict future outcomes.</p>
<div id="tracking"></div>
<h2>What is event tracking in GA4 and why is it important for marketers?</h2>
<p><a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9322688?hl=en#zippy=%2Crealtime-report%2Cdebugview-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Event tracking</a> is a crucial aspect of Google Analytics 4 that helps marketers gather detailed insights into user interactions with their digital properties.</p>
<p><strong>In GA4,</strong> <strong>events refer to specific user actions, such as button clicks, video views, and form submissions, that marketers want to track and analyze</strong>.</p>
<p>Event tracking enables marketers to measure user behavior beyond pageviews and sessions, providing a more accurate and granular understanding of user engagement.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/google-analytics-4-event-differences-vs-ua.jpg" alt="google analytics 4 event differences vs universal analytics" width="936" height="524" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73397" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/google-analytics-4-event-differences-vs-ua.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/google-analytics-4-event-differences-vs-ua-480x269.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Event tracking is essential for marketers because it allows them to make <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/12/13/local-search-marketing">data-driven decisions</a> when developing and optimizing marketing strategies. By tracking user interactions with their website or app, marketers can identify the most engaging content and optimize the user experience to drive better engagement and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/17/how-to-set-up-google-ads-enhanced-conversions">conversions</a>.</p>
<p>With GA4&#8217;s cross-device and cross-platform tracking capabilities, event tracking enables marketers to gain a more comprehensive view of their users&#8217; journeys across different devices and platforms, leading to more effective marketing strategies.</p>

<div id="events"></div>
<h2>What are events and how are they tracked in GA4?</h2>
<p>Events in GA4 refer to user interactions with content on a website or app that can be measured and analyzed. They provide insight into how users engage with a website or app, such as the actions they take, pages they visit, and features they use. <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-analytics-event-tracking/484607/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tracking events in GA4</a> helps businesses and marketers understand user behavior, optimize user experience, and make informed decisions to improve marketing strategies.</p>
<p>In GA4, events are tracked using the Google Analytics 4 data model, which is based on an event-driven approach. The data model focuses on capturing user interactions as events, which are then sent to Google Analytics for processing and reporting. Events in GA4 can be categorized into three types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automatically collected events</strong>: These are events that GA4 automatically tracks without any additional implementation, such as first_open, session_start, and page_view. They provide basic insights into user engagement and behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced measurement events:</strong> GA4 offers an Enhanced Measurement feature that automatically tracks additional user interactions like scroll, click, and video engagement. This can be enabled or customized within the GA4 interface.</li>
<li><strong>Custom events: </strong>These are events that you define and implement manually, based on specific user interactions that are relevant to your website or app. Custom events provide deeper insights into user behavior and engagement, tailored to your business needs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to use Google Tag Manager + Google Analytics 4 for better tracking</h2>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/14/how-to-use-google-tag-manager">set up Google Tag Manager</a> for GA4 to better track and understand events data. We’ll walk through some specific steps.</p>
<h3>A brief introduction to Google Tag Manager</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/12/google-tag-manager">Google Tag Manager</a> (GTM) is a free, user-friendly tool that allows you to manage and deploy various tracking codes and marketing tags on your website or app without the need for extensive coding knowledge. GTM simplifies the process of implementing tracking tags, such as Google Analytics, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-ads">Google Ads</a>, Facebook Pixel, and other third-party tags, by centralizing their management in one interface.</p>

<h3>Setting up Google Tag Manager for GA4</h3>
<p>Setting up <a href="https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/9442095?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Tag Manager (GTM) for Google Analytics 4 (GA4)</a> involves creating a GA4 tag within your GTM container and configuring it to send data to your GA4 property.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a step-by-step guide to help you set up GTM for GA4:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Create a GA4 property:</strong> If you haven&#8217;t already, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/switch-to-google-analytics-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set up a new GA4 property</a> in your Google Analytics account. Note the Measurement ID (e.g., G-XXXXXXXXXX) assigned to your GA4 property, as you&#8217;ll need it in later steps.</li>
<li><strong>Sign in to Google Tag Manager:</strong> Log in to your GTM account and select the appropriate container for your website or app.</li>
<li><strong>Create a new GA4 tag:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Click &#8220;Tags&#8221; in the left sidebar.</li>
<li>Click &#8220;New&#8221; to create a new tag.</li>
<li>In the &#8220;Tag Configuration&#8221; box, click on &#8220;Tag Type&#8221; and select &#8220;Google Analytics: GA4 Configuration.&#8221;</li>
<li>Enter your GA4 Measurement ID from Step 1 in the &#8220;Measurement ID&#8221; field.</li>
<li>Click &#8220;Save&#8221; to save your tag configuration.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Set up a trigger for the GA4 tag:</strong>
<ol>
<li>In the &#8220;Triggering&#8221; box, click on the pencil icon to add a trigger.</li>
<li>Choose the &#8220;All Pages&#8221; trigger for websites or the &#8220;App &#8211; All Screens&#8221; trigger for apps. This ensures that the GA4 tag fires on every page or screen, allowing you to track basic interactions like page views.</li>
<li>Click &#8220;Save&#8221; to associate the trigger with your GA4 tag.</li>
<li>Test your GA4 tag: Before publishing your changes, click &#8220;Preview&#8221; in the GTM interface to test your GA4 tag. Visit your website or app and verify that the tag is firing correctly using GTM&#8217;s<br />
Preview mode or the GA4 DebugView in Google Analytics.</li>
<li>Publish your GTM container: Once you&#8217;ve confirmed that the GA4 tag is working as expected, click &#8220;Submit&#8221; in the GTM interface to publish your changes. Your GA4 tag is now live, and data will begin flowing to your GA4 property.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/9442095?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>After setting up GTM for GA4, you can use GTM to manage other GA4 events, such as custom events or <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9216061?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhanced measurement events</a>, by creating additional GA4 tags and configuring them with the appropriate triggers and variables.</p>

<li>In the &#8220;Trigger Configuration&#8221; box, click on &#8220;Trigger Type&#8221; and select &#8220;Click &#8211; All Elements.&#8221;</li>
<li>Choose &#8220;Some Clicks&#8221; under &#8220;This trigger fires on.&#8221;</li>
<li>In the dropdown menus, select &#8220;Click Text&#8221; and enter the click text &#8220;Buy Now Pay Later&#8221; to identify the button.</li>
<li>Click &#8220;Save&#8221; to save your trigger.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Create a new GA4 Event tag:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Click &#8220;Tags&#8221; in the left sidebar.</li>
<li>Click &#8220;New&#8221; to create a new tag.</li>
<li>Name your tag (e.g., &#8220;GA4 &#8211; Buy Now Pay Later Click&#8221;).</li>
<li>In the &#8220;Tag Configuration&#8221; box, click on &#8220;Tag Type&#8221; and select &#8220;Google Analytics: GA4 Event.&#8221;</li>
<li>Enter your GA4 Measurement ID (e.g., G-XXXXXXXXXX) in the &#8220;Measurement ID&#8221; field.</li>
<li>In the &#8220;Event Name&#8221; field, enter a descriptive name for your custom event (e.g., &#8220;buy_now_pay_later_click&#8221;).</li>
<li>Click &#8220;Add Row&#8221; under &#8220;Event Parameters&#8221; to define additional parameters for your event. Enter &#8220;button_name&#8221; in the &#8220;Parameter Name&#8221; field and &#8220;Buy Now Pay Later&#8221; in the &#8220;Parameter Value&#8221; field.</li>
<li>Click &#8220;Save&#8221; to save your tag configuration.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Set up the trigger for the GA4 Event tag:</strong>
<ol>
<li>In the &#8220;Triggering&#8221; box, click on the pencil icon to add a trigger.</li>
<li>Choose the &#8220;Buy Now Pay Later Click&#8221; trigger you created in Step 2.</li>
<li>Click &#8220;Save&#8221; to associate the trigger with your GA4 Event tag.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Test your custom button event:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Click &#8220;Preview&#8221; in the GTM interface to test your GA4 Event tag and custom trigger.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/google-analytics-4-event-tracking-google-tag-manager-preview.jpg" alt="google tag manager preview page" width="936" height="384" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73438" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/google-analytics-4-event-tracking-google-tag-manager-preview.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/google-analytics-4-event-tracking-google-tag-manager-preview-480x197.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></li>
<li>Visit your website and click the &#8220;Buy Now Pay Later&#8221; button.</li>
<li>In GTM&#8217;s Preview mode or GA4&#8217;s DebugView, verify that your custom event fires correctly when the button is clicked.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Publish your GTM container:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Once you&#8217;ve confirmed that the custom event is working as expected, click &#8220;Submit&#8221; in the GTM interface to publish your changes.</li>
<li>Your custom button event is now live, and data will be sent to your GA4 property when users click the &#8220;Buy Now Pay Later&#8221; button.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By using the click text as the unique attribute in the trigger configuration, Google Tag Manager will fire the custom event when a user clicks a button or element with the text &#8220;Buy Now Pay Later&#8221; on the website.</p>
<div id="buynow"></div>

<h2>What is a conversion path in Google Analytics?</h2>
<p>A conversion path is a series of actions a new website visitor takes before completing a desired action on your site, also known as a conversion. This action can be a form fill, a button click, a purchase, and more.</p>
<p>For example, suppose one of the goals on your website is to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/12/how-to-generate-leads">generate leads</a> through an ebook. In that case, a conversion path will illustrate a connected channel of clicks that website visitors take to submit their contact information.</p>
<p>Here’s an illustration of some common conversion paths:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conversion-paths-examples.png" alt="conversion path examples" width="486" height="310" class=" wp-image-69920 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conversion-paths-examples.png 486w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conversion-paths-examples-480x307.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 486px, 100vw" /><a href="https://www.ashokcharan.com/Marketing-Analytics/images/wa07.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p><a href="https://metabox.io/improve-website-design-better-conversion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>
<p>Conversion paths typically include a landing page, content offer, and a call to action button. You can also include <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/23/thank-you-page-examples">thank you pages</a> in your path.<br />
<a id="why"></a></p>
<h2>Why are conversion paths important?</h2>
<p><a href="https://metabox.io/improve-website-design-better-conversion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">If you want to improve conversion on your website</a>, you need to know what&#8217;s leading to those conversions. And since customers often take several actions before converting, it&#8217;s important to know the ins and outs of those behaviors.</p>
<p>Let’s dive deeper into some of the reasons why tracking conversion paths is so important for creating and maintaining a <a href="https://sixgun.com.au/the-ultimate-guide-to-recruitment-marketing/">marketing action plan</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Know what’s working and what’s not. </strong>Knowing the behavioral paths of your leads and customers helps you to identify which campaigns and touchpoints are working so you can focus your budget and resources accordingly. For instance, you may notice that more of your users’ conversion paths start from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/ppc">PPC</a> ads than your social ads so you can allocate more budget to PPC to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/09/b2b-sales-strategies">boost your sales</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Identify bottlenecks in your funnel. </strong>Conversion paths help you to see where there are leaks in your funnel. For instance, you can see if there&#8217;s a drop-off for a particular offer, perhaps due to a bug, a tracking issue, or because an improvement is needed (such as to be more mobile-friendly, to have fewer fields, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Better understand your audience. </strong>You can also get insights into factors like location, income status, and gender to get a better feel for your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience"> target audience</a>. For instance, you may notice a high cart abandonment rate among users in a particular location. You can look to see if the issue is a lack of localized payment methods, which you can improve on to better customer experience and boost conversion rates as a result.</li>
<li><strong>Simplify campaign reporting. </strong>Finally, clear conversion paths allow you to easily gather metrics across channels, which helps you analyze your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/22/cross-channel-marketing">cross-channel marketing performance</a> more accurately and boost your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/12/20/content-marketing-roi">ROI</a>.</li>

<h2>How to set up conversion paths in Google Analytics</h2>
<p>Now that you know the importance of conversion paths, it&#8217;s time to dive into how to set them up successfully in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/how-to-use-google-adwords">Google Ads</a> and Google Analytics.</p>
<h3>1. Set up your conversion tracking</h3>
<p>To make use of conversion paths in Google Analytics, you of course need to establish what your conversions are. Depending on what marketing strategies you’re using, you can do this through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/30/google-ads-conversion-tracking">Google Ads conversion tracking</a> and/or through Google Analytics goal setup.</p>
<p>In Google Ads:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to Tools and settings &gt; Measurement &gt; Conversions</li>
<li>Click on +New Conversion Action.</li>
<li>Click on the Website</li>
<li>Input your website’s URL</li>
<li>Click on Scan</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conversion-paths-google-ads-conversion-tracking-setup.png" alt="google ads conversion tracking setup" width="720" height="387" class="size-full wp-image-69921 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conversion-paths-google-ads-conversion-tracking-setup.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conversion-paths-google-ads-conversion-tracking-setup-480x258.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Next, you’ll set up your Google Tag, as shown below, then input the tag name and select the destination accounts.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conversion-paths-google-ads-google-tag.png" alt="conversion paths - google ads google tag" width="720" height="359" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-69922" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conversion-paths-google-ads-google-tag.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conversion-paths-google-ads-google-tag-480x239.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Set up your goals</h3>
<p>You&#8217;ll also need to set up goals in Google Analytics. With <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/23/google-analytics-4-vs-universal-analytics">GA4</a>, this setup will be different, but for now, here&#8217;s what it looks like in Universal Analytics.</p>
<p>Click Admin on the bottom left corner.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-analytics-custom-event-tracking-admin.png" alt="" width="800" height="701" class="size-full wp-image-17376 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-analytics-custom-event-tracking-admin.png 800w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-analytics-custom-event-tracking-admin-480x421.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Click on Goals</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conversion-paths-google-analytics-goals.png" alt="google analytics conversion path goals" width="720" height="352" class="size-full wp-image-69907 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conversion-paths-google-analytics-goals.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conversion-paths-google-analytics-goals-480x235.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>After that, click on the custom option to set a new goal and add your goal description and details. Your description entails a name and goal type, as shown below.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-conversion-paths-goal-setup.png" alt="google analytics conversion paths goal setup" width="720" height="514" class="size-full wp-image-69909 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-conversion-paths-goal-setup.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-conversion-paths-goal-setup-480x343.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Though there are four key types of Google Analytics goals you can choose from, your desired conversion action will determine your goal type.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Duration</strong>: These track how long users stay on your site before leaving, which you can use to track engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Destination</strong>: These goals track when a particular page loads on your site as a way to track a conversion. For example the thank you page that triggers after an email newsletter signup or a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/07/thank-you-for-your-order-messages">thank you for your order</a> page.</li>
<li><strong>Pages per visit</strong>: These goals track the number of pages web visitors navigate before leaving your site—which can also be a helpful <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/27/seo-metrics">SEO metric</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Events: </strong>These goals track user interactions that Google does not typically record, like PDF downloads, button clicks, outbound link clicks, or even downloading a pricing quote for businesses like VoIP service providers.</li>
</ul>
<p>After filling in your goal details, click on the value button to set your goal’s monetary value (we show you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/10/how-to-determine-conversion-value">how to set conversion values here</a>). Click “verify” and save.</p>
<h3>Set up an attribution project</h3>
<p>To use the conversion path report in Google Analytics, you must first create an <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/attribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Attribution project</a>. Go to Explore&gt; Conversion Paths, and then follow the prompts to set up your project.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/attribution-project-google-analytics.png" alt="google analytics new attribution project" width="720" height="479" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-69915" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/attribution-project-google-analytics.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/attribution-project-google-analytics-480x319.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Once you have your project set up, you can now create a conversion segment.</p>
<h3>Create a conversion segment</h3>
<p>Go to Conversions » Multi-Channel Funnels » Top Conversion Paths. Then click on Conversion Segments.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-conversion-segments.png" alt="conversion paths google analytics - top conversion paths" width="720" height="577" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-69918" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-conversion-segments.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-conversion-segments-480x385.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Click on Create New Conversion Segment. The new segment can define your users from a particular geographic location, who buy a particular line of products, etc.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/create-new-conversion-segment-google-analytics.png" alt="" width="720" height="352" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-69919" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/create-new-conversion-segment-google-analytics.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/create-new-conversion-segment-google-analytics-480x235.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Define and name the new conversion segment. This ensures that your Google Analytics and your Data Studio show the same reports.</p>
<p>Click Apply then Save</p>
<p>Doing this will create a new conversion segment and also apply the segment to your conversion path report.</p>
<p>Now you&#8217;re ready to go!<br />
<a id="multichannel"></a></p>
<h2>Understanding the Top Conversion Paths report</h2>
<p>With your conversion paths set up, you can now use the Multi-Channel Funnels report in Google Analytics to better understand your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/15/multi-touch-attribution">marketing attribution</a>. This report will show you which channels contributed to a conversion on your site, such as organic, direct, paid, referral, and more.</p>
<p>To view these paths, go to Conversions » Multi-Channel Funnels » Top Conversion Paths<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-top-conversion-paths-report.png" alt="google analytics top conversion paths report" width="720" height="389" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-69913" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-top-conversion-paths-report.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-top-conversion-paths-report-480x259.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Set the date range to the last three months. Remember, the time lag to conversion can run into days or weeks, so set your date range for at least the last three months. This is also often enough time to gain actionable data.<br />
<a id="assisted"></a></p>
<h2>Understanding the Assisted Conversions report</h2>
<p>Within the same tab in Google Analytics is another <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/08/attribution-models">attribution modeling</a> tool called the Assisted Conversions report.  Assisted conversions for a given channel are all the channels that assisted or led to conversion but weren’t the final interaction.</p>
<p>For instance, say a user scans a QR code for app download but decides not to download the app immediately. Later, they download the app through a link on your social media. While the social link tap is considered the last-click conversion, your QR code played the assisted conversion role which may not be accounted for by the conversion metrics.</p>
<p>The flowchart below illustrates assisted interactions further.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-assisted-conversions.png" alt="google analytics assisted conversions" width="720" height="539" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-69912" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-assisted-conversions.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-assisted-conversions-480x359.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/23113805/assisted-conversions.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>It’s important that you understand assisted conversions to identify marketing channels that introduce customers to your product. Then you can tailor your marketing strategies to ensure you attract quality leads from these channels and boost your conversion rates.</p>
<p>By understanding assisted conversions, you can also attribute values to paths and clicks in the line that made way for the final conversion, such as referral links, ads, etc., as shown in the report below.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-assisted-conversions-report.png" alt="google analytics assisted conversions report" width="720" height="344" class="size-full wp-image-69914 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-assisted-conversions-report.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-assisted-conversions-report-480x229.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Doing this not only helps you understand the role of various assisted conversion channels but also goes <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7003286?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beyond the last-click conversion</a> to provide a clear picture of your campaign performance and the general customer journey.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is your <a href="/click-through-rate">click-through rate</a> good, or good enough?</p>
<p>This is a really common question, but unfortunately the answer to &#8220;What is a good click-through rate&#8221; will vary depending on a number of factors, including your industry and keywords. Additionally, in many situations your CTR is not nearly as important as your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/17/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate">conversion rate</a>.</p>
<p>Still, it’s helpful to have some general guidelines as to what qualifies as a good click-through rate. Keeping in mind that your mileage may vary, here are some benchmarks depending on the platform you&#8217;re using for marketing.</p>

<h2>What is a good CTR for a pay-per-click ad?</h2>
<p>What&#8217;s a good CTR for a PPC ad in a Google Ads campaign? Our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/18/search-advertising-benchmarks">benchmark data</a> shows that <strong>a good click-through rate is about 6-7% for search ads like Google Ads</strong>. This figure is not set in stone, but it&#8217;s a reasonable starting point. Plus, as you gain experience with managing a campaign, you should focus more on return on investment (ROI) than click-through rate.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also want to consider your industry competition. For example, someone looking for a pink vintage pinball machine is more likely to click on a relevant ad than someone looking for a printer.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a id="Facebook"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is a good CTR on Facebook?</h2>
<p>Click-through rates on Facebook ads will be much lower than those on Google Ads—advertisers have found that CTRs are higher on Google Ads because people often go to Google specifically looking to buy something. However, people generally go to Facebook to socialize, so they're not in a commercial frame of mind.</p>
<p>According to our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/11/12/facebook-ad-benchmarks#:~:text=The%20average%20Click%2DThrough%20Rate,is%200.89%25%20across%20all%20industries.">Facebook benchmarks</a>, <strong>a good click-through rate for Facebook ads is .89%</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/what-is-a-good-ctr-facebook.png" alt="what's a good CTR - facebook average click-through rate benchmarks" width="705" height="850" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62916" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/what-is-a-good-ctr-facebook.png 705w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/what-is-a-good-ctr-facebook-480x579.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 705px, 100vw" /><br />
<a id="Banner-ads"></a></p>
<h2>What is a good CTR for a banner ad?</h2>
<p>Average click-through rates for banner ads on the Google Display Network are often similar to CTR averages on Facebook as people are passively viewing ads. Across industries, we found tha<strong>t a good click-through rate for a banner ad is about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/29/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">0.46%</a></strong>.</p>
<p><a id="Email-newsletters"></a></p>
<h2>What is a good CTR for an email newsletter?</h2>
<p>Here, click-through rates will vary depending on the type of newsletter, among other factors. B2B newsletters (such as the <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSNewsletterWebPPCNewsletter.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogSidebar_PPC_Newsletter_Newsletter">WordStream Performance Tip</a>!) tend to have higher CTR than B2C newsletters. In either case,<strong> a good click-through rate for email is between 10% and 20%</strong>. However, highly targeted emails (personalized messages, behavior-based campaigns, etc.) can often attain click-through rates above 20%.</p>
<p>Whatever type of campaign you're managing, remember to track your progress. Steady improvement is more important than beating some industry benchmark.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The time has come. Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is here and ready for action. Actually, GA4 is here and ready for takeover.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-analytics-4-meme.jpeg" alt="ga4 meme" width="399" height="370" class="aligncenter wp-image-62258" /></p>
<p>As you may have heard, the current Google Analytics platform, Universal Analytics (UA), will no longer collect data as of July 2023. At that time, your only option will be to make the switch to GA4.</p>
<p>But why? Why is this necessary? And how will it affect your business? Read on to learn the history of Google Analytics, the differences between UA and GA4, plus plenty of pros and cons, tips and tricks to help you navigate this change.</p>

<h2>History of Google Analytics</h2>
<p>For the SEO nerds out there, here&#8217;s the timeline from Urchin in 2005 to Google Analytics 4 in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>2005:</strong> Google acquires a platform called <a href="https://tracking-garden.com/knowledge/web-analytics/systems/urchin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Urchin</a>. Urchin was used to “beautify” log files and make them more palatable at a time when log files were our only source of data.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-analytics-urchin.png" alt="screenshot of old google analytics - urchin" width="600" height="347" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62250" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-analytics-urchin.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-analytics-urchin-480x278.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://tracking-garden.com/knowledge/web-analytics/systems/urchin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<p><strong>2006:</strong> Google redesigns the platform and brands it as Google Analytics.</p>
<p><strong>2012:</strong> <a href="https://analytics.googleblog.com/2012/10/universal-analytics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Analytics is discontinued and replaced by Universal Analytics</a>. Universal Analytics allows users to track cross-platform, device-specific tracking, and create custom dimensions and metrics. This was necessary as apps and mobile browsing were becoming increasingly popular and brands needed a way to optimize for it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-universal-analytics-announcement.png" alt="universal analytics announcement" width="720" height="268" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62251" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-universal-analytics-announcement.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-universal-analytics-announcement-480x179.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>2018:</strong> Europe rolls out data privacy and security laws referred to as <a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>. These laws protect citizens of Europe not only in Europe but also on any site they browse regardless of the country the site is hosted in.</p>
<p><em>(I would like to make a disclaimer that I am not a privacy expert and that all businesses should consult a privacy expert and lawyer to ensure they are in compliance with applicable laws)</em></p>
<p>The data standards set in GDPR actually lead to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/08/google-analytics-gdpr-breach-cnil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Analytics being deemed illegal</a> in France and put millions of businesses at risk of being fined for using the platform. Not long after, New Zealand, Japan, Brazil, California, and many other countries/territories roll out their own privacy laws. With more legislation passing, Google has to make a change in how it collects, stores, and moves its data.</p>
<p><strong>October 2020: </strong>Due to the increasing concerns around privacy and security, Google rolls out Google Analytics 4. GA4 has many baked-in features and tools to allow more control over your data. Google has gone as far as to say that <a href="https://blog.google/products/marketingplatform/analytics/new_google_analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GA4 was built for privacy</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-analytics-4-announcement.png" alt="screenshot of google analytics 4 announcement headline" width="720" height="230" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62252" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-analytics-4-announcement.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-analytics-4-announcement-480x153.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>March 2022: </strong>Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/marketingplatform/analytics/prepare-for-future-with-google-analytics-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announces</a> that as of July 1, 2023 Universal Analytics will stop collecting new data—meaning you will have to switch to GA4.</p>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><p>NOTE: Even though this switch isn&#8217;t happening for another year, it&#8217;s important to note that your data will not migrate over from UA to GA4. So if you want to have a year&#8217;s worth of historical data, your best bet is to switch to GA4 now</p></div></div>

<p>So what are the differences between GA4 and UA? There are many. Let&#8217;s look at them piece-by-piece.<br />
<a id="privacy"></a></p>
<h2>UA vs GA4: Data collection &amp; privacy</h2>
<p>First and foremost, here are the differences between UA and GA4 with regard to user data and data sources.</p>
<h3>Privacy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>No IP addresses.</strong> The most notable change in <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=2919631" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GA4 is that IP addresses are no longer collected or stored</a>. In Universal Analytics, you were able to see IP addresses unless you physically went in and anonymized them. This is the first of many changes made to protect user data.</li>
<li><strong>Easier </strong><a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9940393?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=2919631" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>data deletion</strong></a> which allows admins to delete data at the request of any user(s).</li>
<li><a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7667196?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=2919631" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Data retention options</strong></a> allow you to choose how long GA4 can store user-specific data. By default, the time period is two months, however, you extend it to 14 months if desired. (It should be noted that this doesn’t mean you will only have access to data for 14 months, it just means you lose <strong>user-specific</strong> data after 14 months.)</li>
<li><strong>Options to turn off location-specific data </strong>and ad personalization data by country.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-analytics-4-granular-location.png" alt="ga4 granular location setting" width="720" height="409" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62253" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-analytics-4-granular-location.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-analytics-4-granular-location-480x273.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Data Streams for the new omnichannel landscape</h3>
<p>The data collection differences aren’t only useful for data privacy and security reasons, but they’re also helpful for better understanding the full user journey.</p>
<p>Universal was rolled out in 2012. At this time <strong><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">45%</a> of people had smartphones</strong>, there were <strong><a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/app-stores/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">540,000 apps </a>in the App Store</strong>, and there was <strong><a href="https://www2.census.gov/retail/releases/historical/ecomm/12q4.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$225.5 billion </a>spent on e-commerce</strong>. We were also still teaching a traditional marketing funnel of awareness, interest, desire, and action. This funnel focused solely on the acquisition of new customers and didn’t really address <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/09/customer-retention-strategies">retention</a> at all.</p>
<p>In comparison, at the beginning of 2021, <strong>85% of people had smartphones</strong>, there were <strong>4.5 million apps in the App Store</strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/us-ecommerce-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$578.50 billion </a>was spent on e-commerce</strong> in 2019. Oh, and there are very few “mobile websites” left as Google had already rolled out <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/15/mobile-first-indexing">mobile-first indexing</a>.</p>
<p>With all of these changes, we saw the introduction of the <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/flywheel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing flywheel</a>. This flywheel puts more emphasis on retention and turning customers into promoters (more on this in our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/12/growth-marketing">post on growth marketing</a>).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/funnel-vs-flywheel.png" alt="funnel vs flywheel" width="716" height="477" class="aligncenter wp-image-62249" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/funnel-vs-flywheel.png 716w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/funnel-vs-flywheel-480x320.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 716px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.growth-rocket.com/blog/funnel-vs-flywheel-which-model-is-right-for-your-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>One of the first ways GA4 addresses the new user journey is through the use of<a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9304153?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Data Streams</a>.</p>
<p>Data Streams are the source that gathers information and sends it to your Google Analytics property. In GA4, <strong>you can have multiple data streams per property</strong>. This means if you have two websites, or if you have a website and an app, you can see how your users interact with your properties all in one place.<br />
<a id="reports"></a></p>
<h2>UA vs GA4: Data &amp; reports</h2>
<p>When you compare the information available in Universal Analytics and Google Analytics 4, not too much has really changed. It may look like GA4 has more information on users, but UA has the same information, it’s just tucked under the “Audience” tab.</p>
<p>The biggest difference here is in language around “engagement” and “monetization” as well as the addition of “retention.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Engagement has replaced behavior, but covers many of the same things with added reports on conversions (previously known as “goals”).</li>
<li>Monetization, on the other hand, is a new beast that we will tackle later on in this article.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, like we touched on earlier, there has been an increase in interest to <strong>keep</strong> customers and turn them into advocates over the last 10 years. Google has put retention reports blatantly in the Life Cycle report to reflect its importance. Though this section of GA4 is currently sparse, I can imagine we will see updates in the coming years.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ua-vs-ga4-tabs.png" alt="ga4 vs universal analytics menus" width="600" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62247" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ua-vs-ga4-tabs.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ua-vs-ga4-tabs-480x479.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Users vs traffic</h3>
<p>As you may know, a user is a person that comes to your site. If they come through their phone one time and their computer three times, they are still the same user. Traffic, on the other hand, refers to sessions.</p>
<p>In GA4, user acquisition and traffic acquisition has been split into two different reports.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ua-vs-ga4-aquisition.png" alt="ua vs ga4 acquisition tabs" width="600" height="328" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62255" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ua-vs-ga4-aquisition.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ua-vs-ga4-aquisition-480x262.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>This has resulted in separate acquisition dimensions for both users and sessions, so be sure to be aware of which one you select when creating reports.</strong></p>
<h3>Behavior vs engagement metrics</h3>
<p>In Universal Analytics, behavior metrics were included in almost every report. These metrics included bounce rate, pages/session, and average session duration.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/universal-analytics-behavior-metrics.png" alt="universal analytics behavior metrics" width="720" height="351" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62239" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/universal-analytics-behavior-metrics.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/universal-analytics-behavior-metrics-480x234.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Google Analytics 4 replaced these metrics with new “engagement” metrics. These new metrics are based on “engaged sessions,” which Google has so kindly defined as: Sessions that lasted longer than 10 seconds, or had a conversion event, or had two or more screen or pageviews.</p>
<p>The metrics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engaged sessions</li>
<li>Engagement rate</li>
<li>Engaged sessions per user</li>
<li>Average engagement time</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s right… No more bounce rate!</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; July update: <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-analytics-4-adds-conversion-bounce-rate-and-utm-parameters-386419" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bounce rate has been added back in</a>, along with conversion rate and UTM parameters!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-analytics-4-engagement-panel.png" alt="ga4 engagement panel" width="307" height="388" class="aligncenter wp-image-62238" /></p>
<h3>Monetization</h3>
<p>Monetization reports have taken over the former home of “conversions” reports. The big thing to note here is that monetization in 2021 looked far different than monetization in 2012.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-analytics-4-engagement-panel.png" alt="ga4 engagement panel" width="367" height="463" class="aligncenter wp-image-62238" /></p>
<p>Traditionally speaking, monetization was limited to ecommerce in one way or another. Today though, monetization could include ad revenue, in-app sales, or ecommerce.<strong> In GA4, monetization reports take all streams of revenue into account.</strong></p>
<p>On the downside, if you don’t track anything of direct monetary value on your site, this entire section of GA4 is useless.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-analytics-4-monetization.png" alt="google analytics 4 monetization view" width="720" height="339" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62240" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-analytics-4-monetization.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-analytics-4-monetization-480x226.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This is a bummer because in UA, conversion reports weren’t solely focused on money. They also considered the non-monetary conversions and the attribution behind those conversions.</p>
<h3>Session-based data vs event-based data</h3>
<p>Universal Analytics collected session-based data. Each session was made up of different “hit types.” These hit types included page hits, ecommerce hits, social interaction hits, etc. In contrast, GA4 is an event-based platform, meaning everything is considered an event. First visit? Event. Pageview? Event. The list goes on.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-analytics-4-vs-universal-analytics-hit-types.png" alt="ga4 vs universal analytics hit types" width="583" height="477" class="aligncenter wp-image-62248" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9964640?hl=en#zippy=%2Cin-this-article" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>Now this change is great because it gives us more information on how people use our properties. The downside is that it also means that the two datasets (UA &amp; GA4) don’t play well together…</p>
<p><strong>And that’s why you start from zero when switching from UA to GA4.</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/universal-analytics-versus-google-analytics-4.png" alt="universal analytics vs google analytics 4 - data models" width="720" height="519" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59189" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/universal-analytics-versus-google-analytics-4.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/universal-analytics-versus-google-analytics-4-480x346.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Event &amp; conversion creation</h3>
<p>Not only are events treated differently, but they are also passed through to GA differently as well. As you can see in the diagram above, gone are the days of action, category, and label. In GA4, we have parameters, enhanced measurement, and in-platform event creation.</p>
<p>When you set up your Data Stream you will have the option to turn on enhanced measurement which collects page views, downloads, outbound clicks, video engagement, and scrolls. <strong>If you keep enhanced measurement on, all of these events will be collected automatically! No extra work necessary.</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ga4-enhanced-measurement.png" alt="ga4 enhanced measurement" width="720" height="369" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62242" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ga4-enhanced-measurement.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ga4-enhanced-measurement-480x246.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If there is an event that you’d like collected but doesn’t fall under enhanced measurement, you may be able to set it up right in the GA4 platform using conditions and parameters. Parameters are pieces of information sent alongside events that provide context on the user or user action.</p>
<p>Once you’re collecting an event, you have the option to mark it as a conversion by simply clicking a toggle button—<strong>no more “Goal” setup!</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ga4-event-creation.png" alt="google analytics 4 new event creation" width="720" height="353" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62241" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ga4-event-creation.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ga4-event-creation-480x235.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /><br />
<a id="features"></a></p>
<h2>Increased functionality in Google Analytics 4</h2>
<p>During your initial setup, you will want to ensure you tackle all of the options available to you in the “property” settings. We’ve already covered many of them, but I highly recommend checking them all out.</p>
<h3>Product Links</h3>
<p>One of the last options under property settings is Product Linking. It’s likely you’ve used Product Linking with Google products before, maybe through Search Console or Google Ads. Basically all it does is link data between different Google Products, there is no real difference with Product Linking in GA4 other than the platforms available.</p>
<p><strong>In GA4 you now have the option to link to Google Merchant Center, Google Optimize, and BigQuery natively and for free!</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ga4-link-integrations.png" alt="google analytics 4 link integrations" width="400" height="573" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62243" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ga4-link-integrations.png 400w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ga4-link-integrations-209x300.png 209w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<h3>Available customizations</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most underrated feature of Google Analytics 4 is the ability to customize the platform to meet your needs.</p>
<p><strong>Not only are you able to create custom reports in GA4 like you could in UA, but you can actually add those reports right to your navigation.</strong> That’s right, no more having to navigate to a separate part of the platform! In GA4, if you want to create a new report, you can put it anywhere in the Reports navigation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ga4-page-screens-report.png" alt="ga4 page screens report" width="720" height="478" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62244" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ga4-page-screens-report.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ga4-page-screens-report-480x319.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Other customization options include changing the name of collections and topics in the secondary navigation using the <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10460557?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Library</a>(not to be confused with the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-library">Google Ads library</a>).</p>
<h3>Explorations</h3>
<p>You can create dashboard-esque reports using the Explorations in GA4. I like to say that Exporations is the love-child of custom dashboards from Universal and user interface of Data Studio.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-analytics-4-explore-tab.png" alt="ga4 explore tab" width="720" height="309" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62245" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-analytics-4-explore-tab.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-analytics-4-explore-tab-480x206.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Machine learning capabilities</h3>
<p>We started to see the roll out of machine learning tools with Universal Analytics. Insights were rolled out in 2018 to help people find trends and outliers in their data. As time went on, the machine learning got more sophisticated and allowed users to “ask questions” in the search bar as a way of quickly finding information.</p>
<p>When GA4 was released, insights were baked into the platform more than ever. Not only are insights available and highlighted throughout the platform, but new <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-analytics-ai">machine learning tools</a> were also introduced!</p>
<h3>Anomaly detection</h3>
<p>Anomaly detection, which was previously reserved for insights, is now available on most line charts. This tool is extremely helpful for identifying statistical differences in your data at a glance. In order for anomaly detection to work, Google must have sufficient historical data to build predictive models. Which leads to the next new tool—predictive analytics!</p>
<h3>Predictive analytics</h3>
<p>Previously, if someone wanted to access predictive analytics, they would have to pay for another tool or create them themselves. But, no more! GA4 introduced predictive analytics for LTV, churn probability, likely churners, likely top spenders, likely purchases, purchase probability and more.</p>
<h3>Attribution</h3>
<p>For the last few years, Google has been working on its tools. With the rollout of Universal Analytics, it rolled out its multi-channel funnel tools. Then, in December of 2019, it rolled out its Attribution Project tool which allowed users to access a group of tools surrounding attribution and conversion.</p>
<p>Now in GA4, we see a section in the primary navigation called “Advertising,” Upon clicking into this section of GA4, we will find all of the same tools from the Attribution Projects. This includes conversion paths, time to conversion, the model comparison tool, and touchpoints to conversion.</p>
<p>But the tools aren’t the only attributions you’ll see in GA4. In the last few months, Google announced that all users were getting access to Google’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/30/data-driven-attribution-default-update">data-driven attribution model</a>. Once that rolled out, all GA4 properties were changed to using that model as their default conversion model, whereas UA still relies on last-click.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-analytics-4-attribution-panel.png" alt="google analytics 4 conversion panel" width="300" height="439" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62246" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-analytics-4-attribution-panel.png 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/google-analytics-4-attribution-panel-205x300.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h2>Lots to learn</h2>
<p>Here is the thing: We are just starting to really understand GA4. And much like every other Google product, it changes every day! There is still so much to learn and discover in GA4, and this process will look different for everyone.</p>
<p>I highly encourage you to get out there and play around in GA4. It may be uncomfortable, but I assure you it’s much more like UA than you think it is, just a bit more sophisticated. And who could be mad about that?</p>

<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/23/universal-analytics-going-away">Google Universal Analytics Is Going Away: What You Need to Know</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since 2005, Google Analytics has been the gold standard for tracking website and marketing performance. While over the years, Google has made additions and improvements to the platform, it announced last week that it will be making a removal:</p>
<p><strong>On July 1, 2023, one of its most common instances of Google Analytics (Universal Analytics) will be going away.</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/history-of-google-analytics.png" alt="history of google analytics" width="720" height="311" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59230" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/history-of-google-analytics.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/history-of-google-analytics-480x207.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Now I&#8217;ll admit that even though I use Google Analytics every day, I wasn&#8217;t sure what any of this meant. Do we use Universal Analytics? What exactly is a &#8220;property&#8221;? How does Analytics 360 fit into this picture? Assuming I&#8217;m not alone in my confusion, I dove in to find out and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m sharing today. Read on to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>What&#8217;s changing, why, and when</li>
<li>How to tell if your account will be affected</li>
<li>What you need to do</li>
</ul>
<h2>What’s changing</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>The simple version:</strong> Universal Analytics is getting replaced by Google Analytics 4 starting July 1, 2023.</li>
<li><strong>The official announcement: </strong>Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/marketingplatform/analytics/prepare-for-future-with-google-analytics-4/">announced</a> that “On July 1, 2023, standard Universal Analytics properties will no longer process data. You’ll be able to see your Universal Analytics reports for a period of time after July 1, 2023. However, new data will only flow into your GA 4 properties.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s break this down:</p>
<h2>What’s a property?</h2>
<p>This is the website or app that you are tracking with Google Analytics. If you are currently using Universal Analytics to track your website, this would be called your “Universal Analytics property.” Once you set up GA4, you’ll have a “Google Analytics 4 property” for that same website. Because UA and GA4 are different, different reports are available to you for each property. Learn more about <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2649554?hl=en">Google Analytics properties here</a></p>
<h2>What is Google Analytics 4?</h2>
<p>To understand exactly what GA4 is, a little<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics"> Google Analytics history </a>lesson is in order.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> The very first instance of Google Analytics, which came out in 2005 (when you had a Razr flip phone with your favorite song as your ringtone).</li>
<li><strong>Universal Analytics (UA): </strong>The new and improved version of Google Analytics that came out in 2012 and became the default property type.</li>
<li><strong>Google Analytics 360: </strong>This is a software suite that, in addition to Universal Analytics, provides Tag Manager, Optimize, Data Studio, Surveys, Attribution, and Audience Center. Came out in 2016.</li>
<li><strong>Google Analytics 4:</strong> This is the latest version of Google Analytics, which came out on October 14, 2020.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What’s the difference between UA and GA4?</h2>
<p>Google Analytics 4 doesn’t just offer more of what Universal Analytics offers. It’s built differently to align with current and future needs for reporting and privacy. Here are some of the differences and benefits.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Event-based:</strong> Universal Analytics is session-based, while GA4 is event–based. In other words, the ability to track events like button clicks, video plays, and more is built in with GA4, while this requires advanced setups in UA. This comes from the premise that page views aren’t the sole important metric.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-device tracking:</strong> UA was built around desktop web traffic, while GA4 gives businesses visibility into the customer journeys across all of their website and apps.</li>
<li><strong>Machine learning:</strong> GA4 uses machine learning technology to share insights and make predictions.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy-friendly:</strong> UA data relies heavily on cookies, GA 4 does not.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also read <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9964640?hl=en#zippy=%2Cin-this-article" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google&#8217;s explanation of UA vs GA4 here</a>.</p>
<h2>How do I know if I’m using Universal Analytics?</h2>
<p>Google Analytics 4 came out on October 14, 2020 and became the default, so if you created your property after that date, you’re likely using GA4. If you were using analytics prior to that date, you’re likely using UA.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure, you can <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11583832">check your property type</a> by clicking on the down arrow in the top left of your account, next to your property name:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/universal-analytics-property-type.png" alt="property type in google analytics" width="720" height="279" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59169" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/universal-analytics-property-type.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/universal-analytics-property-type-480x186.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Then look at your property ID:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/google-analytics-UA-GA4-property-type.jpg" alt="property ID in google analytics" width="720" height="338" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59170" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/google-analytics-UA-GA4-property-type.jpg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/google-analytics-UA-GA4-property-type-480x225.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li>UA property IDs start with UA and end with a number.</li>
<li>GA 4 properties only have numbers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What do I need to do?</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re currently using Universal Analytics, there are three actions to prioritize:</p>
<h3>1. Switch to GA 4 as soon as possible</h3>
<p>While you have more than a year before this change takes place, it’s best to make the switch now so your GA4 account can gather the data needed for automated insights.</p>
<p>If you are currently using UA, you’ll want to set up a GA4 property alongside your existing UA property. Use <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9744165">Google’s GA4 Setup Assistant</a>, which gives you the option to set it up with your existing tagging.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/google-analytics-4-property-setup-assistant.png" alt="GA4 property setup assistant" width="720" height="561" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59171" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/google-analytics-4-property-setup-assistant.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/google-analytics-4-property-setup-assistant-480x374.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you run Google Ads, have ecustom events, or use other advanced features, refer to <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10759417">Google’s page on how to switch to Google Analytics 4</a>—which breaks the process down into 12 steps with effort levels indicated for each step.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/start-migrate-google-analytics-4.png" alt="steps to migrate to GA4" width="720" height="525" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59172" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/start-migrate-google-analytics-4.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/start-migrate-google-analytics-4-480x350.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Adjust your Google Ads conversion tracking</h3>
<p>Once your GA 4 property is set up, you’ll be able to view Analytics data in your Google Ads account.</p>
<p>If you have conversion tracking set up, you should <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10632359#zippy=%2Cin-this-article">import Analytics conversions into Google Ads</a> and remove any UA goals to avoid duplicates.</p>
<p>To import your Analytics conversions, in your Google Ads account, go to Tools &amp; Settings &gt; Conversions &gt; Add new conversion action, and select Import:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/import-google-analytics-conversions-google-ads.png" alt="import google analytics conversions to google ads" width="720" height="582" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59174" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/import-google-analytics-conversions-google-ads.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/import-google-analytics-conversions-google-ads-480x388.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There you can select each conversion event you want to import.</p>
<h3>3. Export historical reports</h3>
<p>Google will allow access to your Universal Analytics data for at least six months after July 1, 2023, during which time you should export the data that is important to you. There are three ways to export:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can export individual reports</li>
<li>Use the Google Analytics Reporting API</li>
<li>Export to BigQuery</li>
</ul>
<h2>Google Analytics 4, here we come</h2>
<p>I already mentioned this but it&#8217;s worth mentioning again: Don&#8217;t drag your feet with switching over to GA4. The sooner you start, the less historical data you&#8217;ll need to export come July and the sooner Google&#8217;s machine learning can start surfacing and predicting insights in your account. Stay tuned for more GA4 tips and tricks!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>Back in September of 2021, we were hit with a boatload of Google Ads announcements. Some were sad (so long, expanded text ads), some were unsettling (key matching behavior has &#8220;improved&#8221; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f928.png" alt="🤨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />), and some were downright confusing (display campaigns anyone?).</span></p>
<p><span>But there were some good announcements too, like the new travel ad type, some holiday-friendly Google Shopping attributes, and the star of today&#8217;s post, <strong>the Google Ads budget report</strong>. </span></p>
<p>Exhilarating, I know. But hey, you will be excited when you start saving money because of  this report and the tips below. So read on for:</p>
<ul>
<li>A complete walkthrough of the Google Ads budget report.</li>
<li>Five steps to determine a realistic Google Ads budget.</li>
<li>Five expert-suggested strategies to get the most out of your spend.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span>What is the Google Ads budget report?</span></h2>
<p><span>To understand what&#8217;s going on here, you first need to understand daily average budget. When you set your daily average budget, you&#8217;re not setting exactly how much Google will spend on that campaign each day. You&#8217;re giving Google a rough idea of what you&#8217;d like your daily spend to average out to at the end of the month—meaning Google could exceed or fall short of that amount on any given day.</span></p>
<p>Originally, Google could spend up to 20% more than your daily average budget in this manner—until October 2017 when it announced it could spend <span><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/05/adwords-daily-budget-changes">100%, or double your budget</a>—if it means more clicks or conversions.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>This is helpful in getting the most out of your budget, but advertisers have had limited insight into these fluctuations. Google’s new budget report,<a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/11202082"> announced on September 30</a>, solves for this. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-ads-budget-report-announcement.png" alt="google ads budget report screenshot" width="600" height="501" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53578" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-ads-budget-report-announcement.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-ads-budget-report-announcement-480x401.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go over how to access and interpret this report as it pertains to your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/21/ad-spend-pacing">Google Ads budget pacing</a>.</p>
<h2><span>How to access the Google Ads budget report</span></h2>
<p><span>The budget report is a separate report for each of your campaigns in Google Ads (and only campaigns using daily average budget),and there are a few different ways to access it. For each of these methods, you may need to switch from <strong>summary view</strong> to <strong>detailed view</strong> under Tools &amp; settings. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>From the campaigns tab:</strong> </span>Select a campaign whose date range includes the current month. In the campaign’s budget column, hover over the budget or click the pencil icon. In addition to being able to make changes to your average daily budget, you will also see a link to the budget report.</li>
</ul>
<p><span> <img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-ads-budget-report-access.png" alt="how to access the google ads budget report" width="720" height="304" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53579" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-ads-budget-report-access.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-ads-budget-report-access-480x203.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>From the shared library:</strong> </span>Click Tools &gt; Shared Library &gt; Shared budgets. Then do the same as above—hover over the budget or click the pencil icon where you can make changes or see the link to the budget report</li>
<li><strong>From the ad groups page:</strong> In the tabs on the left select Ad groups, then select an ad group, and follow suite.</li>
</ul>
<p>BTW, don&#8217;t forget that you can also see how your competitors advertise on the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-library">Google Ads library</a>.</p>
<h2><span>How to use the Google Ads budget report</span></h2>
<p><span>The report shows you how changes to your average daily budget impacted (or will impact) your performance and spend limits, as well as how much you are projected to pay at the end of the month. There are two segments to the report: cumulative monthly spend and daily spend.</span></p>
<h3><span>The cumulative monthly spend section</span></h3>
<p><span>This section of the report includes:</span><strong><span> </span></strong><strong><span> </span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Monthly spending limit: </span></strong><span>the most you’ll pay for a campaign in one month, determined by that campaign’s average daily budget multiplied by 30.4 (days in the month). Monthly spend limits were introduced in June 2021. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/26/google-ads-monthly-spend-limit">We cover it here.</a></span></li>
<li><span><strong>Monthly forecast:</strong> amount you’re projected to spend based on your average daily budget.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Cost to date:</span></strong><span> how much you’ve spent so far in the month.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>When you hover your mouse over any of the lines in the graph, you can see specific details for that day. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Spend for a past day:</span></strong><strong><span> </span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span>Spend for a future day:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Notice how you can edit the budget amount to see how adjusting your budget would impact your campaign’s spending limits.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-ads-budget-report-future-1.png" alt="google ads budget report - future projected spend view" width="720" height="294" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53583" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-ads-budget-report-future-1.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-ads-budget-report-future-1-480x196.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3><span>The daily spend section</span></h3>
<p><span>This section visualizes for you how much of your daily average budget you are spending each day. You can see:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>How your budget is spent from day to day</span></li>
<li>How campaign performance changed, or is projected to change, by adjusting your average daily budget.</li>
</ul>
<p><span><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-ads-budget-report-daily-spend-section-1.png" alt="google ads budget report - daily spend section" width="720" height="198" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53584" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-ads-budget-report-daily-spend-section-1.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-ads-budget-report-daily-spend-section-1-480x132.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /> </span></p>
<h3><span>Served costs, billed costs, and monthly spending limits</span></h3>
<p><span><a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10486637?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google&#8217;s help page on spending limits</a> is your best resource for this, but here is a quick rundown on the difference between these two numbers and how they relate to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/26/google-ads-monthly-spend-limit">monthly spend limits</a>.</span><span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Served cost is the cost of all clicks or impressions for a campaign, while b</span><span>illed cost is the actual amount you are responsible to pay after adjustments for things like invalid activity.</span></li>
<li><span>Served costs can exceed monthly or daily spending limits, but you will never pay more than these two limits. Any cost that goes over your monthly spending limit (which can sometimes happen due to a delay in Google&#8217;s detection) will be covered by Google. </span></li>

<h2>How to determine your initial Google Ads budget</h2>
<p><span>If you&#8217;re reading this post, it&#8217;s most likely because you pay attention to your Google Ads spending and (call me crazy) want to make the most of it. So let&#8217;s go over some tips and strategies so that your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-budget">Google Ads budget</a> report is looking the way you want it to.</span></p>
<p><span>If you&#8217;re <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/12/02/best-google-ads-training-courses">just starting out with Google ads</a> or looking to revamp your strategy, you&#8217;ll want to first establish a reasonable budget. But how the heck do you determine how much money you want to spend in a month? A week? A day? Your first click? </span></p>
<p><span>Our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/09/14/adwords-budget-guide">Google Ads budget guide</a> covers all of this and more, but here are four key questions to answer so you can arrive at a number that works for you.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><strong>How does Google Ads fit into your current marketing strategy?</strong> </span>Is the goal of your Google Ads to support existing efforts or is it a new strategy altogether? Do you already have a <a href="https://localiq.com/localiq-grader?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong online presence</a>?</li>
<li><span><strong>What are your competitors spending? </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/18/ppc-competitor-analysis">Do a PPC competitor analysis</a> to find out what keywords they&#8217;re bidding on. This will give you an idea of what you&#8217;re likely to bid on as well as what they&#8217;re not bidding on that you might want to target. </span></li>
<li><span><strong>What are the average CPCS for those keywords?  </strong>Use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/09/18/best-keyword-research-tools">keyword research tools</a> to see the average cost per click for those keywords. This isn’t going to pinpoint your budget, but it will give you a rough idea of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/21/how-much-does-adwords-cost">how much Google Ads will cost</a>.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>What are the benchmarks in my industry? </strong>In addition to keyword tools, you can use our Google Ads benchmarks reports to get average costs per click (and more) for your industry. This will help you get an idea of what you can expect.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Which KPIs matter most to me?</strong><br />
Cost per conversion is important to everyone, but it&#8217;s crucial to take into account your other goals and metrics. For example, what is your ideal number of sales or leads? It might help to look at your goals for other marketing channels to identify this.</span></li>

<h2>How to get more out of your budget</h2>
<p>Alright, so you&#8217;ve determined your budget. Now it&#8217;s time to make sure you&#8217;re getting everything you can out of every last penny. Here are some of the core strategies for doing so.</p>
<h3>1. Set the right bids</h3>
<p><span><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/19/google-ads-automated-bidding">Google Ads’ many automated bidding strategies</a> are designed to help you make the most of your budget. The hard part is setting and adjusting those bids—especially if you’re not a math fan. Follow the steps below to set you initial Google Ads bids and determine your ideal <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/15/lower-cost-per-acquisition">CPA</a>. </span><span><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/11/easy-adwords-bidding-strategies"></a></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span> Use Google’s bid recommendations in the Keyword Planner.</span></li>
<li><span> Aim for just below the highest position.</span></li>
<li><span> Use third-party tools to find out where your competitors’ bids</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span> Let your keyword-level CPAs dictate when it’s time to adjust your bids. </span></li>
<li><span> Big management scripts</span></li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Allocate your budget across keyword types</h3>
<p><span>The<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide"> keywords you target in your Google Ads campaigns</a> fall into five categories: research, branded, competitor, high intent, and top performers. Here are three fundamentals to follow when allocating your budget:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Focus the majority of your budget on high-intent keywords (including branded terms).</span></li>
<li><span>Top-of-funnel keywords can eat a hole in your wallet: there are better (cheaper) ways to reach a wide audience, such as with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/23/google-display-ads">Display ads</a>.</span></li>
<li><span>Adjust budget allocation on a weekly basis to ensure maximum ROI.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We expand on each of these tips in our aforementioned <span><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/09/14/adwords-budget-guide">Google Ads budget guide</a>.</span></p>
<h3><span>3. Identify leaks in your spend</span></h3>
<p><span>If it’s not apparent with the bajillion CTAs we have on our site for the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Google Ads Grader</a>, which identifies wasted spend (among other things), we are on a mission to stop the burning of precious Google Ads budgets. I think it’s safe to say that 95% of our posts on Google Ads tie back to this goal, but I’ll direct you to the most direct one: </span><span><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/20/stop-burning-your-adwords-budget">7 Ways to Stop Burning Your Google Ads Budget.</a> In this post you&#8217;ll learn how to:</span></p>

<h3><span>4. Adopt the 7 habits of highly effective spenders</span></h3>
<p>Those with big budgets tend to do better than those with lower budgets. But it’s not BECAUSE they have big budgets. With so much money on the line, they have to be regularly active in their account. In our post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/09/05/how-to-compete-with-big-budgets-adwords">How to Compete with Big Spenders in Google Ads (without Spending More Money)</a>, we tell you how to achieve better results without putting more money into your budget, through:</p>

<li>Compelling headlines</li>
<li>Ad extensions</li>
<li>Negative keywords</li>
<li>Higher Quality Score</li>
<li>Regular maintenance</li>
</ul>
<h3><span>5. Try these lesser-known optimizations</span></h3>
<p><span>Last but not least, don&#8217;t limit your budget optimization strategies to just the best practices. We are always sharing little tips and tricks, like these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/24/google-ads-optimization">4 Google Ads Optimizations to Stretch Your Budget Further:</a></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>​​Get rid of vanity metrics so you can stay focused on what truly matters.</span></li>

<p>If your marketing assets could talk, I’m sure they’d say something similar, because not all tactics are created equal. Your email campaign might have resulted in a customer, but what about the ad that captured their email address in the first place?</p>
<p>Multi-touch attribution helps us to give credit to our marketing channels where it’s due so we can understand what&#8217;s working best. So in this post, I&#8217;m going to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>What multi-touch attribution is and why it’s important.</li>
<li>The pros and cons of the four main types of multi-touch attribution models.</li>
<li>How to set up view multi-touch conversion data.</li>
<li>How to choose the right attribution model for your business.</li>
</ul>
<p>But before that, let&#8217;s talk about marketing attribution in general.</p>
<h2>What is marketing attribution?</h2>
<p>Marketing attribution is used to identify which campaigns or strategies are responsible for your customers becoming aware of your business and eventually purchasing your product or service.</p>
<p>To understand marketing attribution, think of your last big buying decision. I’d bet you didn’t just jump straight to a website and take the plunge. You may have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Received an email</li>
<li>Saw a post on social media</li>
<li>Researched online</li>
<li>Read reviews</li>
<li>Seen an ad</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ul>
<p>If the company behind that purchase is using marketing attribution, they will be able to see which of those channels led you to become a customer.</p>

<h2>Why is marketing attribution important?</h2>
<p>Regardless of what your marketing goals are, your strategies are most likely costing you time, money, and resources. You don’t want to be putting all of that effort in for no return. Marketing attribution helps you avoid that by helping you to track what works and what doesn’t.</p>
<p>Well, marketing attribution not only helps you analyze the success of your marketing efforts, but it also gives you insights into the customer journey.</p>
<p><strong>In order to improve the future, we must understand the past, </strong>and marketing attribution helps us do that!</p>

<p>Alright, now it&#8217;s time to move on to one of the most important approaches to marketing attribution: multi-touch attribution!</p>
<h2>What is multi-touch attribution?</h2>
<p>Remember those marketing touchpoints I listed above? As you know,  there is rarely just one marketing campaign responsible for a conversion. Multiple touchpoints are involved, which is where multi-touch attribution comes in.</p>
<p>Multi-touch attribution is marketing attribution that takes into account these multiple touchpoints. And you use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/08/attribution-models">attribution modeling</a> to choose how you’d prefer to weigh those many actions towards counting to a conversion.</p>
<p>There are two categories of attribution models: single touch and multi-touch.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/13427716?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As of June 2023</a>, first click, linear, time decay, and position-based attribution models are no longer available attribution model options. In September 2023, all remaining conversion actions still using any of those four attribution models will be automatically switched to data-driven attribution and these models will be removed from Google Ads reporting. Last-click and data-driven attribution models are the only two options available for advertisers going forward. </em></p>
<p><strong>Single-touch attribution models </strong>only credit the first or last touchpoint before said conversion action. The two single-touch attribution models are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First click:</strong> The first item that sparked the conversion gets full credit, regardless of other steps in between on the customer’s journey.</li>
</ul>

</article>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Last click: </strong>The last asset your user sees or clicks on before the conversion gets full credit, regardless of anything that happened prior to the action.</li>
</ul>

</article>
</div>
<p><strong>Multi-touch attribution models,</strong> on the other hand, give credit to multiple touchpoints. The multi-touch attribution models in Google Ads are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Linear</strong></li>
<li><strong>Time decay</strong></li>
<li><strong>Position based</strong></li>
<li><strong>Data-driven</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Benefits of multi-touch attribution</h3>
<p>In an omnichannel world, there are countless ways a customer could reach their conversion point. Multi-touch attribution uses the pre-set signals each model is built off of to properly weigh those touchpoints accordingly.</p>
<p>This particular type of attribution model allows you to assign real financial value to all your various marketing efforts. Unlike the single touch models within the marketing attribution umbrella, multi-touch attribution models take <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/24/ppc-performance">your PPC optimization</a> a step further by <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/07/ppc-reporting">reporting on performance</a> across the customer journey—not on just one asset at the beginning or end.</p>
<p>But multi-touch attribution is not as common as you might think. Take a look at the survey below:</p>

<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.adroll.com/blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>Despite the known fact that the customer journey has so many touchpoints, only 34% of advertisers are using multi-touch as their primary attribution model. In fact, 58% don&#8217;t venture away from single-touch! Read on to learn why you may want to use multi-touch attribution in your PPC campaigns.</p>
<h2>How to measure multi-touch attribution</h2>
<p>You can view your multi-channel attribution data using the Google Analytics <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/08/25/google-analytics-multi-channel-funnels">Multi-Channel Funnels tab</a>.</p>
<p>With the <strong>Assisted Conversions report</strong>, you can see the value of each channel by displaying the additional number of conversions outside of raw “last touch” conversions.</p>

<h2>Types of multi-touch attribution models (pros &amp; cons)</h2>
<p>As noted above, there are four types of <a href="https://www.invoca.com/blog/marketing-attribution-modeling-techniques">multi-touch attribution</a> models in Google Ads. Let’s take a deeper dive into each one:</p>
<h3>Linear attribution</h3>
<p>A linear attribution model distributes the credit for a conversion evenly across all interactions along a conversion path.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="97668dda-713f-472a-a4d2-df3e9f656e00" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/multi-touch-attribution-linear-model.png" width="472" height="306" alt="multi-touch attribution models: linear attribution model" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><strong>Pros: </strong>Linear attribution is straightforward—each asset holds the same amount of weight. So it’s a great way to start analyzing your marketing and advertising efforts using multi-touch attribution to optimize for the entire customer journey (not just one single activity).</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Remember the group project dilemma I mentioned at the beginning of this post? Linear attribution models can allow that same phenomenon to happen as all assets show they are contributing equally to your end goal (even if some really aren’t). In short, it can be hard to pinpoint what is or isn’t working.</p>
<h3>Time decay attribution</h3>
<p>A time decay attribution model gives more credit to any interactions that happened closer to the time of the conversion, based on a seven-day half-life. For example, an ad interaction eight days before a conversion gets half as much credit as an interaction that happened just one day prior to the conversion.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="14241251-b2ab-4c4c-8592-113b5650ba2e" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/multi-touch-attribution-time-decay.png" width="466" height="307" alt="multi-touch attribution: time decay model" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><strong>Pros: </strong>Time decay attribution models can be helpful if you have a short sales cycle, since you’ll have an idea of what pushed a customer to ultimately convert at the very end of their journey.</p>
<p><strong>Cons: </strong>If you have a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/01/26/sales-cycle">long or complex sales cycle</a>, certain assets that may have impacted a customer early on won’t receive the credit they might deserve.</p>
<h3>Position-based attribution</h3>
<p>Position-based attribution uses a 40-40-20 rule to credit interactions towards a conversion. This means it gives 40% of the credit to both the first and last interactions, and 20% to the rest of the interactions in between. Position-based attribution is often also referred to as a U-shaped model.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0e2a5d03-bdb8-40c9-985d-1d155494200a" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/multi-touch-attribution-position-based.png" width="470" height="305" alt="multi-touch attribution: position based model" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><strong>Pros: </strong>With position-based attribution, every touchpoint gets a piece of the pie while still optimizing for the (sometimes more important) first and last interactions.</p>
<p><strong>Cons: </strong>Low-value interactions could mistakenly receive too much credit depending on your customers’ journey. Think of it this way: does it make sense for my first touch <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/01/automated-email-marketing">email blast</a> to receive the same credit as my display ad that resulted in the conversion?</p>
<h3>Data-driven attribution</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/30/data-driven-attribution-default-update">Data-driven attribution</a> distributes credit for a conversion based on your account’s past data for said conversion action. It’s different from all other models because it uses your data to calculate the actual contribution of each interaction along the conversion path.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="33ce2a09-9866-47ae-9606-11ee5db99d46" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/multi-touch-attribution-data-driven.png" width="472" height="308" alt="multi-touch attribution: data-driven model" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><strong>Pros: </strong>Data-driven attribution can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/12/google-tag-manager">increase accuracy in your reporting</a> by using historical data to know truly how impactful each asset might be.</p>
<p><strong>Cons: </strong>If your account doesn’t have a ton of historical data for data-driven attribution to go off of, it can be difficult to efficiently weigh in each conversion’s touchpoints.</p>
<h2>Which multi-touch attribution model should I use?</h2>
<p>I think there is one thing we can all agree on when it comes to multi-touch attribution models: there are <strong>plenty</strong> of options to choose from!</p>
<p>If you’re struggling to know which choice is best for you, do a bit of research and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/11/09/5-question-quarterly-adwords-account-audit">take inventory of your current PPC campaigns</a> and your accounts’ specific needs.</p>
<p>There is, of course, no one-size-fits-all answer as to which multi-touch attribution model is best for you. So, aligning your goals with your multi-touch attribution model selection will help to clarify the perfect route for you and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-the-buyers-journey/">your customers’ journey</a>.</p>
<h2>How to set your attribution model</h2>
<p>Once you’ve decided on which attribution model to use, select the “Attribution model” setting when<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/24/google-ads-conversion-tracking"> implementing tracking for each conversion action</a>. This can be done with both website or Google Analytics conversion actions.</p>
<p>If you already have your conversion tracking set up and want to change what you’re currently using, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In your Google Ads account, click into the <strong>tools &amp; settings</strong> menu, then click <strong>conversions </strong>under the <strong>measurement</strong> section.</li>
<li><strong>Select </strong>the conversion action you want to edit.</li>
<li>Click <strong>edit settings</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>attribution model</strong>, then select from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>Hit <strong>save </strong>and <strong>done</strong>!</li>
</ol>
